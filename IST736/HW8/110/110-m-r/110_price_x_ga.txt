<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend and leader from California for yielding. 
   This do nothing, no energy Congress has perfected changing the rules to suit themselves. But this may take first prize. 
   Virtually all of us talk about the need for entitlement reform. Entitlement, that's those programs that comprise about 55 percent of the budget. I call it a ``yes'' moment at home. It's when the crowds say, Yes, yes, please. Some reform is needed. And the rules currently in place would allow for some real reform, especially in the area of lawsuit abuse reform, not cuts in Medicare. Not an increase in premiums. 
   As a physician for nearly 30 years, I understand clearly the need for liability reform, and it's imperative not just to decrease malpractice costs but to end the practice of defensive medicine estimated to be greater than $300 billion annually. That's $300 billion of savings without any Medicare cut, without any increase in premiums. 
   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake, this vote today is about fiscal responsibility and ending frivolous lawsuit abuse. Let's work together. Americans want action on this issue, and they want it now. This proposed rules change means no reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor a dear friend and a special American on the occasion of his 90th birthday. Worthy Coe Hamling was born on August 5, 1918, on the plains of South Dakota. Armed with nothing more than the dogged determination, rugged individualism, and an unbending family loyalty, forged by a birth attended only by his mother and God, Coe embodies the greatest qualities of America. 
   It was at Hamlin University in Minnesota where he met his loving wife of 66 years, Betty. His embrace of freedom, family, and the sanctity of every human being is balanced by his unyielding sense of responsibility and self-reliance. 
   Living in Roswell, Georgia, Coe proudly anchors a family of five children, ten grandchildren, and eight great grandchildren. 
   Madam Speaker, I know the entire House of Representatives joins me in extending a hearty, happy 90th birthday to Coe Hamling, an American treasure.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Texas and his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this remarkable rule, this martial-law rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you likely know, the new majority is becoming much more creative with their rule writing, and frankly it would be humorous if it weren't so serious. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, this new majority promised us a fair and an open process, but again the majority has failed to live up to that promise. Speaker Pelosi said, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voices silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' That's what she said before the election last year. Well, I agree with the Speaker, we ought to vote against this restrictive rule. 
   Chairman LOUISE SLAUGHTER of the Rules Committee said before, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and the thoughtfulness to debate all legislation under an open rule. An open process should be the norm and not the exception.'' Well, I agree, Mr. Speaker. Now, is that a broken promise, or is it political expediency? 
   Democrat Caucus Chairman RAHM EMANUEL said before the election, ``Let's have an up-or-down vote. Don't be scared. Don't hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it on the table, and let's have a vote.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, I agree. 
   Mr. Speaker, there were five amendments in total that were submitted to the Rules Committee last night. Two were made in order. What's the rush, Mr. Speaker? Which idea was so scary that the new majority decided to shut down debate? In the wake of a terrorist attack, as a result of this legislation, the liability of the American taxpayer is over $100 billion. So this legislation represents a dramatic increase in exposure to the taxpayer. And that may be appropriate. 
   I offered an amendment that would have allowed for appropriate PAYGO rules to make certain that we funded this bill. It went down by a partisan vote. My amendment would have protected the taxpayer dollars of hardworking Americans. There would be real offsets, a commonsense approach. If there is to be a taxpayer subsidy, as good stewards of the American hard-earned taxpayer dollars, we should provide the specific spending decrease to offset any new spending required by this legislation. Instead, Mr. Speaker, we get a budget gimmick that many of my friends and I believe is likely unconstitutional. 
   And that's not only the opinion of those on our side of the aisle. I have here a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer from the office of Congressman Ackerman, a respected Member on the other side, who said, ``It is our strong belief that making the entire program contingent on Congress passing a second piece of legislation completely undermines the intent and the desired effect of the legislation.'' Not only unconstitutional, Mr. Speaker, but irresponsible. 
   Well, welcome to the theater of the absurd. Only in Washington would someone believe that requiring an additional vote at some point in the future for Congress to be able to release funds, where PAYGO won't apply, that it would diminish the cost to the hard-earned American taxpayer, or even that it's possible to do so. 
   Mr. Speaker, rules aren't rules if you only follow them when you want to. The Democrats promised to use PAYGO rules for everything. Instead, they're picking and choosing when they do so. At home, we call that breaking a rule and breaking a promise. Fiscal responsibility shouldn't just be something that we trump out there during campaigns and on the campaign trail. 
   What idea, what amendment was so scary that it inspired this incredibly draconian and restrictive rule? I urge my colleagues not to be scared. Don't hide behind, as Mr. Emanuel said, some little rule. Vote ``no'' on this rule so we can have real PAYGO, real fiscal responsibility on this legislation. The American people deserve no less.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and the ranking member, my good friend from California for yielding and for your leadership on this issue and on so many others that come to our House. 
   You mentioned, and folks have mentioned, that we have been victimized. Well, Mr. Speaker, we haven't been victimized; the American people have been victimized. Because we were promised, we in the House of Representatives were promised, but the American people were promised, an open process. They were promised a fair process. And, as you mentioned, the stories are too numerous to stipulate each individually. 
   But the story that I bring is one of the flood insurance bill, the Flood Insurance Reform and Modernization Act that came just last week. We had an amendment that we were essentially assured would be made in order through the assurances of the Chair of that committee, that we would have an open and deliberative process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of GEORGIA. You are absolutely right. The amendment was within the purview at that point of the Rules Committee. They had notice. 
   Now, again, it is not that we were denied the amendment. It is that the American people were denied the opportunity to have a substantive amendment debated on the floor of the House. In fact, Mr. Speaker, I believe that the President is going to veto that piece of legislation, and I believe he is going to do so because our amendment was not allowed to be acted upon by the House, because he supported the amendment that we would have offered, which was a very substantive amendment, a significant change in the flood insurance reform bill.     
   As my friend from California mentioned, there were 13 amendments made in order to that bill, 13 Democrat amendments, no Republican amendments. I suggest, Mr. Speaker, that is all politics, that is all politics. Again, it doesn't harm us personally. What it does is disenfranchise nearly half of the American people, and that is why this matters. What it means is that nearly half of this body is not given the opportunity and the right that they were given in winning their election. 
   We all represent essentially the same number of people. When the majority does not allow a certain Member or Members to offer amendments or to offer their best ideas, what they do is disenfranchise nearly half of the American people. 
   I can only think of three reasons why that would be done. One, it is a broken promise. We have seen the promises. Two, it is for political expediency. Or, three, it is what de Tocqueville called the tyranny of the majority. That is what I believe we have, a tyranny of the majority that is running this House right now. It doesn't hurt me personally, but it hurts the institution, it hurts our democracy, and it disenfranchises nearly half of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend from West Virginia for her leadership on this and for cogently bringing the debate forward and stating why this is the wrong bill at the wrong time. 
   I am pleased to hear from my friend, though, from Minnesota who said that this was going to save America money. If we keep saving money at this rate, our deficit ought to disappear in short order, $15 billion chunks going out the door. I'm not sure how that math adds up, but I'm certain that it works somewhere. 
   I want to commend my friend from Illinois for raising the point, as I know that the chairwoman acknowledged, and that is that there was no bidding process. There is really no accountability in this bill. Yes, there are plans that have to be proposed and submitted, but there's no oversight, there is no oversight of this money. Fifteen billion dollars could go to anybody, truly, who was a friend or a crony of any official in a State or a city. And we're going to trust the cities, as the chairman said, it was important that we trusted the cities. And I believe primarily that that is important that we do trust cities. If we trusted cities so much, though, then why would we not adopt an amendment that I proposed in committee that said that we ought to let the city do with the property what they deemed appropriate? But we haven't done that. We said oh, no, even if this facility, this housing facility is public housing and is absolutely dilapidated, you couldn't demolish it. Oh, no, we wouldn't want that to happen. We wouldn't want the city to make a decision that they could do something better with that property. In fact, this bill precludes that opportunity. 
   I heard the chairwoman say that she wouldn't want to add an amendment that would provide for that accountability or that oversight because it might bog down getting the money to the cities. Well, Madam Chairman, I'll tell you what will bog down getting money to the cities, if people were really sincerely interested in that, and that's a veto. And this bill will be vetoed by the President of the United States for appropriate reasons because it is irresponsible and it is not appropriate to spend the kind of money that we're talking about without any oversight and without any accountability. Remember, $15 billion. 
   I am constantly surprised, truly, by my friends on the other side of the aisle who don't seem to remember where this money comes from. Where does this money come from? It comes from hardworking Americans. And I would suggest, Madam Chairman, as my friend from Texas said, that hardworking Americans have a significant challenge right now in some aspects of their life, trying to make certain that they can afford the increase in gas prices under this majority, for the increasing prices for commodities under this majority. And so it would be appropriate that we remember that, and that we allow more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   Now what is the solution? Well, I would suggest, Madam Chairman, that a couple of programs that are in place right now and are working diligently to make certain that people can stay in their homes, FHA Secure is a program that is administered by the Federal Housing Authority that provides greater flexibility for refinancing homes for hundreds of thousands of Americans. The Hope Now Alliance was a program that was put into place, a private sector cooperative effort that actually makes it so that struggling homeowners can get the kind of counseling and guidance to assist them to refinance their mortgages. More than 1.4 million Americans, Madam Chairman, have been shown the opportunity to be able to stay in their home. 
   These are positive and productive programs that make it so that individuals can stay in their home. They aren't a bailout that is being proposed by the other side. They aren't taking $15 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money and saying, ``It's okay. We'll cover it. Don't worry about that. The American people's pocketbook is absolutely endless.'' 
   This is a bad bill, wrong bill, wrong time. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the American people are fair people. And they expect their representatives to remain cognizant of and reflect that fairness in all actions. 
   This House has moved from fairness, from deliberation and from proper recognition that would allow all Members the opportunity to actively represent their constituents to repeated tyranny of the Majority. Madam Speaker, there is a crisis of leadership by this majority. 
   Every person in America has the right to have his or her voice heard. No Member of Congress should be silenced on the floor guaranteeing that the voices of the people are heard. 
   Do you recognize those words, Madam Speaker? You should, for they are yours. And they're being violated. 
   The minority possesses their equal rights, which equal law must protect and to violate would be oppression. Recognize those words, Madam Speaker? You should. They were spoken by Thomas Jefferson and quoted by you and they are being violated. Why? It's either political expediency or a broken promise, one or the other, neither of which the American people support because they are a fair people. 
   Madam Speaker, I submitted four thoughtful, substantive amendments which deserve the consideration of all 435 Members of this house. But they were denied that opportunity by this restrictive and unfair process. Madam Speaker, the American people understand that the rules aren't rules if you follow them only when you want to. Democrats promise to use fair and open rules for everything, but they're breaking rules and they're breaking promises to the American people. 
   I urge the Speaker and the majority to be true to their word. Stop playing politics. Stop breaking promises. Allow the Members of this House to represent their constituents. What idea, what amendment is so scary that it couldn't be considered on this floor? I call on  my colleagues not to destroy the very fiber of our representative democracy.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, have you seen the news? Democrat inaction on the alternative minimum tax is leading to a delay of tax refunds for millions of hardworking Americans. The carelessness of this new majority is poised again to strike the American people, this time in their wallet. 
   This AMT problem's been known for months. Yet we still have no action in this Congress. 
   The average tax refund last year was more than $2,000, $2,000, Mr. Speaker. That's a mortgage payment. That's college tuition. That's a holiday credit card bill. 
   While the new majority has made clear that, in good faith, they support policies to raise taxes, this expensive predicament with the AMT is simply the result of congressional negligence. Now, the American people expect more than this from Congress. They want less partisanship and more leadership. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's act now to ensure the American people are not forced to pick up the tab for the carelessness of this majority. Let's put politics aside and put hardworking taxpayers first.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, here we are, Thursday afternoon, 3:58 p.m. All across the Nation, the day shift is ending, or about to end. Folks getting ready for the afternoon shift. Other folks that work the night shift are either just waking up or just going to sleep to get prepared for another day, another day of work. 
   Where is the House? The House has gone home, Thursday afternoon, and the House has gone home, not to return until next Tuesday. What didn't we do this week, like we didn't do last week, and the week before, and the week before, we didn't address the number one issue on the minds of Americans and hurting the American pocketbook, and that's the issue of gas prices, didn't address it, nothing.     
   Now, the majority will tell you that they brought to the floor a drill bill. What they brought to the floor today, Mr. Speaker, cynically, was what they called a drill bill. In fact, it was really just a ``no energy'' energy bill. 
   Why do I say that? Well, the bill had eight sections. Six sections are either current law or are clerical. Current law: No new energy. One of the sections mandated project labor agreements that would increase the construction costs of Alaskan pipelines by as much as 30 percent. Increasing costs: No new energy. The final section would increase the bureaucracy and the red tape for any new energy production. It didn't open any exploration onshore. It  didn't open any exploration offshore. Increasing costs: No new energy. 
   Now, what is the solution? Well, the solution is what the American people know, and that is that it's a broad array of items. It's conservation. Americans are doing an incredible job of trying to conserve. We're using less energy than we did last year. Conservation is the key, and we can all do more. It's finding alternative fuel, that fuel that will allow the 21st century to be an American energy 21st century. That will take a little while. 
   So, in the near term, in the short term, what's the solution? Mr. Speaker, you know what it is. It's what your constituents tell you about. It's increasing supply. It is increasing the supply of energy, American energy for Americans. How do you do that? America has incredible resources. 
   Onshore resources: We ought to be doing more exploration. We're only using 6 percent of the eligible land to be leased to find American energy for Americans onshore. 
   Offshore: Deep-sea exploration. The vast majority of Americans support environmentally sensitive and sound deep-sea exploration. We ought to be doing that. Only 3 percent of the available territory is being utilized currently. 
   Utilizing clean coal technology: We now have technology available that allows us to use coal of which America is, remarkably, the world's greatest repository of coal in the world, and we ought to be using that for clean coal technology. 
   Oil shale, which exists in our western area: There are more than 2 trillion barrels of oil that could be extracted from oil shale in environmentally sensitive and sound ways. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, we're doing none of that. Now, it's not because there isn't legislation for it. In fact, we have bills right here at the desk: H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act; H.R. 2279, the Expand American Refining Capacity Act; H.R. 5656, to Repeal the Ban on Acquiring Alternative Fuels; H.R. 2208, the Coal Liquid Fuel Act. All sorts of bills exist. They exist, but we aren't allowed a vote. 
   As you know, the majority party, the Democrat leadership, beholden to leftist individuals, will not allow a vote on the floor of the House. All we're asking is for a vote. We're not asking for a guaranteed outcome, just a vote. Give us a vote, Mr. Speaker. Why not? What are you afraid of? Why not have a vote? Why not respond to the demand of the American people and increase American energy for Americans? Bring down gas prices. We demand a vote. We hope that next week we'll see it.

Not deterred by the challenge of their tasks, the organizers of the Special Olympics programs have performed phenomenally and made a serious impact in countless lives. 
   Ironically, their extraordinary results are likely due to their focus on the games, and not the winners. This is apparent from their oath, ``Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me brave in the attempt,'' a message from which we can all learn.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairwoman, here we are back to Orwellian democracy. We are here considering the Employee Free Choice Act, which better is described as the ``Employee Intimidation Act,'' and we are here because it is the number one legislative priority of organized labor, and for Democrats it is the cost of doing business to gain the majority. Big Labor has given their marching orders and Democrats are executing them to a tee. 
   The ``Employee Intimidation Act'' is incompatible with the interests of workers, individual liberty, and the principles of sound democracy. If this legislation passes, then Congress will effectively be stripping away the protection of secret ballot elections. 
   Employers and union organizers alike shouldn't fear elections conducted by secret ballot. It is the only manner to protect an individual's choice without subtle or overt coercion. Secret ballots are the cornerstone of democracy. 
   This card check process is not only biased and inferior; it is also rife with coercion and abuse. In fact, card checks have been challenged on the basis of coercion, forgery, fraud, and peer pressure. Testimony before our committee only three weeks ago revealed the practices union organizers undertake to manipulate the card check system and get employees to sign at any cost, including home visits and workplace intimidation, and granted, yes, intimidation that can occur on both sides, from the employer or from the union. 
   The intent of this Employee Intimidation Act is to reverse the decline of union membership. Only 12 percent of workers belong to labor unions, down from 20 percent in 1983. But secret ballot elections remain the most effective way to determine the true wishes of the majority of employees at a work site. In fact, Federal courts have ruled that the secret ballot elections are the most foolproof method to determine support. Signing an authorization card in public before employers and the union and fellow employees is often done to avoid offending anyone or getting organizers off one's back. It is not a true gauge of union support, and I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 800, the Employee Intimidation Act.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, the previous speaker said this is only the beginning. That is our concern, and that is the concern of the American worker. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have said that people can get fired when they show an interest in either signing up or supporting a union. Well, it is curious. In our committee we heard from Ernest Bennett, who is the director of organizing For UNITE, a union, who told a room full of organizers, while he was organizing this union, during a training meeting for the Cintas union, that if three workers weren't fired by the end of the first week of organizing, that UNITE wouldn't win the campaign. Madam Chairman, facts are tricky things. 
   So when did the rights of American workers become so dispensable? When did allowing Americans to decide in private how they would make decisions that affect their life become expendable? A party that claims to be a voice for American workers is going to silence them in one quick vote. It is shameful and it is saddening. And it is even more disturbing that some of our friends on the other side of the aisle feel that Mexican workers deserve more rights than workers here in America.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this issue and in this House. Illegal immigration is as important an issue as any other major policy concern to my constituents, and I know to all Americans. 
   Across the country, there is overwhelming support for immigration reform, and this is due to the general sense that Federal policies have not succeeded and illegal immigration has become a crisis. With an estimated 12 to 20 million illegal aliens living here, Americans realize that the presence of so many is undermining the rule of law and undercutting the economic security of hardworking Americans. 
   No one wants to be denied economic opportunity for freedom, especially if it is being determined by those who are not lawfully in the United States. This motion to recommit is an opportunity to address the concerns of legal American workers which have not been raised from across the aisle. 
   This recommittal would simply require a union to demonstrate that any authorization card presented for recognition be signed by a United States citizen or a legal alien. Under current law, any worker, whether in the United States legally or not, can sign an authorization card. I repeat, under current law, whether in the United States legally or not, any worker can sign an authorization card and have it counted toward the threshold for union recognition. 
   So far, Republicans have proven that this Employee Intimidation Act is incompatible with the interests of workers, individual liberty, and the principles of democracy. Moreover, the card check process has proven not only to be biased and inferior, but also ripe for coercion and abuse. 
   Even more incompatible with democracy and ripe for abuse would be to allow illegal aliens the right to approve workplace representation for all legal workers at a site. I can't imagine that anyone truly believes that illegal aliens should be able to weigh in and determine union recognition, compensation, and benefits for legal American workers. 
   This Nation is at a point where illegal immigration has become such a crisis that it is threatening national security. To get this crisis under control and reaffirm our security, it is not too much to ask that all parties, employers, unions and employees, do their part. Employers are already on the front lines of deterring illegal immigration and verifying employee status. 
   Asking that authorization cards be determined as ``valid'' and accompanied by documentation is just another step to get the matter under control and ensure only legal workers are  deciding on union recognition and workplace rules. 
   It is such a small step. Unions can fulfill the requirements by following the same process that employers follow and use the same universe of documents that employers use, and to do this would not only guarantee that illegal aliens are not determining the rules for legal American workers, but it would add another check to strengthen national security. 
   I urge passage of this motion to recommit.

I thank you, Congressman Westmoreland, for your leadership on this issue and that is really a great idea, and that is a petition that has a spot for every Member of the United States House of Representatives to sign that will say, ``I will vote to increase U.S. oil production to lower gas prices for Americans.'' 
   As you said, it doesn't get any more simple than that. It's just as straightforward as it could be. 
   I am sorry I couldn't join you at the beginning. I was listening in my office to our friend from Ohio who had some comments, that I thought it was important to set the record straight a little bit. I know my good friend from Indiana has done so, but I thought I would mention a couple of things. 
   It's true, we do need to work together. We do need to work together, Democrats and Republicans on behalf of the American people. But as my mama used to say, it takes two to tango, and it's tough to dance by yourselves when the folks who are setting the agenda and setting the bills that come to the floor of the House, that will allow the bills that come to the floor of the House, when they won't tango, when they aren't interested, apparently, in solving this problem when the American people are crying out for a solution. 
   My good friend, Mr. Ryan from Ohio, talked about the issue of the oil companies, domestic oil companies, American oil companies who are trying to bring as much product out of the ground as possible. At these prices, one would think that they would. He talks about the fact that only a quarter of the lands are being used that are currently being leased to the oil companies. 
   He says, well, why don't they use the other 75 percent? 
   Well, that reminds me of the question that Willy Loman got, you know, Willy Loman was a bank robber. And they asked him, Willy, why do you rob banks? He thought a little bit and said, because that's where the money is, the money is there. 
   These oil companies don't drill on the other 75 percent of that land, not because they don't want to, it's because there are tests, remarkably efficient tests, that allow the domestic oil producers to tell whether or not there is oil down there. If they do those tests and they find that there is not any oil down there, then should we expect them to waste money and drill in those areas?

   To underscore the point that my friend from Indiana made about Alaska, the proven reserves, the proven reserves that are there are more than twice as much as the oil reserves in all of Texas, more than twice as much as the oil reserves in all of Texas. That's where the oil is, that's why it's important to allow them to go there. 
   This would represent, the Alaska exploration, would represent a 50-percent increase in the total U.S. proven reserves. I would say that's a remarkable amount, incredible amount. You talk about something that would drive down the cost of gasoline, just the announcement that we would allow it to occur would drive down the price of oil across the world. 
   But I think it's extremely important.     
   We have a group called the Truth Squad that gets together to try to shed light on things because facts are stubborn things. Facts are stubborn things. Our motto is everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   When the American people look at the facts on this issue, they understand that we need to conserve more. Without a doubt. And they understand that we need to have a transition to alternative fuel, that we need to find that non-fossil fuel that will drive our economy and our Nation for centuries to come, hopefully. 
   But they also understand that it is foolish for a Nation that has incredible resources, like the United States, to let them just sit fallow and not take advantage of them and make it so that we are more reliant on foreign oil than ever before, and that we are buying oil from folks that frankly don't like us very much. They understand what this is about. 
   I believe that over the coming months as we see gas prices continue to increase, that they will pay more attention to what is going on in this room and in this building. And as they pay more attention, they will appreciate that there are a group of individuals who are interested in increasing supply. And then there are a group that have proven over and over and over that they are not interested in increasing supply. I hope as we work together, we will be able to increase those numbers of people who want to increase supply to more than 218 so we can move forward.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I think it is important that we discuss a little bit about Saudi Arabia and the issue that Senator Schumer brought up in the context of our President going to the Middle East. And the way my constituents saw it, why is our President going to the Middle East and begging for the production or for them to sell us more oil. That is just not befitting of what we ought to do for our Nation which has incredible reserves, incredible reserves. 
   And the facts will bear out what you said, and that is that the increase of oil that could come from Alaska is remarkable and would significantly lower the price. I am reminded of the Jay Leno line. Jay Leno said to his audience a couple of weeks ago, ``The Democrats say if we allow for drilling in Alaska, it will take 10 years before we see any gas.'' 
   He said, ``That's just what they said 10 years ago.'' So it hasn't changed. It's the same old excuse.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from Indiana for bringing up the issue of national security because energy security is national security. There is no doubt about it. People at home understand this better than the folks in this room, apparently, as a whole. Energy security is national security. 
   I would suggest that it is irresponsible of us, it is an abrogation of our duty and our oath not to fulfill the requirements that would allow for us to be self-sufficient in energy. And we can with the resources that we have. There is no doubt about it. 
   The dirty little secret is 30 years ago when we had the challenge, the oil crisis where we all waited in lines to fill our gas tanks, all of us at the time said, all of us said we will never be this reliant on foreign oil again. The dirty little secret is at that time we were about 25 percent relying on foreign oil. And now we buy over 60 percent of our oil, not from ourselves, not from domestic producers. So the dirty little secret is that we have gone a long way in the wrong direction. We can turn it around. We can move it in the right direction in an environmentally sensitive and sound way, in a technologically sound way that will not have the kind of catastrophes that many on the other side say are a certainty. 
   I am pleased that you brought up Hurricane Katrina in a little different light. During Katrina, the thousands of rigs in the gulf, not one of them had a leak from Hurricane Katrina. In fact, there is more seepage naturally of oil out of the ground every day into the Gulf of Mexico than occurred during Hurricane Katrina because of a problem with the technology, the equipment. 
   We have come so far in this Nation over the last 30 years in terms of technology and being able to do energy production, oil production, getting it out of the ground, in an environmentally sensitive and sound way. There is no reason, no reason not to move forward. 
   In fact, the issue of Alaska and whether or not we ought to explore there, President Carter knew that we ought to. As my friends know, he signed a bill that provided for the 1002 area. That was in 1980. It is not a wildlife or a refuge at all, it is an area that was specifically designated for future exploration for oil. And our friends on the other side of the aisle won't allow that to happen.

And so that's why your leadership on this is wonderful. 
   I'm reminded of the individual who said that every other nation on the face of this earth looks at their natural resources and views them as an economic asset. They view them as an economic asset, something that can help their nation. 
   The problem that we seem to have is that the majority leadership, at least, in this body, looks at our natural resources and views them as an environmental hazard, which doesn't make any sense. It certainly doesn't make any sense to the folks in my district, and I suspect it doesn't make any sense to the folks in your districts.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Absolutely. Let's get together. And I appreciate you bringing up some of the other ways to increase our domestic resources or utilization of our resources. Offshore drilling, offshore oil, deep sea exploration, 85 percent of the lower 48 States, Outer Continental Shelf, energy resources remain under lock and key by the Federal Government. You can't go there. 85 percent. 
   In fact, as I mentioned, the United States is the only nation that has shoreline in the world that doesn't allow for exploration offshore to the degree that would allow for utilizing those resources that are available.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That lets you know how much of the shoreline of the United States is in Alaska, because that's what bumps that number way up. 
   I want to make just one brief comment about the oil shale that we've got available to us in the United States because I was astounded when I learned these figures. And again, these are facts. This isn't my opinion. This is a fact. 
   The Department of Energy estimates that the United States is endowed with more than 2 trillion, 2 trillion, that's T-R, 2 trillion barrels of oil from oil shale if we were allowed to move forward with that clean technology, environmentally sound way, 2 trillion barrels. 
   To put this figure in perspective, the world has used 1 trillion barrels of oil since the first oil well was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859. So twice as much oil as the world has used in the past 150 years is available through environmentally sound technology, through the use of oil shale. To not take advantage of those resources is astounding to me.

   And I appreciate my friend from Indiana talking about the truckers, and if we were able to contact them and say, You ought to contact your Member of Congress because this petition is so simple, American energy solutions for lower gas. What could be more simple? And so you're talking about onshore oil, bringing more onshore oil on line, bringing deepwater oil on line, bringing new refineries on line. 
   One thing that I learned just recently is that on the north shore of Lake Erie, the north shore of Lake Erie is not the United States. It's Canada. Good friend, neighbor to the north. They've got--they are drilling on land and then under Lake Erie to get oil. Our good friends, the Canadians to the north. And what are they doing with that oil? They're selling it to us.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for pointing that out. 
   Now Hugo Chavez is the president of Venezuela, not the president of an American oil company, not the president of a friendly nation, he is the president of Venezuela, and that's what gets my constituents so outraged, and that is instead of taking advantage of the American resources that we have to make American energy, what is this leadership in the House doing? It is forcing us to continue to give millions upon millions upon millions of dollars to folks who don't like us. Incredible. 
   T. Boone Pickens is doing ads on television right now. He talks about a $700 billion transfer of wealth every year, $700 billion from the United States offshore. And much of it to folks that don't like us. And why? Mr. Speaker, why? Because the leadership, the Democrat leadership in the House of Representatives will not even allow a vote on the floor of the House to make it so that we can vote on whether or not we ought to utilize American energy for Americans. 
   And I know that people get frustrated by talking about the processes. They say you ought not talk about the process. But in this instance the process is policy. The process is policy. 
   Here we had a Speaker who came into the majority leadership 18, 19 months ago. And what did she say, she said this was going to be the most open, the most fair, the most equitable Congress in the history of the Nation. And what have we had? We have had the most closed Congress in the lifetime of us sitting here. 
   We talk about what are called open rules which allow amendments or debate on a specific bill when it comes to the floor. This has been the fewest number of open rules that anybody can remember. It is phenomenal, much more so than what we were criticized for when we had the majority 2 years ago. 
   But what that failure of process means, what that closure of the process means is that ideas aren't able to be brought to the floor, votes aren't able to be had on bills that the American people care about. And in this instance, it is the American people's pocketbook. It is their livelihood. It is jobs. It is on American energy for Americans that the Speaker of the House will not allow a vote on this floor. It is unconscionable. It is unconscionable. I don't know if most Americans appreciate this is going on. 
   We believe that the process of bringing American energy to Americans is complex. It takes into account all sorts of different opportunities that we have. Conservation, we all believe in conservation. We are all getting greener. 
   Alternative fuel, we believe we ought to incentivize the creation of alternative fuel and not make it so that 
   the government is picking the winner in the area of alternative fuel.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my colleague for yielding because the issue of oil shale is, I think, the untold story that is truly one of the secrets to making, allowing America to be energy self-sufficient or even energy-independent. 
   As you say, the vote was held here on the floor of the House to make it so that America couldn't use its resources. 
   Some of my friends are fond of saying that America, under this Democrat leadership, is the only nation on the face of the earth that views its natural resources as an environmental hazard instead of a national asset. It is truly phenomenal. 
   You mention that the oil shale resources that we have here, in the United States, in the lower 48, would possibly provide two trillion barrels of oil. 
   Now, we throw around big numbers here in Washington; we are fond of doing that. But what does that mean, two trillion barrels of oil? 
   It is not only more than the oil that is present in the Middle East. Mr. Speaker, it is more than twice as much as the entire earth has used in the last 150 years. It is more fossil fuel than the earth has used since it began, since man began using fossil fuel for energy. It is an absolute phenomenal amount of natural resource. And the thing that has made it accessible is that we now have technology that is available to utilize it and mine it in a way that is environmentally sensitive and environmentally sound. 
   But what does this leadership say? What does the Speaker say? Oh, no. Oh, no, we wouldn't want to do that because, as my friend from North Carolina says, we believe that we can actually repeal the law of supply and demand. 
   Well, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, what my friends and my constituents at home say. They want to be able to use American energy for Americans. So we have got to conserve. We have got to find that alternative fuel. But in the meantime, in the short-term, in the near term we simply must increase supply, onshore drilling, exploration, offshore deep sea exploration, utilizing oil shale, clean coal technology, making certain that we have enough refineries, more refineries to be able to refine the product that we have, all of those things go into the mix to making it so that America can be energy self-sufficient so that we can bring down that spike in the cost of gasoline at the pumps, and in the cost of home heating oil which is, although it is hot right now, it will be cool relatively soon. And our friends in the Northeast, who are so fond, apparently of this current Democrat majority, with this Speaker and this Democrat majority, they will find out what this leadership has brought them, and it has brought them incredibly skyrocketing prices in the area of home heating fuel. 
   So I hope that people are paying attention to that as they look at their newspapers and as they look at their ballots, Mr. Speaker, as they evaluate who they believe ought to be leading this Nation. 
   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I believe that the commonsense agenda is an agenda that embraces all technologies, embraces all technologies in a way to increase American supply of energy for Americans. We would hope that we would be able to do that in a bipartisan way. Our friends on the other side though, in terms of the leadership, haven't allowed that to happen. But we look forward to the day when we are able to lead and lead with both Republicans and Democrats to bring together, American energy for Americans and bring down the cost of gasoline for our constituents all across this land. 
   I want to commend once again my friend from Georgia for his leadership on this and so many issues. I look forward to being with you again.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the leadership's support in allowing me to bring this amendment forward. I also want to recognize former Congressman Joel Hefley. This has come to be known as the Hefley amendment. So I want to thank former Congressman Hefley for his leadership on fiscal responsibility issues in Congresses past. 
   There has been a lot of talk about money on this bill, Mr. Chairman, and this is the appropriate time, because it is appropriations time. Most of the programs that we have discussed are indeed worthy programs. But I think it is imperative that we always remember where this money comes from that we are appropriating, that we are spending. 
   The money isn't Washington's money. The money is the money of the hardworking American taxpayer, and we ought not ever lose sight of that. As such, we ought to bend over backwards to make certain we are being as responsible as possible in its expenditure. 
   The big picture on this bill is the Energy and Water appropriations. The big picture is that last year this government spent, Washington spent on these programs, $30.2 billion. That is with a ``B,'' Mr. Chairman. This year, the proposal is to spend $31.6 billion; $31.6 billion, an increase of 4.3 percent. 
   This amendment is very simple. It says simply that we ought to decrease that overall amount by 1 percent, in an effort to save one penny on the dollar, as families all across this Nation have to do when they are having some tight fiscal times. 
   It would be an increase of 3.3 percent over last year. I know there are those who would like it to be lower. I am one of those. But I think it is important that Congress ought to make a statement that we can indeed be fiscally responsible. This 3.3 percent increase, this amendment would provide for that, and would be a reduction of 1 percent over the amount in the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wish to thank a number of Members who have offered similar pieces of legislation or amendments, Congresswoman Blackburn, Congressman Campbell, Congressman Jordan, Congressman Feeney, Congresswoman Musgrave and Congressman Hensarling, for their leadership on these issues. 
   I think this a commonsense issue. It is a matter that I believe ought to garner great support in this Congress and demonstrate to all that we indeed have an interest in fiscal responsibility. So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to my good friend the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor), the chief deputy whip of this conference.

So nobody is talking about cutting anything. 
   That might be the problem here in Washington. This would be a 1 percent reduction on the remarkable amount of increased money that the majority party has brought with this bill.

   I appreciate again the comments of my good friend from Ohio, who previously talked about there being no tax increase in 2008, and he urged the American people to take a look at their tax bill. 
   He is right. There won't be, because of Washington shenanigans. Because what we do here is budget in a 5-year window, and in fact the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation will hit the American people, curiously, Mr. Chairman, after the next election. 
   But you can check the record. It is indeed there, and all the American people have to do is recognize that, and they will. And they will.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I think this has been a helpful debate. I want to recognize the efforts of Congressman Hefley in the past and urge my colleagues to support the former Hefley amendment of a 1-percent reduction in the increase, Mr.  Chairman. As I remind our colleagues, the portion appropriated for this area of Federal spending last year was $30.2 billion. This year the request in this bill is for $31.6 billion. This amendment would simply reduce it by 1 percent. It would be a 3.3-percent increase. It would be a symbolic decrease, but it would be a recognition that Washington needs to get its fiscal house in order. 
   My good friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the importance of reducing spending. But yet we see a significant increase over, as the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Terry) just said, significantly over what we brought last year. Yes, it would be a symbolic decrease, but it would ever so slightly reduce that slope, that increasing slope of Federal spending. I think that is indeed what the American people desire. 
   Spending in this bill, as in other appropriations bills that are coming before us, will be allocating money, Mr. Chairman, that the Congress doesn't have. The Congress doesn't have it, and it continues to spend more than it takes in. I think it is imperative that we harken back and remember that wonderful Reagan admonition that Washington spends too much, it is not that it doesn't gain enough revenue. There is certainly enough revenue to provide for appropriate services. 
   And I will be the first to tell my colleagues that there are wonderful programs within this bill. The question is whether or not we are going to demonstrate to the American people that we have the fiscal responsibility, the reasonable standards in terms of what ought to be spent at the Federal level based upon what has been spent in the past and the incredible hardworking American taxpayers who send their money year after year after year. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense 1-percent reduction.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the leadership for allowing me to come to the floor this evening and spend a few moments and talk about some of the activity that has gone on here in the House over the past couple of weeks. This is an edition of the Truth Squad that I am pleased to be able to host. 
   The Truth Squad is a group of individuals who endeavor to come to the floor of the House and try to shed a little light, a little truth, a little honesty on the matters that are discussed here on the House floor. It is my privilege to come to the floor of the House tonight and talk about the work that is being done here in the House right now and in Congress. 
   On the House side, we are in the appropriations process, the time when we determine as a Congress, as a House of Representatives, how to prioritize, how to spend hard earned American taxpayer money. It has been an interesting process, Madam Speaker, as you well know. 
   Last week we had a fascinating time that really brought light to one of our favorite quotes and that is this quote here from Senator Patrick Moynihan. 
   Senator Moynihan said that everyone's entitled to their own opinion but no one's entitled to their own facts. 
   And so last week we had one of the appropriations bills come to the floor of the House and the majority party had determined that they were intent upon making certain that earmarks, or special projects, were never seen by not just the American people during the process of the debate but by Members of Congress. The appropriations process was such that the majority party had determined that these special programs or special projects in individuals' districts, what have come to be known as earmarks, some people know them as pork, that these special projects would not be seen by Members of Congress until the very end of the process, until the conference committee occurred, and then they would be put into the bill. The reason that that is important is that there would be no way from a procedural standpoint or parliamentary standpoint, no way to be able to have a Member of this House of Representatives stand up and say, I think that we ought to have a separate vote on spending X amount of dollars for this project. And that's just wrong, Madam Speaker.  
   And so what we did on our side was to say, that's not what the American people want. That's not democracy. That's not what we're here for. That's not a process that gives honor to the House of Representatives. That's not a process that says that, yes, we are interested in being responsible with hard-earned American taxpayer money. So we spent a lot of time last week trying to make certain that that point was brought to the floor, that that point was brought to the American people. In so doing, we got some attention. We got some attention, because I think for a small moment that many people across this Nation appreciated that there were people fighting as hard as they could here in this Congress to make certain that there was some fiscal responsibility, that there were individuals who were doing their dead level best to make certain that if this Congress was going to spend as much money as the majority appears to desire to spend, if we were going to do that, that we were going to make certain that every dollar was held accountable. 
   We got a lot of individuals, a lot of newspapers, a lot of press across this Nation who agreed with us, who said, that's absolutely right. How on earth can you have a process that hides money, that hides money until the very last moment? That's not the way it ought to be done. I have here a number of pages, a number of editorials that were written all across this Nation agreeing with our perspective: Roll call, the Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, the Hill, the Washington Times, on and on and on, around the Nation far and wide, really remarkable, Chicago Tribune, papers all across this Nation agreed. 
   What they said was that they were proud of Republicans, proud of conservative Members finally standing up and saying, no, we're not going to have that kind of process here. 
   And so the majority party relented. They said, okay, we agree. We ought not do what we said we were going to do, we're going to work to make certain that those projects are transparent, that there is accountability, that individuals when they present and desire to have special projects in their district that they have their name attached to it, something we've been fighting for for a long time. It was proof that democracy works. It was proof that hard work and diligence and that when you fight in that way for the American people, for the American taxpayer, that yes, there are times when you can be victorious. I was proud to work with my colleagues in the Republican Conference and on the Republican side of the aisle and some of our friends on the other side who joined us and said that you've just got to change that. 
   It has been a curious situation here these past couple of weeks as the majority party has brought appropriations bills to the floor. I am reminded in this process as we bring up some of the remarkable irresponsible spending that continues to go on here in Washington, Madam Speaker, of some experience that I had back at the State level. I represent a district in Georgia on the northern side of Atlanta, the northern suburban Atlanta area. I served four terms in the State senate before coming to the House of Representatives. In that process, there were also individuals there who were interested in spending what many of us believed was too much of hardworking American taxpayer money, and so we came up with an award that we entitled the ``stuck pig award.'' I was reminded of it this week, because when we have pointed out the amount of spending, increased spending, irresponsible in many instances spending, on the part of the majority party, you hear them squawk and squeal. And so we came up with, at the State level, what we called the stuck pig award and we would award it to somebody who defended the most ridiculous kind of spending. It may be, Madam Speaker, that we need to come up with the same kind of award here in Washington, because there would certainly be a number of candidates for the stuck pig award. But maybe we'll leave that for another day. 
   I want to highlight a number of things that happened on the floor just today. Today we had, Madam Speaker, as you remember, the Energy and Water appropriations bill, a bill that is very important for our Nation, an area that sets priorities in terms of spending for our Nation and the amount of money that ought to be spent on projects all across this Nation that in many areas are needed desperately. Last year, Madam Speaker, in that area of appropriations, we spent, this Nation spent, $30.2 billion. The administration's request in the areas where they felt appropriate to fund for this year, for fiscal year 2008, was $30.4 billion, an increase of about 0.6 percent, under 1 percent and certainly under the rate of inflation, which is what we attempted to do when we were in the majority, was to keep these levels increasing at a rate less than inflation. Many of us believe that we ought to have actual decreases, but keeping it less than inflation is certainly a step in the right direction. 
   But what happened this year is that the majority party brought this bill to the floor, the appropriations bill for Energy and Water, at a rate of spending of $31.6 billion. That's a 4.3 percent increase, which is about three times the rate of increase that we had when we brought the bill to the floor last year. 
   Now, many of us believe that that's simply too much money, that that doesn't prioritize the Federal budget in the way that Americans across this Nation have to prioritize their family budget. And so we offered a number of amendments, which is really the only way that you can kind of get to who is interested in being fiscally responsible and who isn't. Because, Madam Speaker, as you know, people can stand up and give speeches about anything they want and they can say anything they want, but as Senator Moynihan said, everyone's entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. 
   We learned some facts today on the floor of the House, Madam Speaker, about who is interested truly in fiscal responsibility. A number of us offered amendments that would have resulted in some decrease in the amount of spending. These amendments covered various levels. One of the amendments offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) said that we ought to keep the spending in this area of the appropriations, in this area of our budgetary process, to exactly what it was last year, to have no actual percentage increase, which results in a functional decrease because of the rate of inflation, something that many people believe to be responsible at a time when the Federal Government spends more than it takes in, which the Federal Government currently does. So Mr. Campbell offered an amendment that said you ought to keep it at last year's level, which is about a $1.3 billion savings. 
   Mr. Jordan, the gentleman from Ohio, said that may be appropriate, but if our friends on the other side of the aisle or in this Chamber don't think that that's a little too much to save, then I'll offer an amendment that says we ought to keep it at the President's level, the 0.6 percent increase. What that would do would save about $1.1 billion. 
   I offered an amendment that said, well, there may be some people who believe that keeping it at last year's level is not an appropriate level, that keeping it at the level that the President and the administration requested is not an appropriate level, that, well, then maybe we just ought to decrease it or reduce it by 1 percent. Now, Madam Speaker, this isn't a 1 percent cut. This would be a 1 percent reduction in the increase. The increase is about 4.3 percent. This would be a 1 percent reduction, increasing it about 3.3 percent. So if you didn't believe that we ought to keep it at last year's number, if you didn't believe that we ought to put it at the number that the President requested, then you might believe that we ought to just reduce spending by 1 percent, decrease it by 1 percent in the reduction of the increase. And so we offered that amendment. 
   And then a final amendment, overall amendment, was offered by Mrs. Musgrave, the gentlelady from Colorado. She said, in essence, well, you may not believe that we ought to keep it at last year's amount, you may not believe that we ought to go to the President's amount, you may not believe that you ought to cut 1 percent, that may seem to be too much, but you ought to believe that you could cut a  half a percent. You ought to believe that you could cut a half a percent, so 50 cents out of every $100, that you ought to be able to cut that amount. 
   Those four amendments were offered on the floor of the House today. The fact is, Madam Speaker, that each and every one of those amendments failed, that the vast majority of the Members of the majority party, the Democrat Party, voted against those to carry the day. So that they believe that, no, you ought not keep the spending level, as a matter of fact, you ought not keep the spending level in this area of the budget to last year. You ought not save $1.3 billion. 
   And they voted that you ought not have the amount of spending be at the level that the administration, that the President requested. This is the executive branch, the branch that is responsible for carrying out the laws and the bills and the priorities that we pass here in Congress, you ought not keep it at that level. You aren't interested in saving $1.1 billion. Again, a fact. 
   They also said, as a matter of fact, Madam Speaker, that you don't want to cut it 1 percent. You don't want to have a reduction of 1 percent. Remember, a reduction in the increase. Not a reduction in real numbers but a reduction in the increase. None of these amendments would have reduced in real dollars. All of them were a percentage reduction in the increase. 
   The majority party, in fact as a majority said, no, we don't as a matter of fact want to reduce the increase by 1 percent. Also, as a matter of fact, Madam Speaker, they said that they didn't want to reduce it by one-half of 1 percent. They didn't want to realize savings that would result in a 50 cent savings out of every $100 spent by the Federal Government in the area of Energy and Water appropriations. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, I don't know about you, but when times are tight in our household, when times are tight in the household of my constituents, when times are tight in households all across this Nation, when American families have times when they are spending more or budgeting more than is coming in, what they do is they look at their budget, they look at their family budget and say, Where can we save some money? Sometimes they say, Well, we'll just cut everything a little bit. We'll spend a little less on everything. That's the similar story. That's the analogy to the family budget. 
   But what this Congress said, what this majority party said is that, no, we don't believe that we're not spending enough. In fact, we believe that we ought to spend more. We ought to spend more than the increase last year, we ought to spend more than was requested by the administration, we just ought to spend more. And so it rings on deaf ears, Madam Speaker, when the majority party says, and had said before the election in November, we will rein in Federal spending. 
   Well, this is a clear example, once again, of what I have dubbed Orwellian democracy, after George Orwell, the famous author, who famously in his books demonstrated that policies of governments oftentimes say one thing and do exactly the opposite.     
   That's what we find now in, I believe, this majority party, is that they say one thing and do exactly the opposite. So they say, with a straight face, that we are reining in government spending, that we are reining in Federal spending. 
   But, in fact, what's happening is a significant increase in Federal spending and an increase of greater than the amount that they railed against last year, which strikes me as being somewhat disingenuous and also misleading to the American people. The American people go to the polls every 2 years, and they vote based upon what people are going to tell them what they are going to do. I believe before that our side of the aisle had gotten a little wayward in terms of spending. So the message of reining in Federal spending fell on receptive ears. 
   The problem is that it hasn't been followed up by action. So it's a leadership that continues to say one thing and to do another, truly, truly remarkable. 
   Now, I want to talk a little bit about the issue of taxes and the tax increases that will be required to cover the amount of spending that the new majority has begun to march down a path to spend. The appropriations bill last week was an example of that, the appropriations bill today was an example of that, and most of them, as they come up through the 12 bills of the appropriations process will, indeed, demonstrate the lack of fiscal responsibility. 
   So what the other side is going to have to do is to find revenue. Instead of doing what our party did, and this President did, and President Reagan did, and, in fact, President Kennedy did in order to gain increased economic activity and in order to increase revenue to the Federal Government, those three individuals, President Bush, President Reagan and President Kennedy, all decreased taxes in a somewhat nonintuitive kind of activity, increased revenue to the Federal Government. 
   Because when you decrease taxes, what you do is you allow people to keep more of their money, you allow them to keep more of their money in their back pocket and in their pocketbook. Hence, they are able to decide for themselves when to save or when to spend or when to invest. When they spend, because they have more money, what results is increased economic activity. 
   Well, the current majority party demonstrates clear differences between a conservative Republican philosophy and a liberal Democrat philosophy. The difference is that we believe taxes ought to be reduced in order to increase economic activity. The other side clearly believes that the taxes ought to be increased, with the peculiar notion that if you just increase taxes enough, you will gain enough revenue to the Federal Government to equal the appetite for spending. 
   So they passed a budget, and their budget would increase taxes for every single American that pays taxes, every single American that pays taxes. The largest tax increase in the history of our Nation was passed by this majority just a few short months ago. 
   When you ask, well, what would that cover, what happens is that all of the tax, the appropriate tax reductions of earlier in this decade, 2001 and 2003, if the budget that was adopted by this majority is allowed to proceed over the next number of years, all of those tax reductions go away. All of the tax increases come back. 
   What happens on December 31, 2010, which isn't too far away, what happens is that the tax rates on ordinary income go from 35 percent overnight to 39.6 percent. The capital gains tax goes from 15 percent to 20 percent overnight. Dividends tax goes from 15 percent to 39.6, overnight. Estate tax, this is the death tax, this is what individuals, individuals' families, their estate has to pay when they die. It would be 0 percent on December 31, 2010, under the majority party's budget, and under the budget that they adopted. Again, this is the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation. It will jump to 55 percent overnight in 1 second. 
   Child tax credit, which would rest at $1,000 in 2010, would decrease in half. It would be cut in half, decrease child tax credits by 50 percent down to $500. The lowest tax bracket, those at the lower end of the economic spectrum who currently pay 10 percent would pay 15 percent, a significant increase in their taxes, nearly about half of what they would currently pay. 
   Now, it just doesn't make any sense to have that kind of tax policy in place when, in fact, what they have said before is that they would responsibly spend American hard-earned taxpayer money and be fiscally responsible. Instead, what they have done is gone back to a tried and true method of tax and spend. So everybody's taxes, nearly $400 billion, will shoot up virtually overnight. 
   Now, in their budgetary process, and that might be all right for some people, that whole tax increase and gaining, supposedly gaining new revenue for the Federal Government. Some people will say that's fine, if you are really solving problems, if you are truly solving problems, then it may be appropriate for us to do that. 
   As you well know, the largest problem that we have in our Nation from a fiscal standpoint is the issue of entitlement spending, automatic spending that occurs in our Federal Government programs, primarily three programs, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  
   This chart here outlines the percentage of the Federal budget that goes for those programs. These are the programs that are on automatic pilot. They just kind of continued to increase because of the demographics of our society, aging population. The monies for these programs continue to increase year after year unless there is particular reform. 
   So, in 1995, those three programs that are in this yellow portion of this pie chart here were about 48.7 percent of the Federal budget. In 2005, they measured 53 percent. They are a little over 54 percent now. In 2017, they will be 62.2 percent with no changes, and within another, oh, 10 to 15 years beyond that, they will consume the entire Federal budget, if the budget remains at its current level, which is its historic rate. 
   Now, many of my constituents might say if you are going to increase taxes like the majority party has done by adopting the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, nearly a $400 billion tax increase, if you are going to do that, that might be okay if you are going to solve real problems, if you are going to solve real problems. But the fact of the matter is that the budget didn't solve any of the problems, none, zero. 
   When we look at this graph, this graph is evidence of the absolute emptiness of the promise that the majority party had to reform entitlement spending, to reform automatic spending, mandatory spending. In our budget, in 1997, we had 125, $130 billion in appropriate reform and reductions. The Deficit Reduction Act, in 2005, had about $43 billion in appropriate reductions. 
   The budget just adopted for the coming years, by the new majority party, had zero, zero, no money at all for appropriate fiscal reform, responsible reform in the area of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. 
   Those programs are social compacts with the American people, but they are programs that left on their current course will not be able to survive. They will not be able to survive. So every day that we wait, the problems get greater, the solution gets more elusive for each of those programs. So it is imperative, it is imperative that we move forward. 
   I would challenge my friends on the other side of the aisle to join together with those of us who are interested in true fiscal responsibility and true entitlement reform, and let's get it done. Let's get it done on behalf of the American people, because, frankly, that's what they sent us here to Washington to do, to solve big problems. 
   This graph demonstrates that we are not solving big problems here. As I say, if you were going to increase significantly the amount of taxes that the American people are paying, then many of them may say, I think there is a better way to do it, as I mentioned. Because I think tax reductions increase revenue to a greater degree to the Federal Government. 
   But many people across this Nation might say, well, I am all right paying a little more taxes if we are solving real problems, but not if we're on a spending spree that appears to be what is occurring with this new majority. This graph demonstrates the commitment to entitlement reform, which apparently in this new majority is zero. So I urge my colleagues to rethink the process and the policies that they put in place that will result in no significant entitlement reform. 
   As they are looking, once again, at their budget and at their policies, I would urge them also to look back into history. The next graph demonstrates clearly what kind of economic policy does work. This graph could be a number of things that show, that demonstrate negative growth or negative activity in the economy to positive activity in the economy over the years of this decade. 
   This graph, as a matter of fact, is the graph about job creation. How many new jobs have been created in our Nation since the beginning of 2001? As you can see, what we have here for month after month after month after month, between 2001 and 2003, virtually negative job growth during that period of time, no new jobs, in fact, losing jobs in the economy. For every single quarter, with the exception of four during that 4-year period. 
   Something happened, miraculously, in the beginning of 2003, the early months of 2003, in this vertical line here that marks the beginning of moving toward quarter after quarter after quarter after quarter of increased job growth, over 7 million new jobs since the summer of 2003. 
   What happened at that time is, as you know, this is when the final appropriate tax reductions were adopted by the Republican majority with this administration and this Congress. What that has resulted in is remarkable increase in job growth across our Nation. Virtually every single State, virtually every single State has seen increase in job growth over that period of time, average job gain of 168,000 new jobs per month on average. 
   So one would think that if you were charged with coming up with economic policy for our Nation that you would look back and say, well, this looks to be a pretty good program here that has resulted in significant job growth. 
   As I said before, this could be economic development, you could see a significant decrease in unemployment. All sorts of things could go on these axis, and you would see positive activity during this same period of time. 
   So if you were charged with coming up with economic policy for our Nation, one would think that you would look at this and say what happened, what happened at that point that made the resulting number of quarters to the current time, made it so productive? How did we become so productive as a Nation compared to where we were earlier in this decade? 
   Well, as I said, what happened during that time was appropriate tax reductions, making it so that individuals paid less of their hard-earned taxpayer money, that they are allowed to keep more of their money so that they decide when they spend, or they save or they invest. It's those kinds of policies that have resulted in can significant economic growth and economic activity. 
   I would urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as they are working through their process, as they are trying to figure out how to make certain that we stay a global, world competitive economic engine, that what they ought to do is look into history. Just a few short years ago there was a policy that was adopted by this Congress that resulted in remarkable, remarkable economic activity. So that we have the most economically productive Nation in the world, the industrialized world. 
   We continue to perform month after month after month. One of the main reasons for that is, indeed, the decrease, the appropriate reductions in taxes all across the Nation so that anybody who has paid taxes pays fewer taxes, less taxes today from a percentage standpoint than they did prior to that early point in 2003. 
   That's what results in increasing economic activity. It's not something that is unique to these tax reductions in 2003. In fact, that's what we saw when President Reagan decreased taxes in the 1980s, decreased taxes for the American people. Many folks said, oh, you can't do that, you won't be able to fund the programs in the Federal Government. 
   But what happened is that, as happened here, it increased revenue to the Federal Government because you decreased taxes because you cut taxes and because you allow the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money.     
   And that's what results in increasing economic activity. And it hasn't only been on the Republican side of the aisle. Democrats, indeed, have shown this same kind of discipline in the past. When President Kennedy, in the early 1960s, in fact, cut taxes, decreased taxes, appropriate tax reductions for the American people, because he knew that if you decrease taxes to the American people, what happens is that they will determine for themselves responsibly when to save or to spend or invest and, in fact, that increases economic activity for our Nation. 
   It points out, Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental differences that I talked about between a conservative Republican philosophy and a liberal Democrat philosophy, and that is that we believe that the American people know best how to spend their money, not Washington. There are very few times when Washington knows better how to spend someone's money than themselves. And it just makes common  sense, because only an individual, only people know their priorities. 
   Now, there are certain things that we have to spend common money on, without a doubt, and we talked about one of those that we dealt with earlier today. But there's a responsible way to do it, and that responsible way to do it, Mr. Speaker, is to identify, clearly identify those programs that ought to be absolute priorities. 
   And I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that that is so many fewer programs than this Federal Government is currently undertaking. But the Democrat liberal majority has a mentality that tends to come from San Francisco, I guess, which means that you just ought to spend just as much as you can get. You just ought to spend as much as you can get. 
   And so I'm pleased to join with my colleagues and point out that the economic policies that have been successful in the past and will continue to be successful if they're adopted, are those policies that will result in more hard-earned taxpayer money being able to be kept by hard-earned American taxpayers. 
   I just want to highlight once more a chart that demonstrates exactly that. And that is that when you reduce taxes to the American people, when you reduce, appropriately, taxes so that the American people can keep more of their hard-earned money, which is what occurred here in the early part of 2003, tax revenues were going down and down and down, 3 straight years of decreases between 2000 and 2003, tax reductions occurred with the Tax Relief Act being passed, and then the revenues increased significantly so that greater revenues than ever seen by the Federal Government because of tax reductions. And that's the kind of responsible economic policy that we believe, that I believe, ought to be put in place and kept in place, so that you decrease the tax burden on the American people, you allow them to determine when they save or they spend or they invest their own money. And then what happens is that the economy flourishes because there's more money available to drive the economy, more jobs created, more economic activity, more independence, and more liberty, more liberty and more freedom, because when people are able to keep their own money, they're freer, they're freer to make decisions about how they indeed spend or save or invest their own money. 
   So we're talking some economic policy tonight, Mr. Speaker, and hopefully, we'll be able to encourage our friends on the other side of the aisle to adopt some of these commonsense reforms. 
   I'm pleased to be joined by my good friend from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) who's going to talk a little bit also about some economic activity that's been going on here in Washington, and I'm pleased to yield to my friend.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I appreciate his bringing that sign because it highlights the Orwellian nature of this majority. You say you have got folks who are members of the Blue Dog coalition and what they say is that they are opposed to increasing that number. But, Mr. Speaker, what happened earlier this year is that the 8 trillion plus dollars of debt that have increased over multiple administrations have been increased to over $9 trillion now. The debt ceiling was increased by the Democrat majority, along with the Blue Dogs, to over $9 trillion. By this majority. By this majority, Mr. Speaker. Something they said they would never do. But, in fact, that is exactly what they did do. And in so doing, they adopted the second largest debt increase in our history. 
   So it is important for the American people to be listening and watching. It is important for them to appreciate what happens when you decrease taxes, that Federal revenues increase. It is important for them to appreciate, as this chart demonstrates, what track we are on for spending with this new majority. 
   This green line here, Mr. Speaker, that is moving along demonstrates the significant increase in spending. And much of that is driven by the entitlements that we talked about earlier, the mandatory spending, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and demands reform. Demands reform. But that is not what has been enacted by this majority. The problem is that this majority is adopting policies in their current appropriations bills that will not decrease that line; it will increase. It will further increase that slope. And that is not the kind of leadership that America needs or deserves or desires or, Mr. Speaker, I believe, not the kind of leadership that they voted for in November. 
   One of the things that they did do in November was send us a good new Member on our side of the aisle, Mr. Lamborn, and I am pleased to see him join us this evening and I look forward to his comments on economic policy.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman's comments, Mr. Speaker. And I am so pleased that he brought that up because oftentimes when we have these discussions, you hear people never provide any solutions, and you have put a solution on the table that I think is very important. 
   As you mentioned, I have been here just 3 years. This is my third year in Congress. And I came from the State level, where you have to balance the budget, and the reason you have to balance the budget is because you can't print money. States can't print money and Washington can, and that may be the crux of the problem right there. But I recognized early on that all of the inertia, and we see it during this appropriations season, all of the inertia here in Washington is to spend money, to spend more money. There are very few institutional, if any institutional, parameters in place that force you to hold the line on spending, which is why a balanced budget amendment is so incredibly important. And it is one of the reasons that many of us have supported a taxpayer bill of rights at the Federal level. We certainly did at the State level. I know I did. I suspect you did as well at the State level. 
   But we believe and we have introduced legislation for a Federal taxpayer bill of rights because we believe taxpayers have a right to know that the Federal Government doesn't grow beyond their means; that they have a right to receive back every single dollar that they put into their retirement program, into the Social Security program. We believe that taxpayers have a right to a balanced budget amendment without raising taxes, which is one of the issues that you stated. And it is so important, and the reason it is important is because of the programs and the policies and the traditions, if you will, of Washington. And the American people understand this clearly. The traditions are to continue programs that are already in place and then add some more on. It is just the natural tendency, and that is simply not what the American people want or desire, I believe. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for his comment. 
   I am hopeful that the President will follow through on his admonition to Congress to toe the line on spending, and I am hopeful that he will indeed veto a bill that gets to his desk that has an increase in spending. 
   Remember, the amount that the administration requested is the amount that the departments believe is the appropriate level of spending to carry out the needs of the American people. 
   Now, it is perfectly appropriate I believe for Congress to reprioritize within that basket, to say we think we ought to be spending, as a Nation, more here as opposed to here. I am one of those who believe we ought to be spending less as a Nation; so I would hope we would reprioritize and say this program is a priority of the Federal Government and, in fact, this one is best done elsewhere, maybe even the private sector and consequently doesn't need to be funded. 
   But what will happen, I trust, is that the President will be good to his word and veto legislation that spends more than the departments asked for and then it comes back to the Congress in order to rewrite a bill that will provide and allow for the President to sign. And as I say, I am hopeful that that kind of fiscally responsible activity occurs as we move through this process. 
   And I am pleased to yield again to my friend.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's comments. And I will point out that our side of the aisle, when we had responsibility for these budgets over the past at least 2 years that I have been here, we kept the rate of increase in the discretionary programs to less than the rate of inflation. And that was something that I and many others here thought was important. 
   I think it is important to put on the table solutions because the American people want solutions. They want us to work together in a positive way and provide solutions. And the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is indeed a program of solutions, making certain that we don't grow beyond our means, that the Federal Government budget doesn't grow faster than the rate of inflation and the increase in population. Perfectly appropriate. Making certain that the Social Security Trust Fund money is spent on Social Security. 
   We heard a lot about that from our friends before the election, that that is exactly what they would do. In fact, they have had an opportunity to put that in place and have not done so. 
   A balanced budget amendment without raising taxes, it is clearly possible from historical precedent and from economic policy that has been written before that it is easily done to balance this budget without raising taxes. You will hear our friends on the other side say, no, you have got to raise taxes in order to balance the budget. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for asking it because it is one of the things that resulted in a 12-year history in this Congress of no increase in taxes. And one of the reasons for that was we required in our rules a super majority to raise taxes. And you are absolutely correct. On that first day there were a lot of rules that changed that determined how the House works. One of the rules that was changed said, no, you don't need a super majority; all you need is a simple majority, which, as you know and as the American people know, means that the majority party can do anything they want in terms of taxes, which was how they were able to pass a budget that includes the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, nearly $400 billion in the future. 
   So I appreciate my good friend's comments and would yield to him if he has another question or comment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from Colorado for coming down this evening and sharing his comments and his perspective. It's similar to mine. And the disappointment is shared as well because the American people did expect more. And I think that the numbers that we've seen, Mr. Speaker, and the polls that are out now that demonstrate the impression of the American people of Congress is at its lowest point in decades, that that's reflective of the disappointment that they have in this new majority. So I appreciate your comments. 
   I do just want to end, Mr. Speaker, by highlighting once again what we believe the solutions are. And there are solutions, and they're positive solutions. And they are solutions that we can embrace together, Republicans and Democrats, who truly desire to be fiscally responsible. And they are incorporated in the Taxpayer Bill of Rights at the Federal level. Again, it means that the Federal Government ought not grow faster than the rate of inflation and the increase in population; that every single dollar that goes into the Social Security trust fund ought to be spent on Social Security; that that money ought to be preserved for individuals who send that money to the Federal Government; that a balanced budget occurs without raising taxes. It's very doable. We have demonstrated it time and time again, that you increase revenue to the Federal Government when you decrease taxes. So, a balanced budget amendment without raising taxes. 
   And fundamental and fair tax reform. Our tax system is woefully flawed, and it is a system that is crying out for reform, crying out for repair. It's unfair for people all across the spectrum, and demands, indeed demands, fundamental reform. 
   And finally, a supermajority required for any tax increase, as my friend from Colorado highlighted. We had no tax increase over the 12 years when my party was in charge. And one of the reasons for that was that it required a supermajority to pass a tax increase. And that just makes common sense. If you are going to take more of the hard-earned American taxpayer money, then you ought to do it with significant majorities. Thomas Jefferson, I believe, said that ``You ought not make major changes with minor majorities.'' It's something that I think this majority ought to adhere to. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just close by saying that we live in a wonderful and glorious Nation, a Nation that allows us to be elected and to come and represent the finest people on the face of the Earth. I challenge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to endeavor to do that in a way that's responsible, that respects the hard work that they do day in and day out, that respects the importance in the correlation between liberty and freedom, and allowing the American people to keep more of their money. When they're able to keep more money, they're more free, they have greater independence and greater liberty. And by so doing, we adhere to fundamental principles that are uniquely American. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today the new majority sadly declares politics more important than health care for our Nation's poorest children. Democrats are moving forward with a massive expansion of Washington-run health care under the auspices of helping kids. Yet, any honest discussion about this bill reveals that it is clearly less about helping children and more about Washington control. You see, they think they can make better decisions than you. 
   Remarkably, this expansion of bureaucratic health care offers taxpayer-funded coverage to people who are neither poor nor children. Democrats have made it clear that this bill is just the next step in their desired march toward Washington control of health care. And as a physician, I have seen how dangerous government control of health care can be. 
   Rather than forcing bureaucratic-controlled health care upon the American people, I urge my colleagues to reject this proposal and reauthorize SCHIP in a way that is consistent with its original bipartisan intent: helping America's poorest children.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. It really is a privilege for me to come to the floor tonight and work with you, Mr. Kirk, for a few moments and to explain to our colleagues here in the House and to the Speaker about the suburban agenda, a very important area. I appreciate your leadership in this area. You have been steadfast in making certain that these issues, and they may not be top-tier issues, they may not be headlines in all of our newspapers, but your district, like my district, I have a suburban district outside of Atlanta, and folks there are concerned about what folks all across this Nation are concerned about.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That really is true. When I talk with groups at home, and once we get past the hot button, the headline issues of Iraq and immigration and the like, people are concerned about education for their kids and they are concerned about health care for themselves and their parents. They are concerned about security and quality of life issues in their community to make certain that there is going to be green space and there are places where can take their kids. 
   I was sitting in my office and I had to come down and join you. These are not Republican issues or Democrat issues, these are American issues.     
   They're issues that I think all of the House can rally around. And you mentioned the health care issue, and as a physician, I understand as well as anybody I suspect about the importance of being able to provide health insurance for families. 
   We live in a world now where jobs aren't constant. It used to be that your dad and my dad and other folks, they'd get a job and they'd be with that same company 25, 30, 35 years, and they'd get a gold watch and they'd move on and they'd take that health care with them. Now, that's not the case. Our children will have 7, 8, 9, 10 different jobs, 10 different employers and oftentimes having themselves as being self-employed.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Exactly. And that hits the nail right on the head. People want to know that their health care is going to be consistent and they have the ability, along with their physicians, to make health care decisions, which is why the Health Insurance Portability Act that Congressman Dent is reintroducing is so important. 
   It makes it so, as I understand, that if an individual changes jobs, that they're able to provide that COBRA insurance for as long as needed. So it makes it so they can continue that COBRA insurance for a much longer period of time, to tide them over until they're with another employer or they can be able to provide for individual insurance on their own. 
   It's not the be-all-and-end-all, but it is a particularly important piece of the puzzle that makes it so that people can maintain their own health insurance, and I know that you agree with that.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Exactly, and that gets to the number of uninsured that we have in this Nation. There are 45, 46, 47 million individuals who at some point during this calendar year will be without health insurance. Those aren't the folks that are on Medicaid. Those aren't the folks that are on Medicare. Those are the folks that are between jobs oftentimes, who are unable to continue the COBRA insurance that they ought to be able to, and this is what this bill would do. It would really, really solve one of the major problems that we have with working Americans who do indeed want to provide health insurance for families. 
   So I commend you for your leadership on this issue and so many others. 
   The Senior Safety Indignity Act is extremely important. I served in the State legislature, as I know many folks in this chamber did, and every single year we would hear horror stories about problems of health care workers in the nursing home or extended care facility arena. 
   And in Georgia what we tried to do was a similar kind of thing to make certain that background checks were available, and this would provide that kind of security and that kind of important information for individuals in the senior centers so that we know that the folks who were going to be assisting seniors and caring for seniors have the appropriate skills and the appropriate background in order to do that.

Almost the majority of those are naming a building or naming a post office or renaming a building or renaming a post office. 
   And these issues here, if you look down the list of those seven issues, from the gang elimination to teacher and student safety, to other education issues with 401 Kids Family Savings Act or the Health Insurance Act that we talked about, the Deleting Online Predators Act, open space, Senior Safety Act, these are the issues that are of vital importance to the American people all across this Nation.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. And you're right. The incident at Virginia Tech was so astounding and so horrific for all of us to witness, and our hearts and our prayers still go out to those families. 
   But I understand, as I know you do, that there were individuals who were reticent to bring that out into the open before it happened, bring that individual who apparently committed that awful, awful tragedy out into the open for fear of potential liability. 
   That's no way for a Nation to live. That's no way for a responsible people to have to operate, to have to think in the back of their mind, well, can I do what's right or do I have to worry about an attorney, do I have to worry about a lawsuit. 
   This is the kind of legislation that we, as a Congress, if we adopted these seven items, I suspect that the American people would say this is a Congress that has acted appropriately, and we would all be able to stand proud and with that poster and present it to our constituents and say this is a responsible agenda for the American people. 
   My concern right now over the next three weeks, as you well know, we're entering appropriations time. It is very likely that none of these things, none of them, will be even brought to the floor during this period of time and that we'll get bound up in the process of spending hard-earned taxpayer money, trying to be responsible in that endeavor. But these issues that are supported by 60, 70, 80 percent of the American people, we ought to be able to take those off the table right away.

It's not that the Internet is bad, it's just that this is a different world, and the Internet is now like Main Street of 20 or 30 years ago, where you would have to be wary of strangers, and our parents told us about strangers on Main Street and how to deal with them. It's much more difficult when those strangers are able to come literally into your own home and entice young people who may not have their guard up as much. 
   We have story after story, time after time you will hear law enforcement officers talk about the challenges that they have in even getting young people to admit that, in fact, they have been susceptible or been approached by this kind of behavior. But it is rampant out there. It's absolutely rampant. There is not any reason that we ought not to be able to pass some commonsense legislation like the Deleting Online Predators Act like you have introduced in this House of Representatives, which is something that ought to be supported by 70, 80, 90 percent of our colleagues here, something that ought to go, frankly, in front of the appropriations battles we are about to wage over the next 3 to 6 weeks as we work as diligently as we can to responsibly spend hard-earned taxpayer money.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Not only fallen short, but I would suggest to my good friend from Illinois that the majority party has seemed to raise hiding and decreasing transparency and accountability in a very important area to a huge degree, and that is the area of earmarks, the area of special projects, pork projects, special projects for Members. 
   What we have just learned in the past week or so is that the Appropriations chair has said well, we won't be debating any of these earmarks, these special projects on the floor of the House. We won't be debating them. What we will do is parachute them in, air drop them in a conference committee so that there can be no light, no sunshine on these earmarks. 
   That's the kind of priority that concerns me about this majority party, that they have a priority for decreasing transparency and decreasing accountability for spending, but they also, by the same token, will not address the concerns of the vast majority of Americans all across our Nation. 
   In the area of security, in the area of education, in the area of health care, in the area of senior security, in the area of green space in our communities, a wonderful, positive agenda that we have put before this Congress and, in fact, it's getting no visibility here on floor of the House.

It's something that's near and dear to our hearts in Georgia. As you may recall, Senator Paul Coverdale, the late Paul Coverdale, served in the United States Senate. One of his goals was to make certain that there was an ability by all families to be able to afford a college education for their children. He fought as hard as he could during his tenure in the United States Senate to make certain that happened. 
   This is an extension of that. This is a wonderful, would provide a wonderful opportunity for families to put aside a little money in a tax-free mechanism to be able to cover college education for their children.

This would transfer that, and those kids then do extremely well, so much better than their peers in other classes who haven't been given that assurance. 
   This is the kind of program that would give that assurance to every young child all across this Nation, to allow their parents to be able to put aside a little bit of money, a little resources over the lifetime of their child so that they can then afford the college education and open the dreams for each and every child.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I want to thank my friend from Texas for his leadership on the Rules Committee and on this issue of wanting and demanding what the American people want, and that is an open process. 
   I oppose this rule because I believe, Madam Speaker, that it stifles the ability for Members of this House to represent their constituents. The reason that it stifles them is because it doesn't allow for the kind of debate and the kind of voting on issues that we've just heard about. 
   This is a good bill. I want to commend my classmate, Representative Wasserman Schultz, and Representative Wamp for their work; but it's not a perfect bill. And so we ought to move in the direction of making it a more perfect bill by allowing amendments, other ideas from this House to come forward. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm sorry to say that this is just another example of what I have come to know and phrase as ``Orwellian democracy'' by this new majority. It's Orwellian democracy because they say one thing and they do exactly the opposite. 
   What did they say? Well, what they said is that they would assure a fair and open process. Before the last election, Speaker Pelosi said, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voice is silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' 
   So what's different now, Madam Speaker? Is it political expediency, or is it a broken promise? 
   The chairman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, said before, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and the thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under an open rule.'' 
   So what's changed, Madam Speaker? What's different now? Is it political expediency, or is it a broken promise? 
   Mr. McGovern, a member of the Rules Committee, said, ``I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if you want to show some bipartisanship, if you want to promote a process that has some integrity, this should be an open rule. All Members should have an opportunity to come here and offer amendments to this bill to improve the quality of deliberations on this House floor.'' 
   So what's different now, Madam Speaker? Is it political expediency, or a broken promise? 
   Democratic Caucus Chair, Mr. Emanuel, said before, ``Let's have an up or down vote. Don't be scared. Don't hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it on the table. Let's have a vote. So don't hide behind the rule. If this is what you want to do, let's have an up or down vote. You can put your votes right up there, and then the American people can see what it's all about.'' 
   So what's different, Madam Speaker? Political expediency, or a broken promise? 
   I offered an amendment that would be debated on this floor that would have reduced the amount of spending by 1 percent. It would have saved the American taxpayer $31 million. Now, $31 million may not seem like a lot in Washington, but back where I come from and across this Nation, $31 million is a lot of money. It would say to the American people this is a step in the right direction for fiscal responsibility. That was said before, what was said before by the now majority leader, Steny Hoyer, who said, ``We want to get the budget deficit under control. We have said fiscal responsibility was necessary, but we're not going to be hoisted on the torrent of fiscal responsibility.'' 
   Madam Speaker, rules aren't rules if you only follow them when you want to, and choosing when to do so is breaking a promise. An open promise shouldn't just be something that you talk about on the campaign trail. 
   Madam Speaker, Americans understand that promises made on the campaign trail and promises that aren't kept in the heat of debate on the House floor are broken promises. And the American people are paying attention.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from California for yielding and for organizing this and his leadership on this issue. I appreciate your perspective and your expertise as a CPA practicing before you came to Congress. I know that you have the knowledge that all of us should utilize as we talk about budget and the economy. 
   You know, I was sitting over in my office and listening to our good friends on the other side of the aisle as they were discussing their issues before. I could not help but being amused by their comments. And you sense that they are trying to lay the groundwork now for a budget that they are going to propose, and they are going to propose it obviously with more spending, because that is what our friends on the other side of the aisle do. 
   But I could not help but just be reminded of the Orwellian sense of how the folks on the other side of the aisle seem to govern. You know, they just seem to think that if they just say it, that it is so. All you have got to do is say it, then it is so. They passed a bill last week that they said did not have any earmarks or any special projects. In fact, it had hundred of millions of dollars of earmarks that they could have taken out; in fact, voted against taking them out. 
   But I did want to review very briefly, before I mentioned a word or two about the budget and the economy, these wonderful Six for '06 programs that they passed. And of course they are celebrating them as if they were law. However, the Senate has not acted on any of these, so, in fact, they have not become law. And thank goodness they have not become law, because what this highlights is the hypocrisy of our good friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   They talk about passing all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations. In fact, that is not what they did. That is not what the bill did that they brought to the floor. In fact, they did not pass some of the most important recommendations that allow for communication between committees here that make it so all America would be safer. 
   They talk about the minimum wage increase. In fact, what they would do if they increased it in the way that they wanted to is to decrease the number of jobs on America and propose this unfunded mandate on American small businesses, which actually cuts the level of employment in our Nation. The Senate has recognized that, and they are working to try to correct the damage that the Democratic House has done. 
   They denied completely the proven results. I am a physician, practiced medicine for over 20 years before coming to Congress. And the Democratic majority here denied the proven results of adult and cord stem cell research on a bill that they passed here earlier. I suspect the Senate will have to correct the damage that they have done there as well. 
   As a physician I recognize the importance of doctors and patients making health care decisions by themselves without governmental intervention. And what our good friends on the other side of the aisle did was, in fact, work to fix prices in the area of Medicare prescription drugs, which would decrease the number of drugs available for seniors and, in fact, harm seniors, I believe, in the health care that they receive. And consequently I think the Senate is going to have to work on fixing that. 
   One of the remarkable hypocritical things that they did in their discussion points about decreasing student loans, in fact that is not what they did at all. What they did was pass a bill that kind of tracks down, decreases the interest on student loans, and then for 6 months  cuts the interest on student loans in half, not for students, though, for graduates; cuts it for 6 months, and then, bam, at the end of that 6 months, the interest rates pop right back up. 
   Then the most amazing thing that they have done is to tax domestic oil companies, not foreign oil companies, Mr. Speaker, not foreign oil companies. They tax domestic oil companies so that domestic oil costs more, foreign oil costs less. So what will happen is that Americans will be more reliant on foreign oil. 
   So it is a remarkable, remarkable culture of hypocrisy and misinformation, disinformation, I call it Orwellian government, that our good friends on the other side of the aisle have promoted. 
   I do want to mention some of economic issues that you had talked about before, the good news, remarkable news in the economy: economic growth, 3.4 percent growth in GDP over the last year; business investment up for 14 straight quarters; job growth of 7.2 million new jobs since the summer of 2003; low unemployment rate, 4.5, 4.6 percent unemployment rate. That is a rate lower than the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s combined. 
   Tax revenues, tax receipts are up. Deficit reduction you mentioned, Mr. Campbell, the latest numbers that are out on the 12-month rolling deficit, the budget deficit, down to $188 billion. That is the lowest that it has been since 2002. And a steady increase in labor productivity. 
   So one would think that if our friends on the other side of the aisle were interested in a good economy, they would look at this economy and they would say, well, how did that happen? What made that happen? Were there actions that were taken by the Federal Government and Congress that resulted in those good numbers? 
   Well, in fact, there were. And they happened in 2001 and 2003, as my friends know, and those were the tax reductions, the appropriate tax reductions on the American people, capital gains, dividends, tax reductions, and a decrease in income tax for the vast majority of Americans. What that did, as it did under President Reagan and as it did under President Kennedy, what that did was to stimulate the economy in a way that resulted in the numbers that we have seen. 
   And so our good friends on the other side of the aisle would do well to study history. They would do well to study history. They would do well to learn from history as they try to formulate their budget and make certain that they appreciate, as we do on this side of the aisle, that Washington does not have a revenue problem, it has got a spending problem. 
   We look forward to working with our good friends on the other side of the aisle in decreasing Washington's spending, solving those difficult challenges that we have, as my good friend from Iowa mentioned just a little bit ago, in the area of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, all of those automatic spenders that are comprising more and more of the budget. 
   I look forward to working with him, I know that my friend from California does, and again I appreciate his leadership and the information that he has been bringing to the floor of the House today and to the American 
   people. Because we are challenged with solving these problems and difficulties that we have as a Nation, we ought to do it together. We are proposing the kind of positive and uplifting messages that I think all America can embrace. I appreciate the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1051, which is a bill to establish a public Web site through which individuals may find a database of available scholarships and fellowships and other programs of financial assistance for the study of science and technology and engineering and math. 
   Before I begin, I just want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey for introducing this piece of legislation and for his leadership in this area. I also want to commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) for his leadership, as well as Mrs. McMorris Rodgers, Mrs. Biggert and others for their support of this bill itself. 
   I am a strong proponent, strong proponent of STEM education programs. Anything that Congress can do to strengthen interest in these fields is wholeheartedly welcome. 
   As a physician, I understand and appreciate the challenge that our Nation has in maintaining its preeminence in these fields. Encouraging our best and brightest and interested young people to choose this field of study is a positive step, and I believe this bill is a step in that direction. 
   As we continue to discuss new ideas for the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, it's important that we develop proposals that will ensure students are informed about their options for financial aid, both from the Federal Government and from the private sector. In fact, the House has already taken one step in that direction, included in H.R. 890, the Student Loan Sunshine Act, which passed last month, was a proposal that was offered by Representative Keller, that would make it easier for students to get information on their options for Federal financial aid. 
   This proposal would launch a single Web site for opportunities for financial aid in fellowships and scholarships being offered by any agency within the Federal Government. 
   This bill simply takes this idea one step further by making sure that information about scholarships and fellowships and other forms of private financial aid is readily available to students interested in pursuing their opportunities in education and science, technology, engineering and math. As we continue to examine proposals to increase America's competitiveness, it's helpful for us to equip students interested in pursuing careers in these fields with the information that they need that might assist them in financing their education. 
   For these reasons and others, I respectfully ask my colleagues to support H.R. 1051. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I stand before this House and say that I oppose human cloning. 
   As a physician, I'm extremely concerned about the consequences of human cloning and all of its ramifications, but this bill doesn't ban human cloning, not as we all know it. 
   The author says, read the bill. Well, I would suggest to my colleagues, that is exactly what they ought to do, read the bill. 
   The definition on page 2 of human cloning says, ``The term `human cloning' means the implantation of the product of human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology into a uterus or the functional equivalent of a uterus.'' It confines the definition to implantation. Cloning means to copy. Human cloning means to copy a human. 
   Dorland's medical dictionary definition of human cloning is, ``The transplantation of a nucleus from a somatic cell into an ovum which then develops into an embryo.'' It doesn't confine it to implantation, because implantation is the next step. 
   Cloning doesn't have to do with implantation. This is another, Mr. Speaker, in a long list of Orwellian democracy actions by this majority, saying one thing and doing another. This bill wouldn't ban human cloning at all. 
   What a shame, what a sham. I urge my colleagues to read the bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2559, which is a measure to extend programs under the Higher Education Act that are set to expire at the end of this month. 
   I want to thank my committee colleagues, Chairman Miller, Chairman Hinojosa, Mr. McKeon and Mr. Keller for their work on this bill, as well as their consistent efforts on behalf of our Nation's college students and their families. 
   Bolstering our higher education and student aid programs has long been a priority for Congress, regardless of which party was in the majority. In the last Congress, for example, under Republican leadership, we passed a measure that reduced lender subsidies, increased loan limits for students, and provided additional resources for students studying math, science and critical foreign languages in college. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate didn't act on the higher education reauthorization in the last Congress, so we were forced to extend programs under the law last September. In that extension, we included a number of important benefits for college students and institutions of higher education as well. For example, we reduced red tape and provided loan forgiveness to spouses and parents of those who died or became disabled on September 11. 
   Mr. Speaker, just last month, the House continued our work to strengthen the student aid system by passing the Student Loan Sunshine Act, bipartisan legislation that will restore confidence in the relationships between student lenders and colleges and universities. 
   Now, as we prepare anew to reauthorize programs under the Higher Education Act, we are again faced with the need to pass an extension of these programs to bridge this gap. Now, make no mistake, the measure before us today is worthy of our support, but, at the same time, I am hopeful that our friends on the other side of the Capitol will renew their commitment to a full reauthorization. These extensions, now five of which we've had in the last Congress alone, ought to become a thing of the past. 
   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of the Capitol in completing our reauthorization work in the 110th Congress. Just as importantly, I also look forward to working toward reforms that recognize the contributions of market-based programs that have been made on behalf of millions of students for the last several decades. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder in which the blood doesn't clot causing excessive bleeding and easy bruising. Without proper treatment, it can lead to organ damage, serious joint and muscle problems, and terrible pain. Those with hemophilia often live in a world unknown to others, anxious about even minor injuries or cuts because what is minor for most people can be a major problem for those with hemophilia. 
   As a physician, I'm confident that with attention, diligence, innovation, and scientific progress, we will improve the lives of those afflicted with this troubling disease and realize a cure. 
   Madam Speaker, hemophilia is a daunting condition requiring vigilant care, but we see a day where patients need not fear its pain or its consequences. I'm proud to stand today in support of World Hemophilia Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I note as I come to the well here that it's now 2:49 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, a time when across this Nation the folks who worked the day shift are getting ready to complete their work; the folks who are working the afternoon or evening shift are getting ready to head off to work or on their way to work; and the folks who work the midnight shift across the Nation are probably just rubbing their eyes as they wake up and begin their day or bedding down as they begin their rest before they get back at it again this evening. 
   Where is the House of Representatives? Well, Madam Speaker, you look around the House of Representatives and they've gone home. They've all gone home. Now, why is that important? Well it's important, Madam Speaker, because I think it demonstrates another day demonstrating the crisis of leadership that we have in this House of Representatives. 
   Madam Speaker, I come to the well today at this time to document that we are now 62 days into a unilateral disarmament of the United States of America as it relates to folks who want to do us harm all across this world, 62 days in which we have not had in place the Protect America Act, 62 days in which we have not had in place the appropriate rules and protections for communication companies to allow our United States Government to listen and intercept electronic communication between a foreign individual in a foreign land who wishes to do America harm and another foreign individual in a foreign land who wishes to do us harm. 
   Did you get that, Madam Speaker? Non-U.S. citizen, not on U.S. soil, talking or communicating through electronic communication to another non-U.S. citizen, not on U.S. soil, about how to injure Americans either on the battlefield or here in our homeland. 
   It's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The bill was the Protect America Act. Sixty-two days ago, the leadership in this House of Representatives allowed that to expire. And why? For some reason, they believed that lawyers ought to be able to represent that foreign individual in a foreign land who want to do us harm with the same protections that you and I enjoy as American citizens. 
   Madam Speaker, when I go home to the Sixth District of Georgia and I tell people about this, they shake their head and say, what on earth is going on? Where is the leadership? And I agree. Where is the leadership? 
   Madam Speaker, there is a crisis of leadership in this House of Representatives, whether it is on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or the Protect America Act, to allow our intelligence community the tools that they need to keep us protected. Whether it's on not doing anything positive about the price of gasoline all across this Nation, the only thing this House has done, this leadership has done is to increase the cost of domestic production of oil by increasing taxes. And who pays those ultimately? You got it, Madam Speaker. Americans. 
   Whether it is allowing the free and fair trade agreement with Colombia to not come to the floor, to change the rules so that it can't come to the floor so that we kick in the teeth the only real friend that we have in South America, one of the few friends we have in South America, a democratically elected government; or whether it is, again, not allowing our intelligence community to listen to a terrorist on foreign soil, talking to another terrorist on foreign soil so that we know what the bad guys are going to do before they do it. 
   Madam Speaker, that's a crisis of leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (Mr. COLE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield such time as he might care to consume to my good friend from Georgia (Mr. <em>Price</em>). -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from Oklahoma for his leadership on this and so many issues and for yielding me time. 
   This is an important issue, an important bill. So many of us have worked with groups within our districts all across this Nation who have had family members volunteer, serve, defend our liberty and freedom around the world, many of them on multiple tours of duty. So helping the families and recognizing their sacrifices is extremely important. They fight to defend our liberty, they fight to defend our freedom, they fight to defend our way of life, and yes, they fight to defend our ability to stand on this floor and debate and deliberate the major issues of the day. 
   Which is why it is with some significant regret that I discuss the issue that is the most important issue facing Americans today at home, and that is the issue of the economy and increasing gas prices and energy policy, and sadly say to my colleagues that the freedom and the liberty and the processes that our military men and women risk their lives to protect are sadly not being honored here on the floor of the House. 
   We heard with great fanfare last week the Speaker and the Democrat leadership announce to the Nation that they had reached a compromise on energy policy, an issue that we have been, on my side of the aisle, demanding an appropriate deliberative process and a fair and open debate for these many months. 
   But the Speaker announced they had reached a compromise. The problem, Mr. Speaker, as you well know is the compromise within their own minds, within their own caucus, which is why it saddens me to recognize that the men and women who are fighting to defend our freedom and our liberty and fighting for the ability of our democracy to long survive, and yet we have a process of democracy that's been so distorted it would not be recognized certainly by our Founding Fathers and likely not by any civics class across this Nation. 
   Because the way in which this energy bill supposedly--I don't know who's seen it--supposedly will be brought to the floor in less than 24 hours is through a closed process, through a secret process behind closed doors; not an open deliberative process, not a democratic process. Dare I say, Mr. Speaker, not an American process. 
   This is an important bill to recognize the sacrifices of American families all across this Nation whose loved ones stand today and have continued to stand to fight for liberty and freedom. But it saddens me greatly, Mr. Speaker, to not have that process and that fight and that valor honored here on the floor of the House of Representatives in a way that recognizes the history of our Nation, the appropriateness of the deliberative process, the imperative of democracy, the recognition that each and every one of us represents the same number of Americans. 
   So I support this bill, but I am so saddened and distressed by what appears to be a recurrent theme among this current leadership, and that is not to recognize the imperative of democracy and debate and deliberation in this, the greatest House, the people's House.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP'S PLAN FOR FAILURE IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much the opportunity that my leadership has provided in me in allowing me to come and share some comments this evening on the floor on what is truly a momentous and historic day for our Nation. 
   Within the last hour, as you know, Mr. Speaker, I understand that the President has fulfilled the promise that he made to the American people. That is to uphold and preserve and defend the Constitution of the United States; and in so doing, he has vetoed the legislation that was passed by the Democrat majority recently, last week, to provide not just funding for our troops in harm's way but also to make 535 commanders in chief here in Congress and to spend an extra 20-odd billion dollars on what was supposed to be a clean, clear definition of the amount of resources needed by our troops to keep themselves safe and out of harm's way in both Iraq and Afghanistan. So within the last hour the President has vetoed that legislation, and this Congress will take up that veto tomorrow. 
   Curiously, today we have had Members of the majority party come to the floor over and over and over again and express a peculiar amount of glee, glee that is highlighting their policy of failure and their policy of defeat. Frankly, I don't understand it, Mr. Speaker. Many of my constituents talked to me this past weekend when I was home and said they didn't understand it either. It was peculiar from their standpoint to understand and difficult to understand how the majority party in this Congress could believe that abandoning our troops in harm's way was an appropriate thing to do. And, consequently, I am as perplexed as they with the policy that this majority party has put in place. 
   The policy that they have put in place, as is clear to everybody and we will talk about that a bit this evening, is to ensure defeat and to ensure failure of our troops. And it seems to be all, all, for politics, which is probably as sad and distressing as anything, Mr. Speaker.     
   The Democrat leadership continues to be committed to a plan for failure in Iraq, and they seem to be doing it, as I say for political points, scoring political points, political partnership, political grandstanding, whatever you want to call it. 
   And some might ask, well, how can you be so certain of that? Well, Mr. Speaker, we get example day after day after day. And the most recent example is what happened today, and that is, that the bill that this Congress passed, this majority passed last week to provide artificial timelines and specific benchmarks for our troops on the ground and to add incredible billions of dollars of pork to the war supplemental, the bill was passed last week, and they did not send it to the White House until today. Now, the President took his responsibility seriously and he vetoed that and turned that bill around rapidly. 
   But why, why, the American people are asking, why did it take nearly a week to send that bill to the White House? Every day that goes by, every day that is added on to our troops and our military not having the resources that they need to be able to protect themselves, to be able to continue the mission that they have defined, every day that goes by that makes it so that they have to rob from Peter to pay Paul, every day that goes by that makes it so that they are unable to repair munitions and armaments, every day that goes by is costly to our men and women in the military, and costly in a way that costs lives. And so every day that goes by, by design, is a flawed policy, is a policy for failure, and is clearly a policy that is grounded in politics only. 
   So the question has to be asked, Mr. Speaker, well, why did it take 5 days to send that bill to the President? Well, what we have seen today is the answer to that question; and that is, that the other side, the majority party, clearly wanted to score their political points, to take advantage of a May 1 anniversary that they would define, to distort that terribly, but to take advantage of that anniversary for political points. It is sad, Mr. Speaker, it is truly, truly very sad. 
   I came to the floor last Wednesday, when this House passed the bill, and I talked about it being a sad and a sobering day for America, and a shame. And I talked about it being a shame because the policy that this majority party has adopted is a policy that sends the wrong message to our troops, it sends the wrong message to our allies, and yes, Mr. Speaker, it sends the wrong message to our enemies. Because to our troops it says that we don't believe in you. We don't believe you can accomplish your mission. We don't believe that you have the ability to do what you say you can do. We don't believe in our general that we supported and endorsed by unanimous vote in the Senate just this year. The message to our troops says, ``We don't believe in you.'' 
   To our allies, the message is one that, I think if you look at it seriously, Mr. Speaker, is one that nobody would want to send. Because what it says to our allies is, with this majority party you can no longer trust the commitment and the word of the United States of America. That is what it says to our allies. I don't think that is the message, Mr. Speaker, that we ought to be sending around the world in this dangerous time. 
   But probably the most important message is the message that it sends to our enemies. To our enemies it says, if you happen to have a difference with the United States of America and you believe that the destruction of the United States of America is at the core of your belief, then all you have to do is wait, all you have to do is wait; America will give up. That is the wrong message, Mr. Speaker. That is the wrong message. And it will ultimately end up in a more dangerous world if it is allowed to succeed. 
   If that message is allowed to succeed by the policies of this Nation, it will ultimately end up in a more dangerous world. It will certainly end up in a more dangerous Middle East. And it will end up, I believe, and many scholars and experts in the military believe that it will end up causing greater amounts of casualties for the American people, and certainly for our military who will have to engage in a way and in a manner that is almost incomprehensible to us right now. 
   Most of us in this Chamber, who we are privileged to serve, but most of us have members of the military who have come from our district; all of them have sacrificed to serve. They have recognized the importance of service to our Nation. They have stood up and they have said, I hear the call. If you talk to them, most of them will say that they are not in favor of the kind of policy that has been adopted by this majority party. One of them has been very open about that in this letter that I am going to read. It comes from a Lieutenant Jason Nichols, United States Navy, who is serving currently in Baghdad, in Iraq. 
   The statements by the majority leader in the United States Senate recently about the war being lost have hit a nerve, they have struck a cord on the part of our men and women in the military. They have struck a cord across this Nation, Mr. Speaker. And the cord that they have struck is one that says, how on earth can we have a majority party, a majority leader who makes that kind of statement in the middle of conflict when our men and women are in harm's way? What kind of leader is that? 
   This letter, as I say, comes from Lieutenant Jason Nichols, United States Navy, it is addressed to Senator Reid. And he says, ``Senator Reid, when you say we've lost in Iraq, I don't think you understand the effect of your words. The Iraqis I speak with are the good guys here, fighting to build a stable government. They hear what you say, but they don't understand it. They don't know about the political game, they don't know about a Presidential veto, and they don't know about party politics. But they do know that if they help us, they are noticed by terrorists and extremists, and they decide to help us if they think we can protect them from those terrorists. They tell us where caches of weapons are hidden. They call and report small groups of men who are strangers to the neighborhood, men that look the same to us but  are obvious to them to be a foreign suicide cell. 
   ``To be brief, your words are killing us. Your statements make the Iraqis afraid to help us for fear we will leave them unprotected in the future. They don't report a cache, and its weapons blow up my friends in a convoy. They don't report a foreign fighter, and that fighter sends a mortar onto my base. Your statements are noticed, and they have an effect. 
   ``Finally, you are mistaken when you say we are losing. We are winning, I see it every day. However, we will win with fewer casualties if you will help us. Will you?'' 
   Respectfully, Lieutenant Jason Nichols, United States Navy. 
   Do you hear that, Mr. Speaker? The message that we are sending to our enemy, as I said, is all you have to do, if you oppose the United States, is just wait. But it is more than that, isn't it, Mr. Speaker? As Lieutenant Nichols said, quote, ``To be brief, your words are killing us.'' Mr. Speaker, who is ``us'' in that letter? Who is ``us''? ``Us,'' Mr. Speaker, are the brave men and women who stand up and fight on behalf of the United States of America, who stand up and defend our liberty and our freedom. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are some people in my district who wonder why the action of Members of Congress who will make those kinds of statements, why that isn't defined as treason. I get asked those questions at home. They are tough to answer. They are tough to answer. I ask you, Mr. Speaker, why? Why? Why do we have leaders that make those kinds of statements? 
   It is not just members of the military that are saying that this policy that's being adopted and the kind of language that's being used are detrimental to our Nation and to our alliances and to our men and women in harm's way. There are all sorts of press reports and press opinions, editorials across this Nation that say what on earth are the Democrats doing? What on earth is the majority party doing? 
   The Chicago Tribune described the Democrat surrender bill as ``Self-Defeating.'' They had in an editorial on the 27th of April, just 4 or 5 days ago, ``Establishing a timetable now would be self-defeating. A new defense secretary and a new commander on the ground should have time and flexibility to see if they can succeed where their predecessors failed,'' which is exactly what Americans believe. But there is this peculiar glee on the other side of the aisle that they are accomplishing something for political gain; however, that something puts America at greater risk. 
   The Chicago Tribune goes on to say, ``President Bush will veto the spending bill approved by Congress this week because it contains a timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops from Iraq. He is right to do so.'' Mr. Speaker, this isn't a paper that is known to be terribly supportive of this President, but they understand the consequences of the actions of this majority party, they understand that they put us at greater risk. 
   And finally, the editorial from the 27th of April from the Chicago Tribune goes on to say, ``Establishing a congressionally mandated timetable for withdrawal would straitjacket the ability of General Davis Petraeus, the top commander on the ground, to pursue the stabilization of Iraq as events and conditions warrant. 
   ``Senator HARRY REID said recently the war is lost. This legislation would all but guarantee it.'' 
   So in addition to having a certain amount of glee with the actions that are occurring, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the Democrat leadership in both the Senate and the House is vested in the defeat of the United States in Iraq. They are now on record as being in favor of the defeat of the United States. It is a very peculiar strategy, Mr. Speaker. And the only way it makes sense is if you believe that this Congress ought to act for short-term political gain by a given political party; that is the only way it makes sense. No other way could it be deemed as being appropriate for the policy of this Nation to hamstring, to handcuff, to tie the ability of our generals on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan to make decisions. It seems truly that failure and defeat are the goal of the majority party. How sad, how sad for a once proud party in this Nation to have failure for the United States be their new strategy. 
   The Wall Street Journal sees it similarly. They say that Washington Democrats are taking ownership of the defeat in Iraq. In an editorial on April 25, just last month, they say, ``In calling for withdrawal, Mr. Reid and his allies, just as with Vietnam, may think they are merely following polls that show the public is unhappy with the war. Yet Americans will come to dislike a humiliation and its aftermath even more, especially if they realize that a withdrawal from Iraq now will only make it harder to stabilize the region and defeat Islamist radicals. And they will like it even less should we be required to re-enter the country someday under far worse circumstances.'' 
   It is peculiar, when you think about it, Mr. Speaker, because what you hear from the other side, what you hear from the Democrat majority in all of their discussion and all of their points, their political partisan points that they make about this, all that you hear is about this issue of failure. You never hear about what the next step is. 
   We are going to talk about that a little bit tonight, about what the next step ought to be, about the consequences for failure. Because it is important that the American people appreciate that the decisions made in this Congress will affect this Nation for a long period of time if the decisions aren't made in the light of day and with eyes wide open about what the consequences of failure in this day and time in the Middle East will be. 
   The Wall Street Journal also went on to say, ``At least Mr. Bush and his commanders are now trying to make up for previous mistakes with a strategy to put Prime Minister Maliki's government on a stronger footing, secure Baghdad and the Sunni provinces against al Qaeda, and allow for an eventual honorable U.S. withdrawal. That's more than can be said for Mr. Reid and the Democratic left, who are making the job for our troops more difficult by undermining U.S. morale and Iraqi confidence in American support.''     
   It gets to the issue of what kind of message, Mr. Speaker, we are sending to our allies. 
   The San Diego Tribune was another paper that weighed in on this issue. They went on to describe the Democrat surrender bill as ``a sham that is detrimental to our efforts.'' They said, ``The Democratic campaign is a textbook lesson in why the war cannot be managed by a committee of 535 bitterly divided lawmakers. The Constitution gives Congress control of the Federal purse strings, to be sure, but this authority has never been an effective instrument for directing forces in a combat zone. The Constitution gives that authority to the commander-in-chief alone.'' 
   This brings up the interesting issue, Mr. Speaker, of how this Congress can believe that it ought to be having 535 commanders-in-chief. It doesn't make any sense, because it puts every one of the Members of Congress who believe that they know better what ought to go on on the ground in a position that ties the hands of our generals. 
   It is not unusual for the Democrat party to believe that Congress knows best. Oftentimes their decisions affect people in kind of peripheral and tangential ways. In this decision, Mr. Speaker, it affects our military men and women who are putting themselves in harm's way very directly and adversely. 
   Now, I want to be clear that those of us in the Republican Party believe that this is an appropriate debate for Congress to have. It is appropriate for Congress to say, as the paper that I just cited says, that Congress has the power of the purse string, and it is appropriate for Congress to say, if it so desires, if the majority party so desires, that we ought not fund the troops anymore in Iraq or in Afghanistan or wherever else this majority party deems that it is not appropriate for us to fund troops. That is an appropriate debate. That is a clear debate, that is a clear vote, which is why we asked for a clear vote, a clean vote, on the war supplemental. Because, Mr. Speaker, when that happens, then it is very clear what people are voting upon. That, yes, we believe there ought to be resources available for our men and women in harm's way; or, no, we do not. That is a clear vote.  
   We muddy the waters and we confound the issue and we do a disservice to our Constitution and we do a disservice to our men and women in the field, certainly, when we put arbitrary timelines and benchmarks in a bill that clearly, clearly, is not appropriate, and makes it so that the Constitution becomes undermined. 
   The San Diego Union Tribune goes on to say more on April 26. General Petraeus was here, who is the Commander of American forces in Iraq on the ground. He visited this Congress last Wednesday and was not given the opportunity to speak to the House of Representatives as a whole in this Chamber. In fact, it is curious, Mr. Speaker, because the Speaker of this House went out of her way to visit the President of Syria on a visit recently to the Middle East, but she didn't go out of her way to visit with the American commanding general when he visited Congress. 
   So, the San Diego Tribune last week said, ``Yesterday's pleas to lawmakers by General David Petraeus, the top commander in Iraq, not to micromanage the war were brushed off without serious consideration in the House's partisan stampede. Meanwhile, essential funding for the troops has been sidetracked by the phony legislative exercise playing out on Capitol Hill.'' 
   That is what I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, that the only rational conclusion that one could come to about why we are going through this process, why we are going through this ``sham bill,'' as the San Diego Union Tribune calls it, why we are going through this exercise and putting the American people and our troops in harm's way through this exercise, is all about politics. It is all about politics. How sad, Mr. Speaker. How sad. 
   The Union Tribune concludes, ``And even though this sham bill is merely a political show, the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate managed to lard it up with nearly $25 billion in wasteful pork, most of it entirely unrelated to war funding.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is not just our men and women in the field who say that this is a wrong-headed policy. It is not just those of us on the minority side of the aisle who say that this is a wrong-headed policy and it sends the wrong message to our troops and to our allies and to our enemies. It is cogent individuals across this Nation who have come to that same conclusion. 
   The opportunity to come to the floor is a true privilege and a great opportunity to share with the American people what our belief is about this supplemental war bill, and I am pleased to be joined by a colleague, the gentlelady from Tennessee, Congresswoman Blackburn, who is a true leader in this House and has been a true leader on this issue, because she understands and appreciates the importance and the consequences of the decisions that we make as they relate to our troops in the field and as they relate to our Nation and to our future liberty and our future freedom. 
   I am so pleased you would join us this evening. I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. I am struck by the general sense by the majority party, or seeming sense by the majority party, that their actions don't really make any difference to date. In fact, the delay we have already had, I have heard from some folks in the military that they are not able to keep up some of the repair of some of the equipment in other areas, not in the field of war right now, but in other areas, which makes us less safe as a nation. 
   I was wondering if you had anybody you talked with who was giving a similar story?

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate those comments, because it is an incredible privilege and honor to represent a nation where we have men and women who are willing to stand up and serve, to volunteer to stand up and  serve to protect the freedoms that you describe, which is why in my district people are so confounded by the kind of policy that is being pushed by the majority party at this point. Because what they see is a majority party now that is saying to our troops, we don't believe in you, we don't believe you can accomplish your mission. It is saying to our allies that you can't believe in the commitment of the United States. And it says to our enemies that all you have to do is wait. It is very strange policy. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate you bringing up the extra $20-plus billion in the bill. And I am not often struck by the candor of some of our friends in the Democratic Party, but I was moved and struck by the candor of the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel, who was on one of the Sunday shows. I think it was ``Meet the Press'' with Mr. Russert. And Mr. Russert said: Why did you put all of that money in the bill? And Chairman Rangel, to his remarkable credit of candor said ``because we needed the votes.'' 
   So it is clear that the reason that the extra $20-plus billion of pork spending is in that bill is because, exactly as you said, they believe that people won't be able to vote against the bill if that kind of pork spending is in it.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you once again for pointing out this incredibly prescient and clear perspective on this issue, if people in the majority party would just step back and take a look. And that is why it is important that you pointed out that the bill number is H.R. 1591 and how to find it online at www.thomas.loc.gov, and I urge people to look at the area in the bill that has the artificial time lines and benchmarks. What we oftentimes hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle is there is no specific time line; but the bill is very specific. It says by October 1, we will begin to bring the troops home. 
   So it is clear that their mission is politics. The majority party's mission is politics. There can be no other reason for the remarkably foolish, if you want to support the United States, the remarkably foolish policy that they put on the table. The only reason can be politics, and short-term politics at that.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady because it is the question that needs to be asked, and it is a question that our friends on the other side of the aisle asked all the time about what the President asked once Saddam fell, what next? What we ask them now, given our current situation: Where is your strategy? If you succeed with your policy of ending the funding  for the troops and ending our involvement in Iraq, what next? What happens then? 
   There are some very good scholarly individuals who have looked at this, and they have said what they believe will happen next. In fact, the chart that I have here shows what the National Intelligence Estimate, the NIE, says will happen if we fail in Iraq. That is important because that group, the National Intelligence Estimate, is the group that our good friends cite all of the time, incorrectly, I might add oftentimes, but they cite them as the source for information about what ought to be done in Iraq. 
   But what the National Intelligence Estimate has said that the consequences of failure in Iraq would be: ``Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources, and operations remain an essential, stabilizing element in Iraq.'' Essential stabilizing element in Iraq. 
   Last week when General Petraeus was here and what he said, and it was so distorted by our friends on the other side of the aisle, but what he said on April 26 was: ``As I noted during my confirmation hearing, military action is necessary but not sufficient. We can provide the Iraqis an opportunity, but they will have to exploit it.'' 
   He also said: ``And again I note that we are just really getting started with the new effort.'' 
   He went on to say: ``Success will take continued commitment, perseverance and sacrifice, all to make possible an opportunity for the all-important Iraqi political actions that are the key to long-term solutions to Iraqi's many problems. And because we are operating in new areas and challenging elements in those areas, this effort may get harder before it gets easier.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of information that is imperative for this Congress to appreciate and recognize and utilize in its formula for where we go from here. If we ignore that kind of information from our general that was unanimously approved by our Senate, if we ignore that kind of information, we do so at our peril. 
   So what happens if we have failure in Iraq, according to the National Intelligence Estimate, well, one, Iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control. What does that mean? That means in essence the nation breaks into three warring factions, three warring factions, and some would say that is what is happening right now. The difference is there would be no stabilizing influence whatsoever, and the estimates are that ten of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqis would be slaughtered. Mr. Speaker, that is a sobering assessment. That is a sobering assessment. 
   Secondly, interference by neighboring countries in an open conflict is what the National Intelligence Estimate says is likely with failure in Iraq. What does that mean. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, what that means is that the conflagration, the battles, the war in Iraq becomes a war in the larger Middle East in a way that can only be described as a nightmare not just for the Middle East but for peace in the world, for peace in the world. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate went on to say there would be massive civilian casualties and population displacement, as I mentioned before. The estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of individuals slaughtered, killed, murdered, in sectarian violence that would put the kind of violence that we are seeing right now, which is horrendous, but it would make it seem like just a prelude, just a prelude. 
   Fourth, the al Qaeda in Iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside Iraq. 
   This is important because if al Qaeda, if in the larger war on terror which we sometimes or oftentimes in this Chamber seem to lose sight of, but if in the larger war on terror the terrorists, the Islamic terrorists whose stated desire is to wipe Israel off the map and to end our way of life, that is their stated desire, not my opinion, that is their stated desire. If we fail in Iraq, what results is a haven of significant size and significant ability to attract terrorists in a way and to allow them the opportunity to plot for significant violence and attacks both inside and outside Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we saw outside Iraq doesn't just mean next door. It means around the world. As we saw on September 11, around the world can mean violence and horrendous activities visiting our shores when we least expect it. 
   Finally, the National Intelligence Estimate says there will be spiraling violence and political disarray, including Kurdish attempts at autonomy in Kirkuk. What that means is the nation breaks apart. And if Iraq breaks apart in the way that the National Intelligence Estimate has stated would be the likely outcome of failure in Iraq, if that nation breaks apart, what happens is it becomes a magnet for terrorism and a terrorist haven in the Middle East, a less stable Middle East, a more endangered Middle East, an emboldened enemy, a likely scenario that would bring about significant violence upon our shores once again.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, the consequence of the actions that have been adopted by this majority party, by this bill that the President has vetoed this evening, the consequences of moving forward with that same kind of legislation, which the majority party has threatened to do, and ``threatened'' is the right term because it threatens to place, Mr. Speaker, at greatest risk and in greater harm's way, if we continue along that path, what we do is bring about a less stable Middle East, certainly a less stable Iraq, a greater threat to Israel and other Nations in the Middle East and certainly a greater threat to the United States. 
   I was quoting earlier, Mr. Speaker, from some news reports and newspapers from around the Nation on what they believed was the essence of this bill that the President has appropriately vetoed this evening. 
   The Washington Times said that, ``The Democrats' lack of interest in the real-world impact of their legislation is reflected in their shabby treatment of the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General David Petraeus. Last week, House Democratic leaders initially declined General Petraeus' invitation to brief Members, reversing themselves only after coming under fire from Republicans. And by tying funding for the war to a surrender bill that the President will veto, the Democrats are showing studied contempt for our troops in the field.'' 
   Studied contempt, Mr. Speaker, which brings me back to the original letter that I read from Lieutenant Jason Nichols, who clearly appreciates this studied contempt, but also takes it to the next step and describes what that studied contempt does. I quote Lieutenant Nichols once again, ``To be brief, your words are killing us.'' 
   A powerful statement, Mr. Speaker, and we ought to be listening. We ought to be listening to the brave men and women who stand up to defend our liberty. 
   The Washington Times went on to say on April 26, ``When it came to the 150,000 U.S. troops now fighting in Iraq, lawmakers included enough poison-pill language to ensure a presidential veto which will in turn delay much-needed support for military operations in Iraq.'' 
   In another paragraph in that same article on April 26, ``To satisfy the MoveOn.org types, particularly in the House, the bill stars the pullout as early as nine and a half weeks from now. In an effort to provide political cover for House `Blue Dogs' from more conservative districts who want to vote with Mrs. Pelosi, it contains troop-withdrawal language that sets a `goal' for pulling out rather than a deadline.'' 
   However, Mr. Speaker, if you read the bill H.R. 1591, what it states, indeed, is a hard and fast deadline. 
   I want to quote one more individual who has stood tall and taken a lot of heat for it, and this is Senator JOSEPH LIEBERMAN who last week wrote in the Washington Post that the Democrat surrender bill is ``dangerously wrong.'' 
   He went on to say, ``And today, perversely, the Senate is likely to vote on a binding timeline of withdrawal from Iraq. This reaction is dangerously wrong. It reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of both the reality in Iraq and the nature of the enemy we are fighting there. What is needed in Iraq policy is not overheated rhetoric but a sober assessment of the progress we have made and the challenges we still face.'' 
   He went on to say on April 25 of this year, ``Indeed, to the extent that last  week's bloodshed clarified anything, it is that the battle of Baghdad is increasingly a battle against al Qaeda. Whether we like it or not, al Qaeda views the Iraqi capital as a central front of its war against us.'' 
   Finally in that article, Mr. Speaker, Senator Lieberman said, ``In the two months since Petraeus took command, the United States and its Iraqi allies have made encouraging progress on two problems that once seemed intractable: tamping down the Shiite-led sectarian violence that paralyzed Baghdad until recently and consolidating support from Iraqi Sunnis, particularly in Anbar, a province dismissed just a few months ago as hopelessly mired in insurgency.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, where do we go from here? Well, I think that it is time for the majority party to regroup, to reassess, to appreciate that what they have done is spent four months on a policy that is candidly shameful; that brings about a discredit and a disservice to our troops; that sends the wrong message to our allies saying that you cannot trust the United States of America; and certainly sends the wrong message to our enemies saying that if you oppose the United States and you are in a conflict, all you have got to do is wait because the United States will not live up to its commitment. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, what we need to do from here, the President has vetoed this bill this evening. I would challenge the leadership in the majority party to bring the House together. I would challenge the Senate to work together in a bipartisan way and come up with a bill that the President can sign and to do so in very rapid fashion. Every day that we delay makes it more harmful for our troops, makes it so they know not whether or not they will get the resources that they need to carry on their mission, makes it less predictable, continues to erode their morale because of the comments like the ones by the Senate majority leader last week. So we must in short order come together and pass a bill that the President can sign. 
   Mr. Speaker, regardless of what you believe, what one believes about the nature of this battle and whether or not it is indeed the central front of the war on terror, it is incumbent that we live up to our responsibilities, to our oath as Members of the United States House of Representatives, that we live up to the responsibility and the duty that we have. That primary responsibility is to preserve and to protect and to defend the United States. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that one of the issues about preserving and protecting and defending the United States is making certain that the men and women who stand up and volunteer to protect our liberty and our freedom deserve all of our support and the resources that they require to protect themselves and to carry out their missions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I challenge the leadership of the House and the Senate to make certain that this week we act to bring forth a bill that will pass both chambers of this Congress, and that the President can sign, that does a credit and honors our troops; that sends the correct message to our allies, and that is, that you can count on the word of the United States of America; and sends the correct message to our enemies, and that is, that if you engage the United States in military battle, that you have met an enemy that you cannot defeat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, health care decisions are often the most personal and important decisions ever made, and those decisions should rightly be made by patients and doctors, not bureaucrats and insurance companies. So it's concerning that the Democrat leadership plan to move forward with a large expansion of Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care under the guise of providing care for children. 
   The House Democrat plan would cost $50 to $80 billion, and include children whose families have an annual income up to $82,000, making 71 percent of all children in America eligible for government-run socialized medicine, a level of income where 89 percent of children already have private health insurance. Why? Because these Washington politicians believe they can make better health care decisions for America's families. They don't trust patients, and they don't trust doctors. 
   As a physician I know that the best medical decisions are made by patients and families. The positive solution is patient-centered health care, making insurance available to all patients and families. Let's put patients in charge, not Washington. That's what Americans want.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment in a little different vein. It's an amendment to increase funding in the Math and Science Partnership Program under the National Science Foundation by $2 million, and reduce by $2 million the Department management salaries and expenses under the Department of Commerce. 
   I'll offer an amendment here to increase American competitiveness and to improve opportunities for America's children. My amendment proposes to offer additional funding to the Math-Science Partnership Program under the National Science Foundation. We must fund important priorities to ensure that our Nation continues to see positive growth in our youth in the area of math and science. 
   In my home State of Georgia, I recently had the opportunity to join over 25,000 students and teachers and researchers from 31 different countries at the Georgia Dome for the FIRST competition. The FIRST, as many of my colleagues know, stands for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology. It's a robotics competition. If any of my colleagues haven't been to a robotics competition, I encourage them to go see one. It is a remarkable experience. 
   I was extremely impressed with the level of enthusiasm and the remarkable educational benefit with this type of an initiative that's provided to thousands of American students. We should continue to promote this and other similar programs throughout the Nation. 
   I'm sure that my colleagues recognize the significance of promoting a strong interest in math and science and technology education. These fields of learning and research are vital to our country's continued success. In fact, investment in basic research and programs like this is an essential element in assuring future prosperity, security and leadership in our rapidly evolving world. 
   The National Science Foundation has a mission to achieve excellence in science and technology, engineering and mathematics educational at all levels and all settings, from kindergarten through postdoctoral training. One of the most important successful initiatives under the NSF is the Math and Science Partnership Program, established in 2002, to strengthen and reform mathematics and science education for children around the Nation. 
   It's important to offer children guidance and examples set by mentors and role models, and provide students the opportunity to learn about the importance of higher education, and they're exposed to career options, especially from those folks who love and are enthusiastic about science and engineering and mathematics. 
   Under this commendable program, each State administers its own competitive grant program for institutions of higher education, K-12 schools and local partners. 
   In addition, the MSP program focuses on raising educational standards to prepare children for postsecondary education in math, science or engineering. 
   This program is worthy of additional funding because of its positive results for improving math and science skills which are vital for a developing workforce that's capable of increasing America's competitiveness internationally. 
   All jobs of the future will require a basic understanding of math and science. In fact, the 10-year employment projections showed that of the 20 fastest-growing occupations, 15 of them require significant math and science preparation. 
   This small adjustment is a symbol of our greater commitment to STEM education programs. Support for these programs is vital for the continued success of our children, our citizens and our Nation, and I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for his leadership in this area and for yielding me some time to talk about this rule and a little more expansive subject. 
   I think what we are seeing today really demonstrates the difference between our side and our approach, the Republican approach to fiscal challenges, financial challenges, financial responsibility that we face in this Nation, and our friends on the majority side, on the Democrat side. 
   We have had some important bills this week that we have dealt with. We have also had an opportunity to be financially responsible, fiscally responsible and accountable to the American people. Our side has chosen to propose those measures of accountability. The  other side, the majority side, has chosen to ignore that. This is another example today. 
   I live outside of Atlanta. My district is the Sixth District of Georgia. It has remarkable challenges in the area of water and water quality. I appreciate the importance of assisting State and local governments in the area of clean water. 
   This is an important bill. It ought to be a priority of our Nation. What the majority party says, however, is that this may be a priority, but we are not going to treat it as a priority from a financial standpoint. We are going to throw money at it from a governmental standpoint and we are going to enact the kind of PAYGO proposal that the majority party loves so much, which is raise taxes and go on with the program. That is what this bill does. 
   This is an important bill. It authorizes $16 billion in discretionary spending. It creates two new programs and continues other existing programs. There is $375 million for the creation of new Federal grant programs at EPA and $1.5 billion for State grant pollution control programs. It reauthorizes $20 million annually for some expired pilot programs to provide technical assistance in the area of water works treatment projects, and it authorizes $14 billion to provide grants to States to pay for the construction of clean water projects. These are important, important programs. 
   How do we pay for it? How do we pay for it? Well, the majority Democrat Party proposes that we pay for it by increased taxes, which is their ``TAXGO'' policy that they have for their financial programs. TAXGO: they raise taxes, and they raise taxes because they somehow believe that when you raise taxes on businesses that it never reaches the American people. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, as you and I both know, corporations don't pay taxes. What they do is they cover that by charging more for their product. The American people pay corporate taxes. The American people's taxes, the American people's costs are increased when corporate taxes are increased. It is just like the other side, the majority side, believes that the money that comes to the Federal Government is the government's money. It is not the people's money; it is the government's money. And that is this clear definition that we have seen this week. 
   So I offered an amendment to this bill that said this ought to be a priority of our Nation. But we ought to state that it is a priority by saying that there are other measures in the Federal Government program that we ought not cover because this ought to take that priority. A true PAYGO, a true pay-as-you-go proposal. 
   The Rules Committee decided no, they didn't want to do it that way. They wanted to raise taxes on the American people. So their TAXGO policy is in full place right here with this rule that doesn't even allow, doesn't even allow the Members of the House of Representatives to even make a statement on whether they think we ought to cover this with current money. 
   So the TAXGO policy is in place by our good friends on the majority side, on the Democrat side. This rule proves it. What has happened this week on the floor of the House proves it, as they have voted down real pay-as-you-go amendments to two of the previous bills. 
   As I said, Mr. Speaker, I think this really points out the clear and distinct difference from a financial standpoint in this House of Representatives. I am told, as you know, Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee doesn't even allow for a recorded vote anymore on these, so you can't even tell who is supportive of the rule and who isn't supportive of the rule. But as I understand it by those who were there, every single Democrat opposed my amendment, which means that every single Democrat, including the new Democrats on the Rules Committee, support a tax-and-go policy, a tax-and-spend policy. 
   This rule is a demonstration of that. This rule approves that. This rule proves that the majority party is not interested in financial responsibility and financial accountability, because they were given the opportunity to say, yes, we believe that we ought to identify priorities and pay for them at the Federal level by making certain that we are not increasing taxes and increasing the amount of money that hardworking Americans have to send to the Federal Government.     
   So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this rule. This is another evidence of the undemocratic side of the majority party that says, no, we ought not have a full and open debate which was promised to the American people. We ought not have a full and open debate on how we are going to pay for government programs. 
   I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be responsible, to be financially responsible, to allow for the appropriate discussion, debate and voting on measures so the American people know who their friends are from a taxing standpoint. I believe it is the Republican side of the aisle. I would hope my Democrat friends would join us in that endeavor, and urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and bring an appropriate rule, bring a rule that allows us to debate the issues in an open and honest way and then have the vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (END OF 100-HOUR AGENDA--THANK GOODNESS -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, thank goodness that the 100-hour agenda is over. Maybe now we can get down to doing some real work on behalf of the American people. 
   The celebration by our friends on the other side of the aisle is for a victory of form over substance. In just 2 weeks, they have passed a watered-down 9/11 Commission recommendations package, killed working-class jobs by imposing an unfunded mandate upon small businesses, limited choice in health care by forcing the government to fix prices and decrease the availability of medicines for seniors, pulled a bait-and-switch by misrepresenting their promise to cut student loan interest rates while offering no real relief to students; and finally, amazingly, fostered greater reliance on foreign oil by raising taxes on domestic oil production and exploration. 
   The American people know the difference between campaign rhetoric and good policy, and they demand that the majority honor an open, honest and fair legislative process, one that produces positive, principled and bipartisan solutions. The American people expect no less and deserve more than has been delivered so far.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment. 
   This amendment would reduce the EPA operations and administrations budget by $3.884 million and increase the EPA's science and technology homeland security water security initiative by that same amount. This area of the EPA program was decreased by $3.884 million below the President's request and $9 million below 2007 appropriations levels. 
   The operations and administrative appropriations has been increased by $40.8 million from the 2007 level, although that's the administration's request and I commend the committee for meeting that request.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (NO REASON TO CELEBRATE -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today the majority party will increase taxes on American oil companies and, hence, on all Americans. And they will increase our dependence on foreign oil. This will complete the sixth item of the majority party's initial agenda. This is the sixth time, but certainly not the last time, that Democrats will put forth a policy that fills a sound bite, but not sound policy. And according to a Democrat clock that stops and starts when it is politically convenient, they will be completed within 100 hours. 
   While those from across the aisle will pat themselves on the back, this is no cause for celebration. Adopting legislation without allowing consideration by any committee, or even a single amendment, is not a reason to celebrate. Applying the rules of the House only when they serve your purpose are no rules at all. And a blatant disregard to follow through on promises made in November shatters the trust of the American people and is no reason to celebrate. 
   This is the people's House. It thrives when ideas are wrestled with and challenged. The best ideas and solutions then rise to the top. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are watching. Doing anything less is no reason to celebrate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, soon our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will be introducing their 2008 budget. What they will really be introducing is an unprecedented tax hike on the American people. 
   Under the economic policies of the last 6 years, the American people have led this economy to over 40 straight months of economic growth, over 7 million new jobs and an unemployment rate at a near-40-year low. This is proof that Americans respond best to having more of their money in their pockets. 
   Nevertheless, the majority party, true to form, is preparing to usher in the largest tax increase in history. That's right, the largest tax increase in history that would bring back the marriage penalty and discourage further investment and growth. This would be a huge step backwards for our economy and for our government. The American people deserve leadership that respects their hard work. Washington must stop trying to find ways to afford a larger government. 
   As we begin the debate on the budget for the upcoming year, we shouldn't begin with a plan to grow an even more massive bureaucracy on the backs of the American taxpayer.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1227, GULF COAST HURRICANE HOUSING RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for his passion for openness and honesty in our process, and I thank him for yielding me some time. 
   I rise to oppose this rule for two specific reasons. One is because it is not an open rule. It is not an open rule. It is a violation of the assurances that we have been provided by the majority party. It is not an open rule. Having a little bit of an open rule is like being a little bit pregnant. It ain't possible. This is not an open rule. And I stand here with an amendment that was turned down by the Rules Committee. I stand here also opposing this because this rule takes fiscal sanity and it moves it into a room somewhere, a very dark room, and then locks the door and it throws away the key. 
   I have in my hand, Madam Speaker, the report from the Rules Committee on what we are considering today. And it has the amendment that I had offered, commonly known as PAYGO,  and it has the recorded vote. This is in the Rules Committee yesterday. 
   And my amendment would have been very simple. It said: ``Would require any new spending authorized by this legislation to have a specific offset.'' Simple. And what happened on the vote? Mr. McGovern voted ``no.'' Mr. Hastings from Florida voted ``no.'' Mr. Welch voted ``no.'' Mr. Arcuri voted ``no.'' Ms. Slaughter voted ``no.'' Ms. Matsui voted ``no.'' They voted against even considering, even considering financial responsibility. So I rise to oppose this rule. 
   This new majority has promised a fair and open process; but, Madam Speaker, I am here to tell you that what we are living in now is the land of Orwellian democracy. Because they just say something, they think it is so. Once again, this majority has blocked a vote on applying pay-as-you-go principles to new spending. 
   We have wonderful comments from leadership on the other side. Speaker Pelosi has said, on a previous rule, when the Republicans were in charge, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voices silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' And I support that sentiment. ``Because this is a restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote `no.' '' 
   Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said on a rule that came before the House, ``Mr. Speaker, once again this House majority is resorting to heavy-handed tactics that are designed to do one thing only, to achieve a pre-ordained result by shutting down a full and fair debate in this House.'' And that is precisely what the majority party is doing now. 
   The new Chair of the Rules Committee said, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under an open rule, not just appropriations bills. An open process should be the norm, not the exception.'' 
   Democrat Caucus Chair Rahm Emanuel said, ``Let us have an up or down vote. Don't be scared. Don't hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it on the table. Let us have a vote.'' 
   So I ask my friends on the majority side, what are you afraid of? The amendment said: ``Which would require any new spending authorized by this legislation to have a specific offset.'' 
   What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? That is real financial responsibility. 
   My good friend from Massachusetts said that they were waiting on a CBO scoring. Well, then the bill does require funding. In fact, what the CBO has said, that it has a price tag of nearly $1.3 billion. Maybe money well spent, but I would suggest, Madam Speaker, that it is money that we ought to find in our current budget. 
   So this hypocrisy of the majority party is stifling, absolutely stifling. They are not the most open and fair Congress in history; in fact, they are a far cry from it. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule based on fiscal responsibility and based on the hypocrisy of the majority party claiming to provide open rules, claiming to provide real and honest debate and running away from it once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker so much for the opportunity to come and address the House once again. 
   Once again I want to thank the Republican leadership for the opportunity to bring another edition of the Official Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad is a group of folks on the Republican side who got together and were interested in trying to bring about some correction to the disinformation and the misinformation that so often happens here in Washington. 
   Listening to my friends on the other side of the aisle for the past couple of minutes, I feel like I am in Alice in Wonderland. They have gone through the looking glass and it is difficult to tell what is real and what is not. 
   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that I believe we have entered a new phase of democracy in our Nation. And I call it Orwellian democracy. What it means is that the majority party, whatever the majority party says is accomplished,  regardless of the actions that they take. And it is so true when you think about the issues that have been brought to the floor this evening. And I want to touch on a few of those before I talk about this incredibly important issue that we have as has been brought to the floor earlier in terms of discussion with the supplemental Iraq resolution to fund and make certain that our troops, our men and women who are defending our liberty, have the appropriate resources that they need. 
   But my friends on the other side of the aisle talked about the wonderful issues that they have brought and passed on this floor of the House so far this year. They didn't mention that virtually none of them have gotten through the Senate, which is another issue all together. 
   But they talk about these grand issues, and the statement was made that we ``gave Republicans the vote they wanted all along,'' which is just terribly amusing, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, because what has come to the floor to be voted on in this House of Representatives this session so far have been bills that have had very little input, by and large, from the minority party, very little input, frankly, from the vast majority of the Members of the House. 
   And so the Official Truth Squad, the role of the Official Truth Squad is to bring light and truth to the issues that we are working with here in the United States Congress. And we have a number of quotes that we enjoy citing. One of my favorite comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was a United States Senator from the State of New York, and a very brilliant man. And he had a saying that he would use from time to time, and it was that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. And I should say, Mr. Speaker, that that quote, the truthfulness of that quote was never more true than right here in the United States Congress because certainly everybody has their own opinion. But if they would look at the facts, if they would look at the facts on behalf of the American people, I tell you, Mr. Speaker, we all would be a whole lot better off. 
   I want to highlight a couple of bills that my friends brought and mentioned as being the wonderful panacea of this new majority, which is taking us in a new direction. That was their slogan over the past campaign. And, Mr. Speaker, they are absolutely right. They are taking us in a new direction. The problem is the direction is backwards. 
   And a couple of the issues that they cite, the 9/11 Commission, they talk about bringing all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations to the floor. In fact, that is not what they did. In fact, they didn't bring the ones that were most important to truly gain control from Congress's standpoint, from an accountability standpoint, over the ability for us to protect our Nation. They left those out. Now, they don't want to talk about those, but they left those out. Mr. Speaker, that is a fact, not an opinion. That is a fact. 
   They talk about the fixing of student loans that they did. And certainly student loans are important, and I have all sorts of young people in my district who are desirous of making certain that they can have the opportunity to gain student loans and have the opportunity to further their education. Extremely important issue. 
   And what the majority party did, at least they would have you believe, is to fix the challenge of providing student loans at a reasonable interest rate. In fact, what they did was bait and switch, for they decrease interest rates for a 6-month period of time, and then it shoots right back up to where it has been. So that is the truth. That is a fact, Mr. Speaker. That is not opinion. That is a fact. All you have got to do is read the bill. 
   And then my favorite bait and switch, my favorite Orwellian phrase, or example of Orwellian democracy that they have is the whole issue of prescription drugs for our seniors. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my previous life, before I came to Congress, I was a physician. I was an orthopedic surgeon, took care of patients for over 20 years. And I knew in my heart of hearts, as my patients knew, that when the Federal Government got involved in the delivery and the minutiae of medicine of taking care of people, it rarely, if ever worked. 
   And so my good friends on the other side of the aisle say that they have solved the problem of the Medicare part D. Well, the problem that they didn't see is that Medicare part D, which has offered our seniors much greater choice and covered the vast majority of seniors with an opportunity to receive the medications that they desire, the problem that they didn't see is that, or that they won't acknowledge is no problem at all, and that is that the program is working. Eighty to 90 percent of seniors in this Nation are pleased with the options and the choices that they have. But, no, that didn't fit their talking points. And so as a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, what they did was pass a bill that would go a long way toward limiting the choices of American seniors to have medications that they so desperately need and deserve. And if you didn't believe me, if you didn't believe those were the facts from my standpoint, Mr. Speaker, all you have got to do is turn on your television, because now we have a number of groups who are advocacy groups and groups who look out for seniors who are now advertising to try to get the message to the majority party that, hey, don't do that. That program is working. Leave that program alone. Don't upset my prescription medication. That is a fact, Mr. Speaker. It is on the television. They are advertising that right now because they understand and appreciate that when government inserts itself into the practice of medicine that the people that lose are the patients. 
   And so I am pleased to be able to have the opportunity to come down here tonight and to work on setting the record straight, providing some facts. 
   I do want to utilize a couple of the quotes that my good friend said a little bit earlier, my good friend from Florida said, this is a ``better emergency supplemental that is coming to the floor.'' 
   What is coming to the floor is a, I hope it is coming to the floor, is a bill that will hopefully provide for the appropriate resources, appropriate monies for our troops to defend our Nation and to continue the incredibly valiant work that they are doing in both Iraq and Afghanistan.     
   Now, the problem that some of our friends on the other side of the aisle have is that they are trying desperately, as valiantly as they can, to make their program make sense. And why, Mr. Speaker, you would ask, are they having trouble having it make sense? Well, the problem that they have is that they really don't believe that the troops and the mission of liberty ought to be supported to the degree that we believe it ought and that it must be in order to maintain our freedom. So they are left with a Nation that desires to support the men and women who are diligently and valiantly defending freedom around the world, left with a Nation that wants to support those individuals, and we are left with a majority party, many of whose Members, including many in the leadership, don't want to do so. 
   And I don't say that lightly, Mr. Speaker. I say that in all seriousness, and I say that because I know, and you know, that the policy that has been proposed by this majority party now as it relates to the incredibly difficult and brave work that is being done in the Middle East on behalf of all Americans by our troops, the program that the majority party is proposing is a program called ``slow bleed.'' Slow bleed. It kind of gives you chills when you think about it, Mr. Speaker, when it is being used in reference to our Nation and our troops. Slow bleed. 
   What does it mean? Well, Mr. Speaker, it means that high-ranking members of the majority party, the Democrat Party, have decided that they are not interested in funding the troops. They are not interested in the mission of victory, of liberty over tyranny. They are not interested in that. What they are interested in is removing the funding. 
   So I quote, Mr. Speaker, a fact. I quote Representative John Murtha in an interview that he gave just 1 month ago when asked about this slow bleed program that they are trying to put in place. He said, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.''  
   Mr. Speaker, that is a little concerning. We have men and women who are putting their lives on the line, who are standing in front of enemies the likes of which we have never seen. And here in the United States House of Representatives, this majority party has a Member who is determining funding for the troops who says, ``They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, what equipment is he referring to? Well, he is referring to protective armor. He is referring to vehicles that have the appropriate protection from IEDs. He is referring to the kind of air superiority, the air power, that is necessary to protect our troops on the ground. As far as I can tell, he is referring to everything that would be used in the normal course and operation of a military activity. 
   And why do I say that? I say that because what they are trying to do, what they are attempting to do, is to truly remove from generals on the ground the ability to defend not only their troops, but to defend liberty and defend freedom. 
   It is a remarkable thing, Mr. Speaker. We are at an incredible crossroads in our country's history, and we have a leadership in place that has a difficult time matching their message with their action, because what they want to do doesn't match what the American people want done, and it is extremely difficult for them. 
   I quote again, Mr. Speaker, from Mr. Murtha when asked, but why don't you just cut off the funding for the war? This was back on March 4. He was asked on a news program, why don't you just cut off funding for the war? That is the honest thing to do, Mr. Speaker. If they want to have the vote about whether or not we ought to continue our involvement, our protection of liberty, and our engagement in this war on terror, you ought to have that vote. Let us have that vote. Let us have that debate. But, Mr. Speaker, they won't do that. They won't do that. 
   Why won't they do that? That is what Mr. Russert asked on NBC's Meet the Press on March 4, 2007. He asked Mr. Murtha, ``But why not cut off funding for the war?'' 
   And what did Mr. Murtha say? ``Well, you don't have the votes to do that. We don't have the votes to do that. You just can't go forth, and the public doesn't want--they don't want that to happen.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the contortions that you see on behalf of the majority party on this issue are because their desire, their zeal to end support for our men and women who are defending liberty and fighting tyranny and fighting terror around the world don't mesh. They don't mesh. 
   There are some who get it right, though, throughout Congress, some members of the majority party who understand and appreciate what their leadership is trying to do. One of those is Senator Joseph Lieberman from Connecticut. Speaker Pelosi was quoted as saying, ``Democrats have proposed a different course of action. Over and over again we have suggested a different plan.'' And Senator Lieberman was very sage when he said, ``Any alternatives that I have heard ultimately don't work. They are all about failing. They are all about withdrawing, and I think allowing Iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the Iraqis, for the Middle East, and for us.'' 
   Slow bleed, Mr. Speaker. Slow bleed. That is a sad and dangerous time when we find our majority party here in the United States House of Representatives supporting a policy that would remove the ability for our troops to do what they must do to defend our liberty. 
   What is our principle on our side of the aisle? What is the Republican principle? Well, the principle is that our troops in combat deserve to be sent the resources and the reinforcements that they need to succeed in their mission in Iraq without strings and without delay. Without strings and without delay. 
   We have, as a matter of fact, a piece of legislation that would do just that. Representative Sam Johnson from Texas, a war hero, truly a war hero, an individual who spent years in a prisoner of war camp in Vietnam, an individual who knows of the challenges that troops face when involved with an enemy that is ferocious, but an individual who understands and appreciates that from this Chamber, from that Congress, you cannot micromanage a war. And when you attempt to do that as a Congress, when you attempt to have 435 Members of Congress who want to all be generals or 100 Members of the United States Senate who want to all be generals or Commanders in Chief, when you have that, it doesn't work. It can't work. It is impossible. 
   So if you want to have the vote, I tell my friends, I ask my friends, I challenge my friends in the majority party, if you want to have the vote on whether or not we ought to simply cut off the funding to support our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, let us have that vote. Let us have that vote. I would be interested in the outcome of that. I doubt we would get 100 votes in support of that. And it wouldn't, because that is not what the American people want. The American people don't want failure, and that is the prescription that the Democrats, the majority party, are giving us. 
   We have a bill, House Resolution 511, introduced by Representative Sam Johnson, as I mentioned, and it is very simple. It states what the principle ought to be when American military forces are in harm's way. And that principle says, as this resolution says, ``Congress will not cut off or restrict funding for units and members of the Armed Forces that the Commander in Chief has deployed in harm's way in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.'' That is it. That is it. 
   Mr. Speaker, the problem with that is that that doesn't fit the bumper-sticker politics of the majority party. That doesn't fit the Orwellian democracy of the majority party. That doesn't fit the hypocritical actions that are being taken by the majority party. And consequently this bill is languishing in committee. 
   There is a discharge petition, which, as you know, Mr. Speaker, is a petition that Members of the House of Representatives can sign to be able to bring legislation out of the committee when it is against the will of the leadership. That discharge petition was begun today. What it allows is Members of the House of Representatives, when there are a majority of them, and that takes 218 Members, when there is a majority of them who sign that, then that bill then comes to the floor of the House for a vote. 
   So I challenge my friends on both sides of the aisle, House Resolution 511, sign the discharge petition. 
   This is principle. This is principle. This is truth. This is the kind of support that our men and women deserve. It is not feigned support. It is not Orwellian support. It doesn't say, yes, I support you, and then pull the rug out from under you. It is not hypocritical support. It doesn't say we want to support you so very, very much, but we are not going to do what it takes. This says it all. It says that we will not cut off or restrict funding for units or members that are deployed in harm's way. Why can't we have a vote on that, Mr. Speaker? What are they afraid of, Mr. Speaker? What are they afraid of? 
   I would suggest they are afraid of the fact that this would pass on the floor of the House of Representatives. This bill would pass. And because it doesn't fit their political agenda, their political agenda, then I doubt that we will see it unless we can get 218 Members of the House of Representatives to sign the discharge petition. 
   So what about this bill that they are going to bring to the floor? What about this supplemental bill that the majority party is planning to bring to the floor this week? Of course, we have been told it would be earlier than this; so they seem to be having some difficulty within their own ranks in garnering support. But what the bill does, as we understand it, is to put in place an inflexible timeline, an inflexible timeline that says that the troops must come home regardless of what is happening on the ground unless the mission is completely accomplished, in essence. Well, Mr. Speaker, as you know, in battle and in war, it is just not possible to have 535 Commanders in Chief. That is not the way our system works, not the way it ought to work, not the way our Founders envisioned it. 
   In fact, it is curious, Mr. Speaker, when the Articles of Confederation were written and our Nation was formed, some of the aspects of those articles didn't work very well; so the  Founders of our great Nation got together in a Constitutional Convention, and they worked on issues to try to make certain that this Federalist system, this United States, could come together and work together. And one of the first things that they did was recognize that in the Articles of Confederation there were no provisions for a Commander in Chief. So one of the easiest things that they were able to do was to get consensus on the fact that the Commander in Chief ought to be one individual, and that that individual ought to be the President of the United States and the executive branch, and that that was the only way to work it because obviously you couldn't have countless Members of the House of Representatives or countless Members of the United States Senate who were functioning as Commanders in Chief. It doesn't work, and they recognized that. 
   So putting in place an inflexible timeline that culminates with a date certain for the withdrawal micromanages our commanders in the field, and it undermines the efforts of our troops on the ground. I believe that. I believe that putting in place the kind of artificial timelines and artificial constraints on our commanders, on our generals, on our troops would be a disaster. It doesn't make any sense. All it does is make political points. And that, Mr. Speaker, isn't fact. Isn't fact. It is just not Republicans who believe that that would be the wrong course. There is a remarkable orchestra of individuals and groups all around the Nation that are standing up now and speaking out against the foolishness of that kind of proposal.     
   I cite for you, Mr. Speaker, the Washington Post. Now, the Washington Post is a wonderful newspaper. It has been around for a long time. But nobody would contend that the Washington Post was a very conservative newspaper or a great friend of conservative thought. Nobody would contend that. 
   But what does the Washington Post say about this plan of the majority, about the Democrat plan? They say, ``It is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself.'' That, Mr. Speaker, was written on March 13, just 1 week ago. ``An attempt to impose detailed management on the war without regard for the war itself.'' 
   What volumes that speaks, when you think about where it is coming from. It is not coming from individuals who would have any political chip, no political reason to embarrass the majority party or to call them out on a policy that may not necessarily be very sound. What that does is demonstrate that they understand and appreciate the consequence of adopting what is supposed to come to this floor this week as the Iraq war supplemental would be devastating for the nation of Iraq, for the Middle East, for the United States, and, yes, for the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about the Iraq Study Group. The Iraq Study Group was the bipartisan group that got together, actually a group that began because Representative Frank Wolf, a Republican in this House, added it to a piece of legislation that was passed almost a year ago. What it said is that we ought to have a bipartisan group get together and work in a non political way to make recommendations to the executive branch and to Congress about how to move forward in Iraq. 
   They came up with a number of recommendations. We hear it all the time from the other side that the Iraq Study Group didn't endorse this or didn't propose this or didn't support that; that they supported a withdrawal of the troops from Iraq; that they didn't support any escalation in the number. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, if you look on page 73 of the Iraq Study Group, Mr. Speaker, that is another fact, if you look on page 73 of the Iraq Study Group report, it, in fact, supports an escalation, a small escalation, of the number of troops in Iraq. What they also did was oppose a date certain for withdrawal. 
   Mr. Speaker, again a fact. I quote from one of the cochairman, former Secretary of State James Baker, who said in testifying before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, ``The Study Group set no timetables and we set no deadlines. We believe that military commanders must have the flexibility to respond to events on the ground.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues here in the House heard that. I hope that they are listening, because what they are saying, what the Iraq Study Group said is exactly what we are saying now, and that is that this supplemental bill that has artificial timetables and artificial deadlines that are capricious and politically motivated, clearly that that kind of action is not appropriate, it wasn't called for by the Iraq Study Group, and would not allow the military commanders to have the flexibility that they need to succeed. 
   How about the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Speaker, again, not a paper in our Nation that has tended to be terribly friendly to conservatives or Republicans. The Los Angeles Times, in an editorial on March 12, when it had reviewed what the majority party was proposing in this supplemental Iraq war resolution to fund the hard, incredibly diligently working men and women who are defending liberty, what did the Los Angeles Times say? Well, Mr. Speaker, the Los Angeles Times called for the bill to be vetoed. Vetoed, Mr. Speaker. Why would they do that? 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate our receiving a message from the Senate. The message from the Senate is that a Senate bill was passed, and we are pleased to see that. We look forward to the time when the Senate will take up some of the legislation that the House majority has passed, that they have been so terribly proud of, and look forward to working in concert on that legislation. 
   But I was talking, Mr. Speaker, about the supplemental war resolution that will come forward, the bill that will provide for appropriate funding of our troops in harm's way, defending liberty and defending us, and the proposal that is coming from the majority party is a proposal that would micromanage the operations of our troops. It is a proposal that has been described as ``slow bleed,'' which is a proposal that means that you will defund, you will remove the funding from the men and women who are working so valiantly to defend us. 
   That is not just an opinion from our side of the aisle. That is an opinion from all over. Many people are recognizing that. The Washington Post, as I mentioned, had an editorial that criticized the majority party for coming forward with it. The Iraq Study Group supports, in fact, a minor, small escalation in the number of troops, and never said, Mr. Speaker, never said that they agreed with artificial timelines. The Los Angeles Times, again, Mr. Speaker, a paper that has not been noted for its friendliness to our side of the aisle, called for the bill to be vetoed. They called for the bill to be vetoed. Why did they do so? They said, ``It is absurd for House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi to try to micromanage the conflict and the evolution of Iraqi society with arbitrary timetables and benchmarks.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is a fact. March 12 of this year, the Los Angeles Times calls the war supplemental ``absurd.'' 
   And what about the National Intelligence Estimate? The National Intelligence Estimate, which was released in January, warned of the dangers of early troop withdrawal. They said that if coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to give credibility to the National Intelligence Estimate. Those are the folks that determine in an objective way, in a non political way, what are the consequences or prospective consequences of actions that this Nation 
   takes. 
   This poster here talks about the consequences of failure. It is important that we talk about the consequences of failure, because many people, not just on our side of the aisle, but many people around this Nation, including the Washington Post, including the Los Angeles Times, have concluded for themselves that the proposal that the majority party has put forward is a bill that will result in defeat or failure in Iraq. So it is important that we look, Mr. Speaker, at the consequences of failure for our Nation. What are the consequences of failure?  
   This is from the National Intelligence Estimate. What they say is that Iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control; that interference by neighboring countries would occur in an open conflict, that means Iran, Syria, other neighboring countries; that massive civilian casualties and population displacement would occur. Massive civilian casualties. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the majority party, the leadership in the majority party, has considered the consequences of that? What would happen? Al Qaeda in Iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside of Iraq, and spiraling violence and political disarray, including Kurdish attempts at autonomy in Kirkuk. 
   Mr. Speaker, clearly, clearly, failure, failure will result in a much worse situation for the people in Iraq, the people in the Middle East; I would suggest much more danger in the Middle East and for our friends in Israel; and, Mr. Speaker, it would result in a much more dangerous situation, I believe, for the United States of America. 
   So, what are they doing? What is the other side doing to try to pass this piece of legislation, this hypocritical piece of legislation, this piece of legislation that they are having such difficulty doing, because, again, what the American people want and what they in their rhetoric, what the majority party in their rhetoric, say are two completely different things. So what are they having to do? 
   Well, they are having to use a lot of what has come to be known in this town, Mr. Speaker, as pork. The original estimate for the bill was about $100 billion. About $100 billion, Mr. Speaker. The other side has now added over $20 billion to the bill. And what are they doing, Mr. Speaker? They are buying votes. They are buying votes. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that an emergency bill, this is an emergency bill to fund our troops, is not the appropriate vehicle for unrelated spending, either foreign or domestic. Our troops ought not be bargaining chips. Our troops ought not be bargaining chips. That is what the majority party is doing. 
   Quoted here in a publication here in Washington earlier this month, it says, ``Democratic leaders see this emerging strategy as a way to encourage their liberal members to vote for the supplemental budget bill.'' This emerging strategy is buying votes, adding all sorts of items to the bill. 
   Curiously, this party, the majority party, ran in their campaign on this wonderful issue of fiscal responsibility, financial responsibility, making certain that everything that came through Congress was paid for. They call it PAYGO, pay-as-you-go; make certain that you have got the resources in place in order to pay for whatever proposal you are moving forward. 
   Well, they have virtually thrown that out the window. We have had a number of amendments on bills that would hold their feet to the fire and make certain that they were accountable on this PAYGO issue, and they have defeated everything that would make them accountable. 
   They are doing the same thing here. They willfully abandoned their pledge of fiscal responsibility. Not long ago they pledged to follow pay-as-you-go budget rules and spending restraints to curb the deficit, and this bill would not be subject to PAYGO. 
   Last year, it is important to appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that House Republicans rejected a $14 billion increase in nonemergency spending that the Senate tried to attach to an emergency troop funding bill; $14 billion was saved for the American taxpayer in a bill that came to the floor of the House from the Senate just last year. Under a different majority we saved $14 billion. The majority party now is going to spend, if they have their way with this bill, at least $21 billion more than has been requested. 
   That is important, Mr. Speaker, because this is an emergency bill, and as such it doesn't come under the normal budgetary rules. So if they are able to spend $21 billion in this piece of legislation, then what happens is that they don't need to spend that $21 billion in the normal course of activity, in the normal budgetary process, so it frees up another $21 billion, and, in fact, Mr. Speaker, what you get is $42 billion of more spending, extra spending. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, our troops deserve the resources that should be in this bill, the finite resources, the resources that the President and the generals and the commanders in the field have requested. They should be able to receive those resources now, not after, not after our friends on the other side of the aisle in the majority party carry out this incredible political charade of voting on a bill that will never become law in its current form because the Senate, the Senate, won't go along. They have, in essence, said so. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are some incredible quotes that I have regarding this issue of micromanaging the war and this issue of loading the bill up with pork. There is a Democratic claim earlier this year, just last week, as a matter of fact, from Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who said, ``There is no micromanaging of the war, period.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, I already have outlined that individuals outside of the Republican Party and the Republican cause have reached the conclusion that, yes, in fact this is micromanagement: Again, the Los Angeles Times editorial where they said it is ``absurd'' that they try to micromanage the war. The Washington Post editorial said, in short, the Democratic proposal to be taken up this week is an attempt to impose detailed management on a war without regard for the war itself. Aggressive oversight is quite different from mandating military steps according to an inflexible timetable. 
   Even some of their own Members have reached the conclusion that this, indeed, is micromanaging the war. Representative DAN BOREN of Oklahoma said just 2 weeks ago, ``It is still micromanaging of the war.''     
   Mr. Speaker, this plan that our friends on the other side of the aisle have truly does a disservice to the discussion, does a disservice to the debate, makes it seem that all votes are for sale here in Washington to Members of the House. Really, it is a cynical ploy. Spending the kind of money they are proposing to spend is not helpful at all. 
   Where are they planning to put some of that money? It is important to look at that. We talk about the Iraq emergency war supplemental, an extra $21 billion. Where would some of that money go? Well, $1.8 billion in crop disaster assistance. It may be appropriate money to be spent, Mr. Speaker, but in an emergency war supplemental, it is absolutely the wrong place. If you will recall, if this House, if this majority party has its way and puts that money there, what it will allow them to do is increase somewhere else spending by $1.8 billion and follow their shadow PAYGO rules. 
   $60 million for salmon fisheries. 
   Mr. Speaker, it truly is a cynical ploy on the part of this majority party if they continue to march down this road of packing this legislation with all sorts of extraneous spending that nobody in their logical, correct, factual, truthful mind could conclude was related to the emergency war supplemental. $60 million for salmon fisheries; $25 million for spinach growers. Spinach growers may indeed need some emergency assistance, but in an emergency war supplemental? I think not. 
   Mr. Speaker, $50 million for asbestos abatement in the Capitol, and it goes on and on and on. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we know, there are very specific guidelines in this bill for our troops, very specific dates about when they must be at a certain place in the accomplishment, in the engagement, in the execution of the challenges that they have before them, very specific. In this bill there is very specific language about the amount of money that is available for the troops and when it would be cut off if in fact those arbitrary timelines and benchmarks were not met. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, I learned this afternoon something very, very interesting, and that is there is a significant amount of money for livestock, American livestock, in this bill. That is real pork, if you will. It may be upwards of billions of dollars, but I can't tell you exactly what it is because in the language of the bill it says that the amount of money that will be available for this livestock provision will be ``such sums as may be necessary.'' Mr. Speaker, that is unlimited. And it struck me as truly ironic and sad that this majority party, this Democrat  leadership, believes we ought to have an unlimited amount of funds for livestock in this Nation and a finite and limited amount of money for our troops in the field. 
   Mr. Speaker, that contrast just speaks volumes. It speaks volumes about the cynicism with which this House is being led, about the hypocrisy by which this bill is being brought to the floor. An unlimited amount of money for livestock in America and finite, limited amounts of money and arbitrary guidelines, arbitrary timelines for our troops in the field. 
   Mr. Speaker, it saddens me. It saddens me to serve in a body where the majority party has a leadership that is that cynical and brings the debate and the items that we discussed here on the floor of the House to a point that is so very, very trite really. So very, very trite. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have only a few minutes left, and I wanted to spend a few moments discussing the larger issue, the larger war on terror. I think it is important we do that because when the American people think about the issue in Iraq and whether or not we ought to be there, and the debate can be had about whether or not we ought to be there, and that is an appropriate debate to have. And I wish we could have an honest and open debate and an honest and open vote on whether or not we ought to be there, a single vote on that; but the majority party has seen not to bring that kind of open and honest debate to the floor of the House of Representatives. 
   But when Americans think about what is going on in the world, they understand and appreciate that however things have been executed or delivered in Iraq, the activity that has gone on on behalf of the American people in Iraq, although they may have problems with that, they understand and appreciate that the bigger picture, the larger war on terror, is a challenge that we must recognize in America and we all must face. It is a challenge and the facing of an enemy the likes of which we have never seen. 
   You don't have to go far to find examples of that, Mr. Speaker. In fact, the best examples I have found are those that come from the self-proclaimed enemies themselves. This is a quote, Mr. Speaker, from Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi, an individual with whom we had as far as I know no concerns before he decided that he wanted to become a mortal enemy of the free world. He acted upon that in a way that has been extremely treacherous. He said, ``We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that is a little chilling, but it is important that we recognize that is the nature of the enemy in this war on terror. The consequences of not engaging and not being certain that we prevail in this war on terror, the consequences of failure in that activity would deliver a death knell to our society. The issue is as large as that. 
   I try to visit schools in my district, the Sixth District of Georgia as often as possible, and I like to talk to young people and get their perspective on their life and what they see in the future. Most of them are very, very hopeful; and I share that hope and optimism for the future of our Nation. But oftentimes when we are talking about government and talking about politics and talking about the issues of the day, I will ask them, especially the middle school students and the high school students, I will ask them: Do you believe the United States will continue to survive forever? And it is an interesting question because it forces one to think, well, what allows us to survive right now? What has been 
   put in place that allows us to survive right now? 
   Most young people when you ask them that question, they have not really ever thought about that. They have not thought about what has brought about the preservation of our Nation, the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world. It is a remarkable question to ask. Most of them have not ever thought about it; but when they do think about it, they understand the gravity of the question. They understand that there are challenges in this world. They understand there are people like Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi out there who want to see the end of our Nation as we know it. That is not our opinion; that is his stated fact. That is what he has said that he wants to do. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the gravity of the challenge that we have facing us is real, and the magnitude of it is remarkable. And the ferocity of the enemy is unlike any we have ever faced. 
   When I get individuals to tell me, well, if you just think about this in the way we fought World War II or previous wars in which we prevailed, then you will appreciate we need to do X, Y and Z. But I would suggest that the enemy that we are up against is not like any enemy we have faced. If you don't believe me, all you have to do is think about the terrorist plot and the attacks that were foiled because of the wonderful intelligence work on the part of Great Britain and the United States and Pakistan last August. And that plot as you will remember was a plot to bring down at least 10 or more civilian airlines carrying enough people who were flying across the Atlantic Ocean to bring them down in a terrorist act so they could kill more people than were killed on 9/11. So they had to have 10 or a dozen planes that they would work in concert to bring down. That plot was foiled. That was a real plot. That was a real plan on the part of our enemy. 
   And that plan itself is chilling enough, Mr. Speaker; but when you realize and appreciate that two of the individuals who were apprehended and had participated in the planning of that and were intent on carrying out that act were a married couple, a mom and a dad with an 8-month-old child, and they were going to use that 8-month-old child's baby food in the airplane to be the vessel for carrying the bomb on board. They were going to kill themselves and their 8-month-old child and bring down a plane and kill as many innocent civilians as they could. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is an enemy whose ferocity we can't even comprehend. That is an enemy who says: We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology. That is an enemy the likes of which we have never seen, and that is an enemy that requires that we in the United States House of Representatives work in concert together, that understand and appreciate the gravity of our time, of this time and make certain that we do all that we can to follow the principles that have allowed us to become the longest-surviving democracy on the face of the Earth. 
   Part of those principles are embodied in the United States Constitution. Part of that United States Constitution that has allowed us to prevail and to have the greatest amount of success and provide the greatest amount of freedom for the greatest number of people ever in the history of mankind, part of those principles stipulate that there is one Commander in Chief, not 535. 
   So if the majority party wants to have a vote about whether or not we want to end the funding for the battle that our Commander in Chief believes we must be engaged in in order to make this next step in the larger war on terror, if the majority party wants to have that vote, then let's have that vote. But to do so as they are planning to do this week, in a cynical and hypocritical way, to load up the bill with so much extraneous spending, tens of billions of dollars in order to buy votes to pass this hypocritical and cynical bill that micromanages this incredibly important endeavor that we are engaged in right now is wrong. It does an injustice and a disservice to not just this body but our entire Nation. 
   I urge my colleagues to encourage leadership on both sides of the aisle to support that open and honest debate. I know on our side we are ready for that debate. We are ready for that debate. I would hope that the Speaker and the Democrat leadership would encourage and support that debate as well.     
   It is an incredible privilege to come to the floor of the House and share these words, Mr. Speaker. I thank my leadership for that opportunity. 
   It is very humbling to serve in the United States House of Representatives, a body in which 10,000 or 11,000 or so individuals have served in the history of our Nation. It is a great responsibility in serving in this body, but the primary responsibility is to make certain that we do all that we can to preserve and protect our Constitution and our Nation.  
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest humbly that the bill that is being proposed by the majority leadership this week on the supplemental emergency war resolution is not a bill that does a service to our Nation and does credit to the work of this House of Representatives. 
   I urge my colleagues to bring forth the bill that will show that, in fact, we do indeed support the troops in harm's way.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (NO CHILD LEFT INSIDE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, environmental education increases awareness and knowledge about environmental issues while providing needed skills to make informed decisions. When utilized appropriately, it enhances critical thinking and problem solving but does so without advocating a particular viewpoint or a course of action. 
   But the bill before the House today is establishing a framework that could become ripe for abuse, with outside factions directing learning in the classroom. It is why Republicans are offering this motion to recommit in order to ensure there is no undue political influence in the classroom while protecting the interest of taxpayers. 
   This motion to recommit is a commonsense package of safeguards aimed at protecting taxpayers' wallets, limiting special interest influence, and taking partisanship out of the classroom. Currently, none of those safeguards are present in this bill. 
   The first safeguard ensures that priority funding goes to local school districts first. Since 1992, more than 50 percent of environmental education grants have gone to nonprofit organizations. American taxpayers are paying for these programs, so it makes sense that their dollars go to local schools and children before third parties. 
   The second safeguard prohibits funding to any organization that lobbies or retains a lobbyist, especially those special interests that routinely advocate against more American-made energy for Americans. It is no coincidence that the same groups and affiliates which are suing to block oil and gas leases are also lobbying and receiving funds for environmental education. 
   And the final safeguard makes certain that information in the classroom is fair and balanced. Its aim is to ensure that classrooms remain free of partisan or political influence and that science, not a political or ideological agenda, is what students are taking away from their learning experiences. 
   In committee I raised the point that certain organizations, textbooks, and curricula have misinformed students by advocating erroneous specific measures to address environmental problems. Even worse, environmental information has been presented with unbalanced or scientifically inaccurate data. 
   On this side of the aisle, Republicans do not want such uneven portrayal. But there is a greater reason for offering this package of reforms: Republicans do not want the very same radical special interests that are directing energy policy in the United States to have the same influence in our classrooms. 
   The high price of gasoline is squeezing family budgets. And this Congress has yet to cast a vote during this energy crisis that truly expands exploration and the production of American-made energy. 
   Republicans have a plan to increase domestic production, provide tax credits to promote clean and reliable sources of energy, and encourage conservation to ease demand for gasoline. But roadblock after roadblock has been erected. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been nearly 50 days since the Speaker and this majority, the majority party, turned off the microphones, turned off the cameras, and turned down the lights and silenced the will of the American people on the House floor. Nearly 50 days since the good folks across the aisle made it abundantly clear that election year special interests are more important than the public interests. 
   Republicans are going to continue to champion for an all-of-the-above energy solution. But this is a moment in which the House can make certain that those who are writing our Nation's anti-energy policies are not directing learning in the classroom as well. 
   Republicans want to hold these programs to the highest standards of quality, accuracy and neutrality. This will only happen if funding is going to schools first, special interests are not shaping the education agenda, and there is a balanced presentation of information. 
   In conclusion, this motion to recommit is a trio of commonsense ideas that keeps children at the forefront while maintaining high standards for science in the classroom. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this forthwith motion to recommit. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (AMERICA'S BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL PARKS QUARTER DOLLAR COIN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue, the national parks quarter bill. We have in  my district the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, which is under the National Park Service, the longest linear park in the Nation, 48-mile linear park, and so I am pleased to support this bill. 
   The concern that I have, however, about the national parks is that, Mr. Speaker, more and more Americans aren't able to get to them, and they aren't able to get to them because of the price of gasoline. And so what we ought to be doing here as the House of Representatives, in addition to recognizing the wonderful work of the National Park Service, is to do all that we can to make certain that the number one issue of Americans across this Nation is addressed. That issue is energy policy and gas prices. So I come to the well today to lend my support to those who are trying to move forward in a positive way as it relates to energy policy for our Nation. 
   We have, Mr. Speaker, as you know, a number of bills that aren't being brought to the floor because the Speaker doesn't want them to come to the floor, is not interested in increasing supply of oil for Americans, American energy for Americans. There are a number of discharge petitions, which is the only avenue that Members of the House have when their bills are bottled up when they can't get to the floor. We have four of them that are available right now. 
   One is the No More Excuses Energy Act that would increase the ability of new refineries to be brought on line in the United States. Mr. Speaker, we haven't had a new refinery built in this Nation in over 30 years, and the problem with that is that we can't get product to the retail market. We cannot increase the supply if you don't have increase in refineries. That is H.R. 3089. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is another one, H.R. 2279, which would expand the refining capacity on closed military installations, one of those that allows for increasing refining capacity on land that is currently not even being used, Federal land that is not being used. And this is important as it relates to national parks, because again, Mr. Speaker, my constituents are having trouble getting to the national parks because of the price of gasoline. And this House is not acting because the leadership, the Speaker and her leadership, are not interested in bringing forward bills that increase supply. 
   Another one is H.R. 5656, which would repeal the ban on acquiring alternative fuels. Mr. Speaker, we were home last week, and one of the things I heard from my constituents as I know folks heard all across this Nation is: You have got to solve the energy problems. You have got to solve the gas price problem. 
   One of the ways to do that is to conserve. Yes, there is no doubt about it. Another way is to increase supply. We have talked a lot about that. Another way in the long run is to make certain that we have got the kind of technology available to provide for alternative fuel. 
   This is a bill, H.R. 5656, that would allow for increasing accessibility to mechanisms to bring alternative fuels on line, diverse sources of fuels like oil shale and tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   I was surprised to learn, Mr. Speaker, as I know you were that the United States has one of the largest resources of oil shale in the world. In the world. So much so that the estimate is that we could get over 2 trillion barrels of oil out of the oil shale, oil sands that is American resource. American resource. 
   Now, 2 trillion is a big number. It has got a lot of zeroes after it. What does it really mean, 2 trillion barrels of oil? Well, just to put it in perspective, Mr. Speaker, the world has used 1 trillion barrels of oil since 1875. Mr. Speaker, the world has used 1 trillion barrels of oil since 1875. We Americans possess, our natural resources, the ability to gain 2 trillion barrels of oil without any influence from a foreign source, without utilizing any foreign source or any foreign technology. We could do that right now if we were able to have this House and Senate act. 
   So this is remarkable, remarkable information. It is important that the Members of the House know this. It is important that all Americans know this. Because we have within our capacity the ability to become not just less reliant on foreign oil but self-sufficient on American oil. American energy for Americans. That is what it is all about. That is what we hear when we go home. 
   So why, Mr. Speaker, why will this House not be allowed to vote on H.R. 5656? Or H.R. 2279? Or H.R. 3089? Or the one that has brought a discharge petition this week H.R. 2208, which is the Coal to Liquid Fuel Act, which would reduce the price of gasoline by encouraging the use of clean coal technology?     
   Mr. Speaker, as you also know, we in the United States possess the world's largest reserves of coal, and technology has changed so drastically over the past 20 to 30 years, that now it is possible in an environmentally sensitive and sound way, and responsible way, to gain natural gas, to gain gasoline from liquid coal, from coal-to-liquid technology, energy for Americans, American energy for Americans. 
   But what is happening here in the House of Representatives when it comes to energy policy? Nothing, Mr. Speaker. Nothing. And so when I went home last week, I know I heard what all of our colleagues did, and that is the House has got to act. The House has got to act. The frustration level of the American people is huge. And it ought to be. Their anger is huge, and it ought to be. 
   I encourage my colleagues to communicate to the Speaker's office, to let the Speaker know that we want to vote on these bills. I don't know how the vote will turn out, but I do know that the constituents of my district and the constituents of districts all across this Nation want to know how their Member will vote on these bills. It is imperative, American energy for Americans. 
   Once again, I want to thank my good friend from Delaware for providing me this time, and getting to the issue of the national parks in a little side way manner, but I think it is important. I think it is important because our constituents, I know, want us to solve the issue of energy so they can visit the national parks, the beautiful national parks all across this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the Speaker. 
   I thank my good friend from Delaware for allowing me to comment on a few of the comments that have been made by the gentlelady from New York and try to set the record straight a little bit. 
   The issue of the 68 million acres of leased land, of Federal land to gain access to oil reserves under Federal land of the United States isn't whether or not all of those have been used, it's whether or not there is any oil underneath them. And the fact of the matter, Mr. Speaker, as you well know is that in much of those areas, there is no oil underneath them, and you don't need to drill in every single acre to confirm there's no oil in adjacent acres. The technology is incredible today. So the fact that all haven't been drilled doesn't mean that the resources that are under those 68 million haven't been utilized, because they have. In fact, Mr. Speaker, 95 percent of the land that ought to be available for leasing has not been leased. 
   My good friend asked what happened on our watch. What happened when the Republicans were in charge. Well, Mr. Speaker, as you know, we passed the vast majority of these and they got held up in the Senate. They got held up because it requires 60 votes to move anything through the Senate. My suspicion though, Mr. Speaker, is that now there aren't 40 individuals who would stop these bills from moving forward, that the holdup is here in the House of Representatives. 
   My good friend from New York talks about all of the bills that have already been passed. Well, Mr. Speaker, the problem with that is that none of them, not one of them deals with increasing supply. They call it a law of supply and demand because it's a law. It's a law. If you increase the supply, you will decrease the cost at the pump. Americans know that. 
   Americans want a vote on supply. Mr. Speaker, give us a vote on supply. American energy for Americans.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the apology of the gentleman from Mississippi. It should be noted that it was an offer from this Member to forego what occurred over the past hour in this House to the gentleman from Mississippi during the process, and that offer was declined. But I appreciate his apology, and I accept his apology.  
   Mr. Chairman, it is indeed a remarkable privilege for each and every one of us to serve in this House of Representatives. This is the greatest deliberative body in the world, and it is the greatest deliberative body in the world because we treat one another with respect during our deliberations. Our deliberative process works because of a level of comity. It is not appropriate to impugn the motives of individuals, nor is it appropriate to call one's personal character into question. 
   My amendment to this bill simply would move us in the direction of financial responsibility, a small direction admittedly, but in the direction of financial responsibility. 
   To correct some historical inaccuracies that have been stated on this floor, during the 1998 floods in the Midwest, the local match that was required by our government was 25 percent. During the 2004 Florida hurricanes, the local match that was required for Federal grants was 10 percent. 
   This amendment would simply state that more resources provided for the local communities from this remarkably generous Nation who have already provided, authorized over $100 billion for recuperation after the remarkable devastation of Hurricane Katrina, that further moneys would not be allowed to be utilized for the local match. That does not preclude this administration or the Secretary of HUD being able to waive that requirement. 
   This amendment is a very small step in the direction of fiscal responsibility, of respecting the hard-earned taxpayer money that is sent to Washington. I would encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that respects that hard work and moves us in the direction of accountability in an area that is desperately requiring that kind of accountability. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, many of us in this Chamber find it absolutely incomprehensible that there are those who believe that the best course of action in the face of a determined enemy is to tell that enemy that we are less than determined. Yet that is exactly what the Iraq supplemental financing bill does. 
   What message do we send our brave military men and women when we won't guarantee them the resources and equipment that they need without including a litany of restrictive and arbitrary timetables? What will our soldiers on the front lines of this war think when they hear that salmon fisheries and spinach growers are being used to buy votes? 
   This Iraq supplemental bill is just one more step in what has become a long list of unprecedented attempts by this majority to accept defeat at any cost. For those of us in Washington, we get to face this moment in the warmth and comfort of our homes and our offices. For so many Americans, they will face this moment in the harsh reality of a war zone. We must not forget what is at stake. Our military will not and the American people will not.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as I begin, I do want to set the record straight a little bit. I think it is important for us to appreciate and for America to appreciate that the comments by Members on the other side, who have stated over and over that there seems to be a resistance by Members on our side of the aisle to helping individuals out after Katrina, simply is not borne out by either the facts or history, and it is not an appropriate reflection of history. 
   The heart of the American people is immense, and we all poured out our hearts and we helped immensely when Katrina occurred. We opened our homes and our communities. In my district in the north side of Atlanta, we opened up shelters and provided great assistance, as I know men and women and boys and girls did all across this Nation. The heart of America is huge. 
   I offer my amendment today in an effort to try to prevent further waste and fraud and abuse of Federal spending on Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts in Louisiana. 
   Mr. Chairman, as a condition of Federal assistance, Federal grants oftentimes require State and local governments to match Federal grants or to provide a portion of matching funds with State or local spending contributions, oftentimes in the range of 10 percent. This is in order to encourage the efficient administration of the assisted activities giving local recipients an incentive for good management. 
   Why do we do this? Mr. Chairman, I would suggest it is analogous to a copay when you go to your doctor. As a former physician, I am familiar with those, and most Americans are familiar with those. When you go to your doctor, you have a bit of a copay. And what that does is provide for you an opportunity to encourage appropriate and proper attention and oversight. It actually increases the responsibility of individuals and it increases the financial soundness of the entire system. This amendment would provide that same type of responsibility.     
   Striking section 103 would prevent the use of Federal CDBG funds, these are Federal funds, these are hard-earned taxpayer dollars, for the local match requirements and maintain much-needed local incentives to maximize Federal assistance. 
   I think it is also important for Americans to appreciate that Congress has already promised over $100 billion, that is with a ``B,'' since Katrina and Rita have occurred. To put that in some context, the Louisiana State budget prior to Katrina was $16 billion. 
   Although we have held over 11 hearings and four briefings and questioned over 137 witnesses, what is needed is increased oversight of that Federal assistance. The underlying bill weakens that ability to provide that oversight. Why, I would ask, would we want to weaken that ability? 
   In fact, a report by Representatives Waxman and Cardoza and Obey and Tanner and Holmes-Norton and Tierney by the Democratic staff on the Committee on Government Reform in August of 2006 itself identified 19 contracts that were offered or that were given during Katrina collectively worth over $8.75 billion that they themselves say have been plagued by waste and fraud and abuse, citing wasteful spending, lack of competition, mismanagement, et cetera. 
   Examples from a GAO audit provided to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in testimony in December of last year stated just as an example nearly $17 million in potentially improper and/or fraudulent rental assistance payments to individuals, nearly $20 million in potentially improper or fraudulent payments went to individuals who are registered for both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, using the same property. Millions of dollars of improper and potentially fraudulent payments went to nonqualified aliens, including foreign students and temporary workers. 
   Why is it, Mr. Chairman, that we would want to lower the threshold of due diligence that should be applied to spending Federal assistance when waste, fraud and abuse has already been so well documented? 
   It is obvious to everyone that better oversight of Federal spending is needed. This amendment would assist in providing that oversight and making certain that local and State individuals would have a greater responsibility, a greater incentive to make certain that the programs and the grants that they receive, those moneys are spent in a responsible way. 
   It is an effort to be better stewards of the American taxpayers' money, and I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments. However, the hyperbole and the emotion brought with it is curious, again in light of the remarkable assistance that the American people have provided out of their own generosity privately and the generosity that this Congress has provided to the tune of greater than $100 billion of assistance to individuals who have suffered from the greatest devastation of Hurricane Katrina. 
   The purpose of this amendment is an attempt to move in albeit a small direction, but a small direction of fiscal responsibility. We hear comments by the Members on the other side all the time about how they want to bring new fiscal responsibility to Congress. Well, Mr. Chairman, in fact, what we have had is a step in the opposite direction ever since they have taken charge. 
   So I would hope that Members would appreciate that this bill, again, is a small step in the direction of financial and fiscal responsibility. It does not preclude the use of previous moneys prior to this bill. If $110 billion is not enough then to provide for allowing individuals to have some local assistance use, I am not certain how much will be. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I again state that this is a small step for fiscal responsibility and encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I find the most recent comment of our good friend on the other side rather amusing, as the President is charged with executing the policies that this Congress puts in place; and heaven forbid, that he or whoever might occupy that office, might have certain priorities that they would want to bring about to, in fact, execute the policies that have been passed by this Congress. 
   But be that as it may, I want to commend my good friend from Texas for bringing this amendment forward. I think that the amendment itself highlights truly the fallacy of the process that we're under. And that is, as my good friend from New Jersey just mentioned, that we fail in this Congress, at least the majority party fails in this Congress to prioritize spending in a way that passes a test that I believe the American people would be proud of or be pleased with. 
   The point isn't, as my good friend from Indiana has stated, the specifics of the project that he identified. That is not the point of the debate that we would rise to engage in. The point is that when is enough enough? When is it that we, as a Federal Government, take hard-earned tax money out of the pocketbooks and the back pockets of Americans and say, okay, that's all we need. 
   Clearly, this new majority has said that we can't get enough. We can't get enough. And consequently, they have adopted, in this past 6 months, a budget that includes the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, the largest tax increase in the history of America. 
   And I have friends at home who say, well, that wouldn't be so bad if, in fact, they were solving real problems. But, Mr. Chairman, as you well know, the challenge of the Federal spending, the challenge of the budgetary process is the automatic programs, the entitlement programs, the mandatory programs, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, which comprise 54, 55 percent of our Federal budget. 
   And the budget that this new majority passed that included the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation did nothing, said nothing about how to reform those programs; how to make certain that Social Security, which is a program that is challenged to be charitable, challenged from a process standpoint, to be able to provide a safety net for those young citizens across our Nation who are in their 20s and 30s.     
   It is a program that will not have those kinds of resources without structural change, and so the majority party passes a budget with the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation and says nothing, it is mute, as it relates to Social Security reform. Mr. Chairman, I don't think that is what the American people sent us to Washington to do. I think they sent us to Washington to solve real problems. 
   As a physician prior to coming to Congress, one of the huge challenges  that we face is the provision of health care and health insurance for our citizens. And, consequently, the other two limbs of the budgetary challenge that we have, Medicare and Medicaid, huge problems, huge challenges from a financial standpoint. They require structural change. However, this majority passed in their budget, again the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, nearly $400 billion, and said nothing, nothing about structural reform to those programs that are imperative for the healthiness of our Nation. 
   So when we talk about our concern regarding spending, it is not necessarily the specifics of a given paragraph within a spending bill. The specifics are the overall amount of money that we are spending as a Federal Government and the fact that we are ignoring, this Congress is ignoring, the true financial challenges that face us as a Nation. 
   So I rise to commend my friend from Texas for offering an amendment that I think brings focus to where the debate ought to be, and that is to challenge each and every Member of this body and each and every Member of the Senate to make certain that before we end our time here this fiscal year, to make certain that the budget for fiscal year 2008 is as responsible as it can be, that we address appropriately those huge financial challenges that we have as a Nation and be much more responsible with taxpayer money and make certain that we allow Americans to keep their hard-earned taxpayer money in their back pocket and in their pocketbooks. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was compelled to come down to just comment about some of the information that we've heard from the other side regarding issues not necessarily related to this amendment, because they broadened the debate significantly to talk about the deficit. And Mr. Chairman, as you well know, the deficit has been decreasing significantly for reasons that I would like to touch on a little bit. 
   They also talked about the issue of the work that they had accomplished, that this majority had accomplished. And they talk about decreasing gas prices. Well, in fact, what their gas bill did, Mr. Chairman, as you recall is to increase taxes on United States oil companies. Sounds good maybe in some districts, I don't know; mine is not terribly interested in anybody paying more taxes. But they increased taxes on United States oil companies. Now that bill sits in the Senate, thank goodness, because hopefully the Senate will be able to resolve it and correct it so that the actual policy of this Congress on gas prices will indeed be to bring them down. It takes greater responsibility to do that. 
   If in fact that were to become law, then what we would do under the direction of this majority party is to decrease the ability for American oil companies to produce American oil, and we would increase our reliance and our dependency on foreign oil; not the greatest energy plan, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest. 
   They also talked about assisting kids' education, college education. We have that as a goal, certainly. We think it's appropriate to provide for greater resources for American citizens to attend higher education. What does their bill do, though, Mr. Chairman? Again, it sits in the Senate, so hopefully we will have the Senate correct that. 
   But what their bill does is to ratchet down very gradually the interest rate that students pay on loans to go to college and keeps them at half their current rate for 6 months, Mr. Chairman, and then, boom, right back up to where they were. Well, Mr. Chairman, that isn't leadership either. 
   Now, this chart right here, Mr. Chairman, talks about the increasing Federal revenue. But this red line here could be jobs, it could be increasing Federal revenue, it could be economic development. And there was a remarkable thing that occurred in 2003 that made it so that that line goes up appropriately. Thank goodness, the American people say. Appropriately, Federal revenues increase, economic development increases, jobs increase. And what happened in 2003 was the culmination of appropriate tax reductions for the American people. And what does this majority want to do? It wants to take that line back down. Because what they've done is passed a budget that reverses every single tax reduction, appropriate tax reduction, for the American people. Mr. Chairman, that is not the kind of leadership, I don't think, the American people deserve, nor is it the type of leadership that they desire. 
   So, when we broaden this debate, it's appropriate, because the American people, Mr. Chairman, the American people are watching, and what they see is a majority party that is terribly interested in making certain that the American people are taxed to a greater degree so that they ostensibly have more money to be able to spend on their pet programs. 
   My good friend says that it's only folks who make hundreds of millions of dollars who will have their taxes go up. Well, Mr. Chairman, that is not the case, as you well know. Taxes will increase for virtually every single American. Anybody who pays taxes now, under this new majority if they get their way, will have increased taxes. That's not the kind of leadership I believe the American people voted for in November, it is not the kind of leadership that we would provide, it is not the kind of leadership that the American people deserve. 
   So, I am pleased that my good friends on the other side have broadened the debate because it results in the opportunity to bring into focus greater clarity to these budget bills, greater clarity to these appropriations bills, and makes certain that the American people are paying attention to the kind of leadership that this new majority is offering, or the lack of leadership they're offering.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I was compelled to come and talk just a little bit about this amendment, which I commend my friend from Texas for offering, because I've been surprised at the rapidity with which the new majority has regained their old stripes that they lost 12-plus years ago. 
   We were sitting in committee the other day and marking or finishing the prospects of a bill that we're passing out of the Education Committee, and it turns out that there was more estimated revenue that came into the Federal Government and was eligible for appropriation by the committee. And so the majority party, within very short order, stated that they had found hundreds of millions of new dollars and they were offering an amendment to recognize that, in fact, they had found hundreds of millions of new dollars; and then, within seconds, appropriated or authorized the spending of the hundreds of millions of new dollars. 
   So I was somewhat bemused by that and made the comment at the time that I was pleased that they had found the hundreds of millions of new dollars; I was somewhat surprised that they had spent it so rapidly. 
   And so I would draw your attention, Mr. Chairman, to the fact that an issue, a process by which the Federal Government has been utilizing to save hundreds of millions of dollars and, yes, billions of dollars, as stated by the gentleman from Texas, that of providing for competitive bidding, is an appropriate process. It's an appropriate process for our Federal Government to use. It's a responsible process so that we may spend hard-earned taxpayer dollars wisely. And so I'm distressed that this bill would include a section that would preclude competitive bidding. 
   As everyone knows and understands kind of inherently, there are many, many things that the private sector can do much more reasonably and responsibly and efficiently and without significant expenditure of resources than can the public sector. And so it just makes no sense to me, and certainly no sense to my constituents back in the Sixth District of Georgia, that we would adopt a new measure that would provide that we ought not have competitive bidding. 
   But I think it points out a significant distinction, a difference between the two parties. The minority party believes that it's appropriate to have competitive bidding, that it's appropriate to utilize the full robust nature of the private sector whenever possible, in some instances it's not possible, but whenever possible in order to save hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   The majority party apparently believes, given that this is included in the bill, that that's not an appropriate concern of the Federal Government, that we ought not be looking for all efficiencies possible, and I think that's an appropriate distinction to draw. 
   I think it's a conclusion that, obviously, Mr. Chairman, the American people will draw given this provision in the bill. It's a distinction that I would suggest the American people weren't aware of when they went to the polls last November. It's a distinction I do believe, however, they will be paying attention to as future elections arise. 
   But I just want to commend my friend from Texas for this remarkably commonsense amendment, for appropriately reviewing the legislation and identifying those areas where, in fact, savings could occur; and part of our responsibility certainly is providing money for the necessary activities of the Federal Government, but it's also part of our responsibility to be as prudent as we can with hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   I also want to commend my other friend from Texas, who was here just before me, talking about the importance of providing the distinction in the majority party already passing a budget that has the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation.     
   That, again, is evidence of their return to the previous stripes that they had 12-plus years ago. 
   I am pleased to join my colleague from Texas in this commonsense, wise, fiscally prudent, and fiscally responsible amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the Chair, and I thank the leadership for the opportunity to bring this amendment forward. 
   This amendment is a very simple amendment. It's an amendment that has come to be known as the Hefley amendment, or at least came to be known as the Hefley amendment, a former Member of this body who offered an amendment to decrease appropriations bills by 1 percent in an effort to begin fiscal responsibility. 
   And it's my privilege to bring these amendments to the floor again in an effort to take that first step, take that first step to begin fiscal responsibility in this Chamber. 
   This is a good debate. It's a good debate that we have when we talk about how to spend hard-earned taxpayer money, because, Mr. Chairman, as you know, oftentimes in this Chamber, in fact, we've heard on some of these appropriations bills Members talk about their money, about my money. And it's always important that we remember whose money it is. It's not government money. It's not our money. It's the money of the hardworking American taxpayer. 
   So this amendment is very simple. It simply says that we ought to reduce by 1 percent the amount of money being spent in this particular appropriations bill. And to be clear, that is still a significant increase in spending over last year, but it's an attempt to begin fiscal responsibility. 
   One of the numbers, the numbers are that last year this portion of the appropriations bill spent $47.5 billion. The President requested an increase to $47.9 billion for this next fiscal year, and the committee itself brings forward a bill that will spend $50.7 billion. That's $3.2 billion more than last year. 
   So this amendment would say, well, we ought not spend $50.7 billion. Let's see if we can't get a little fiscal responsibility and instead spend $50.2 billion. 
   Again, it's not as far as many of us think we ought to go in an effort to try to be more responsible with spending the hard-earned American taxpayers' money, but it is a step in the right direction. It is a step along the line of fiscal responsibility. It is a recognition. It would be the beginning of a recognition that this is not Congress's money, that it is the money of the hardworking American taxpayer. 
   On many of these bills we seem to get a few more votes each time. I'm hopeful that at some point this House will make a statement, that this House will make a statement and say, yes, we do believe that, in fact, moving forward under the banner of fiscal responsibility dictates that we respect the hard work of the American taxpayer and, in fact, accept one of these amendments as we move forward. 
   So with that I think it's a commonsense amendment. It's a problem-solving amendment. It's an amendment that speaks to what the American family would do when they have some fiscal challenges, and that is to overall reduce the amount of money that they spend. 
   So, with that, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the chairman. 
   I think this has been a healthy presentation from this side. The muted response from the other side is understandable. 
   When you have instituted in your budget the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation, when you continue to increase the spending at a rate that is greater than inflation, greater than the increase in population for our Nation, then the response, I suspect, ought to be muted. 
   My good friend from Ohio has said he will close, and I look forward to that response. I am reminded, prior to him standing up, though, that a wise individual once said: When you don't have the facts on your side, then you ought to raise your voice, and you ought to raise it very loud. And so I ask my colleagues to pay attention to what is about to come. 
   I do want to recognize what my good friend from Texas said, though, and that was talk about Alice in Wonderland. I have dubbed it Orwellian democracy that we are involved in here. My friend from Massachusetts talks about the railing against the Republicans who spent too much and increased the debt. And so what is the response to that? It is to increase it even further, spend more money. They use the grand line of we are interested in investing in the American family. Well, Mr. Chairman, the American families all across this Nation know that when the majority party, when the Democrats talk about investing, what they mean is to hold on to your wallet because that means that taxes are coming; and the budget indeed includes the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation. 
   This bill, this bill in and of itself, a $3.2 billion increase, 6.7 percent over last year. Why is it that we can't just decrease that by 1 percent? By 1 percent. Is that too much to ask? 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge you, if you have any questions about what kinds of money we are talking about, it is H.R. 3074, you can go on line. You can find this bill on line, and you can go to any line item. And I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, when you do that, that if you take any specific line item and you say to yourself, is it possible that they might be able to get by with 1 percent less, 1 penny out of a dollar, $1 out of every $100? Again, that is what American families all across this Nation do. When they find themselves in a little bit of financial difficulty, when they find that their wallet is a little pinched, what they do is they look at their expenditures and they say, we are going to have to cut back. And that is exactly what we, the American family, want to do is to cut back. 
   That is what this is. This is a sincere and a commonsense attempt to try to begin fiscal responsibility here in the House of Representatives. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I would urge my colleagues to take a clear look at this commonsense amendment. 
   This is an amendment that addresses an area of the bill. The underlying bill itself, this appropriations bill, allows for money to be placed in a slush fund that would be used essentially for political purposes. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this commonsense amendment that would prohibit the FHA from diverting money to help fund a ``housing trust fund.'' This name for this is actually part of the Orwellian democracy that I've talked about extensively with this new majority.     
   Because it really isn't a housing trust fund. It is a fund that is wholly unnecessary and wholly political. 
   This amendment would shield middle-class homeowners from the new majority's desire to fund a new expansion of government-built housing; again, with completely political paybacks. HUD already has a number of programs, a number of programs, Market-to-Market, the American Dream Downpayment Initiative, which are aimed at preserving existing affordable housing and expanding affordable homeownership. 
   The HOME Investment Partnerships Program, also administered by Housing and Urban Development, is the largest Federal block grant to State and local governments. It is dedicated exclusively to creating new affordable housing to low-income households. 
   The new Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is pending funding in this bill derives part of its funding from skimming money, and a lot of it, from FHA mortgage premiums and creates another mechanism which forces the Federal Government into the home-building business and with political nuances to it all. 
   As Assistant Secretary for Housing, Federal Housing Commissioner of the United States, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Mr. Brian Montgomery, pointed out at a recent hearing before the House Committee on Financial Services, FHA receipts are already credited toward HUD appropriations. As a result, any new program, any new program, like this one, takes that revenue at the expense of the previous HUD programs that I mentioned earlier. As Mr. Montgomery testified, we will be ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.'' Now, why would we do this? Well, we would do it, I guess, because the majority party desires to have political direction over that money. 
   Mr. Chairman, is there any doubt that the provisions of the FHA modernization bill will create an incentive for FHA to charge higher premiums than is safe or prudent given that incentive? Pressure to hit certain revenue targets will cause a dramatic departure from today's environment where the FHA is able to work to ensure that low-income and first-time homebuyers are being charged the lowest possible premium. It will be those borrowers who pay the cost of this new housing trust fund, those least able to afford it, and likely those least able to desire any activity that smacks of the political cronyism that this slush fund would bring about. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to take a serious and prudent look at this commonsense amendment. I believe it is something that the entire House should be able to embrace. I hope they will support the amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate those comments. I understand the lack of desire on the part of the appropriators to get into the business of the authorizers, but that is the way the system works here. One committee will authorize, and then the Appropriations Committee comes along and determines whether or not there ought to be money. 
   What this amendment says is that this House ought to say no, we ought not put money into a slush fund, into a housing slush fund that actually takes money away from programs that are demonstrated to have had excellent results, Market-to-Market, the American Dream Downpayment Initiative, the HOME Investment Partnerships Program. 
   This slush fund will take money away from those programs that have been very, very helpful to individuals across this Nation, low-income individuals across this Nation, who are trying to get into a home. What it will do is substitute it with a slush fund that will be used for political purposes. There is no doubt about it. So it doesn't surprise me, I guess, that the majority party would oppose this amendment. 
   But I would ask my colleagues on both sides, Republicans and Democrats, to clearly look at this amendment and appreciate that none of us, none of us, ought be using this kind of money, the kind of money that allows low-income Americans to get into their home and have the American dream, realize the American dream, but to do so with political slush fund money. It just isn't appropriate. It is just not right. 
   So I urge my colleagues to take a serious look at this amendment and support the amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, Americans are demanding action on an issue of paramount importance to our national security that is being carelessly ignored by this liberal majority. 
   Nearly 3 weeks, that's how long it's been since Democratic leadership allowed the Protect America Act to expire, removing essential tools from American intelligence officials. 
   Almost 3 weeks, that's how long it's been since Democrats unilaterally disarmed our Nation, leaving us more vulnerable to attack. 
   Americans will not be fooled by Democratic rhetoric that there's no threat or that we're prepared enough, safe enough with pre-9/11 intelligence gathering capabilities. They know we are not adequately prepared. They know we cannot be prepared when Congress, this House, takes crucial tools away from those who are charged with keeping us safe. 
   This careless and irresponsible course of action must not stand. Americans will not stand down and they won't give up until the House does what's right, does what the Senate has already done, and that is to protect the people and the stability of our great Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, vote on the Protect American Act today.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I want to thank the chairman of the committee for his kindness in allowing appropriate amendments within committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I had hoped that this would be an absolutely open rule on the floor of the House, but it seems that this is as open as we get in this Congress, and I appreciate the opportunity to present an amendment or two on this important bill. This is an important debate that we are having. 
   If you look at the backdrop for it, it is important to appreciate the history of what is happening in many of our business sectors in this Nation. Seventy-five percent of the IPOs in the world are not in the United States. There is a reason for that. The number of public companies converting to private increases daily, and there is a reason for that. The number of U.S. companies looking to move offshore is increasing, and there is a reason for that. 
   As it relates to this issue in 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted sweeping changes to the rules regarding disclosure of compensation paid to executive officers and directors of public companies. This amendment, my amendment, amendment No. 9, simply states that the disclosures of executive compensation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006 provide a complete and adequate mechanism for shareholder approval. 
   SEC rules approved last summer direct companies to publish a table showing executives' total compensation, designed to bring better disclosure to shareholders. Companies must also detail stock option grants. The centerpiece of it was a single pay number, a single pay number meant to replace a jumble of charts and tables that appear now in proxy statements sent annually to investors. The single number will combine salary and bonuses and perks and other compensation awarded in a given year, with details for each component provided in a summary composition table. 
   Publicly traded corporations compete for the trust of investors, and these votes that have been proposed in the underlying bill can already be arranged for today if the corporations feel they are warranted as illustrated by AFLAC's recent nonbinding shareholder vote on executive compensation. 
   Now, if investors become displeased with a board of directors, then they have several choices available to them. They can seek to elect different board members. They can sell their stock and shift their investments to other companies whose corporate governance and decisions are more to their liking, or they can ask the government to expand regulation. 
   Regrettably, it is this last option that we are faced with today. Further, regulation from Congress is rarely the answer, and it certainly is not now. 
   I would ask my colleagues to seriously consider this amendment. My amendment is a vote for transparency. It is a vote for disclosure over increased government expansion and regulation. A vote against this amendment will increase the incentives for companies to go from public to private and to move from onshore to offshore. 
   I will close by saying this. Most Americans have a general sense that some CEOs have levels of pension that are greater than warranted by merit. They know that there must be a correction. They also know well that Washington should not be the author of that correction. 
   I urge adoption of my amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding; I appreciate that. And I appreciate my good friend from Oregon being so transparent in his truth as he made a very interesting argument for more regulation and the fixing of CEO salaries. Which is remarkable, Mr. Speaker. The mischaracterization of this amendment is extremely curious. 
   The chairman of the committee says this amendment is superfluous, it is not necessary. Well, it is absolutely vital. And the reason it is vital is because it is important for us to say that we believe it is appropriate, the action that has been taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission as it relates to CEO compensation and the disclosure requirements. That is important, because it is important for us as a Congress to say we condone and appreciate the work that the administration, the executive branch is doing in this area. It is also important because it draws attention to the issue and says to the American people, educates them to what is now available to them as shareholders. 
   My good friend from Oregon says that this isn't mandatory. Well, it is mandatory. The bill states it is mandatory. There isn't any way out of it. It is Congress inserting itself into the functioning in very specific ways of corporations. And, Mr. Chairman, I don't know about your constituents, but my constituents know that that is the last place they want Congress, I promise you that. 
   My good friend from Oregon states that the vote is fixed, it is not really a vote. Well, if he truly believes that, then why on Earth would he support the underlying bill? If the vote is already fixed, why support the underlying bill? It doesn't make any sense. 
   So I would also just highlight for Congress and for anyone who is a shareholder that the opportunity for these kinds of votes already exists within the structure of corporate governance right now, within the structure of shareholder rights, as was demonstrated by a good company from Georgia, AFLAC, who went ahead and already has these nonbinding shareholder votes. But there is a difference between having individuals in the private sector, shareholders and individuals outside of the mandating of government to have it occur and have government come in with its heavy hand and say, this is exactly what you need to do because we know best. 
   Mr. Chairman, in my district I believe that my constituents know better how to act and how to relate to corporations than Washington. And I appreciate the gentleman's time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from Florida for his amendment. I do think that it focuses the attention of this issue where it ought to be. 
   But I want to address a couple of remarkable misstatements from my friends on the other side. They have said, the gentleman from Oregon said that, I don't want to allow a shareholder vote. 
   Well, I mean, that is absolutely ridiculous. I am all in favor of a shareholder vote if it is done without the mandate from Washington. That is the distinction that we have here, Mr. Chairman. We have a party that is desirous of increasing regulation and increasing the mandate from government. And we have defenders of a system that allows individuals to act in concert in the way that they best deem appropriate. That is the difference. It is a fundamental philosophical difference. 
   They believe that mandates from Washington are the solution to this and virtually every other problem. Well, I simply don't believe that. I simply don't believe that, and I know that my constituents don't believe that. 
   It is also clear from the comments made by my good friend from Oregon that class warfare is alive and well. And that is also something that I think does a disservice to this body, and does a disservice to our Nation, does a disservice to the discussion. 
   To my good friend, the chairman, he was somewhat astounded by the fact that the gentleman from Illinois and I could think differently, and I appreciate that because the lock-step group on the other side is in full swing. And I understand that. That is all right. But we have an opportunity to think on this side of the aisle. And we have an opportunity to reach conclusions. They may be the same conclusions, they may be different conclusions, but we have an opportunity to think on this side of the aisle. And for that I am appreciative. 
   What I am only asking for in this bill and in the amendment that I am supporting is to provide the opportunity for the American people to think and to act for themselves without the mandate, without the dictates from the Federal Government. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the gentleman from Florida.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I think that this amendment gets to what the consequences of this underlying bill are. Now, we have heard some contradictory information from the proponents of this bill. Some say it doesn't mean anything. Some say it is very important and that the consequences are remarkable. 
   I would suggest that, frankly, we don't know what mandating to companies and to publicly traded companies in this Nation, what this bill will do. I don't think that we, as Congress, know. I think the consequences may be remarkable and significant. 
   I do know that it would be helpful and appropriate for all of us to have that information, to have the information about what the unintended consequences of this might be. So this amendment is an amendment to address that. It would ensure that this legislation will not compromise fair competition and a level playing field for publicly traded companies. The amendment would require the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, to conduct a study to determine whether a separate nonbinding vote, what the bill mandates, whether or not that would hinder a publicly traded company's ability to compete for the best available candidates for its officers and directors. 
   It would make sense that it would be helpful for us and for the Nation to know whether or not that would be a consequence. If, in fact, the SEC finds that the rules would hamper the company's ability to compete for the best candidates, then the nonbinding shareholder vote will not be required. 
   For every publicly traded company, there are thousands of privately held firms. Large privately held corporations compete with publicly traded corporations for the same talent pool of CEOs and, presumably, pay the same compensation levels. Responsibility, our responsibility dictates that we don't add yet another reason for companies to list on foreign exchanges or otherwise be discouraged from becoming publicly traded. 
   So this is a very simple amendment, provides for a study that would determine the consequences in terms of whether or not publicly traded companies would be able to attract the best talent. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it's a privilege to come to the well of the House and address this body. It's Tuesday, about 16 minutes to 1 o'clock, and the House is back in session for another week. 
   Today, we are going to be taking up some interesting resolutions. H.R. 1002 expresses support for the designation of April 2008 as Public Radio Recognition Month. We are going to take up House Resolution 1029, which congratulates and recognizes Chi-Chi Rodriguez for his continued success on and off the golf course. We are going to rename a post office in Cleveland, Ohio. We are going to rename another post office in Rancho Mirage, California, and we are going to recognize or have a bill that recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day. That's what is on tap for the House of Representatives today, Mr. Speaker. 
   What aren't we going to do? 
   Well, we aren't going to do what my constituents in the Sixth District of Georgia want us to do and what Americans all across this Nation want us to do, and that is to deal with the issue of gas prices, of rising gas prices. For another week, we're not going to deal with that because the leadership in this House, the Democrat leadership in this House, will not allow the bills to come to the floor that will increase American energy for Americans. 
   The average gas price in this Nation today, Mr. Speaker, is $4.08 a gallon. In California, it's $4.60 a gallon. In Connecticut, it's $4.38 a gallon. Now, facts are stubborn things, Mr. Speaker, but there are some laws of economics that are driving all of this. 
   Part of it, not all of it, is supply and demand, and there are some other facts that are important for all of us to appreciate. The United States expanded its dependence on foreign members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries--that's OPEC, Mr. Speaker--by a full 7 percent in 2007 alone. That means we increased our dependence on foreign oil. The United States is the only developed Nation in the world that forbids, that forbids, Mr. Speaker, safe energy production in its Outer Continental Shelf. That's deep sea exploration. We are the only developed Nation in the world to do this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the Chair, and I thank the leadership for the opportunity to present this amendment. 
   This amendment is very simple. It transfers $50 million from the 1990 BRAC account and puts $22 million into the Veterans Health Administration and Medical Services account. The proposal for the 1990 BRAC account is $50 million above the Department of Defense request. As has been talked about with the previous amendment, it is nigh impossible to be spending more than the request. 
   The money that is in the request is used for environmental cleanup associated with previous BRAC-based closings, and my amendment would make the 1990 BRAC account reflect the Defense Department request and place $22 million of these funds in health care for our veterans. The amendment as scored by CBO is outlay neutral which is the reason for the difference in the figures. 
   While cleaning up after base closings is indeed important, the unrequested money, as has been mentioned, would be very difficult to spend and would be better spent, I believe, by providing better health care for our returning service men and women. 
   The conflict we are in has left many soldiers with lifelong injuries, and veterans are acquiring lasting health care. As a physician, I am well aware of the fact that traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder are the signature conditions from our current conflict. As we are learning more about traumatic brain injury and PTSD, we find that more and more of our soldiers are suffering from these injuries. 
   I believe it is imperative that we ensure that as much funding as possible  is available to go for important veterans health care. I believe this amendment to be a fiscally responsible amendment that ensures that our veterans are taken care of in the finest possible manner. I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's comments, and I applaud the work he has done to increase funding for veterans health care, sincerely. I don't recall, specifically, requests to the committee; but I am certainly on record in multiple areas across this Congress in urging increased funding for health care. As a physician, I appreciate the need for increased funding for health care across all areas of our budget. 
   My understanding regarding this provision in the bill is that the $50 million increase over the DOD request is, as I understood it, money that would not be able to be spent in fiscal year 2008. Consequently, that was the reason we requested or proposed in this amendment that the money come from that. So removing $50 million from there, based on outlays by CBO, would stipulate that $22 million was available; and it is my respected request to my colleagues that we place that money for veterans health care for the obvious benefits to all. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I look forward again to a spirit of debate today on an issue that's of the highest importance, I believe, to the American people. 
   Before we get into the substance of the amendment, I thought it might be appropriate to review a few items of discussion as we closed last evening. We had some good friends on the other side who talked about all of this being ``a waste of time.'' Well, Mr. Chairman, I am here to tell you that my colleagues and I believe that any time that we can fight on behalf of the American people for transparency and for accountability and, yes, for democracy, that that is not a waste of time. 
   We heard last evening that our discussion points on this appropriations bill, which spends billions of hard-earned taxpayer money, that it was long on process and short on policy. Well, Mr. Chairman, our policy regarding the earmark issue, which has now grabbed the attention of the entire Nation, our policy was complete transparency and an opportunity not just to be informed about earmarks, but to have an up or down vote, an up or down vote and the opportunity to vote on each individual special project. That is an apparent novel thought to our new majority, and we would encourage them to visit the rule that we had in place prior to the change in leadership. 
   We also heard last evening that we weren't hearing any facts by the minority party. Well, Mr. Chairman, the fact is that their earmark policy, the majority party's earmark policy is simply a slush fund to spend money as they or one individual may deem fit. 
   As we revisit this second-order amendment, I think it's important for the American people to appreciate and for our colleagues to appreciate that what this amendment would do would be to decrease spending by the majority party by about $8.5 million. Mr. Chairman, that's $8.5 million in savings to the American people. 
   Now, I know to some here in Washington that may seem like a paltry sum, but $8.5 million is a lot of money. It's a lot of money, and it's appropriate for us to be discussing how that money ought be spent. 
   The chairman of the subcommittee said yesterday what we needed was a reality check about this amount of money that was in the bill. He said that the majority party consulted with the Office of Executive Counsel, and this is exactly the amount of money that they said they needed. Well, Mr. Chairman, we consulted some folks, too. We consulted the American taxpayer. The American taxpayer said that we are spending too much money, and that they want greater oversight on the amount of money that this Congress spends of their hard-earned tax money. 
   Mr. Chairman, this new majority ran on a policy of openness and honesty and candor, and I would suggest that this is hardly a process that could be considered as embracing openness or honesty or candor. If we examine the process that's proposed by the majority party, it would allow appropriations bills to have a line in them. Every appropriations bill would have a line in it, it would say ``trust us, just trust us.'' Any Member that then wanted a special project or an earmark would write a request to the Appropriations Chair, the Appropriations Chair would then decide if that project had merit, not the House, the Appropriations Chair, and then we would be informed. No opportunity to identify that particular project, projects would simply be disclosed. We would be given information. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, this issue isn't about disclosure. It's not just about knowing what's in the bill. It is about having the opportunity, as our constituents would desire, for us to debate the issue, for us to debate each of those special projects, for us to deliberate on them. It would be an opportunity for us to follow the rules of the House. It would be an opportunity for transparency, and a much greater opportunity for accountability. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, this is about ideology, yes, about who ought to be better able to spend the hard-earned taxpayers' money, whether it's Washington or whether it's our constituents. And it's about a slush fund that we are beginning to get a sense is recurring in bill after bill, and in these appropriations bills, a slush fund in every bill that would allow the majority party to determine where those special projects would be funded. 
   So what's the solution? What's the solution? We had a long debate yesterday, a long discussion yesterday. And I think it is important that we put on the table the solution that would be most appropriate, and that is, I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, a moratorium. Let's have a moratorium on all earmarks. Let's make it so that we do what the American people, what our constituents would desire, which is to get together and solve this challenge that we have. It's not a Republican challenge or a Democrat challenge, it's an American challenge: How do we most wisely and most responsibly spend the American taxpayer money? 
   I would support a moratorium. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment as we learn and work to responsibly spend taxpayer money.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is indeed a great privilege and honor to come back to the floor of the House and present some alternative views, some views that I hope are more grounded in truth as this is another edition of the Official Truth Squad. We've heard some interesting comments over the last hour and over the last few days and weeks and months. So, Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honor to be designated by our leadership to come and share some words with this Chamber. 
   I would first comment about the relative tone and the divisiveness of the language that we have just heard. It just astounds me that people think who come to Washington that our constituents want us to be divisive. When I go home, what I hear from folks is that they want us to work together, that they want us to work together positively for solutions. So the class warfare debate that we have just experienced over the last hour is truly remarkable, as one Member talked about the spirit of Lincoln, a proud Republican, and what he brought to our Nation. A government of the people, by the people, and for the people is what he championed. He also championed an end to class warfare. So I would encourage my colleagues to read further in history and to expand their vision of what it is that their constituents truly want. And as I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, my constituents, our constituents, I think, want us to work together. 
   This is the Official Truth Squad. This is a group of folks who come to the floor and have an opportunity to address our colleagues and hopefully  bring, over the course of an hour, a little brighter perspective, a little more upbeat perspective, a little more optimistic perspective, and, hopefully, a little more truthful perspective because so often what happens on the floor of this House during the course of our debates is that the truth tends to be swept away. And, again, that frustrates our constituents. It frustrates my constituents, I know, when they ask why we can't stick to the facts, stick to reason as we try to solve the significant challenges that confront us as a Nation. 
   I have a number of favorite quotes. One of them is this one from the late United States Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He said, famously, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.'' Another one of my favorite quotes is ``Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.'' So I was so pleased when I heard either the Speaker or the majority leader say just this in a debate recently, and I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to heed this. Everyone's entitled to their own opinion, and you ought to state so, and that's appropriate. But you're not entitled to your own facts. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, we're going to share a few facts with our colleagues, and I am going to start by bringing a couple of quotes from a true American institution. Certainly the ``Tonight Show'' is an American institution. The current host of the ``Tonight Show,'' Jay Leno, oftentimes crystallizes in just a very humorous way what the American people are thinking. So I thought it would be appropriate to share with our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, what Jay Leno has said over the past couple of days. This is about the state of Congress right now. As you know, Mr. Speaker, the numbers for Congress aren't great right now. I would again encourage my colleagues to try to use the sense of what the American people are saying as a positive impetus to have us move forward together in a commonsense, positive, upbeat, principled way that reflects the will of our Nation. 
   But Jay Leno said the other day, ``And our new Democratic Congress, remember, they promised longer workweeks. Well, now they announced they're going to a 4-day workweek. I guess they realized they don't need a full 5 days to do nothing.'' It was alluding to the fact that really not much has gotten done in these first 10 months of this 110th Congress under the new leadership. And it hasn't for a variety of reasons. We will talk a little bit about that tonight. But I would suggest most clearly, Mr. Speaker, that it hasn't because this new majority seems to be unwilling to work together on behalf of the American people. SCHIP is a classic example, and our colleagues mentioned that, and we will talk a little bit about that tonight. 
   Jay Leno also said just 2 days ago, ``The Democrats in Congress have announced they will now be taking Fridays off. Apparently they were getting worried their approval rating was getting too high.'' As I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, the approval rating for Congress is not great. 
   And that troubles me. It should trouble all of us. It troubles me because I think that what the American people are seeing when they look here to Washington, when they look to the Speaker and to the leaders that are running this Congress, they see an institution and they see a group of leaders who are not willing to work with each other. And for those of us who are less than senior Members, certainly in the minority party at this time, it is very distressing because we came here, all of us came here, to solve problems. I oftentimes encourage my colleagues to go back and read their first piece of campaign literature in their first campaign because I think, Mr. Speaker, that speaks to the goals and the vision and the dreams that we all had when we came to Congress. 
   But as you know, Mr. Speaker, a recent Zogby poll found that for the second month in a row, this Democrat-led Congress's approval rating was 11 percent. Now, why is that? Well, I think if you look at the bills that have been passed through this Congress and signed into law, there have been 107 of them so far, Mr. Speaker, 107 bills. Now, you might think that that would be a grand accomplishment, and I suspect that it is on one measure. This new majority touted the fact that they have had over a thousand votes. What they didn't say is that the vast majority of those were procedural votes. They were determining how the bills ought to move forward, oftentimes in significantly noninclusive ways. But 107 bills have gone through the House and the Senate and signed into law by the President. So I thought it would be helpful to kind of break down those 107 bills. What were they? Were they wonderful solutions, as have been proposed, to children's health insurance? Were they wonderful solutions to health system reform? As a physician myself, I believe so strongly that we need significant, positive, patient-centered health system reform.     
   Was that one of the bills that was signed? Was controlling the crisis that we have in the area of illegal immigration, was that one of the bills? Well, regretfully, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, it wasn't. 
   In fact, of 107 bills signed into law, 47 of those bills named post offices, courthouses or roads. Now, those are important things to do, and certainly when we name and honor individuals with the naming of a post office or a courthouse or a road, that's an important thing to do, but it ought not be something that the majority party brings forward and champions as a grand accomplishment. I haven't looked at what the votes were on those 47 bills, but I suspect that, by and large, they were unanimous. I will just take a wild guess, Mr. Speaker; I suspect that the vast majority of those were unanimous. 
   So, 47 of the 107 bills signed into law were naming post offices or roads or courthouses. Forty-four of the bills were noncontroversial measures that were either sponsored by Republicans or they passed overwhelmingly. And those are the kind of routine things that you've just got to do to keep the trains running on time here. 
   So, 47 naming post offices or other buildings; 44 were noncontroversial. Fourteen of the remaining 16 were to extend preexisting laws or laws that had been passed during the Republican-led Congress. Now, that means that there were only two left out of that whole 107 bills that were signed into law. In fact, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that these were the two most important bills. One of them was the extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and we'll talk a little bit about that. But to keep our Nation safe, one of them was that bill. That passed. But as I note, Mr. Speaker, that passed over the objection of the leadership of the Democrat Party. 
   So, one of the most important things we've done, in fact, probably one of the two most important things that we've done, passed over the objection of the leadership of the Democrat Party, the majority party. The other bill that passed was the supplemental to provide appropriate resources for our troops. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, not an opinion, but a fact is that we have, yes, we have, indeed, had over 1,000 votes. And the majority party is very proud of that, and maybe they should be. But when you look at the number of bills that have passed Congress, 107, 47 of those were to name post offices or buildings, 44 were noncontroversial, 14 were to continue previous law, and two, the two most important, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the appropriate resources for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, passed over the objection and the vote of the majority leadership, the majority of the majority leadership. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I'm not sure that's something to champion, but I will tell you that I believe that's part of the reason that the American people say, ``What's going on? What's going on up there in Washington? Can you all please work together on behalf of the American people?'' which is what I believe and my colleagues, I know, believe we ought to do. In fact, many of those things would be very, very humorous if they weren't so doggone serious. We are in challenging times, Mr. Speaker, and I would suggest and encourage my colleagues, frankly, on both sides of the aisle to put positive issues out there and work together as we move forward. 
   One of the bills that we heard from our good friends on was the SCHIP bill, the State Children's Health Insurance  Program, and I will be joined by a number of colleagues tonight to talk about that. I would just like to say that as a physician who practiced in the northern side of Atlanta for over 20 years taking care of kids, I take personal offense to anybody who says that those of us who have not supported so far the State Children's Health Insurance reauthorization bill don't care about kids. Clearly, we care about kids. I spent my entire professional life caring for kids. 
   The other side says, well, 81 percent of the American people want SCHIP. Well, they do when you ask them the question, do you support the State Children's Health Insurance Program? And I ask that of my folks when I go home and have meetings and talk to Rotary Clubs and other kinds of groups. And I have asked them over the past 2 or 3 months, do you support renewing the State Children's Health Insurance Program? And sure enough, the vast majority of the people raise their hand, and as well they should. And I ask them to keep their hand up. And then I said, now, would you support that bill if you knew that poor kids were not going to be taken care of before kids in wealthier families? Put your hand down if you wouldn't support that bill if you knew that kids from higher income families would get insurance paid for by the taxpayer before lower income kids. And about one-third or so of the hands come down; still a number of hands up there. And I say that because that's what is in the bill that the majority party passed and that was vetoed by the President, and then we sustained that veto. 
   And then I say, well, now, would you support that State Children's Health Insurance Program if you knew that it also covered childless adults? And a number of other hands come down. And I don't make that up. I ask that question because that's in the bill. Now we've got about one-half or maybe one-third of the folks still raising their hand saying they would support the bill. I say, now, would you support the bill if you knew that 2 million kids would be forced from private personal health insurance onto public, State-run, government-run bureaucratic medicine? And you get almost all of them coming down at that point. They've kind of gotten the clue that in the fine print in the bill, it's not what they've been led to believe. 
   And then I ask them, well, would you support the bill if you knew that in order to make the funding work, you would have to have 22 million new smokers in America because it's paid for by tobacco tax, would you support it now? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, I don't have to tell you the results of this unscientific poll. But the fact of the matter is, not an opinion, but the fact of the matter is when I get through outlining what was in the bill, there isn't a hand left. There isn't a hand still raised that said they would support that bill. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, that's why the numbers have come down. In the length of time that the majority party has been demagoguing this issue and trumpeting out their radio ads and their television ads across this Nation, what has happened is that the American people have recognized that the story that they were being told by this majority party, the Democrat leadership, was, in fact, not the truth. It may have been an opinion; it certainly wasn't the truth. 
   And so now what we see is 55, 60, 60-plus percent of the American people saying yes, we want to help poor kids, absolutely, that's appropriate. And we'll talk tonight about how we should do that, a positive message, an upbeat message, an optimistic message, a message that says, yes, Americans are generous, we know that, and they believe that, in fact, there is a better way, there is a better way to do business here in Washington, hopefully to raise those numbers. There is also a better way to fashion a bill that would provide health insurance for low-income kids. 
   So I am pleased to be joined tonight by a couple of 
   colleagues, my good friend from New Jersey, who certainly knows fiscal issues as well as the issue of State Children's Health Insurance Program. I look forward to your comments this evening and yield to my good friend Mr. Garrett.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate your perspective on it and your comments because they ring true. Those are the absolute facts, Mr. Speaker. 
   And to put a few more numbers on that, at 300 percent of the poverty level, which is about $62,000, $63,000 of income for a family of four, 79 percent of those families already have health insurance. The children have health insurance. And this bill that the President vetoed and the veto that we sustained, this bill would have made it so that those children would have been essentially forced, because the employers would say, well, why should I insure these kids if the government is going to do it, those kids would be forced into government-run medicine.     
   At 300 percent of the poverty level, at 62, $63,000, folks who live in families with incomes at that level or below comprise 53 percent of the kids in this Nation, 53 percent of the kids, which means that over half of the kids would be eligible for State-run, government-run bureaucratic health care. And as a physician, I know that whenever the government got involved in the decisions I was trying to make on behalf of my patients, it was even more difficult. 
   I am pleased to welcome my good friend and physician colleague from Georgia, who understands those issues as well with governmental intervention into the practice of medicine. I appreciate you joining us tonight and look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I try to bring posters, because when I look at something like this it really drives the issue home and brings it much more clear to me. But this is what you have mentioned that is so true, and the bill that was passed, as you said, would require 22 million new smokers, new smokers, that means from 2010 to 2017, 22 new Americans would have to start smoking. This is the number of folks that would have to begin smoking just in order to pay for the program.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so much. I appreciate my physician colleague pointing out again the number of new smokers needed to pay for it. And the last time I remember, it has been a while since I have been in medical practice, but we used to try to get folks to quit smoking, that is what we tried to get them to do, instead of beginning to smoke to pay for it. 
   This chart really describes it very, very well, talking about the bait and switch of the funding. In addition to having a tobacco tax pay for it, which is really counterproductive because we want folks to quit smoking, not start smoking, but in addition to that, what happens at 5 years, this is 2008 program, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, when you get out to this fifth year, what happens in the majority party's bill, the Democrats' bill? The funding drops way off, which means that they weren't sincere about this in the very beginning. 
   It really isn't about cost. It is about control, about who is going to control health care. Is it going to be patients, individuals, families and doctors? Or is it going to be government? It really is about something as basic as that, a basic question. 
   I'm so pleased to be joined tonight by my good friend from Florida who has a district that is probably as sensitive to health care as any in this Nation, GINNY BROWN-WAITE. I appreciate so much your joining us and I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so much, Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite. We appreciate your perspective. What a moving story about the beginning of the program where you were on the front lines at the beginning. I know of nobody in this Congress who has greater compassion for kids than you. I sincerely appreciate your coming down, sharing that story and trying to bring some truth. That is what we are trying to do, trying to bring some truth and some light to this issue. 
   When folks at home ask me what the alternative is, because there are alternatives, there are wonderful, positive alternatives, a number of other Members of Congress have introduced bills. I, along with over 60 folks in Congress, have introduced a bill that we call More Children More Choices Act. It would be a bill that would in fact reauthorize SCHIP, State Children's Health Insurance Program, up to 200 percent of the poverty level, that is $42,000 for a family of four. For those kids between $42,000 and $62,000 and their family, we would provide premium assistance, premium support, make it so that all kids can, indeed, get health insurance. But most of those kids would then be able to have health insurance provided in a personal and private way so that their doctors and their families were making health care decisions, not the government.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so much. I appreciate your joining us and providing that perspective. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, there are all sorts of alternatives. The alternative we put forward was H.R. 3888. I encourage my colleagues to look at it.     
   It's a bill that would reauthorize SCHIP. It would make certain that we had premium assistance or support for  those folks in low to middle-income families so that they could make certain that they could own their own personal private health insurance and be able to make health care decisions, with families and doctors being the ones in charge, not State or Federal Government. It would allow States greater flexibility to provide health insurance for their uninsured population. 
   So I would encourage my colleagues to look at that. I think it is the kind of bill that folks across this Nation I think are clamoring for because it allows us to work together in a positive way and do something that benefits our constituents, does something that benefits the vast majority of Americans. One of the things that benefits the vast majority of Americans is not to have the Federal Government reach into their pockets and destroy their economic well-being. 
   This Federal Government, under the new leadership here, has shown a penchant for increasing the desire to have this government involved in all sorts of personal decisions, and probably the most personal of decisions is what to do with one's money. When you think about it, tax issues, taxes are, in actuality, the government, either the local or the State or the Federal Government coming into peoples' lives and saying, We know how to spend your money better than you do. We know so well how to spend your money better than you do that we are going to take it from you, because you certainly don't know exactly what you ought to be doing with your money. 
   This new majority, this new majority has passed all sorts of tax bills, almost at every turn. As we have talked about, Mr. Speaker, they have passed a $392.5 billion tax increase in their budget; $50 billion in new energy taxes; $35 billion in new tobacco taxes; $7.5 billion in new taxes on a farm bill. Hold on to your wallet when you go to the gas tank; a 55 cents per gallon increase in gas taxes for infrastructure and global warming studies; new taxes on homeowners by ending mortgage deductions. 
   Mr. Speaker, that isn't all, because Congressman Rangel, chairman of the Ways and Means, you have got to honor him for his candor, because what he says is he is coming with the mother of all tax hikes, the mother of all tax increases, and, Mr. Speaker, this is a $3.5 trillion proposal for a tax increase over the next 10 years, the largest individual tax increase in American history, $3.5 trillion. Mr. Speaker, that is with a T. Only in Washington can we talk in those kind of numbers. 
   It is very concerting to me, I know to my constituents, and it's concerting to my colleagues who have joined me tonight to talk about the issue of taxes, the issue of money and Washington's appetite for money. 
   I am pleased to welcome my good friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from California for outlining what truly is a frightening issue for many Americans. Many folks, especially in the middle class, there has been talk about a war on the middle class. I tell you, Mr. Speaker, the war on the middle class is being fully engaged by this majority party when you think about a $3.5 trillion tax increase. 
   Congressman Rangel, again, you have to honor him and commend him for his candor and his honesty. He says, well, look, 90 million Americans will have a tax decrease with his proposal. What that means, Mr. Speaker, is that over 200 million Americans will have their taxes increased. That is where this $3.5 trillion comes from. It comes from anybody who is paying taxes currently to any degree will have their taxes increased. My friend from California outlined so many different ways that we are taxed and taxed and taxed by folks who think they know how to spend our money better. I believe I know that most folks on our side of the aisle believe that individuals know how to spend that money better. I recognize my good friend from Ohio, who believes that sincerely and has great knowledge and acumen about the issue of taxes and financial issues, my good friend, Mr. Jordan from Ohio.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thanks so very much for joining us tonight, and for really shedding the truth on issues as they relate to taxes. You are so right about the spending. 
   That is what we have seen in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, is bill after bill after bill with more spending and more spending and more spending. And it will drive, it has to drive, increased taxes. So what we have seen is a proposal from not just a back-bencher, not just somebody who took some wild hair and decided that they were going to propose a tax increase; the proposal comes from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, the tax writing committee. And in fact the Speaker in her first comments about it said she supported it. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Halloween, you talk about something that is frightening. As my friend from California said, that is frightening, to have the Speaker and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee supporting a $3.5 trillion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, on individuals. 
   My good friend from California, I am pleased to yield.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for those comments, but the truth sometimes is painful. And it is important as leaders in this Nation  that we bring the truth to our constituents. And the truth of the tax bill that has been proposed is on this chart right here, Mr. Speaker. This describes the time from 2007 through 2050 and the amount of money that would be raised, the amount of taxes that would be raised by the Democrats is this orange line right here, this top line, and it continues to go up and up and up. 
   And the reason it is important to appreciate it going up is this ordinate here, the Y axis, has the percent of GDP. That is the entire economy of the United States. And once you get above about 18, 19, 20 at the outside, the economy tends to plummet. You can't run the economy in an aggressive and appropriate way to provide jobs for people when you get above 20 percent. 
   And the majority's party plan, the plan proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and supported by the Speaker of the House in her first comments, what that plan does is move us upwards of 24 percent of gross domestic product. Mr. Speaker, that is a frightening prospect. That is not the kind of leadership, I believe, that the American people bargained for last November. The kind of leadership that they wanted, that they desired, were individuals to work together for solutions. 
   And the yellow line down here, Mr. Speaker, is a solution. It is called the Taxpayer Choice Act. It is uplifting, optimistic, enthusiastic support of the American people. It says, Mr. and Mrs. American, you know what to do with your money more than we do; and we believe that so strongly, we are not going to increase taxes on you. If you work harder, you will be able to keep more money. You will be able to appreciate the fruits of your labor. Isn't that what America is all about, Mr. Speaker? To be able to reward hard work and reward success and reward entrepreneurship and reward vision? That is what America is all about. That is what my constituents tell me when I go home. 
   So my constituents are concerned, which is why the numbers for Congress are so very, very low. An 11 percent approval rate of the United States Congress by the American people. Again, that troubles me. This is a wonderful, fine institution. It works best when people work together positively for their constituents. 
   So I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I challenge them to embrace them in the SCHIP arena, embrace a positive bill which provides reauthorization for the bill but ensures that moms and dads and families and kids can be able to make health care decisions with their doctor without the intervention of the Federal or State government. 
   As a physician, I know oh so well how the intervention of the State and Federal Government into the practice of medicine destroys the ability to take care of people. It makes it so you can't provide quality health care for children and moms and dads. 
   There are alternatives to that. H.R. 3888, the More Children More Choices Act. More kids being insured, the same number of kids proposed by the other side, but more choices. More personal ownership and more ability to control one's future. 
   In the area of taxes, Mr. Speaker, the alternative is clear. It is allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. It is what we have done for the last 6 years. It has resulted in the largest economic boom we have seen in a number of decades. In fact, it has resulted in the largest economic boom that we have seen since taxes were decreased before in the sixties and the eighties under President Kennedy and President Reagan. And what we saw under them was increasing revenues to the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is an incredible privilege to come to this floor and present ideas and speak on behalf on our constituents in a positive and optimistic and enthusiastic way. I encourage my colleagues to embrace the kind of optimism and enthusiasm we have for America. And if this majority party would do just that, I promise you that the ratings for this Congress would increase. I look forward to joining my colleagues in that positive and upbeat way.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from California for offering this amendment. I think that at the beginning of this first appropriations bill of the 110th Congress, which I might add is 1 month after the first appropriation bill that we, when we were in the majority last year, that we moved through the House. So the time is without a doubt getting late, but I commend the majority for finally bringing this to the floor. 
   But I want to commend the gentleman from California because this is the type of amendment that sets the tone about what kind of responsibility we will bring to this House for all of our appropriations processes over the next number of weeks.     
   I want to commend the gentleman for this amendment. I appreciate the fact that he has identified an area where, yes, it's only $10 million, but $10 million in my area is a fair amount of money. So I want to commend the gentleman for bringing the amendment to the floor. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman pointing out the increase by 7.5 percent. Again, I would like to just draw the House's attention to the fact that this may just be $9.5 million, but as I mentioned, $9.5 million is a fair amount of money. 
   I appreciate also the gentleman coming to the floor earlier and talking about broadening this debate. He talked about what he called the war deficit. He brought minimum wage into this debate, brought spending into this debate. That's a wonderful thing. Because, yes, that's what we're talking about. We are talking about spending hard-earned taxpayer money. So no amount of money is too small to discuss and to bring light to. 
   I would implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to, yes, look at the expansive nature of these appropriations bills, to look at the increase in the amount of money that this majority plans on spending over past Congresses. 
   I also would ask my colleagues to look at the process. Because the debate has been expanded, I think it's an appropriate time to talk about the issue regarding earmarks, special projects. We have now a policy apparently in this House of Representatives, that allows the majority party or, actually, one Member of the majority party, to determine when he decides which earmark, which special project, warrants support by the entire House or warrants the opportunity to even have a vote on a special project. 
   But can you have a vote on a specific special project? No, no. What we will have, our special projects that are the pet special projects of one individual, brought into a conference report, and no opportunity, no opportunity for any Member of this body to point out that, in fact, that ought to have a particular vote, that we ought to have individuals stand up. 
   I support the amendment of the gentleman from California.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I want to commend the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) for his amendment, drawing attention once again to the amount of spending in this and, I am certain, in other appropriations bills as we go forward. 
   I think it is important for the Chamber and for all of those who might be watching to appreciate that spending is, indeed, the disease that infects Washington. It is the disease that makes it so that Americans all across this Nation no longer trust this Congress to do the right thing when it comes to being good stewards of their hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   In fact, this Congress so far has increased spending, authorization for spending, by over $50 billion already. And instead of being more responsible with the appropriations bills they are bringing forward, in fact we find tens of billions of dollars in more spending. 
   Now, the consequence of that is somehow you have to pay for that. What we have seen by our friends in the majority is adopting a budget that will be, if not the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation, the second largest tax increase, depending on how you do the numbers, but hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know we have good friends who talk about the new direction that they brought to Washington, given the last election. Mr. Chairman, I am here to tell you, that new direction is backwards, and it is backwards to a time of tax and spend that, frankly, the American people don't favor. 
   One of the things the American people do favor, however, is sunshine. And they favor it for all of the activities that we engage in here in Congress, sunshine in the processes that we have, and sunshine in making sure that votes are recorded in committee, sunshine in terms of the debate that goes on. And, yes, Mr. Chairman, sunshine in terms of the money that this Congress spends, which is why it is so distressing that we have a new policy on behalf of the Appropriations Committee and the majority that allows for hidden spending, less transparency, less accountability when it comes to something that the American people care dearly about; and that is earmarks, special projects, or ``pork projects,'' as many people know them by back home.     
   We have been harping on this because it is such a change, such a remarkable change in policy and in procedure here on the House floor and within the House of Representatives. 
   And it's not just our opinion. It's not just our opinion. There are newspapers that have provided their opinion all across this Nation, that have agreed. They have said that the process that's been adopted, which would allow for one individual, one individual in this Chamber, to determine which special projects would be supported and to determine which projects would be included in a conference report, not brought to the floor in the usual appropriations process, not so that my colleagues here can stand up and say, I don't think we ought to be spending hard-earned taxpayer money on that project. In fact, I think I feel so strongly about that that we ought to vote on it, and people ought to be held accountable. 
   It's the kind of vote that when we were in the majority we allowed because it's an appropriate vote to allow, and we even went further in the last Congress and adopted a rule that said if earmarks, if special projects were put in in a conference report, when you only get to vote on the overall bill itself, you can't pick out individual projects. If they were put in that conference report, then a Member of the House on either side of the aisle could raise a point of order and say, we ought not be taking that up because it violates the rules of the House, and had an opportunity to highlight, to bring a specific vote for a specific measure. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, that apparently is no longer the case, from what we hear by Members in the majority party now, and it's not only our opinion that it's the bad way to do the House's business, it's the opinion all across this Nation. 
   The Wisconsin State Journal recently wrote an editorial and said, with this maneuver, it will prevent the public and most lawmakers from questioning earmarks until it's too late. That means you can't do anything about it. 
   St. Louis Post-Dispatch said, But in a slick maneuver, they will keep them hidden from public scrutiny. In a slick maneuver, they will keep them hidden from public scrutiny. 
   Mr. Chairman, that's not the kind of leadership that the American people want. That's not the kind of responsible spending of hard-earned taxpayer money that the people want. That's not what they voted for in November. They didn't vote for more hidden rooms. They didn't vote for less scrutiny. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and to adopt any amendment that decreases spending in this appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to weigh in on this issue, and I commend the gentlewoman from North Carolina for presenting this issue. 
   The hour is getting late, but I think it is extremely helpful and extremely clarifying for those watching to appreciate that there is a distinction between the different folks rising this evening and drawing attention to the amount of spending. 
   The gentleman who is presenting this bill said in all sincerity that this bill wasn't about earmarks and it wasn't about ideology. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would beg to differ. It is all about ideology, and it certainly has a lot to do with earmarks. 
   The ideology we talk about being present in this bill and every other appropriations bill that I have seen that has been filed so far is that there is one side that believes that spending ought to increase to a fare-thee-well. And there is the other side which believes there ought to be responsibility to that spending. 
   We have already seen the majority party, so far this year, increase authorization for spending by over 50 billion new dollars. We have already seen the new majority adopt a budget which has, depending on who you talk to, the largest tax increase, or the second largest tax increase, in the history of our Nation. That tax increase is to pay for the spending. 
   So, yes, Mr. Chairman, it is all about ideology. It is also about earmarks because what we have been presented is a new policy by the majority party that allows for a slush fund, a slush fund for earmarks in virtually any appropriations bill that comes to the floor. 
   So I commend my colleague from Georgia who spoke just before me and offered a solution, an opportunity to bring greater sunshine and greater light to those earmarks. I think that was a well-thought-out proposal. 
   I suspect there are people watching and saying, what is it that we desire? Why is it that we are drawing attention to what we believe to be an egregious rule? Well, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest what we desire is a decrease in irresponsible spending. It is that irresponsible spending that is causing tax bills for Americans to mount up to unacceptable levels. And, consequently, we believe the slush fund for earmarks ought to be done with, ought to go away. The American people ought to know who is spending their hard-earned tax money, and they ought to be able to hold those folks accountable. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that the solution to the dilemma in which we currently find ourselves is to have the chairman of Appropriations or somebody in leadership on the majority side say, we won't do that, we won't bring about any earmarks in a conference committee that aren't agreed to by each and every Member of the House individually. Individually, that's what we proposed. In fact, that is what we enacted in our own bill, in our own rules last session. 
   Mr. Chairman, there is a solution to this. There is an opportunity for us to move onward and make it so the American people are able to have their say, to have each and every one of their Representatives have their say about the kind of spending that is going on here in Washington. 
   And it is not just our side. If you take the words of the Members of the new majority from the not-too-distant past, after the recent election, when the the majority leader said, ``We are going to adopt rules that make the system of legislation transparent so that we don't legislate in the dark of night, and the public and other Members can see what is being done.'' That is a quote. 
   Here is another quote. ``Words will not do it. I have a good relationship with Representative Roy Blunt. I have a good relationship with Representative John Boehner. We'll work together. We'll include them in decision-making. 
   ``To the extent that we create an atmosphere of mutual respect, the American people will feel more comfortable with Congress.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I suspect you know what I know, and that is that the recent data on the respect with which the American people hold this Congress and this majority is at an all-time low. And I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that one of the reasons that it is at an all-time low is because of the kind of policies that are being put into place by this majority that make it so that light cannot shine on the amount of spending that is being done in this Congress. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment. I urge a change to the earmark policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I would say to my colleagues, here we go again with Orwellian democracy, which is alive and here on the floor of the House with the majority party saying one thing and doing another. They promised us a more transparent process, they promised us a process that had greater accountability; and in fact, what we are getting is something completely the opposite. 
   I would note also that we are coming to the floor now with the first appropriations bill which is 1 month later than when we brought our appropriations bills to the floor last year. 
   I am sorry that the Chair of appropriations has left the floor. He made the comment that this would be a more responsible earmark process. He said he would take all of the requests and would add, quote, ``virtually every earmark,'' unquote, would be included in the bill. Well, that is interesting. 
   What that process does is make the Chair of the Appropriations Committee the judge and the jury, the sole judge and the sole jury for every single special project. I would prefer there would be no special projects, but it appears that the Appropriations Chair is going to be the one to determine whether or not your project is worthy. 
   Those that have already been dropped into bills brought before this Congress give us no comfort. There appears to be significant favoritism that is being played, significant politics being played. And the threats that have been given by a Member on the majority side to a Member on the minority side, if he didn't support an earmark, give us no comfort. 
   We will get 30 days to review. Well, that is a wonderful thing, with no opportunity, as the gentleman from Arizona said, to have any vote on any earmark. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is not greater transparency or greater accountability. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee said, Well, if you don't like an earmark, vote against the bill, with no ability to get to a specific egregious program that so angers the American people. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that is Orwellian democracy at its finest, doing one thing and saying exactly the opposite. This ought to be an interesting period of time as we move through the appropriations bills. It ought to be a very interesting time as we move through a process that has turned into a sham. It ought to be a very interesting time; and I assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the American people are, indeed, paying attention.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the Speaker so very much for the opportunity for presenting once again before the House of Representatives. I want to thank my leadership for allowing me to head up and chair this hour that is a Special Order hour. It is an opportunity for us in the minority party to come and try to shed some light on some issues that frankly don't get a whole lot of attention here on the floor of the House of  Representatives, and so I appreciate that opportunity once again. 
   Madam Speaker, most of us go home every weekend and visit our district, talk to constituents. It is a wonderful time to be able to go back and get grounded, go back to that touchstone and those people that supported us as we came to Washington, to try to assist in moving our country in the right direction. 
   And I have been struck over the last couple of months as I go home every weekend and talk to my friends and neighbors and fellow church-goers in my Sixth District of Georgia on the north side of Atlanta, I have been struck by their concern about what appears to be from their standpoint a continuing decrease in the level of civility here in Washington. 
   I am in my second term, initially elected in 2004, and one of the things that I thought I would hopefully be able to have some effect on would be to affect positively the level of rhetoric and the level of discourse here in Washington, and the level of frustration that my constituents tell me they have regarding what's going on here in Washington continues to increase. 
   So one of the things that I and some other Members of our conference have tried to do is to come to the floor, try to do it at least once a week, sometimes we're not able to do that, but talk about issues in a light that is hopefully more positive, hopefully respects the history of our Nation in a way that allows us to kind of glean the role that we ought to play as the House of Representatives and as Congress and to hopefully chart out or to define a path that will continue to allow our children and our grandchildren to live in the finest Nation on the face of the Earth. 
   In so doing, what we have tried to do is to talk about truth, to talk about facts. So often in the world of politics, in fact we have heard it just within the last few moments, Madam Speaker, the issue of politics over policy. So often when folks come to the floor of the House they talk more about politics than they do about policy, and I understand that. People have to get elected and I appreciate that, but when you're talking about things that are so incredibly important to the future of this Nation, it would behoove us as a House of Representatives to endeavor as much as we can to work together and to try to come up with the best solution for our Nation. 
   All of us come from different backgrounds. I happen to come from a profession of medicine. I practiced medicine for over 20 years, and medicine is a little different endeavor than politics and legislating. In taking care of patients what we try to do is try to work together, all for a common goal, which is to get the patient well obviously. So it is a collegial activity. It tends to be an activity where we share information and support one another. 
   Would that were the case on the floor of this House of Representatives, Madam Speaker, because I share my constituents' frustration with much of the partisanship that goes on here and much of the sniping and the politics over policy that makes it so very difficult, very difficult to move our Nation forward. 
   So we have developed a group that we call The Official Truth Squad, and its desire, as I mentioned, is to try to shed some light on issues here before our Nation. We have a number of individuals that we like to point to as heroes over the history of our Nation. Many of our former Presidents were certainly individuals who sought the truth and sought to guide this Nation in a positive and an uplifting direction. 
   One of the individuals that I like to quote is Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Mr. Moynihan was a Senator from the State of New York, and he had marvelous quips and marvelous phrases that he would use. One of them was this one right here. It says, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts.'' Everyone's entitled to their own opinion but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   So I was struck by that, Madam Speaker, just last week as I was working here late in the Capitol one evening, happened to run into a couple who was in the hallway, obviously tourists, and they were stopping at some of the statues here in the Capitol. They were interested in finding where the gallery to the House of Representatives was, and so I pointed them in the right direction and happened to see them up in the gallery. 
   I had some friends from home who were visiting as well, and I got a chance to talk to them in the hallway. This young man was a physician. Come to find out he was a doctor who was serving in our military, and in 2 days or 3 days from last week when I met him, he was on his way to Iraq. He was on his way to try to help our men and women who are standing in harm's way and trying to protect our liberty and our freedom to make certain that they were given the finest care they possibly could be given in a difficult situation. He shared with me his frustration about the lack of not just civility but about the lack of attention to urgent problems. 
   One of the things that we briefly talked about was the responsibility that this Congress has to make certain that our men and women who are defending liberty, defending us, making certain that our children and our grandchildren can live in this great Nation for generations to come, and the frustration that he had with the inability of this Congress to make certain that the resources, the money that's needed to be able to allow our military men and women to protect themselves and to protect us has not been forthcoming, and I shared my frustration with him about that same event. 
   Madam Speaker, tomorrow I believe will be 100 days, 100 days since the President of the United States has sent to Congress his request for money, resources, for our fighting men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq, and if there was anything that demonstrated politics over policy, it has been this last 100 days. Very frustrating, Madam Speaker, frustrating for me, and I know that it is concerning and frustrating for our constituents all across this Nation, because what has happened has been a length of time that was played out to just apparently get headlines, it appeared to be. 
   And then there was a supplemental bill that was brought to the floor of the House, and it had in addition to the money that had been requested to allow our troops to defend themselves, it had in addition to that a peculiar set of directions, benchmarks, timelines, for our men and women and our generals on the ground, so much so that they said, look, there isn't any way that we can accomplish what we need to accomplish if you, Congress, adopt this bill, adopts this piece of legislation. 
   Many individuals on both sides of the aisle said, well, you're absolutely right, that sounds ridiculous. And so then what happened was that in order for the majority party apparently to pass this piece of legislation, they kept adding money on to it. So money in Washington does not start with an M. It starts with a B. So they kept adding billions and billions and billions, over $20 billion, to the bill in order to allow for folks on either side of the aisle who had concerns, enough of them to be able to say, okay, well, I can justify my vote for that bill if I am going to get those kinds of resources. 
   And so that bill passed the House with a very slim margin and passed the Senate, was sent to the President, the President promptly vetoed it. It came back to the House of Representatives and was delayed for another 4 or 5 days by this majority, Madam Speaker. The only reason that anybody can determine was for, again, politics over policy. 
   And just last week, another bill was then adopted which had a peculiar arrangement that would allow for some money to go for a while, and then if the Congress still agreed, within a month or two then there would be more money forthcoming. It was what many of us have called war on the installment plan, which is actually a worse plan than the majority party came up with initially.     
   Now, those are the facts. So that bill is passed, and we are waiting to see what happens from the Senate. 
   But I get back to the point of that young man who shared his frustration and his concern with me about why Congress can't act on things that are so pressing for the security of our Nation and for those men and women who are serving in harm's way. It just, it is very, very concerning to men and  women across this Nation, that we, as a legislative body, the United States House of Representatives, can't put politics aside and work for the good of the Nation and work for the benefit and the security of our men and women who are defending our liberty and defending our freedom. 
   So I just offer that as what I am hearing from home. I suspect it's what many of my colleagues are hearing from home as well. I am hopeful that we will be able to move forward with a clean bill, a bill that provides money for our men and women who are defending liberty and defending themselves in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We have got a number of folks who will be joining us today, I hope. We will talk about a number of issues, the war supplemental, the budget and some other items, I hope. 
   But I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and colleague from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland) and look forward to your comments. I yield to you.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman's perspective on the issue of energy, because it's extremely important, because I hear that at home as well. Folks are frustrated by the level of inactivity by this Congress as it relates to many things, and certainly in the area of gas prices. 
   As you recall, Congressman Westmoreland, and I know you appreciate that what we heard out of this new majority was that their bill, earlier this year, their part of their 6 for '06 plan was going to solve a lot of the problems as it related to energy, and what was that plan? 
   As you will remember, that plan was to increase taxes on American oil companies. Increased taxes on American oil companies was somehow going to be this grand plan that would make it so that those mean and awful oil companies wouldn't be making so much money.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Well, I appreciate that observation as well, because that appears to be what they believe. But we are getting a little ahead of ourselves, because it's important to close the loop on this energy issue. 
   Because what the majority party offered was this remarkable smoke and mirrors that said, as part of their 6 for '06, that if we just passed this bill, if we just increased taxes on the oil company, then what will happen is that they will, by some miraculous determination, lower the price of oil for folks at the pump. 
   Well, as you well know, what increases taxes on American oil companies does is make it so that they are less likely to be able to compete in the world so that our reliance on foreign oil gets greater.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Absolutely, without a doubt. There are some real keys, pivotal keys to the real solution to our energy challenges. One of them is conservation. We can all do more in the area of conservation. We can all probably do more on conservation. Probably the long-term solution is some type of alternative fuel. We have done a lot for that. In fact, most Members of the majority party are on record as opposing rewards for the provision of alternative fuel. 
   But one of the mainstays, especially in the short-term, is to provide American energy for Americans. So, peculiarly, what this majority party did, and it's perplexing, frankly, because it doesn't solve anything, is to pass a bill to increase taxes on American oil companies, again, which makes us less competitive in the world, makes us more reliant on foreign oil, and, frankly, it means that what we do is finance those folks who like us less to a greater degree. That doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate you bringing up the issue of the largest tax increase in American history that was passed by this majority on this floor. And folks at home say, well that can't be true. That just can't be true. We can't allow that to happen. What are they doing? 
   And what they're doing is displayed in this chart right here, as you well know, because all of these tax rates, all of these tax rates, given the budget that has been adopted by this House, will increase to significant levels in relatively short order. Ordinary income going from the top rate of 35 percent to 39.6, capital gains going from 15 percent to 20 percent, dividends going from 15 percent to 39.6 percent, estate tax goes from 0 percent in 2010 to 55 percent. That's the death tax. It goes to 55 percent in 2011. The child tax credit cut in half. And the lowest tax bracket, amazingly enough, goes from 10 to 15 percent, which is a 50 percent increase.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentlelady's perspective on that because it is so true. And when folks think about the ordinary income going up from 35 to 39.6 percent they say, well, that, you know, that's just all those folks who are at the top, all those rich folks. Well, as you mentioned and so clearly stated, that includes all the small businesses, and what that means is jobs for America. And so the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation is what has been passed on the floor of this House. Very frustrating. And when you talk with reasonable folks on the other side of the aisle about this, they say, oh, well, we're not going to do all that. We're going to change some of those numbers. We're going to make it so that the lowest rate isn't 15 percent, it comes back down to 10. 
   But the problem is that their budget has spent all of the money that's to come from all of these tax increases. So if they're not going to get that money from one spot, then they've got to get it from another and raise them even more. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I think that it is clear that this is a real problem that the American people are beginning to appreciate, that the leadership that they thought they were electing in November of 2006 is, in fact, not the leadership that they are getting. Again, politics over appropriate policy. 
   This is a pie chart, Madam Speaker, that demonstrates who's going to be paying all those new taxes. And it talks about the billions, billions and billions of dollars that will be supposedly raised by those. In fact, what will happen is that it will so depress the economy that it is not likely that you'll see those kinds of revenues. In fact, what will happen is that we'll see fewer jobs, fewer amount of revenue to the Federal Government, and a significant change in what is a relatively good economic picture at the current time. 
   I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from California (Mr. McCarthy), KEVIN MCCARTHY, who is a member, of, I believe a member of the Budget Committee, and has been involved in certainly budgetary aspects and budgetary planning at the State level. And we're pleased to have you join us here in Washington this term as a new Member of the House of Representatives and look forward to your comments this evening.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman and the comments that he makes about every single tax that we pay with every single thing we do is so apt because this new majority seems to believe that, well, in everything they do, seem to believe that they have got a better idea. They've got better solutions. They know better than the American people about how they ought to do most anything, and especially how they ought to spend their money. 
   And when I talk to my good friends on the other side of the aisle who appear to be interested in making certain that America sustains this economic vitality that it has, and you ask them, well, how did that vitality come about, and you point to things like this chart demonstrates, which is where job creation was before the appropriate tax reductions and what happened afterward, it's as clear as the nose on your face or the drawing before you. Before tax cuts were put in place, there was a staggering job growth and mostly negative job creation. But something happened in 2003, as you pointed out. Something happened.     
   And it resulted in huge, significant job growth, job increase, across this Nation. Literally 49 of the 50 States have increased employment since 2003. And one would think that if you had the responsibility for determining what the economic policies of this Nation ought to be that you would look at that point and you would say, well, it would help me understand what happened then in order to continue the economic growth that we have seen. And it is clear that this job creation, this job growth, was a direct result of allowing Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. So it is without doubt that we need to continue those policies, in fact, to increase the ability for Americans to keep their own money and, therefore, continue the wonderful growth that we have had. 
   I am pleased to yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's contributing this afternoon and his perspective. 
   And it is so appropriate and so uplifting, frankly, to have Members in the House of Representatives who understand and appreciate the connection between cause and effect, the connection between the actions that we take here and then what happens out in the real world. And it is one of those things, Madam Speaker, that frustrates my constituents and I know it frustrates Americans all across this Nation who are concerned that there are fewer and fewer individuals in this House of Representatives that appreciate that connection. 
   I want to mention just a few more items as it relates to the economy and as it relates to our current situation and, hopefully, what will occur with the policies that are adopted by this House of Representatives and this Congress. 
   This is a chart, Madam Speaker, that demonstrates the unemployment rate. And as you will recall, at the beginning of this decade, the unemployment rate was increasing significantly and got up to almost 6.5 percent in the early part of 2003. If you were to look at this graph and to believe and appreciate that a low unemployment rate means a vibrant economy, that people are working, that people are being able to support their family, that they are able to change jobs, that they are able to move up in the job market, that is what happens when you have a low unemployment rate. And anything below about 5 percent is considered to be an extremely vibrant economy. 
   So something happened in 2003 to result in a steady decline in the unemployment rate over the last 3 or 4 years. And what happened in 2003, again, is that we, Congress, and this administration allowed for Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. Now, when you look at that, it is an important thing to appreciate. It is also important to recognize that cause and effect. 
   But it is also important to look at some other numbers and kind of dig a little deeper into what was the consequence, what happened with the decreases in taxes. 
   As I mentioned, job growth, 88,000 new jobs were gained in just this past April, with nearly 2 million new jobs being created over the last 12 months. Our Nation has added nearly 8 million new jobs since August of 2003. And, Madam Speaker, sometimes those numbers just kind of get lost. You say 8 million new jobs or nearly 8 million new jobs, and it is tough to know whether or not that is good or bad compared to maybe what the rest of the world is creating. What is happening in the rest of the world? 
   Well, Madam Speaker, 7.8 million new jobs since August of 2003, that is more new jobs than all other major industrialized countries combined. That is more than all other major industrialized countries combined. That is  more than England plus France plus Spain plus Italy plus Scandinavia plus Japan plus all other industrialized countries combined. That is phenomenal, Madam Speaker. It would behoove us to delve into why that has happened. 
   Our economy has seen job gains for 44 straight months, and employment has increased in 47 States. I think I should correct myself. I think I said 49 States earlier. It is 47 States within the last year. So the lower unemployment rate that we see, 4.5 percent, among the lowest in the past 6 years. And, Madam Speaker, that rate is lower than the average for the 1960s, for the 1970s, for the 1980s, and for the 1990s. That rate is lower than the average unemployment rate during those periods of time. 
   Economic growth, this economy that has been in transition has shown a sustainable growth path, an increasing path over a period of time. Real GDP growth is up 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year and 2.1 percent over the last four quarters. Household spending, what are moms and dads across this Nation spending? Well, their spending is up 3.8 percent, and it remains strong and really is expected to be that kind of firm foundation upon which we continue this positive economic activity. But it will only continue, Madam Speaker, if we are responsible and set appropriate policies that will allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   By the same token, business investment continues to increase. Capital investment turned up in the first quarter. As my good friend from California mentioned just a moment ago, tax receipts were up. Tax receipts rose 11.8 percent in fiscal year 2006 on top of a 14.6 percent increase in 2005. And so far this year, we have seen growth of 11.5 percent. And that is what is confounding to our good friends on the left who don't seem to appreciate the cause and effect of allowing Americans to keep more of their money. In fact, what they say over and over is, well, the government needs more money in order to X-Y-Z. Even if you believe that all of the things that Washington does are appropriate and even if you believed that there was no waste and that there was no fraud and that there was no abuse that you could squeeze out of the system, even if you believe that, what we see happens when you decrease taxes, when you allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, is that revenue increases. So, Madam Speaker, what we see here on this chart is a chart that demonstrates Federal revenue. That is the amount of money coming into the Federal Government in billions of dollars. And over the first part of this decade, we saw a steady decline in the amount of money coming into the Federal Government. And then once again that magic line, that magic point in time in 2003, when this Congress acted responsibly, along with this administration, and allowed Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, what happened, Madam Speaker, is a remarkable thing, and that is a significant and huge increase in the amount of money coming into the Federal Government. 
   It ought not have been a mystery. Many people predicted it. Many people said that is exactly what would happen, and they knew that because that is what happened throughout history. President Reagan knew it when he decreased taxes on the American people and saw increasing revenue to the Federal Government. President Kennedy knew it when he enacted appropriate decreases in taxes on the American people in the early 1960s, and what we saw as a Nation at that time was an increase in revenue to the Federal Government. 
   So, Madam Speaker, it is important that we look at the cause and effect. What we do here makes a difference in everything. It has consequences for the American people. And so when you have positive activity in our Nation as it relates to the economy, positive job growth, positive numbers coming into the Federal Government, positive business investment, increasing homeownership, low inflation, low unemployment, it behooves us to figure out why that happened. It happened because we allowed more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money, and we ought to continue those policies. 
   Now, one of the great concerns that I have, Madam Speaker, is that I don't sense any amount of willingness on the part of our new majority to continue those appropriate policies. And, frankly, I don't sense a whole lot of willingness on the part of a majority of Congress on both sides of the aisle to do what needs to be done in the area of spending. As my good friend said earlier, we don't have a revenue problem here in Washington; we have a spending problem. And it is clear that that spending problem continues regardless of the party in power. 
   So I am one of those who believes that there needs to be some restraints, some process restraints that ought to be put in place in order to decrease the level of spending appropriately and make certain that we hold people accountable and that we make certain that people are being responsible with the hard-earned money that Americans send to Washington, which is why I support a Federal Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   And I have labeled this chart ``American Values and American Vision'' because, Madam Speaker, I believe that it is an American value to allow individuals to keep the benefits of their labor. I believe that the more we allow individuals to derive the benefits of their labor and their hard work and their entrepreneurship and their ingenuity that what we will do is create more Americans who will strive to do more, who will strive to create more, who will strive to risk more, who will strive to do more in order to succeed. And the more Americans that are willing to do that, I have all the faith in the world that we will continue to be a wonderful and productive and successful Nation. 
   However, if we as a nation decide, no, we as a government know best, that we ought to tell you what to do, that we ought to tell you where to go, we ought to tell you how much you can make, that we ought to tell you when you make too much, what that does is stifle ingenuity and it stifles creativity and it stifles entrepreneurship and it says, no, we don't want you to be successful. We only want you to do this much, not more. We don't want you to truly reach your full potential. We just want you to do this much. We don't want you to dream big dreams because that wouldn't be a decision that we have made. Your dream may be at odds with some decision that Washington makes. 
   Madam Speaker, that is not the America that I know. That is not the American value that I was taught. That is not the American vision that I have and that so many of my colleagues have. 
   So the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that we have introduced in this Congress, Federal Taxpayer Bill of Rights, says a number of things, positively says a number of things. It says that taxpayers across this Nation have a right to a Federal Government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. And what does that mean, Madam Speaker? What that means is that this bill, if enacted, would appropriately reduce the size of government or limit the size in the growth of government to an increase in the population of our Nation plus a cost-of-living adjustment so that the government could rise but no more than the increase in population and the increase in inflation. That is a restraint on the kind of spending that occurs on both sides of the aisle here in Washington. That is the kind of positive solution that I and many people support. 
   We believe in American values and an American vision and a Taxpayer Bill of Rights that says that taxpayers have a right to receive back every dollar they entrust to the government for their retirement.     
   The issue of entitlements, Madam Speaker, we haven't even touched on this afternoon, but it's an important issue. The issue of Social Security is one that is extremely important because it was a program that was put in place a number of decades ago, and it was put in place at a time when there were 15 or 16 workers for every retiree, a wonderful program to have in place to allow for seniors to have some nest egg or some cushion that they could rely on when they retire. It also, curiously, Madam Speaker, as you likely know, was put in place at a time when the average life expectancy in this Nation was less than when the benefits  would begin. That is the kind of program that the Federal Government likes. It means that you don't necessarily get what you put into the program itself. 
   We believe that American taxpayers have the right to receive every dollar back that they put into the Social Security program. We believe that the Social Security trust fund money ought not be spent on anything but Social Security retirement benefits. We believe that is a right that Americans have. We believe that is a responsibility that this Congress has in a positive way to say we will limit the spending of that money to what it was intended for. We believe in American values and American vision, that Federal taxpayers have a right to a balanced budget without raising taxes. 
   There are a number of ways that you can get to balancing the budget. You can get to it by increasing taxes. You can tax businesses and you can tax people, successful people and folks all across this Nation who work for a living. You can tax them and take more of their hard-earned money and for the short term you can balance the budget. Yes, you can. 
   But the way to responsibly balance the budget that embraces American values and that embraces American vision and that allows people to succeed and dream and work hard and have the benefits of their labor, the way to do that responsibly is not to take more of their money. The way to do that responsibly is to decrease spending, is to decrease and restrain the growth of government, and to make it so that the Federal Government does what the Federal Government ought to and ought do only. And that requires, I believe, Madam Speaker, a balanced budget amendment. 
   As I mentioned, folks on both sides of the aisle have difficulty with spending too much of the American taxpayers' hard-earned money. We believe that a balanced budget amendment is imperative. 
   We believe also that Federal taxpayers have a right to fundamental and fair tax reform. My good friend from Tennessee mentioned earlier that on January 1, 2011, 1/1/11, that this new majority is destined for the largest tax increase in the history of this Nation. We believe that that's wrong. We believe that the manner in which this Federal Government gains revenue stifles entrepreneurship, stifles vision, hurts dreams, harms success, says to folks who are working hard out there across this Nation, Don't do that. Don't work hard. That's not what you want to do, because if you do that, we will just take more of your money. That is not the America I dream about and I believe in. So we believe that fundamental and fair tax reform is imperative. 
   And finally, Madam Speaker, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights says that in order to increase taxes in this body, that we must have a supermajority. We must have more than just 50 percent plus one. We must convince a supermajority, a vast number of the individuals who serve in this body from all across this Nation, that a tax increase is absolutely necessary. It is one of the provisions that we had in place for the last 12 years, from 1994 to 2006. It's one of the things that was changed on the very first day of this new Congress, that a supermajority was no longer required. It is one of the reasons, Madam Speaker, why there was no significant tax increase over the last 12 years. One of the reasons, Madam Speaker, that we've seen a significant increase in economic productivity across this Nation over the last 4 years is because of appropriate tax decreases and not allowing increases by just a slim majority. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I am honored to come to the floor this afternoon and to share an American value, American vision that talks about positive things about our Nation and congratulates the men and women around this Nation who are working hard, who are trying to earn for their families and save for their retirement, who are trying to contribute to their own American Dream. 
   I believe that it is an incredible honor to serve in this United States House of Representatives. I believe it is incumbent on every single Member of this House to respect and value the hard work that each and every American performs each and every single day, regardless of the job that they're doing. Every single job has merit and worth and is deserving of our respect. And one of the ways that we ought to respect it is to allow men and women across this Nation to keep more of their hard-earned money and to be responsible with the spending that we perform here at the Federal level. 
   So I am honored to have presented that American vision and that American value to my colleagues today. Madam Speaker, I appreciate that opportunity. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I appreciate his leadership on this. 
   I would rise, Mr. Speaker, to say that all of us obviously support police officers on the street. But there are some legitimate concerns about this bill and others that are brought to the floor. One that I would point out on this bill is that we attempt to find some objective information about the programs that we put in place here at the Federal level. 
   The Office of Management and Budget has a program called Program Assessment Rating Tool which attempts to determine the effectiveness of what we do here on the floor, and their grade for this COPS Program is ``Not performing, results not demonstrated'' in the latest review. 
   That is not to say that we don't support cops on the street, police on the street, but it is important to appreciate that there are some legitimate concerns about the program. 
   Another concern I have is that one of our House rules, XIII section 3(d)(1) says that all committee reports must contain a statement citing the specific powers granted to the Congress in the Constitution to enact the law proposed by the bill or joint resolution. In fact, in this bill being brought to the floor, there is no such statement available from the committee. 
   So I think there are legitimate concerns, Mr. Speaker, and I ask my colleagues to review those.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 249, the bill that we are discussing here, prohibits the commercial sale of wild horses and burros by the Bureau of Land Management. 
   As part of the Bureau of Land Management's program to protect and manage and control wild, free-roaming horses and burros, they are permitted to sell wild horses and burros that are over 10 years of age for commercial purposes for approximately $10 per animal, if the animals have not been successfully adopted in three auctions. If the animals are not adopted and BLM cannot sell the animals, then it will have to provide long-term care for them. 
   Implementing this bill, H.R. 249, will cause the Bureau of Land Management to lose the minimal revenue it is currently able to generate from the sale of the animals and incur additional costs by requiring it to provide long-term care for the animals that they otherwise wouldn't have to, essentially, by mandating a new responsibility. 
   Now, according to the CBO report accompanying this bill, it says, ``Based on information from Bureau of Land Management about the number of animals sold and the cost to care for them, CBO estimates that the resulting net changes in discretionary spending under H.R. 249 would not exceed $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds.'' 
   However, it costs BLM roughly $25 million a year to feed and shelter roughly 30,000 wild horses in its management program. In 2006, 100,000 horses were slaughtered for consumption, which raises concerns that the cost of this legislation could turn out to be much more significant than CBO and the bill's proponents predict. 
   My amendment is very simple. It will apply the principle of pay-as-you-go to any new spending authorized by this legislation. It would require that any new spending as a result of this legislation must have a specific offset before this legislation can take effect. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, as you know, an excerpt of the New Direction For America, which was proposed by the new majority, the House Democrats, in the 109th Congress as their plan once they were to take the majority, reads, ``Our new direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting. No more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' And I agree, Mr. Chairman. 
   On April 18, the majority leader was quoted as saying, ``We want to get the budget deficit under control. We've said that fiscal responsibility was necessary, but we are not going to be hoisted on the torrent of fiscal responsibility.'' That was just prior to the new majority ignoring their own PAYGO rules in order to pass a bill. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I would submit that rules aren't rules if you only follow them when you want to. Democrats promised to use PAYGO rules for everything, and instead they are picking and choosing when to do so. At home, we call that breaking a rule and breaking a promise. 
   So I urge the new majority to rededicate itself to the principle of pay-as-you-go spending. Fiscal responsibility shouldn't be something that is talked about only on the campaign trail. 
   This might not seem like a lot of money to my friends on the other side of the aisle, but Mr. Chairman, the American people deserve for us to be good stewards of their hard-earned money all the time, not just when it's politically convenient. 
   I urge adoption of this quality, commonsense, simple PAYGO amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit offers an effective date for fiscal responsibility. 
   H.R. 249 prohibits the commercial sale of wild horses and burros by the Bureau of Land Management. Implementing this bill will cause the BLM to lose the ability to sell these animals and incur additional costs by requiring it to provide long-term care for the animals that they otherwise would not be required to, thus mandating a new responsibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, according to the CBO report accompanying this bill, it said, based on the information from BLM about the number of animals sold and the cost to care for them, CBO estimates that the resulting net changes in discretionary spending under H.R. 249 would not exceed $500,000 annually, assuming the availability of appropriated funds. 
   However, the Bureau of Land Management spends roughly $25 million a year to feed and shelter 30,000 wild horses in its management program. This motion to recommit will establish an effective date for the legislation, requiring the Secretary to certify to Congress that the long-term care of animals spared by this act will not exceed the cost of $500,000, which is noted in the bill and is the CBO estimate. 
   We all know that the CBO is noted for outrageously poor estimates. The capital gains tax reductions from 2003 to 2006, from 20 to 15 percent, that were enacted, CBO estimated revenue at $197 billion. In fact, Mr. Speaker, $330 billion were gained, an error of 68 percent. This is after the CBO underestimated capital gains revenue following the 1997 decrease by $217 billion. Further, CBO underestimated Federal tax revenue due to the responsible tax decreases that were enacted earlier this decade by $255 billion. Of course, Mr. Speaker, we all know that CBO estimated the Medicare part D premium would cost $38 a month, and in fact, it costs $22 per month, an error of 72 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week in The Hill newspaper, former Congressman Charlie Stenholm appealed to Congress not to pass this legislation for budgetary reasons. Under the new PAYGO regime, Congress should not be perpetuating long-term options when another, less costly, option is available. 
   As of December 2004, 8,400 wild horses and burros became eligible for sale, and as of April 2007, the Bureau of Land Management has sold more than 2,300 horses. If the remaining horses which are available for sale are safe for long-term care, then the Secretary should be required to clarify that the care will not create an undue financial burden on the American people. 
   If the Secretary can certify that this legislation will not exceed $500,000 annually, then this proposal goes forward. If the Secretary cannot certify this requirement, then the legislation should be stopped, and the onus is on Congress to revisit the proposal and find new money. 
   I urge the new majority to rededicate themselves to the principle of fiscal responsibility. Fiscal responsibility should not be something that is just talked about on the campaign trail. This may not seem like a lot of money to my friends on the other side of the aisle, but the American people deserve for us to be good stewards of their hard-earned money all the time, not just when it is politically convenient. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to recommit.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for accepting the amendment. It is a commonsense way to begin this process that lacks a lot of common sense. 
   I wish to commend my colleague from Georgia for beginning the process of fiscal responsibility on this next appropriations bill. I would point out, however, that this bill spends $1.04 billion more than last year, an increase of 5.9 percent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that there aren't many folks across this Nation who got a 5.9 percent increase in their budget this year. So, I think that the amendment of my colleague from Georgia is an appropriate effort to try to begin the process of fiscal responsibility. 
   Mr. Chairman, I stand here supporting this amendment because as we attempt, and thank goodness we have the support of the majority on this small attempt, to begin to decrease bureaucracy, we are faced with a significant and huge increase in bureaucracy coming later this week. 
   I say that because my friend, the chairman of the committee, says, well, our goal here is to not finish the business. No, Mr. Chairman, our goal is to bring focus to an issue and to a bill that will not be allowed to get the focus that this bill gets. Because, as you know, Mr. Chairman, the rules of the House that will bring bills to the floor later this week will be of such a nature that Members of the House won't be able to come to the floor and talk about it. They won't be able to come to the floor and offer amendments in an open and deliberative process.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it's now 1:48 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. Throughout the Nation, folks are finishing the day shift, getting ready to finish the day shift. People who work the afternoon shift are getting ready for work. Those who work the night shift are probably snoozing a little bit so they can get up in a few moments and start it all over again this evening. And where's the House, Mr. Speaker? The House has gone home. The House has gone home. 
   Now, why is that important? Well, we have just finished 2 weeks at home talking to constituents about issues great and small. They're concerned about a lot of things, Mr. Speaker. They're concerned about gas prices. They're concerned about the housing situation. And in my district, the Sixth District of Georgia, I get constant questions about national security: What is Congress doing to make certain that our Nation is safe? And that's important because, Mr. Speaker, today is the 48th day, the 48th day, of a unilateral disarmament on behalf of the Democrat leadership of the House of Representatives. 
   Why do I say that? Well, Mr. Speaker, we are at the 48th day now where the Protect America Act has been allowed to expire. This isn't going to happen in the future. This has happened. This Speaker, this Democrat leadership, has allowed the Protect America Act to expire. 
   Now, what's the Protect America Act? Well, it's an act, a portion of amendments that were adopted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act shortly after 9/11. And what this portion of it allows that was allowed to expire is for the United States, our intelligence community, to listen or intercept electronic communication or phone communication between a foreign individual in a foreign land talking to a foreign individual in a foreign land. Not an American citizen, not on American soil. That means, Mr. Speaker, what they would be allowed to do is to listen to a potential terrorist or a terrorist talking to another potential terrorist or a terrorist outside the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I asked every single group that I spoke with at home for 2 weeks, who believes that our intelligence community ought not have the authority to do that, to listen to a terrorist talking to another terrorist outside the United States, talking potentially about how to do you, me, and our  Nation harm? I didn't find a single individual who didn't think that was the right thing to do. 
   But this leadership, this Speaker, this Democrat leadership has allowed that act to expire. Why? Because they believe that trial lawyers ought to have the ability to represent foreign individuals in the same way that the United States Constitution protects Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's wrong. Many in my district and I believe also that it's a dereliction of duty. It's an abrogation of duty. It's a violation of the oath that we take as Members of the House of Representatives to uphold the Constitution and to protect and defend the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I call on this leadership, I call on this Speaker, to allow this House to vote on the Protect America Act, a bill, amendments that the Senate passed 68-29, in a bipartisan way; a bill that the majority of this House, the majority, Democrats and Republicans combined, have said they will support if allowed to vote on the floor. Mr. Speaker, this is essential to the protection of the United States of America and to reverse the unilateral disarmament that has come about because of the leadership of the majority party. 
   Mr. Speaker, I call on this leadership to bring this bill up as soon as we come back next week and do the people's business.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I hadn't planned on coming down here tonight, but this is a sad and distressing day for this House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I suspect you know, some may not, but there are companies in America that are patriotic and they want to help our Nation fight against those who would do us harm. But amazingly, Mr. Speaker, they feel that they can't. And why? They believe that if they do, they will be sued. That is right, Mr. Speaker. Companies in America believe, and have been given counsel by their attorneys, that if they help the United States Government assist in making our Nation safer, they will be sued. The threat of trial lawyers are preventing our Nation from protecting itself. 
   Outrageous you say? So do I. So do I. 
   If Congress doesn't act this week, this week, critical tools that allow our intelligence officers to monitor terrorist communications overseas will expire. Yesterday, the Senate approved a bipartisan bill, a bipartisan bill by a vote of 68-29, to close the terrorist loophole in our intelligence law. The Senate bill represents a remarkable compromise between Congress and the administration. 
   It rightly restores the original intent of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, by ensuring that intelligence officials can conduct surveillance on foreign targets without a court order while still protecting the civil liberties of the American people. 
   It also grants liability protection to telecommunication companies that helped our government after September 11. Allowing these companies to be subject to frivolous lawsuits threatens their cooperation in the future and would cripple America's counterterrorism efforts. This, unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, appears to be what the House Democrat majority desires. 
   Every American will become exposed to greater threats. Every American: moms, dads, sons, daughters. Every single American is exposed to greater threats because this majority refuses to consider a long-term solution to the problems facing our intelligence community. 
   I haven't read, Mr. Speaker, that terrorists have placed an expiration date on their plots to destroy our way of life. Congress shouldn't put an expiration date on our intelligence community's ability to protect our Nation. 
   This bill expires this week. We must act. Mr. Speaker, elections have consequences, and it appears that the Democrat left majority now in charge is beholden to trial lawyers. I just didn't think that they would put those trial lawyers ahead of national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day. I can only hope that the American people are paying attention.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, what a great opportunity it is to come back to the floor of the House as the designee of the minority leader, the Republican leader, and bring some issues hopefully into a little greater perspective. 
   We come here often and try to shed a little light as a group that we call the Official Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad is a group that got started a little over 2 years ago, because, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, when folks tend to speak on the floor of the House, sometimes they exaggerate a little bit. I know that is hard to believe, but in fact that is the case. In fact, what we just heard, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, is a bit of an exaggeration, and maybe a distortion of the facts. 
   What we would like to do tonight is to talk about a number of issues, primarily monetary issues, taxing and spending and those kinds of things. But before we get started, we want to bring a couple of issues together that have as their common core and their common theme truth. 
   Our desire is to try to bring into perspective some of those areas that oftentimes don't have the light of day given to them, if you will, Mr. Speaker. We have a favorite phrase or quote that we use in the Official Truth Squad, and it comes from a gentleman who was revered in this Capitol, and truly across this Nation, a former Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He is quoted, and a number of folks have said something like this, but he has my favorite quote that crystallizes this issue, and that is that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   Before I begin and talk about some of the fiscal matters, the monetary matters, that we have confronting us in this Nation and that this Congress has already dealt with in ways that I think would benefit from a little light, and certainly issues that we will be dealing with further as we go on into this fall and winter, I want to talk about two very specific issues that have come to this Congress within the last week. 
   The first is something that the American people are well aware of, and that is that General Petraeus, who was the commanding officer of the coalition forces in Iraq, came last week after much fanfare in the media to present to Congress his perspective on what was going on in Iraq, and only in Iraq. Leading up to that, we had a remarkable display by Members of the other side of the aisle, the majority party, that did their best, their dead level best, to discredit this incredible hero and this incredible patriot and this incredible man of service to this Nation. 
   All the while you hear them say over and over and over, ``we support the troops.'' ``We don't like the war, but we support the troops.'' Well, nobody likes the war. But some people back up their statement that they indeed support the troops with action, and the action that occurred leading up to last week's presentation before a joint committee in the House and a committee in the Senate by General Petraeus, a true hero and a true patriot, the action that led up to that by Members of the majority party, the Democrat majority party, I found to be disconcerting. When I was home last week for our extended recess, folks at home found it to be disconcerting. 
   But then what we heard after a remarkable ad was taken out by a left-wing advocacy group that questioned the patriotism and that questioned the honor and that questioned the veracity of what General Petraeus was going to present to the committee, what we heard from the other side after that was remarkable silence, a remarkable silence. 
   So when you hear Members on the other side of the aisle, as we just did within the last 15 minutes, say, Mr. Speaker, I support the troops, but I don't support the mission, well, it is clear, Mr. Speaker, that you can't do that and be true to our men and women on the ground. You can't do that. Because what we heard after the ad that was put in The New York Times, at a discount rate, I might add, the ad that was put in The New York Times, when it questioned the honesty of one of our bravest heroes, military heroes, what we heard from the other side was virtually nothing, which put it all into perspective. 
   That is the truth that Senator Moynihan was talking about. You can have your opinion, but you can't have your own facts. And the fact of the matter is in that instance, when there was an attack on one of our leaders in the military, one of our heroes, when there was an attack, where were the Americans in the majority party, who represent the majority party? Where were they? 
   I know where their constituents were, because I represent many of them, and they were as disgusted as I with the actions of MoveOn.org. They were as disgusted as I with the remarkable, remarkable betrayal of the public trust that anybody in the public arena has. And it was distressing. I found it distressing and saddening that in fact we heard virtually nothing from folks on the other side of the aisle. 
   So that is a bit of truth that the American people are paying attention to. When I go home, that is what I hear. I hear folks ask me all the time, why is it that our Congress, the majority party now in our Congress, cannot stand up proudly and say that they match their words with action when it comes to our brave men and women in the military? So that is a bit of truth that I wanted to highlight, to bring a little light to in this House of Representatives.  
   The other is an issue that again doesn't have anything to do with that, except we are trying to shed some light of truth on it. It happened just a couple of hours ago, Mr. Speaker, on the floor of this House. 
   The majority party has bent over backwards in their efforts to try to make certain that individuals who are in this Nation illegally are able to access certain benefit that are paid for with hard-earned taxpayer money. Now, I don't know why that is. I can't answer the question I get at home, why on Earth would they do those sorts of things? I can't answer that. But they bend over backwards to make certain that individuals who have come into this Nation illegally are able to get access to housing, get access to all sorts of things that in fact my constituents, your constituents, I suspect, Mr. Speaker, don't believe is appropriate. 
   They believe that we ought to make certain that our borders are secure and that individuals come into this Nation correctly, legally. I don't know of anybody that opposes legal immigration. What many of us, especially on the minority side, the Republican side, oppose is illegal immigration and the consequences of attempting to take care of or provide services for those folks that are here illegally. The problem is, those services, all of the services that we address here, are paid for by hard-earned American taxpayer money. 
   So what we had on the floor of the House here today was a bill that should have gotten broad support, the reauthorization of the Federal Housing Act. It is a bill that in its original intent was supposed to try to provide assistance for people who were kind of at the margins. They weren't able to make certain that they were able to afford some kind of housing, and this bill was an attempt to try to provide in a very generous and positive way some assistance to those that needed it. 
   Over time, that mission has become a bit distorted. In this instance today, it has not only become distorted; it has become abused, abused in a way that, again, my constituents at home, they just shake their head when they hear these kinds of stories. 
   What happened is what the bill included, at the direction of the chairman of the committee and of the Democrat majority. What it included was up to a $5 billion slush fund. 
   Mr. Speaker, remember, that is $5 billion of hard-earned American taxpayer money, $5 billion to go into what is euphemistically called an Affordable Housing Fund. But in fact what that money can be used for is virtually anything that the majority party believes is appropriate in terms of giving money to organizations that have something to do with housing. 
   Now, how is that something defined? Well, it isn't, which means that that money can be used for an organization that simply advertises that if you are having difficulty with housing, then we would like to assist you and move you and get you to talk to the people who truly have the answers.     
   That may be 1 percent of their mission, and the other 99 percent of their mission is advocacy for left-leaning organizations all across this Nation. And advocacy for individuals on the other side of the aisle to get elected, and advocacy in ways that the vast majority of the American people would say we ought not be doing that. We ought not be spending hard-earned American taxpayer money that way. Yet this is a $5 billion slush fund for individuals to be able to use it kind of as their own little pet project. 
   If that weren't bad enough, on our side of the aisle we get one opportunity to truly affect and change the course or the description, the content of a bill. It is called a motion to recommit, as you know, Mr. Speaker. In that motion to recommit that we offered today, it was very simple. It said, if you are going to allow individuals to have access to that $5 billion of hard-earned taxpayer money, you ought to make certain that the people receiving that money are either U.S. citizens or here legally. Kind of a simple, commonsense amendment. 
   What we heard from the other side was oh, no, you can't do that. That would limit the ability of us to do, to accomplish our mission. That would make it so we are not able to do the kinds of things that we want to do. 
   Remember, the kinds of things that they want to do is to support organizations that are not consistent with mainstream America. So we offered that amendment that would have provided that you had to be legal in this Nation, that you had appropriate documentation of your legality. You had to be a U.S. citizen or here legally. The other side strenuously objected and defeated it. So 216 or 217 Members of the Democrat Party said no, we don't believe that you ought to be here legally and get those kinds of moneys. We believe those moneys ought to be able to go to those folks here illegally. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I go home and try to explain that to my constituents, there is no way I can do that. They stand in front of me just dumbfounded that the majority party that we have right now is intent on providing taxpayer benefits, taxpayer-funded benefits, to individuals here illegally. That is a bit of a truth that I am trying to weave through and make certain that Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, understand and appreciate that some of these votes actually do matter. Some of these votes matter. That vote today mattered. 
   I am attempting to shed some light on issues that in fact matter, and the issue of the ad that denigrated and criticized and brought into question the honesty and truthfulness of one of our military heroes about which we heard nothing, virtually nothing from the other side, that is truth. That's truth. And the American people are watching. The American people are watching. 
   I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, when I go home I often get some questions from folks who are concerned about what is going on here in Washington. I was reminded by a friend here on the floor of the House today that it is striking that so often what seems to matter at home doesn't matter here, and what matters here doesn't matter at home. So we get the kind of remarkable back-and-forth that goes on here on the floor of the House that oftentimes is not full of the kind of substance that the American people are concerned about, and the issues about which they are concerned we often get very little attention paid to those things here in Washington. 
   We are going to talk about one of those that I hear about all the time from my constituents back home. We are going to talk about the issue of taxes and the issue of spending and the issue of entitlements. ``Entitlements'' is a word I am not very fond of because it is not an appropriate description. Entitlements have come to en capture the Social Security program, Medicare program and Medicaid program. They are called entitlements, because in order to receive the benefits from those three programs, and other entitlements, there are other entitlements, all you have to do is meet certain parameters. So if you are a certain age, for example, you are eligible for Medicare, regardless of anything else. If you are below a certain income and you have a certain family situation, then you are eligible for Medicaid. Once you reach a certain age, you are eligible for Social Security. The proceeds or the benefits that are in those programs are automatic. So I prefer to call them automatic spending as opposed to entitlements. And instead of mandatory spending, I like to call them automatic spending because the spending is on autopilot. It just goes and goes. 
   Regardless of what happens in this Chamber and in the Senate, the spending continues and continues and continues. The inertia here in Washington about these programs is to do nothing. It is to do absolutely nothing because they are automatic. They are entitlements. Why would we want to do anything. We would want to do something because of the changing demographics of our society. We are on a collision course with a fiscal disaster. A collision course with a fiscal disaster. That is not my opinion, that is a fact, to quote Senator Moynihan. 
   If you go to other folks who are much more knowledgeable about this situation, they will tell you the same thing. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke said in February 2007, ``Without early and meaningful action to address the rapid growth of entitlement, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' That is the Federal Reserve chairman saying if something isn't done, the economy  could be seriously weakened. What that means is fewer jobs, decreasing income, higher taxes, decreasing opportunity, a shadow coming across the dreams of the American people. That's what that means. 
   The comptroller general, David Walker, who has been working as hard as he can for literally years to get the American people and this Congress to wake up to this impending crisis, David Walker said in March of this year, ``The rising cost of government entitlements are `a fiscal cancer' that threatens catastrophic consequences for our country and could `bankrupt America.' '' 
   Mr. Speaker, that's not Representative Price talking. That's not somebody who is talking willy-nilly 
   about the sky falling for no reason at all. That is the comptroller general of the United States of America who looks at the numbers and looks into the projections of spending in these entitlement programs and says that there are catastrophic consequences for our country if nothing is done. 
   I am fond of saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, and graphs are oftentimes worth more than that. This graph demonstrates clearly the course we are on. These are pie charts that identify the amount of the portion, the percentage of the Federal budget, that goes to mandatory or automatic spending, the entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. 
   In 1995, these programs, the entitlement programs, automatic spending programs, comprised about 48.7 percent of the Federal budget. And the prediction then in 2005 was that they would comprise about 54 percent of the Federal budget. That was the prediction back in 1995. And what happened? Well, it was right on track. Right on track. 53.4 percent of the Federal budget went to automatic spending in the area of entitlements. 
   Now what's the prediction for 2017? It is 62.2 percent. This yellow portion of the pie continues to get larger and larger and larger. That's the spending in the automatic spending area, the entitlement area: Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. That is a course, Mr. Speaker, that we as a Nation are not able to sustain. It is crying out for reform. It is crying out for improvement and programs that will be more responsive to the individuals receiving it. It is crying out to make certain that as the baby boomers of our Nation retire, as they age, and as we have individuals who are at the lower end of the economic spectrum, it is crying out for programs that are more responsive to them, that answer their concerns, that listen to them. These programs will not be able to do that because they will not be able to be funded. And to sit here in 2007 and act as a Congress and not address these issues is irresponsible. It is irresponsible. 
   This chart, Mr. Speaker, talks about this looming entitlement or automatic spending crisis. In 2007, Federal spending as a percentage of GDP, that's the gross domestic product, is about 20 percent. That means about 20 percent, about two dimes out of every dollar that every American earns, goes towards taxes in order to cover the programs that the Federal Government provides. And the bulk of this, remember, the bulk of this yellow bar here is entitlement spending: Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security. 
   If we remain on our current course, if we do nothing at all, and remember, we have done nothing. If we continue to do nothing, what happens is that in relatively short order, 2020, we go to 23, 24 percent. In 2030 we go over 30 percent. In 2040, we go to 40 percent. In 2050, we exceed 50 percent of the gross domestic product. 
   It's important to remember that, and I have another chart which I don't have with me, but it is important to remember that the average level of Federal budget, taxation to the American people is 18 to 20 percent and has been for decades. It is also important to note that amount of spending, that amount of taxation, that amount of Federal spending, a Nation spending at about 20 percent, is about the maximum that any Nation can sustain for any period of time and remain financially viable. Once you get up into these areas here, Mr. Speaker, you can't sustain that. The economy won't sustain it. People won't have jobs. You begin to lose companies and jobs. You begin to lose the infrastructure that makes it so that individuals can go to work and send their money to Uncle Sam. 
   There is a balance, and that's what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke knows. That is what Comptroller General David Walker knows, and that is why they are sounding these alarms. 
   So you would think that this Congress that is charged with making certain that our financial stake, that our financial future, is positive and optimistic and that my son, our son and children all across this Nation can grow up and be able to have the wonderful opportunities that so many of us have had. You would think that this majority would want to continue or want to make reforms so that those kinds of dreams and visions and entrepreneurship and excitement about America's future would continue. You would think that the current leadership would listen to what they hear if they take that shell and they put it up to their ear or they read the tea leaves or they listen to the people that truly know like David Bernanke and like David Walker. You would think that they would reform these programs or put a proposal on the table to reform these programs.     
   You would think, Mr. Speaker, that there would be no expansion of entitlements, there would be no more additions to the automatic spending that is going on here in Washington. Well, Mr. Speaker, as you know, that is not the case. 
   We have had a number of bills that have come through the floor of this House that have in fact expanded entitlements. The most recent one was terribly discomforting to me. It was the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   Before I came to Congress, Mr. Speaker, I was a physician. I spent over 20 years, 25 years taking care of people, trying to get them well, trying to heal them, trying to make certain that in spite of all the remarkable rules and regulations that are put on the backs of every single physician across this here Nation, that we could actually take care of patients. 
   One of the things that became much more onerous than it ought to be is the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which actually provided greater rules to how to care for individuals than otherwise. It also ultimately didn't fit the original definition. 
   The State Children's Health Insurance Program began in 1997. Its mission was to make certain that those individuals, those children in families where their family made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but they didn't make enough money to be able to readily afford health insurance were given some help; that those families were able to provide some type of health insurance that was truly quality for their children. 
   It is a good mission. It is a bipartisan program, a program that passed through this House in Congress in 1997 in a bipartisan manner because it had an appropriate ideal; it was an appropriate compromise between some Federal program, a State program, and a lot of private input. That program was to run for 10 years. So it is about to expire. 
   So what has happened in this House is that the Democrat majority decided that they weren't interested in working in a bipartisan way, contrary to so much of what they talk about. They weren't interested in working in a bipartisan way. It was their way or the highway. 
   Their way was a remarkable expansion of an entitlement. Remember, the State Children's Health Insurance Program was a discretionary program, which means that the Federal Government determines what resources it has available to provide that kind of care, and it works with the States to make certain that the amount of money is there but that it is not on one of those automatic trajectories to the sky in terms of spending. It is not one of those programs that will assist in bankrupting the Nation, as David Walker talks about. 
   But what does this majority do, this new majority, this Democrat majority that talks all the time about being fiscally responsible? It takes that program and instead of keeping it in the discretionary side, that side where  folks at home can be able to appreciate that it is that side of the budget where if they are able to afford it, they utilize the money in that area, and it puts it in the entitlement side. 
   Instead of these bar graphs and those pie charts being accurate in their prediction, that will be significantly off. In fact, they will be off so much that we will reach this position of not being able to sustain those programs and of decreasing economic activity in this Nation and of lowering wages and of losing jobs in this Nation sooner because of the recent actions of this Democrat majority. 
   They made it an entitlement. They did all sorts of other things which I thought were egregious, as well as they pitted seniors against children in their effort to try to pay for it. You don't see the kind of reform that is so necessary. 
   So, again, Mr. Speaker, you would think that this new majority would say, well, it looks like when we look into the future that we have got a problem on our hands. We have got a problem, financial problem. It is our responsibility as elected representatives of the people of the United States that we need to be responsible, that we need to be responsive to the concerns of our constituents, that we need to make certain that the programs that we put in place will allow Americans to continue to dream and continue to have that great opportunity for success. 
   We need to make certain that we don't allow the entitlement programs to consume an ever greater portion of the Federal budget so that that discretionary side, which, Mr. Speaker, as you know, is not just the military, it is roads, it is highways, it is all transportation, it is all funding for the aviation, it is all of the other kinds of programs. It is jobs, housing. It is the wonderful housing bill that we worked on today. 
   It is all those kinds of things. It is everything that you think of when you think of the Federal Government having activity, everything is all of the discretionary side, and it will be consumed by the entitlements, which means all of the things that folks think about other than those three programs will not be able to take place. 
   So you would think that this new majority would say, well, we better get our act in order, get our House in order, better work together in a collegial and a positive and a bipartisan way to be able to solve this problem. It is what we have been trying to do, what we have been talking about, what we have proposed. 
   In fact, we did so in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. That act reformed entitlements, about $130 billion of reform. That is one of the big things that resulted in the ability to balance the budget, to have a surplus. That was done with a Republican Congress and a Democrat President. In fact, in 2005, in spite of all the kicking and screaming from the other side, another $40 billion in appropriate entitlement reform. 
   What has happened with the budget for this year among this majority, who clearly can read the same charts, who get the same information from the Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, and Comptroller David Walker, who can look at the same projections? What have they done in terms of entitlement reform? Nothing. Nothing, Mr. Speaker. 
   That is an abrogation of duty; that is irresponsible out of this majority. The American people are paying attention because, again, when I go home, they want these problems solved. They want them solved. They ask why can't you work together and get these problems solved. Mr. Speaker, we stand ready, willing and able to work together to get these problems solved. 
   We are going to talk a little more about entitlements, but we want to talk a fair amount about the taxing that has been hoisted upon the American public by this current majority. We will talk about spending. There are a number of ways you can increase revenue to the Federal Government and cover the programs that are so vital and necessary to the American people. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that increasing taxes and increasing spending together are not two of them. I believe that we ought to be decreasing taxes and decreasing spending and being fiscally responsible as a Congress. 
   I am pleased to be joined by my good friend, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), who is a fiscal hawk, an individual who recognizes and appreciates the 
   importance of balancing budgets and making certain that we don't spend beyond our means at the Federal level. I look forward to your comments. I am happy to yield to you.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate you pointing that out. What this chart demonstrates is that the rhetoric that we hear from the other side doesn't match the action. It happens in so many different areas; it is hard to keep up with. I call it Orwellian democracy, which is that the words don't match the actions. 
   This chart demonstrates the seven appropriations bills. A number of us, and you were so very, very supportive of these efforts, attempted to say the Federal Government is spending too much, we ought to decrease that. If you don't want to decrease it in certain specific programs, then let's just decrease it by a certain percent. 
   In this instance, I promoted amendments that would decrease it by 1 percent. Decrease these seven appropriations bills by 1 percent. That is one penny out of every dollar. That reduction would have saved $3.9 billion. Yet the individuals who so often say over and over and over that they are champions of fiscal responsibility, that they certainly don't want to see us overspend, and you see on the far right there the number of times that they voted for and then against this type of amendment, overwhelmingly voted against it, 95 percent almost all the time. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend for coming and helping out and participating and trying to shed light, trying to put a little fact on the table when we talk about the issue of taxing and spending. 
   I do, Mr. Speaker, want to talk fairly specifically about taxes because, as you know, Mr. Speaker, the general consensus out in America is that the majority party, the Democrats, are the party of tax and spend. I grew up believing that, I grew up thinking that, and that is one of the reasons that I was so staunchly a Republican as I entered my political career, because I thought it was most appropriate to decrease taxes and to decrease spending at the State and the Federal level, because I believe firmly, as I believe most Americans believe, that the American people are better able to decide how to spend their hard-earned money, not the Federal Government, not the State government. 
   Our friends on the other side of the aisle tend to believe by and large that the Federal Government knows best; that the choices that the Federal Government makes with how to spend individuals' money, those are better choices than that person could make for themselves. I simply don't believe it and I don't think the American people believe that. 
   But what has happened in a relatively short period of time, Mr. Speaker, we have been in this 110th Congress now a little over 9 months, right about 9 months, in a relatively short period of time the bills that have been passed would increase taxes on the American people, and truly across the board, not just a small focal area. They will talk about increasing taxes on the rich, and we will talk about that a little bit, but in fact what they have passed through this House are bills repeatedly that increase taxes on virtually every single American. And why do I say that? Well, they passed a budget that includes this portion, these parameters laid out in terms of increasing taxes. 
   When you talk about ordinary income, the highest rate would go from 35 percent to 39.6 percent. When you talk about capital gains, it would go from 15 percent to 20 percent. Dividends, 15 percent to 39.6 percent. Those are all increases, Mr. Speaker. They are also facts, not opinions. They are facts. 
   The estate tax in 2010 will be zero. That is the death tax. That means that if you are unfortunate enough to have somebody in your family that dies, that their estate on that day that they die, you don't have to write a check to the Federal Government. But on January 1, 2011, with the budget that the new majority passed, that amount, that death tax goes right back up to 55 percent, which is where it was when we have been trying to get it down, 55 percent. That is an increase, Mr. Speaker. 
   The child tax credit, the amount of money that you are given from the Federal Government as a credit to assist in raising your child, $1,000, in 2010, 2011 down to $500, cut in half, slashed in half. 
   The lowest tax bracket, curiously enough, those at the lowest end of the economic spectrum in 2010 would have a taxable income tax at 10 percent, and then in 2011 at 15 percent. 
   What does that mean, Mr. Speaker? What does that mean to people? The other side is fond of saying that all they are going to do is tax the rich. They demonize the rich, because there is a tried-and-true method in politics which is to divide people. We believe, I believe that it is important to bring people together to work together in a positive way to solve problems, to solve the challenges that we have as the American people. And so they say, well, all we are going to do is increase taxes on the rich. 
   In fact, with these tax rates here, one in five people who benefit from the lower rate on capital gains that was passed earlier in this decade have incomes below $50,000. That is 20 percent have incomes below $50,000. So I guess that all we can conclude from that is that our friends on the other side, the majority party, believe that anybody who makes less than $50,000 is rich, the only conclusion that we could reach given their rhetoric, given what they say. One in four people who benefit from the lowered rate on dividends, one in four, 25 percent have an income less than $50,000. Again, are those people rich, Mr. Speaker? Are those people rich? When you pit people against each other, it doesn't do well or a service to our Nation in terms of the discussion as we move forward. 
   How many folks is that? 2.4 million people earning less than $50,000 benefit from the capital gains tax relief, 2.4 million Americans; 5.4 million Americans who earn less than $50,000 benefit from the dividend tax relief, 5.4 million. In fact, 58 percent of the people who have benefited, Americans who have benefited from the capital gains tax cuts earn less than $100,000 a year.  Over half of the individuals earn less than $100,000 a year. So I guess all those people, Mr. Speaker, by the definition of our friends on the other side, are rich. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are talking a bit about taxes and about the Orwellian nature of the rhetoric that we hear from folks on the other side of the aisle as they continually say, well, we will only tax the rich and we will only tax corporations, as if corporations are this inanimate object that don't relate at all to the American people, that there is no nexus between the American people's jobs and businesses. In fact, when they tax at the rate that they do or that they propose, it affects virtually every single individual in this Nation who has a job. And, Mr. Speaker, that is personal. That is personal to those folks. 
   So we have talked about the $392.5 billion tax increase that was incorporated in the budget that our friends adopted on the other side. We have talked about that, and we outlined where that came from with all of the increases in income taxes, capital gains taxes, the death tax coming back. But what else have they done? Virtually a new tax at every single turn. A new bill comes through here, and it is a new tax or it is a new fee. $15 billion in the energy bill that was passed, $15 billion in new taxes on American corporations, American oil corporations. And I know it is popular to beat up on the oil companies. But, Mr. Speaker, if you tax them more, who is going to pay those taxes? The American people are going to pay those taxes. Corporations don't make any money, they don't mint any money. What they do is American people purchase their products. And if they are taxed more, the American people will pay more for those taxes. 
   In addition to what that means is that we are penalizing American corporations. And they didn't tax foreign oil companies. That is not what they did. They taxed American oil companies $15 billion; $5.8 billion in new tobacco taxes. That might be appropriate. In fact, as a physician I strongly believe that individuals ought not smoke. Ought not smoke. But what they have done is incorporate new tobacco taxes in a children's health insurance bill, so that as you decrease the number of folks that are smoking, you will have to find that money elsewhere. And then where does that come from? Yes, Mr. Speaker, you guessed it, new taxes. 
   $7.5 billion in new taxes in the farm bill. Remember, Mr. Speaker, at every single turn, virtually every single turn, every new bill, this new majority has seen to find an opportunity to raise taxes on the American people. 
   Five-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax increase for infrastructure. That infrastructure is an appropriate thing to pay for. But, Mr. Speaker, as you know, when you set a budget, you ought to set priorities. And one of the priorities of this Nation ought to be infrastructure improvement, but we have got enough money to be able to do that if we would set those priorities. We ought not be increasing the taxes on the American people. 
   A 50-cent-per-gallon, 50-cents-per-gallon tax increase to study global warming. Now, Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is fairly well documented that the temperature on the Earth has increased some over the past couple of years. I don't know that that is due to human activity, but I do believe that we ought to be studying it and looking at it. I also believe that it ought to be a priority of our Nation and it ought to be a priority of our budget, but I don't believe that we need to increase taxes in order to perform that study. I believe that those resources are certainly already there. 
   New taxes on homeowners by ending the mortgage deductions. That is what has been proposed by the other side. 
   And in the SCHIP bill again, in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, there was a small little portion of it that many people didn't even know they were voting on when they voted on it that will provide, if it becomes law, for a tax on every single personal private health insurance policy in this Nation. Every single one. Mr. Speaker, it is not the way that we ought to be proceeding to increase economic development to solve the challenges that we have by taxing Americans over and over and over. 
   I want to spend a few brief moments talking about taxes on corporations, because our friends on the other side, it is one of their favorite pinatas. They beat up on the corporations left, right, and center, and they do so as if the corporations in America aren't paying any tax at all, they aren't paying their fair share. You will hear them say that, Mr. Speaker. If you look at the facts, if you look at the facts, then we could see where the American corporations stand as it relates to the rest of the industrialized world. 
   Now, one would think, given the Orwellian rhetoric that we have heard from the other side, that American corporations are clearly not paying their fair share. Right? They are not paying as much as they might be in, say, oh, pick a nation. Canada? Canadian corporations pay about 22 percent. American corporations, oh, by the way, they are down there on the far right on this chart, Mr. Speaker. They are down there on the far right paying the greatest percentage of taxes of their income of any other nation, tied with Spain. Granted, we are tied with Spain, 35 percent. Switzerland down here, 8 or 9 percent. Ireland is about 12 percent. 
   In fact, Ireland is a great case study, because Ireland used to be way down at this end of the chart, way down at that end. In fact, what they did was decrease their corporate taxes, decrease their taxes on corporations and businesses. And what happened, Mr. Speaker? An incredible economic boom, an incredible economic development occurred, because when you allow corporations to create more jobs, more people get jobs, more money is created in terms of revenue for the Federal Government. And it seems counterintuitive, but when you decrease taxes on both people and on corporations, there is more money that comes into the Federal Government. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, when you look at the facts, when you look at the facts you appreciate that the United States corporations, again, a wonderful whipping boy and it is easy to criticize them because it is tough for them to defend themselves, especially with the rhetoric that we so often hear on this floor of the House. And I find that troubling and I think that is distressing, and it ought to be to the American people, Mr. Speaker. Because when you look at the facts, what you see is that United States corporations are taxed more than any other industrialized nation except for Spain, and we are tied with Spain, 35 percent. So those are the facts, Mr. Speaker. 
   Now, what is the solution? Well, the solution is to respect the hard-earned money of the American taxpayer. That is the solution. We have proposed a taxpayer bill of rights. I encourage my colleagues on the other side to look at the bill, to cosponsor the bill. I would love to have it passed. I would love to bring it to the floor and passed. 
   What does it include? It says that the Federal Government ought not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. That is the balanced budget portion of the bill. You ought not spend more than you take in. You ought to make certain that you end deficit spending. We believe taxpayers have a right to that. We believe that taxpayers have a right to receive back each dollar that they entrust to the Federal Government for their retirement. That is the Social Security portion. As you well know, Mr. Speaker, we talked about entitlements earlier, entitlement reform is imperative. If young people across this Nation are going to be able to receive back with some benefit the resources that they have sent to the Federal Government for their retirement, if that is going to be able to occur, then what needs to happen is that that money needs to be put into a fund that is not used for anything else. Social Security trust fund money ought to be used for Social Security alone. That is what the taxpayer bill of rights says. That is what we say in our bill. That is what many individuals across this Chamber on both sides of the aisle have said that they support.     
   Well, Mr. Speaker, let's vote on that. That's a positive move to make. In fact, that would be a bipartisan positive move to make. We encourage that to happen. We believe that taxpayers have a right to a balanced budget amendment without raising taxes. 
   As we've demonstrated already, the current majority believes that if you  just tax more, you'll be able to increase the money coming to the Federal Government to pay for all these programs, these new programs that they want to enact. 
   In fact, what happens if you tax more, you decrease money coming to the Federal Government. And every single President that has decreased taxes recognized that. John Kennedy did when he decreased taxes, saw a significant increase to the Federal Government in terms of revenue. Ronald Reagan did when he decreased taxes, saw an increasing amount of money to the Federal Government. And certainly in this administration we've seen significant increased revenues to the Federal Government. When you decrease taxes, money to the Federal Government increases. Again, it sounds counterintuitive; but it's not, because what happens is that American people get to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   And you remember, Mr. Speaker, we talked about choices, who ought to be able to choose. One of the most fundamental principles that we believe, I believe, is that the American individual, the American citizen ought to be the one that has the right to choose when they save or they spend or they invest, not the Federal Government, with their money. So many of our good friends on the other side believe that they can make better decisions than the American people with that hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   We believe that you ought to be able to get to a balanced budget without raising taxes. We have a bill that will allow that to happen. We strongly encourage our friends on the other side to support it. 
   We believe that taxpayers have a right to fundamental and fair tax reform. Some of my friends are supporters of a flat tax, a flat income tax. Some are supporters of a fair tax, the national retail sales tax, which I believe to be the most appropriate way to align our form of taxation in our Nation with our form of commerce. We would then incentivize all the things that we say that we want, like hard work and vision and entrepreneurship and success. Right now we punish all those things. Our current tax system punishes people when they do more, when they succeed, when they die. Those aren't things we ought to be taxing. My goodness. 
   And we believe also that the taxpayers have a right to a supermajority required for any tax increase. In fact, as you know, Mr. Speaker, that was the rule of the House until this new majority took over. When they changed the rules on the very first day that we met in January of this year, they changed the rule to make it so that it only took a majority to raise taxes on any bill that comes through this House, not a supermajority, which meant 60 percent before. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it's very clear. We believe, I believe, that working together positively, productively we can solve the challenges that we have before us. 
   It's an incredible honor to represent the Sixth District of Georgia in this United States House of Representatives. It's an incredible honor for each and every one of us to be a Member here. 
   But what our constituents demand of us, I believe, is responsibility to act together and to work together in a positive way, in an uplifting way, in a way that will make certain that we preserve the American Dream and a system in place, an economic system in place that will allow the majority of Americans, the vast majority of Americans, if not every single American, the opportunity to succeed in his or her own life. 
   I challenge my colleagues across the aisle to work together positively in that direction. I know that you've got partners who will assist you on this side.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (EXPANDING AMERICAN HOMEOWNERSHIP ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense motion to recommit that would require that any individual or household receiving money from the Affordable Housing Fund must present verification of legal residency by a secure identification document. 
   Americans believe that it's appropriate to ask those receiving hard-earned taxpayer dollars, taxpayer assistance, that it's right to establish that they are legal residents of the United States. It's common sense. 
   Across the country, whether it's Denver, where in 2006 there were an estimated 20,000 illegal immigrants holding FHA insured loans, or L.A. or Atlanta, where similar activity occurs, illegal immigrants are being given unprecedented access to taxpayer benefits and taxpayer money. In many of these cases of FHA loans, the documents submitted with their applications later proved to be false, resident alien numbers that were never issued, or Social Security numbers belonging to other people, or W-2 forms that were fabricated. In the case of financial institutions, minimal documents are required by their regulators to establish a new customer's identity to open accounts. 
   The current loopholes in Federal law are an invitation, they're an attraction, they're a magnet to illegal immigration. We must not reward those coming here illegally by allowing them the services that ought to be only afforded to American citizens and they're here legally. If we do so, this results in back-door amnesty. 
   This motion to recommit would require that the Federal official responsible for administering the Housing Trust Fund ensure that any assistance provided from the Affordable Housing Fund must require that all adults are legal residents of the United States. Simple common sense. 
   Recipients may use one of three different forms of identification. These forms are considered the most secure types of identification because they're harder to forge or to duplicate. They're all issued by a government agency  which has more checks and balances, more checks and balances preventing illegal immigrants or criminals or terrorists from obtaining these documents. 
   Everyone who is in the United States legally can easily obtain one of the three identification forms, but illegal immigrants, criminals, and terrorists would have to go to significant lengths to receive one. 
   Now, we have offered this type of amendment to bills in the past on this floor, and it's needed on this bill as well, as there appears to be no end in sight to the appetite of our friends in the majority to provide taxpayer benefits to illegals against the will and against the desire of the American people. 
   Now, you will hear that this MTR, this motion to recommit, provides for the committee to report back promptly and that that would ``kill the bill.'' But we all know that's not true. In fact, the Speaker has previously ruled that any bill adopted with this language could readily be returned to the House floor with the new language. 
   You will hear that those already here illegally cannot get federally subsidized benefits. Then because it's clear that there are currently some loopholes in our current system, we ought not have any problem adopting more enforceable criteria for legal documentation. 
   You will hear that if you don't drive or you don't travel to foreign countries, that this is an undue burden. But the American people don't believe that it is inappropriate to ask those citizens receiving Federal taxpayer assistance to first establish that they are legal residents of the United States. 
   You will hear that this might lead us down the path to using Social Security as a universal identifier. But if you read this motion, what it does is simply provide for an array of options for secure IDs that all Americans and legal immigrants have ready access to. Simple common sense. 
   You may hear that it's already in the bill. Well, in fact it is, Mr. Speaker; but it doesn't cover the Affordable Housing Fund. The current regulations to establish a customer's identity do a disservice to the American people. Greater clarification in this area will help stem the tide of illegal immigrants. 
   The Federal Government should not be operating under obscure parameters that do not serve our Nation. We can and should strengthen these regulations to protect the American people. 
   This is a much more appropriate solution to the problem of back-door amnesty than simply saying that we're not going to let illegal immigrants live in government-subsidized housing. To the best of our ability, we must eliminate using hard-earned American taxpayer money to subsidize illegal activity. This motion to recommit does just that, and I urge my colleagues to support the motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (Announcement by the Chairman -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from Minnesota for bringing this issue forward. Madam Chairman, this is an extremely important issue, and I think it is important that we bring the debate back to the actual amendment. 
   The amendment addresses the issue of funding for the Office of Labor Management Statistics, and that agency is the only agency of the government that is devoted to protecting the interests of dues-paying union members, the only one. 
   The funding in last year, fiscal year 2007, was about $47 million. Funding proposed for this year is about $45 million. It is a cut of about $2 million. That is a cut. Not the cut that we have heard explained in other bills that were reductions in the increase; it is a cut. The President felt so strongly about this and felt so strongly about the success of this agency that he recommended an increase to $56 million. So this proposal by the majority party is a decrease of $11.1 million from the President's request. 
   Now, it is curious the arguments that we are hearing on the other side. They have increased spending virtually across the board for every single agency except for this one, and this is the one that provides the enforcement for the Department of Labor. I have supported many appropriate reductions, there is no doubt about it, as we have moved through these appropriations bills, but I believe strongly that there is a message that is being sent in this cut that is being proposed by the majority party, and that message is that it is imperative that the debt that they owe to union bosses be paid. 
   And why do I say that? This is an agency that has significant results. Since 2001, the indictments resulting from investigations by this agency have increased by 20 percent. Now, why would we want to decrease funding to an agency that is showing success in protecting dues-paying workers? Convictions have increased by 26 percent and the courts have ordered restitution of over $70 million in union members' dues that were stolen, stolen by union officials. That sounds like a project that would merit support by the majority party, but, as my good friend from Florida just said, it is clear that this is a trend that we are seeing by this new majority party, and that is that the protection of the rank-and-file worker is not what they have an interest in. And that was demonstrated clearly with the card check issue which, as he mentioned, took away the sacrosanct right of a secret ballot in union formation in this Nation. The majority party said, no, that wasn't important, that individuals ought to be exposed to the kind of intimidation that we see on both sides, both the employer and the union side. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I guess it ought not be surprising that we see this included in the current bill, but it is disappointing. There is no doubt that it is disappointing. Because, again, we have an agency of the Federal Government, the Office of Labor Management Statistics, which is getting results, which is fulfilling its mission, which is fulfilling its charge, which is fulfilling its responsibility to the American people and to this Federal Government, and this new majority proposes to significantly cut the amount of funding to the agency. I think it exposes a flaw in the thinking of the majority party and, hence, this general statement that we are the only individuals for working people. In fact, tax cuts are for working people. In fact, decreasing spending at the level of the Federal Government is for working people. In fact, not passing the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation is for working people. 
   So we stand proudly and honorably before the American people and say that the party that stands in favor of working people is the party that is most responsible with Federal spending. It is the party that holds to account Federal agencies. This Federal agency, this office is accomplishing its goal, it is accomplishing its mission, and so it ought not be one that we cut. There are certainly others that are available to be decreased. I urge support of the Kline amendment and ask all my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I am somewhat amused by the posture of the Appropriations Chair in the last two amendments, and I appreciate the difficult position he finds himself in. But on the one hand, the amendment before this one attempting to support the President's recommendation and then on this one lambasting the President's recommendation. So a case of whiplash, I understand, may be in order.  
   But it is important to talk about exactly what this amendment does. And I want to commend my good friend from Texas for proposing this amendment. 
   The Department of Labor proposes in the President's budget that $14 million go to the International Labor Affairs Bureau, which would move the agency closer to its core mission of research and policy analysis. Remember this is the Department of Labor, not the Department of State. In 2008 the International Labor Affairs Bureau will continue to focus on administering over $530 million, $530 million, in projects that were launched in previous years, including in the field of child labor, as the chairman mentioned. 
   The Department of Labor seeks to restore the International Labor Affairs Bureau to its original mission of research and advocacy by eliminating its grant-making activities. We have all sorts of duplication and redundancies in the Federal Government, and this certainly is one of them. As an example of that, between 1996 and 2001, the International Labor Affairs Bureau's funding rose by 1,500 percent over a 5-year period of time when the agency embarked on an expansive grant-making mission intended to combat international child labor, develop and disseminate AIDS prevention information in the international workplace, support core labor standards development, and provide bilateral technical assistance. 
   Madam Chairman, grant-making activities are appropriately funded through the Department of State and through the USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other agencies. For example, the 2008 budget includes $3 billion to continue international assistance activities in developing countries through the Millennium Challenge Account. The administration created the Millennium Challenge Account to provide targeted and accountable international development assistance to poor countries with a demonstrative commitment to ruling justly, investing in people, and encouraging economic growth. So there are more appropriate places to fund these kinds of grant activities. 
   I would suggest, Madam Chairman, that the gentleman from Texas has proposed an appropriate amendment to return the level of funding in this appropriations bill to a level that would allow the International Labor Affairs Bureau to return to its core mission, its core mission of research and policy analysis and I believe better serve this Congress and the American people.     
   So I commend the gentleman for his amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I will be relatively brief on this. 
   I want to commend my friend from Louisiana for offering the amendment. As a physician in my former life, I appreciate the remarkable increase in the incidence of tuberculosis and the need for surveillance as well as detection and treatment. So I commend my friend from Louisiana for offering this amendment. We all watched with some curiosity and some significant concern within the last couple of months as we tracked the travels of one individual from my City of Atlanta around the world who was felt to have a case of tuberculosis that needed to be treated urgently. So I commend my good friend for the amendment. 
   I do want to say in the larger context, however, that I'm a little perplexed, for the Chair of the Appropriations Committee talks about ``pretending'' to support AmeriCorps in previous amendments dealing with this section of the bill, ``pretending'' to support NLRB, ``pretending'' to support deaf and blind children, and yet those are the amendments that he accepted.     
   So I am a little perplexed as to why this amendment isn't being given the same, at least the same pretending of, support from the Chair of the committee. 
   I would also point out that the appropriately decreased reductions in the proposal from the administration in this area of the budget aren't taken in isolation. They are part of the entire, larger budget, which gets to the issue of the entire, larger budget that this new majority has passed, and that, as you well know, Madam Chairman, includes the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation. So I understand that somehow you have to pay for all these things, but I believe strongly that it is not the American people who desire to have the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation. 
   So I rise to commend my good friend from Louisiana for proposing this sound amendment. I would encourage its adoption. I understand the concerns that others have regarding the underlying section in this area of the bill, but I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for his comments, and I would just like to underscore one point that he made, and that is, that all appropriations bills are bills that relate to priorities. 
   And we oftentimes hear from our good friends on the other side that we're quibbling or pretending or all sorts of descriptions about what's going on here tonight, but Madam Chairman, what's going on here tonight is the work of our democracy and the work of representatives in Congress to best represent their constituents. 
   And to scoff at ordering priorities for spending at the Federal level, I don't believe it's an appropriate message to send to the American people. This is important work. This is hard-earned taxpayer money, and it behooves us to spend as much time as any Member in this House so desires to determine the best way in which that money ought to be spent. 
   So I commend my friend for standing up for the priorities that he believes are most appropriate in this bill.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose above 14,000 for the first time ever. What a proud moment for all of us. 
   For many of us it is not a surprise. This strong economy is a direct result of the pro-growth Republican policies that we are fighting for every day on this floor. It is a sign of continued and growing investor confidence, and it shows that when taxes are low and Americans choose how and where to spend more of their money they will choose to invest in America and make us stronger. 
   This isn't a victory for Wall Street or for big business; it is a victory for Americans. Over half of all Americans are invested in the stock market. More and more Americans want to participate in this strong and growing economy. So they need a Federal Government that respects those wishes, not one that will raise their taxes to pay for out-of-control spending. 
   Let's keep this economy on the right track. Let's rein in spending. Let's focus on growing our economy rather than Washington's bureaucracy. That is what Americans want.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, this amendment is offered in an effort to try to reprioritize monies between two separate funds related to gaining high-quality teachers in our Nation, the Teacher Incentive Fund and the Teacher Quality State Grants.     
   The Teacher Incentive Fund, my amendment would increase the funding for that by $21 million. When the 2007 fiscal year budget was adopted or the appropriations bill adopted, receipt was $2 million. The request from the President for this year was $199 million, and the bill before us includes a provision for $99 million, $100 million less than the President's request. 
   As opposed to the Teacher Quality State Grants, which received last year $2.8 billion, the President's request was for $2.7 billion and the bill before us includes a provision for $3.1 billion, $400 million more than the request by the Department. 
   Teacher quality, Madam Chairman, is certainly the most important school-related factor influencing student achievement. The No Child Left Behind Act reflects this and one of the central tenets is putting a highly qualified teacher in every classroom. Congress now has a greater opportunity to take teacher quality initiatives a step further by increasing funding for the Teacher Incentive Fund, a program that rewards highly effective teachers and rewards results. 
   The Teacher Incentive Fund allows States and school districts to apply for Federal grants in order to develop and implement performance-based compensation systems for both teachers and principals. With the Teacher Incentive Fund, educators who improve student achievement in the classroom are provided with financial rewards such as bonuses and increasing salaries. In 2006, the Teacher Incentive Fund and Congress provided $100 million for the new program; however, in 2007 it received only $2 million, and this is for a program that has shown very successful and rewarding results. 
   There is certainly a need for the fund and to date 34 grantees have received money. But the Department of Education has received nearly 150 applications. More resources would mean more districts would be able to establish performance-based compensation systems. 
   Looking at the workforce, it is estimated that more than 2 million teachers will need to be hired over the next decade. Research has shown that performance pay can be effective at recruiting and retaining highly qualified teachers. So the Teacher Incentive Fund will encourage a talented pool of individuals to go into the field of teaching. 
   Again, this is a reprioritization, a movement of $21 million from the  Teacher Quality State Grants, which is slated to receive $3.1 billion to the Teacher Incentive Fund, which would then receive $120 million. By doing so, this money can be directly given to local districts to create compensation systems and therefore recruit and reward outstanding teachers. Nothing wrong with rewarding the best and brightest when it comes to educating our children. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I appreciate the Chair's comments and I agree with him that we don't have all the answers. I would suggest, however, that what this amendment does is more appropriately prioritize moneys based upon the concerns and recommendation of the Department of Education. The fundamental difference between the two programs, the Teacher Quality State Grants, which is a program that in many areas gets excellent results, the differences are two that this amendment addresses: 
   One is that the overwhelming portion of the money that is available has been put into the Teacher Quality State Grants, moving from $2.8 billion last year to $3.1 billion this year, as opposed to the Teacher Incentive Fund, which would move from a high of $100 million in the last 2 years to $99 million this year, in essence a flat appropriations. 
   The other main difference is that the Teacher Incentive Fund rewards results. It rewards performance. It rewards teachers and schools who are actually gaining those high quality results that we desire for all students across our Nation. 
   So I would respectfully disagree with the Chair, that this is not prescriptive in its formula and the only rigidity that it has in it is that it requires results. So, hopefully, the House will see that the sense in looking at performance, looking at quality teachers, looking at what they are doing in the classroom and the results that they are getting, and rewarding that kind of performance makes sense. I would suggest that that is what most of us have said at home when we talk to our constituents and that this amendment aligns  the actions of this House with what we have told our constituents we would be supporting here in the House of Representatives. 
   So I appreciate the time, and I encourage, again, my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for offering the amendment, and I thank him for his explanation. There is no desire to remove all funding in this area. That would be a different debate and a different discussion. That is not the debate we are having right now. 
   Madam Chairman, I do want to point out the larger picture, the bigger picture we are talking about here, and that is the issue of fiscal responsibility and the issue of responsibly spending taxpayer money, hard-earned American taxpayer money. 
   I was pleased to hear the chairman of the Appropriations Committee say to the gentleman from New Jersey that if the committee determined that those funds ought not be authorized, that they would be pleased to remove those funds, or something like that. 
   I would point out to the gentleman and to my colleagues that on page 302, 303, 304, and 305 of the report of the Committee on Appropriations, there is a paragraph that is headed ``Appropriations Not Authorized By Law.'' I would suggest that we revisit these items and require that they be authorized. 
   ``Pursuant to clause 3(f)(1)(B) of rule XIII of the Rules the House, the following table lists the appropriations in the accompanying bill,'' this bill we are talking about right now, ``which are not authorized by law for the period concerned.'' 
   It may be helpful, Madam Chairman, for individuals to hear which ones are not authorized, not talking about the quality of those programs or the need for them, but the fact that this is a process that has come about where we are appropriating money for many programs which are in fact not authorized. 
   Department of Labor, for example, Training and Employment Services, not authorized since 2003. Appropriations in this bill, $3.5 billion. 
   Not authorized in this bill, the Veterans Workforce Improvement Program, not authorized since 2003. Appropriated in this bill, $1.649 billion.     
   National Health Service Corps, not authorized since 2002, again not talking about the appropriateness of the appropriation itself, but whether or not the process is such that it ought not be authorized prior to carrying out the appropriation. In this bill, $131 million. 
   Not authorized in this bill, Healthy Start, not authorized since 2005. In this bill, $120 million. 
   Not authorized in this bill, Rural Health Outreach Grants, not authorized since 2006. Funding in this bill to a level of $52.9 million. 
   Not authorized in this bill, cancer registries, not authorized since 2003. In this bill, funded at the rate of $47.9 million. 
   Not authorized in this bill, oral health promotion, not authorized since 2005. Funding in this bill, $13.1 million. 
   Not authorized in this bill, substance abuse and mental health services programs, not authorized since 2003. Funding in this bill, $3.26 billion. 
   Madam Chairman, the list goes on and on, and I draw my colleagues' attention to it, because I would agree with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that we ought to be concerned about what is authorized by the authorizing committees and whether or not appropriations ought to be spent for items that are not authorized. 
   But the challenge for us is to spend responsibly, spend hard-earned taxpayer money responsibly.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this amendment, because fundamentally what we are charged with doing here is being responsible with hard-earned taxpayer money. As the gentleman from New Jersey said, it is not responsible to pay for two programs that do the same thing, which is why the administration in its review looked at this program, which is wonderfully named, perfectly appropriate, has a wonderful mission, but the provisions of this program are being accomplished elsewhere in the Federal Government. 
   Now, it may be hard for the Chair of the Appropriations Committee to believe that there is some duplication in the Federal Government, but it is not hard for the citizens of the Sixth District of Georgia to believe that there is duplication. The name of the program that accomplishes this same end is the Vocational Rehabilitation State Grants Program. 
   The goal of the gentleman from New Jersey, I don't believe, is to eliminate the ability to have appropriate programs for migrant and seasonal farm workers. That is not the goal at all. The goal is to responsibly spend hard-earned taxpayer money in accomplishing the appropriate priorities of the Federal Government. So to have anybody come to the floor and say that anybody who would support this amendment desires to end the programs for migrant and seasonal farm workers is simply not true and not the case, and it doesn't appropriately represent the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   Mr. Chairman, I commend him for his desire to make certain that we do not provide duplicative services which are wasteful, wasteful of hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   I am pleased to yield to my friend from New Jersey.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman for his comments. The point about the demonstration project precisely gets to the point of so many of these programs. We do a poor job as a Federal Government in looking at programs that we put in place as pilots or demonstration projects to determine whether or not their effectiveness has been met. 
   I will have an amendment in a little bit that addresses a program whose mission and goal has been achieved and yet it continues to have money coming from the Federal Government. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for the confusion. I apologize for rising early. 
   This amendment is a simple amendment. It addresses the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership program and would end the funding for this program, saving $65 million of hard-earned taxpayer money. The rationale is, as the administration has described and as has been recommended by the Secretary of Education's Commission on the Future of Higher Education, virtually every State operates programs to a much larger degree than the Federal Government that address this very same issue. 
   As I mentioned just a moment ago when I rose to another amendment, we here in Washington enact all sorts of pilot programs and all sorts of trial programs, and so very often, in fact probably more often than not, we don't go back and look as a Federal Government to see whether or not the goal or the mission of those programs has been accomplished. 
   Rarely, in fact, I would suggest, do we see if the goal has been accomplished. This is one in which there has been great success. The mission and the goal of the program has indeed been accomplished. It has accomplished its original objective of stimulating all States to establish need-based post-secondary student grant programs. However, beyond the establishment of these programs, the LEAP program, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership program itself, does little to encourage States to increase their investment in grant aid for their neediest of students or effectively targets this aid to students who could most benefit from it. 
   When we do look, when the Department of Education and when the Office of Management and Budget performs its assessment and reviews this program, what it says is, at this point, because the mission has been accomplished, the results of any further funding for this program are clearly not demonstrated. So in an effort to achieve again some fiscal responsibility and in an effort to decrease some of the significant waste that does occur at the Federal level, I encourage my colleagues to accept and vote for the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for obtaining time, and I appreciate the chairman's comments. 
   Again, the purpose of this amendment is to address wasteful spending. It is a significant responsibility that we have here in the House to make certain that the money we spend, which is hard-earned taxpayer money, is spent wisely. I know there is huge animosity on the other side of the aisle against the President. I think sometimes that animosity actually blinds individuals to some quality work that is coming  from the administration. There are high-quality people who work in the administration, this administration, just like every other administration. In fact, there are high-quality people in the Department of Education and there are high-quality people in the Office of Management and Budget who looked at this problem and said that the goals and the mission of this program have, indeed, been accomplished. It was a wonderful program, served a grand purpose, but the goals and the missions have been accomplished. Consequently, it is appropriate, if we are going to be responsible with hard-earned taxpayer money, to end a program that has accomplished its mission, accomplished its goals, and not continue wasteful Federal spending.     
   So I would urge my colleagues, I know that they can be blinded by animosity for the President and for the administration, but I would urge my colleagues to listen to those hardworking individuals in the Federal Government who are looking at these programs and attempting to find cost savings for the American public so that we can prioritize on other programs. 
   That's what this amendment does. It seeks to be responsible with hard-earned taxpayer money. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back to the gentleman from New Jersey.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the leadership on both sides of the aisle for this issue. 
   I am heartened by the stated enthusiasm of the members of the majority party for the Taxpayer Protection Act. I am remarkably encouraged. 
   Today being tax day, it is appropriate that we speak about this issue, and it is mostly good work. I would commend the individuals who worked on this. It is mostly good work, but I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that real protection requires real reform, and the real solution to the challenges that we face as Americans, all of us in our tax system, is that we need fundamental reform. 
   This is an appropriate bill and kind of tinkers with the margins of our tax system, and I think those modifications are, as I mentioned, appropriate and a step in the right direction; but our current system is extremely regressive and extremely unfair. 
   So, to talk about the earned income tax credit, it's an appropriate thing to notify people who don't know that they are eligible for that. However, there are embedded taxes in everything that we purchase that make our system right now much more regressive than it ought be. 
   There is legislation available that would, in fact, promote fundamental reform. It would capture all of the underground economy that is fully a third of our current economy, nearly $1 trillion. It would reward those kinds of things that we say that we want, like hard work and success and entrepreneurship and vision and all those wonderful American ideals. 
   That bill is H.R. 25. It is the fair tax, the national retail sales tax. It would bring about true fundamental reform and would bring about true protection for the American taxpayer. 
   So I commend the individuals who brought forward H.R. 1677, and I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this is a small step in the right direction. However, real reform requires real change. Fundamental reform to our tax system is what is needed, and I am hopeful that in relatively short order we will be able to embrace each other with real fundamental reform to our entire tax system on the floor of this House.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, thank you so very much. 
   Before I begin, I do want to just say that our hearts, our thoughts, and our prayers are with all at Virginia Tech and in Blacksburg, Virginia, today. As you know, Madam Speaker, an unspeakable horror visited their campus, and it is absolutely impossible for any of us to know what those who were directly connected to it are going through. We were so incredibly heartened by their convocation today as we watched it, and we noted that Hokie spirit is effervescent and incredibly supportive. We are all with the Hokie Nation today. We wish them the best and know that they are comforted by each other and by God's amazing grace. 
   Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege for me to come to the floor again this evening. I want to thank the leadership for the opportunity to share some comments and to discuss an issue that our friends just finished talking about a little bit. 
   This is a remarkable day every year. Madam Speaker, as you know, today is once again the day when Americans reach deep into their pockets and they pay Uncle Sam. Many Americans may be filling out their tax forms right now, or they have just finished slogging through the maze of the Tax Code jargon and crunching numbers and filling out form after form after form. And today, Americans all across this Nation will once again trust Washington with their money, because today is tax  day. It is usually April 15; by a couple different factors it became April 17 this year. But nonetheless, Madam Speaker, it is tax day. 
   And I would suggest, Madam Speaker, that Americans are fed up with the status quo of today, and I and many of my colleagues believe that Americans deserve a different tomorrow. They deserve a tomorrow where they won't be taxed from the day they are born until the day that they die and at every single point in between. 
   Americans deserve a tomorrow where saving and investing are virtues, not vices. Americans deserve a tomorrow where taxation brings efficient and responsible representation, and they deserve a tomorrow where, when the American people do their part, they understand that paying their fair share is enough. And they deserve a tomorrow where the government respects their hard work and appreciates their sacrifice. Only then, Madam Speaker, will tomorrow be any different than today. 
   We are going to talk and discuss this evening the issue of taxes, the tax structure that we have in our Nation that supports so many, many things. We are going to talk about its fairness or lack of fairness. We are going to talk about the amount of money that is received and whether or not there are any options. 
   We are going to talk about positive solutions. And as we do so, we like, when we come to the floor, to talk about facts. I want to talk about facts. And I will remind my colleagues of one of our favorite quotes. One of my favorite quotes comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said that ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.'' And so it is, Madam Speaker, that as we come and talk about facts as they relate to taxes, it is important that we use correct figures, that we use accurate figures. 
   One of the figures that I ran across when looking at the tax issue and realizing how large our government has grown and how many taxes the Washington government takes, in 2005 the Federal Government took in about $2.4 trillion. That is an awful lot of money, Madam Speaker, and it is sometimes hard to kind of get your arms around what that actually means. Well, in a relatively short period of time, less than 50 years, what that means, based upon accounting for inflation and accounting for growth, is that that amount of money is larger than the entire U.S. economy was in 1959. So in less than one person's lifetime we have grown the amount of tax revenue, and this is in constant dollars, real dollars, we have grown the amount of tax revenue larger than our entire government was and the economy was in 1959. So it is truly remarkable. 
   And what that brings about, Madam Speaker, is that we ought to be, as representatives of the people, asking questions. Is that appropriate? Is that an appropriate policy for our Nation? Should we be modifying things? Should we be changing things? Should we be potentially more fair to the American people? What should we be doing? 
   And so we will be joined tonight by a number of colleagues. One of my good friends and fellow colleagues from Georgia is Congressman Phil Gingrey. Congressman Gingrey is a fellow physician, represents a district right outside of the city of Atlanta. I served with him in the State senate, and it is a privilege to serve with him here in the United States Congress. He is one of the true fiscal conservatives, an individual who understands and appreciates the importance of tax revenue, yes, but also the importance of fairness on the part of our Federal Government. 
   So I am pleased to welcome my good friend from Georgia, Congressman Gingrey.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend and colleague from Georgia for your comments, for your perspective, and for the truth and the facts that you bring to the table, and you mentioned a number of them. I would just like to highlight two of them because they are incredibly important, Madam Speaker, for the American people to appreciate. The first is that Tax Freedom Day. We talk about tax day, but Tax Freedom Day has yet to arrive. Depending on what State you are in, I think the earliest State, Tax Freedom Day is April 22, which is next week. But what that means, Madam Speaker, is that every single American who has been working since the first of the year, on average, every single one, is continuing to work from January 1 until now, through at least April 22 to pay the taxes that they owe. They haven't even started to work for themselves or their family. Madam Speaker, that is a tax system that is broken and flawed. 
   The other fact that you brought out, my good friend from Georgia, Congressman Gingrey brought out, was that the proposal that was passed on this floor just a little over two weeks ago by our friends on the other side of the aisle, many of whom call themselves Blue Dogs. We are checking to make certain, Madam Speaker. We think they are probably lap dogs because of the bills that they have been supporting. And one of them was this budget that was passed that will result in a $400 billion tax increase for the American people, the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation. That is a fact. 
   I want to mention a couple of other facts and then call on a couple of other good friends who have joined me this evening. Oftentimes, Madam Speaker, you hear people say, well, the wealthy in this Nation don't pay any taxes, or they get a remarkable tax benefit, that they are given favored treatment. You hear that oftentimes by our friends on the other side. 
   This chart, Madam Speaker, really points out the truth. These are actual numbers and actual facts. And that is that the top 1 percent of wage earners in this Nation, the top 1 percent, pay 36.9 percent of the taxes. That is, the top 1 percent pay 36.9 percent of the taxes. If you take the top 10 percent of wage earners in this Nation, the taxes that they pay, the total revenue that they pay in terms of taxes for this Nation, 68.2 percent. And the top half, the top 50 percent pay 96.7 percent of the tax revenue that comes into this Nation. Madam Speaker, that is a fact. It is important to appreciate that because our good friends on the other side of the aisle so often want to play class warfare. They want to pit one side against the other. And what this shows very, very clearly is that individuals all across this Nation are paying their fair share and then some. 
   I have been joined by many good friends who will comment about various aspects of our tax system and tax policy, as well as the budget that has been proposed. And right now I would like to ask a good friend from Texas to join me, and look forward to his comments, Congressman Kevin Brady from Texas, who has a wonderful business background and appreciates the importance of appropriate government policy and making certain that we allow all Americans, all Americans, the greatest opportunity in this wonderful Nation. Congressman Brady, thanks so much for joining us.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas for his wonderful summary of the remarkable taxes that each and every one of us are exposed to on a daily basis, everything we do. And that is why I say that the American people deserve more than that. They deserve a government that is more fair than that, especially in the area of taxation. The $2,700 for each individual in Texas is about what they would pay, if the policies of the other side go through, about what they would pay in the State of Georgia as well. And the folks have a lot of ability to figure out what they ought to do with that money and a greater priority that they ought to do with that money, as opposed to what the government ought to do with that money. So as most people understand and appreciate, they know how to spend their money better than the Federal Government. 
   And somebody mentioned earlier today that the Federal Government, whenever they do anything on behalf of the American people, it costs three times as much as it would in the private sector. So that even gets to the point more about what the facts of the situation are and why they belie what we are doing, why they would draw anyone to the appropriate conclusion that we are taxed too much as a Nation. 
   I have got a few other folks who have joined me, and I appreciate it so much. And I am joined by my good friend from North Carolina, Congressman McHenry, who also is an individual who has served in the State legislature and knows well the importance of fiscal responsibility and the importance of making certain that we don't overtax our Americans all across this Nation. I welcome you. I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from North Carolina and I appreciate his perspective. And I think he said a couple of important things. One was that he pointed out that the average American spends almost 40 hours preparing his or her taxes. That is one whole week's worth of work. That is 2 percent of the productive time of each and every American spent just on the unproductive activity of preparing their tax returns. If that doesn't scream for reform, Madam Speaker, I am not sure what does. 
   I am pleased to be joined by another good friend, a new Member of Congress, a freshman Member from Tennessee, Congressman David Davis, who I know has run a business and understands the importance of the economy's being vibrant, of the appropriate level of taxes not just for businesses but for individuals. 
   And I appreciate your joining us tonight and look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend from Tennessee for his eloquent comments and for really bringing perspective to the issue. 
   It really befuddles me as to how our friends on the other side of the aisle can say that they need to raise taxes to raise revenue, because if you look at this chart, Madam Speaker, what you appreciate is that as revenues were going down in the early part of this decade, what the solution was, as it is always a solution, is to lower taxes and you allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money. You put more money back in the pockets of American people and what happens? The economy flourishes, and lo and behold we have a record $2.4 trillion of revenue to the Federal Government because of decreased taxes. 
   I am so proud to be joined by my good friends tonight to talk about this issue. And we are pleased to welcome once again Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, an individual who also knows and appreciates the importance of fiscal responsibility and the importance that allowing individuals to keep more of their hard-earned money means to their own freedom and their own liberty. I welcome you and look forward to your comments this evening.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I brought along a number of charts. And we are not getting to a lot of them, but some of them we will. 
   This chart is an important one because this shows the mandatory spending growth, something I like to coin actually ``automatic spending growth'' because it is not mandatory. The Federal Government has determined that that is where we are going to spend money. And it automatically increases. These are the automatic programs, which are basically Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid; and unless they see reforms, what we will have seen from 1995 to 2017 is an increase from 48.7 percent to 62.2 percent of our economy.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. This chart really points that out, ``Ignoring Entitlement Reform,'' which is exactly what occurred 2 1/2 weeks ago when our friends passed our budget. 
   When the Republicans were in charge, with the Balanced Budget Act  we passed in 1987 we saved nearly $130 billion. With the Deficit Reduction Act just a few short years ago in 2005, about $40 billion. With the budget that was adopted 2 1/2 weeks ago, none, zero. No entitlement reform. No automatic spending reform. And consequently, what you know and what I know is that we are on track to spend that 62.2 percent in a few very short years.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for her perspective and for her passion for appropriate policies here out of Washington on behalf of the American people. 
   And you've heard a lot about what our friends on the other side of the aisle have proposed. And it is important to the look at the numbers, Madam Speaker, the numbers on what has been proposed by our good friends on the other side of the aisle when the clock strikes midnight on December 21, 2010. 
   They have proposed and they have enacted a budget that will result in increasing the ordinary income rates from 35 percent to 39.6 percent; increasing capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent; increasing dividends from 15 percent to 39.6 percent; increasing estate taxes from zero percent to 55 percent; decreasing the child tax credit from $1,000 to $500; and, amazingly, increasing the lowest tax bracket from 10 percent to 15 percent. A remarkable $400 billion in new taxes, a remarkable display of, frankly, lack of appreciation and lack of respect for the American worker. 
   Now what is the solution? A lot of things can be done. What we would propose and have proposed is something that respects American values and I believe results in increasing American vision, and that is a taxpayer bill of rights, a Federal taxpayer bill of rights. Many folks will recognize the sound of that because there are some States around this Nation that have indeed enacted a taxpayer bill of rights. The problem at the State level, however, is that all they can address is State revenue, State money.     
   But, Madam Speaker, because of the actions of our friends on the other side of the aisle and because they want to dig deeper, we believe strongly that a taxpayer bill of rights is appropriate for the Federal Government. We believe that taxpayers have a right to a Federal Government that does not grow beyond their ability to pay for it. That means that the Federal Government ought not grow more than the population grows or more than the cost of living increases, and that can be put into law and that is what part of the taxpayer bill of rights does. 
   We also believe that Americans have a right to receive back every single dollar that they entrust to the American people for their retirement. That is the Social Security issue, Madam Speaker. Right now the Federal Government, right now Washington spends money that the American people send to Washington to cover for their Social Security compensation, and what does Washington do, oftentimes it spends it on other programs. That is not right and it is not fair. I hear about it when I am back home, and I suspect you do as well. 
   We believe taxpayers have a right to a balanced budget without raising taxes. You can balance the budget in one of two ways. You can raise taxes to try to increase revenue, which doesn't actually work, but you can have it work on paper. You can increase taxes and say, well, we will balance the budget that way, which is what our friends on the other side of the aisle have done. They say we will increase taxes $400 billion, and that is the way we will balance the budget. 
   Madam Speaker, there is another way you can balance the budget, and that is by decreasing spending, and that is what we would propose through a taxpayer bill of rights. 
   Fourth, we would propose fundamental and fair tax reform. My good friend from Texas mentioned earlier the proposal for a flat tax. That is one way to do it. I support the fair tax, the national retail sales tax, something that would do away with the IRS, do away with that organization that so many Americans dread and results in so much pain and heartache on the part of the American people. 
   Finally, a taxpayer bill of rights that would require a supermajority for any increase in taxes for our Nation, something that was in effect until the very first day of this Congress when this new majority said, ``no,'' we ought not have a supermajority to increase taxes, we ought to let a simple majority do it which results in a huge opportunity for an increase in taxation and has resulted in, by this new majority, policies which will significantly increase taxes. 
   So, Madam Speaker, what we have done tonight is outlined the problem, outlined the history, talked about what kinds of solutions can be proposed and what we would propose in the way of an appropriate Federal taxpayer bill of rights. 
   I would like to close with a quote from Thomas Jefferson who had a perspective on taxation. He said: ``To take from one because it is thought his own industry has acquired too much, in order to spare others who have not exercised equal industry and skill is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it.'' That was Thomas Jefferson, Madam Speaker. 
   Madam Speaker, each and every one of us is remarkably privileged to serve in this House of Representatives. It is an honor to represent my constituents, as I know each Member feels it is an honor to represent theirs. We live in a wondrous and glorious nation, the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world, a nation that has resulted in, because of its actions, more freedom and more prosperity for more individuals than any nation in the history of mankind. 
   It is commonsense and responsibility on behalf of the Members who represent all of the constituents across this Nation that have resulted in those policies. I, as I know my colleagues who have been here this evening, look forward to working with Members on both sides of the aisle to bring about that accountability and responsibility, and to bring about the kind of credit and honor to our constituents that they so richly deserve by their labor. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to making certain that we hold each other accountable to establish the  kinds of policies that are appropriate and the kinds of policies that will result in the greatest amount of prosperity and freedom for future generations of Americans.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Tennessee for yielding and for her leadership on this issue, and I am pleased to join my friend from Texas, as well as my good friend from North Carolina, who is yet to come. I appreciate her bringing great focus to this issue, because, Mr. Speaker, if the casual observer were to give you a description of what they thought was going on here in Washington, they would say, Oh, well, they are being much more responsible. They are not spending as much money as they have in the past. All sorts of wonderful things are happening. They would say so because this new majority has captured what I have called ``Orwellian democracy.'' They are talking the talk, Mr. Speaker, but they are not walking the walk. 
   So I appreciate my friend from Tennessee for taking the leadership and making certain that we bring focus to what truly is happening here in Washington under this new leadership. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle, as you say, this is the first day of the new fiscal year. It is a great opportunity to look back and see what has happened over the last fiscal year that they have been in charge and to look forward. But if what has happened to date is any harbinger of what is to come in the future, Mr. Speaker, we have got real problems, because, as you know, Mr. Speaker, not a single appropriations bill of the 12 annual appropriations bills has made it to the President's desk yet, and we are done with the last fiscal year. The new fiscal year has begun today. 
   They didn't make it to the President's desk because this new majority has picked up right where they left off when they were last in the majority back in 1994 with more taxing and more spending. It is the spending that has our attention tonight, and through so many different areas. 
   This new majority is interested in spending over $23 billion in new money, new Federal money, and that is just the beginning. That is just the beginning. That is what they have appropriated, not what they have authorized to be spent, which is truly hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   But $23 billion is what separates responsible spending from the new majority, which is why we haven't gotten any of the appropriations bills to the President's desk and signed. 
   What we are talking about tonight is a portion of all of that, and that is the issue of earmarks, the issue of special projects, the issue of spending that gets into bills, oftentimes late at night and oftentimes behind closed doors; little projects that one Member or two in Congress make certain are inserted into bills. It is an earmark process, it is a special project process that we on our side, when we were in the majority recognized, albeit a little late, but recognized that it had significant potential for huge abuse. Some of our former colleagues, in fact, have different residences right now because of that abuse. They violated the law and were held to account. 
   So what we did as a majority before the end of last year was to pass a rule that said that all earmarks, all special projects, had to be disclosed. Whether they were in tax bills, whether they were in authorizing bills or whether they were in appropriations bills, every one of them had to be disclosed: who asked for it and how much did they ask for. 
   Mr. Speaker, that makes a lot of sense, doesn't it? It is called sunshine. Sunshine for earmarks, we called it. It is what the American people desire. It is what the American people deserve. It is what my constituents home in Georgia say that is what we want. We want to know who is asking for these things. 
   We instituted this program. One would have thought, given the talk that we heard from this new majority, that when they took over that would have been one of those commonsense reforms they would have continued. That would have made a whole lot of sense. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, as you know, that is not what happened. In fact, there was to be no disclosure of individuals who requested earmarks, as my friend from Tennessee knows; and we fought, Republicans fought tooth and nail to make certain that disclosure occurred in appropriations bills before any were passed. This happened in May and June of this year. 
   Finally, finally, the new majority relented and said, Okay, we will allow for disclosure of who is asking for those earmarks, but that is not true for authorizing bills or tax bills. So what we see in these bills, as my friend from Texas cited, is these projects that get pushed into these bills that have special rewards for certain Members of Congress and their districts. We see it in all sorts of bills. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you will remember, last week we passed in this House of Representatives the SCHIP bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program bill. One wouldn't think that you would need to sway Members' votes on that from a majority standpoint. Just let the bill stand or fall on its merits. The issue of those merits is another debate. But what we saw in that bill were earmarks, special projects for Members on the majority side to sway their vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is not what my constituents want; it is not what the American people want. 
   That might not even be so bad if they were disclosed, if people knew what was happening; if the Member had to stand in this Chamber before his or her colleagues and offer the justification for those programs, if they would stand before their constituents at home and offer justification for those programs. 
   But one of the things that really gets in the craw of my constituents, and I know those of my good friend from Tennessee, is the arrogance with which this new majority has fashioned these programs, the incredible arrogance, once again, saying one thing and doing another. 
   As my friend from Tennessee, Mrs. Blackburn stated, you can get this kind of information at CQ.com, Mr. Speaker, if you like. You may not have seen it. I would ask you to look it up. 
   They had an article today, as a matter of fact, asking: ``Do you want to know how your tax dollars are being spent in Washington?'' And the response is: ``Tough (expletive).'' They are quoting a very powerful Member of the majority party. 
   That is what is so distressing, Mr. Speaker. There is an arrogance about this majority. There is an arrogance that exceeds anything that anybody has ever seen in this Chamber, and there is a culture of excessive Washington spending that I believe the American people are sick and tired of. 
   So when you see this kind of activity going on in the committees, in the authorizing committees and in the tax committees and in the appropriations committees, where Members of this Congress are attempting to hide from their constituents and from other Members of Congress what is in these bills, who is asking for it, how much money and how do I identify it, and when a reporter in fact asks a very senior Member of the majority party how to find out ``how much money for which projects are in this bill,'' that Member of Congress says, ``Tough (expletive).''     
   Mr. Speaker, that is not befitting of this House. That is not befitting of the institution that you and I were elected to hold a seat in. That is not befitting of the responsibilities that our constituents desire us to have when we come to this House of Representatives. 
   So what is the solution? Mr. Speaker, the solution at this point in time for this issue is H. Res. 479. We have a resolution that we would like to get debated on this floor, to have a debate on this floor that says just what we have talked about, to disclose who is asking for these special projects, who is asking for these earmarks, whether it is in appropriation bills, authorizing bills or tax bills. It is a resolution that sits in one of the committees controlled by the majority side. There is an opportunity for all Members of this House to say we ought to be voting on that. It is called a discharge petition. There we have 193 Members who signed to bring that resolution to the floor and debate it and vote on it. It takes 218, which is the majority here. So it is going to take some Democrats. So 193 Members have signed that discharge petition. Not a single Democrat has signed that discharge petition.  
   So, Mr. Speaker, I challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who said during their campaign and even come to the floor of this Chamber and say now: We want earmarks disclosed. We want people to know who has been asking for these special projects. So sign the discharge petition, and it will give us a great opportunity to debate this issue on the floor of the house during a legislative session, during a time when we are talking about adopting legislation and making certain that sunshine is present for earmarks. 
   So I want to commend my friend from Tennessee for her leadership on this issue, for bringing this issue into focus, and for making certain that we fight day in and day out on behalf of the American taxpayer whose money it is that we are given the responsibility for.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE HOUSE HAS GONE HOME WITHOUT PASSING THE PROTECT AMERICA ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 28, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it is now 12:17 p.m. This House came into session today at 10 a.m., 2 hours and 17 minutes ago. Across this Nation, many folks at work are taking a lunch break, others are probably preparing to go to lunch. Those on the second shift  are getting ready to go to work. Those on the night shift are resting or sleeping so they can recover from last night's work and get back and do it again tonight. So, where's the House? Mr. Speaker, the House has gone home. The House has gone home. 
   Today, we dealt with seven resolutions, seven suspensions, seven bills that I think every person voted for completely, entirely. I don't mean to belittle these resolutions, five of them were to name post offices, United States Post Offices. And although that's not the most important thing we do, we honor individuals when we do so, and the individuals who were honored today were certainly deserving of that honor. Two other resolutions were to determine what the Congress will do with the United States Capitol during next year's Presidential inauguration. 
   Now, why is this important? Well, it's important because the Protect America Act, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, has been allowed to expire by this leadership, by the Democrat leadership of this House. Thirteen days now we've been blind, a unilateral disarmament of this Nation in our war on terror. You don't have to believe me, Mr. Speaker. A newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts, yes, Springfield, Massachusetts, said, ``Led by Speaker  Nancy Pelosi, the House let a crucial deadline come and go without even taking a vote on the matter. And it didn't have to be this way. Both parties in the Senate cooperated, setting aside their differences to try to keep the citizenry safe. The House should have done the same thing. Only our enemies gain from this kind of political gamesmanship.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, many Members on our side of the aisle have come to this well and to the microphones over the last 5 or 6 days that we've been in session and talked about the extreme importance of making certain that the Protect America Act is passed. I was on a radio station this morning in our good State of Georgia, and people on the radio show couldn't believe that the House had let this opportunity, this responsibility go. The folks in my district in the 6th District in Georgia believe that the primary responsibility of every single Member who has the privilege of serving in this House is to protect our Nation. 
   Many Members of the House travel to Iraq, back and forth to Iraq, some who went just last week and were told by generals in Iraq that not passing the Protect America Act 13 days ago has led to a decrease in their actionable intelligence in Iraq already. Don't let anybody tell you, Mr. Speaker, that this hasn't put America at greater harm in the last 13 days because it has. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for this House to act responsibly. It's time for this Speaker and this Democrat leadership to stand up and make certain that we pass the Protect America Act.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, when I go home and I talk to my constituents, they understand and appreciate that it is the primary responsibility of Congress to protect our Nation. All Americans believe we should be able to determine what terrorists are saying to terrorists overseas. Playing politics with our Nation's intelligence capabilities only serves to harm our national security. And despite proof of a bipartisan majority of support in the Senate which passed the FISA bill 68-29, House Democrat leadership allowed these protections to expire without a vote. To expire without a vote. Astounding, Mr. Speaker. 
   We're now 13 days into a unilateral disarmament on the part of our Nation.  The ability to obtain the right information at the right time is of critical importance in our struggle against radical terrorists who hide among civilian populations and quietly plot deadly attacks. The Protect America Act moved our intelligence capabilities in the right direction. The Senate understood that in a bipartisan way. The American people understand that. We hope and pray that the Speaker and the Democrat leadership will come to their senses and allow a vote on the Protect America Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the leadership for allowing me to come to the floor of the House this evening and spend another hour of The Official Truth Squad, a group of individuals who come to the floor at least once a week, we try to, at least, to try to shed a little light, a little correct view on the situations that occur here in our Nation's Capital and especially here on the House floor. 
   This group grew out of some frustration by Members on the Republican side of the aisle who felt that there was less light and less truthfulness being spoken here on the floor of the House, and that so often, because of the constrained rules on the floor of the House, we and others were prevented from bringing those instances to light. So we started what we call The Official Truth Squad, and the leadership has been very kind in allowing us to shed that light, bring that truth to the Members of the House and hopefully set the record straight so often. 
   We have many favorite sayings. One of them that I enjoy most is one from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who said that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitle to their own facts. 
   When you think about it, it's so very true here that if we were to deal more in fact that we would have a much better debate, a much better discussion, a discussion that would be much more appropriate for the American people, and live up to the charge that we have all been given, that is, to represent our constituents to the best ability that we have. 
   But facts oftentimes don't hold the day here. But, hopefully, during this hour we will be able to bring some light to some very interesting matters that have been brought before the House and some that are yet to come in the days and the weeks ahead. 
   It has been a curious time here in Washington since the beginning of the year. It's a time of what I have called and dubbed Orwellian democracy, Orwellian democracy, because so often what we see is the party in charge, the majority party, says one thing and then does something completely different. So it harkens back to the author, George Orwell, and the double speak that he highlighted. 
   It's, sadly, distressing that the leadership on the other side of the aisle seems to be all politics all the time. It's a shame, because we both have just gotten back in town from a week of district work period, and I know that you likely heard what I heard at home, and that is that folks are frustrated and oftentimes disgusted with the kind of activity that goes on here in Washington, the kind of lack of debate, the lack of open and honest discussion. The all politics all the time is very frustrating to my constituents, and, I suspect, to those of yours as well. 
   Tomorrow is one of those days that will be a classic example of all politics all the time. The majority party has seen fit to bring forth, and you have heard a lot of folks talk about the issue this evening on the other side of the aisle, but they have seen fit to bring forth another resolution on the war in Iraq. It's curious that it comes literally just hours after the Speaker of the House had an individual stand up, who is known to folks far and wide across this Nation, and say that she was going to challenge the Speaker in the next election. So it appears that the timeliness of this resolution may be, again, all politics all the time in response to an electoral challenge that may be coming upon the Speaker of the House. 
   But the sad part about all of this, as it relates to the war in Iraq, and we are going to talk about a number of issues tonight, but the sad part about the resolution that's coming up tomorrow is that it is all just politics. It's not anything about real policy debates for the American people; it's not about real action. This Congress, this House and the Senate, said relatively recently that we were going to allow the reinforcements to run their course in Iraq, that we are going to allow General David Petraeus, who is on the ground there, along with credible fortitude and gallantry on the part of the American men and women, that we were going to allow the increase in the reenforcements of the American troops to run their course and see whether or not there was progress being made.  
   Now, just a few short weeks after the number of individuals have increased in Iraq, the majority party says, oh, no, we really didn't mean that, we need a new bumper sticker, we need a new headline, so they are going to bring a resolution on Iraq tomorrow. It is really a shame and very sad, because it, again, doesn't add anything to the debate, doesn't do anything other than highlight the politics of this majority party and the fact that they are having extreme difficulty getting any real accomplishments. So they bring another very politically motivated resolution on the war in Iraq, Orwellian democracy, saying one thing and doing another. 
   We have been told this is going to be the most open and honest Congress, most open and honest Congress ever. Well, the facts of the matter, the facts of the matter are that this is one of the most closed and clandestine Congresses ever to grace the American public. It is really a shame, again, really a shame, because issues aren't being debated the way that they should. We will talk very specifically about one of those issues tonight. 
   I want to highlight a couple areas where Orwellian democracy is holding forth and living and surviving well with this new majority. As you know well, this new majority came to power, and they said we are going to cut spending, we are going to decrease spending; we are going to be more responsible with spending hard-earned taxpayer money out there. 
   What does this new majority do? They increase spending. They couldn't wait to criticize all the spending that went on under the charge of the Republican Party when we were in the majority. So what they said, in essence, you spent so much, and it was so awful, that 
   we are going to spend more. That's what they have done. They have increased spending by over $25 billion, $25 billion in the appropriations bills so far, and we are barely halfway through, if that, of the appropriations bills. 
   I would suggest to the American people that it's time to put your hands squarely on your wallet, because the true tax-and-spend majority is back in charge, and it's of great concern, I know, to my constituents and, I suspect, if you talk to yours as well. 
   When they adopted their budget, they adopted a budget that includes the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, nearly $400 billion tax increase. Again, not what they said they were going to do, and not what they said they have done, as a matter of fact. That's why it's Orwellian democracy, because they won't even fess up and own up to the fact, the fact that they have passed a budget that includes the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation. 
   Then they go on and they talk about fiscal responsibility. In fact, many Members have posters outside their offices up here in Washington. Some constituents may have come by the Halls of Congress and seen the posters. The posters look wonderful. They talk about the need for fiscal responsibility, and the amount of the debt, the amount of the deficit. But, in fact, when given the opportunity to decrease the debt, and to decrease the deficit, what happens is that they continually say no. Orwellian democracy is alive and well. 
   Just today, just today we passed a bill that was the reauthorization of the higher education act for our Nation. But it didn't just reauthorize the act and provide more money for students of low-income, and ``low'' means to be able to attend colleges and universities. No, it didn't just do that. What it did in addition to that was to create nine new entitlement programs, nine new entitlement programs. 
   Now, entitlement programs are really a misnomer. They are programs that are on automatic pilot here. They are mandatory spending. They are programs that get started, and they never, ever end, because they are not able to be touched by the kind of discretionary spending that Congress has more control over. They just spend on and on and on, year after year. 
   Yes, this majority created nine new entitlement programs that will spend upwards of $18 billion in just a few short years, a new $18 billion. So there are nine new entitlements, no reform, no reform listed for the entitlement programs, which brings me to this issue of mandatory spending growth that we have seen in our Nation. 
   It's comprised of all sorts of mandatory spending programs, entitlement programs; but there are three that kind of highlight the major problem that we have. Of the nine new ones that they passed today, however, they may grow into being as important as these three, but the three are Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Those three programs, in and of themselves, comprise about 54 percent of our Federal budget right now, about 54 percent of our Federal budget. Our mandatory programs are mainly Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
   The reason that's important is because these programs are mandatory, because they are on kind of automatic pilot, the amount of money, hard-earned American taxpayer money that comes to Washington that is spent on those programs increases gradually every single year. 
   So what this chart here shows, these pie charts here show is that in 1995, those three programs comprised about 48.7 percent of the Federal budget, about half of the Federal budget just 12 short years ago. Now, as I mentioned, about 54, 55 percent of the Federal budget is comprised of these mandatory, automatic-spending programs. 
   In a few short years, 2017, it will be about 62, 63 percent of the Federal budget. That's important because one would think that if you looked at that slope of increase in spending, slope of increase in total spending of the mandatory programs, as it relates to the Federal budget, in a relatively short period of time, it's true, as you know, that those three programs will comprise the entire Federal budget, the entire Federal budget, about 2030, 2035, somewhere in that range, which is within the lifetime of most of us here in this Chamber and certainly the vast majority of the citizens in our districts. 
   That's important because something has got to change. You can't have these programs continue as they are without appropriate and responsible reform. 
   So one would think that the party in charge would say, well, we have got to look at these, and we have got to make certain that we reform these programs, otherwise we are going to have all of the Federal money going to these three programs. 
   When our party, my party, was in charge, what we attempted to do was to appropriately reform these programs and work diligently to make that happen. 
   So in 1997, with the Balanced Budget Act, we passed entitlement reform. We decreased the slope of that line. Now, we didn't end it, because of the difficulty in doing that, there are ways to do that, but it's extremely difficult both politically and financially to do that. 
   But in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we increased by about $137 billion the entitlement mandatory spending over a period of time. In fact, in the Deficit Reduction Act of 2 years ago, of 2005, it was about $40 billion in reform, reform spending in those entitlement programs. It makes it so that the hard-earned taxpayer money is more responsibly spent, that it makes it so that we work diligently to decrease the deficit and to decrease the debt. 
   One would again believe that looking at the previous charts, and realizing that these programs are expanding exponentially, and that they are very, very soon to comprise a much greater portion of the Federal budget, one would say, well, the party in charge probably, when they adopted a budget, they would bring about some appropriate reform to mandatory programs. That's what I expected. It's what my constituents expected. 
   Frankly, I think it's what the American people expected when they went to the polls and voted last November. They expected a more bold process for reform of automatic mandatory spending. Many of us on our side of the aisle would have been in support of that. 
   But what happened? You see over on the far right of this chart, it shows the amount of entitlement reform under this new leadership. Do you remember Orwellian democracy, the talk about fiscal responsibility, the talk about importance for entitlement reform, the talk about reforming the Federal Government, making it run more efficiently?  
   Well, what happened is that the budget was adopted by this new majority that had no entitlement reform, none. In fact, as I mentioned earlier today, nine new entitlement programs adopted, put into place, one could make an argument that that not ought to be zero, that ought to be minus, that this new majority is going in the wrong direction. When they talk about a new direction for America, there is a new direction for America, but it's the wrong direction. It's the direction of greater debt and greater deficit and greater fiscal irresponsibility.     
   That is not what the American people bargained for. I have no doubt about it. Which brings us to the issue that I would like to spend a fair amount of time on this evening. 
   There is a proposal coming forward later this month, within maybe just a few short days, that will address the SCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance program. This is a program that is near and dear to my heart. Mr. Speaker, as you may remember, before I came to Congress, I was a physician. I was an orthopedic surgeon. I spent over 20 years practicing orthopedic surgery in Atlanta. And one of the things that drove me in to politics, to stand up and say, I would like to serve my constituents in the public in this way, was a belief that there were individuals both in my State capital and in Washington that thought they had a better idea, about almost anything, but especially a better idea about health care; that they thought that they could make better decisions about health care than the people involved; that is, patients. 
   So the SCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, is one of those that I think highlights one of the fundamental differences, one of the fundamental flaws in this Orwellian Democratic leadership, which is that they say one thing and then do something completely different. Because what they will say is that they are interested in reforming the system and bringing greater health care, more health care for more children across our Nation, and, Mr. Speaker, what they will do and what they will propose is in fact a program that will move us one step closer, one step further down the road to a nationalized health insurance program and also one step closer to a program that will make it so that patients, parents, doctors are unable to make health care decisions. It is not what the American people bargained for, there is no doubt about it. 
   This new majority is obviously driven by the left in our Nation, driven by, I think, a small minority of individuals who firmly believe, again, that the government knows best; that the government knows best how to make all sorts of decisions. But in this instance it is personal. It is personal for every single American. Certainly it is personal for the children in these programs; because what this program is saying and what is being proposed is that the government, that Washington knows better what kind of health care you need, and we make better decisions. We, politicians, bureaucrats here in Washington, make better decisions than individuals, than individuals, than children and their parents together. 
   I think it is helpful that we are having this debate because I think it provides that great contrast, that wonderful contrast between the party of individual responsibility, and the party that believes that patients and parents and their doctors ought to be able to make medical decisions, and the party that believes that the government ought to be making those decisions. 
   So I am looking forward to the debate. It is a difficult issue because the consequences are so great and the consequences are so personal to each and every American. I don't know anybody that believes truly that the government can make better health care decisions for themselves. I don't know anybody that believes the government can do that. So I am looking forward to the debate as we move forward on the SCHIP program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   I am going to talk a little bit more about that as we go on, but I am pleased to be joined by my good friend from Tennessee, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who is a leader in so many areas, but especially in the area of health care, and serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee. I am so pleased to have you join us this evening and share your concerns and your knowledge and information about the State Children's Health Insurance Program.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. If the gentlelady will yield. 
   I appreciate your comments. And I appreciate especially concentrating in that last statement about whose money this is, because so often we lose sight here with the incredible number of zeroes that we deal with here in Washington, billions and billions of dollars, truly. And all of those dollars take hardworking Americans waking up every single day, making certain that they have cared for themselves and their family, and getting to work and being generous enough to entrust to us their hardearned money, and it is incumbent upon us to spend that money wisely. And the challenge that I see with every government program, but especially  this State Children's Health Insurance Program; it is a noble cause. It is a noble cause without a doubt. Who can object to providing health care for needy children? So it is a noble cause, but it is a government program that is clearly being morphed into something else. And I think that is what you were alluding to.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady again for that perspective. And I just want to highlight something that you mentioned, and that is that there are proposals here in the House and in Congress to make this program mandatory, part of that entitlement mentality that exists on the other side of the aisle, and to increase the eligibility for this mandatory program up to 400 percent of the poverty level; you mentioned that is about $82,000 for a family of four. 
   This chart demonstrates that the percent of children who would be covered up to 200 percent, which is what has been the original guidelines for the SCHIP program and what we believe ought to be appropriate at this point, is 50 percent of the kids will be covered in a Federal-State program.     
   If you go up to 300 percent, then it gets to 77 percent of the children. If you go up to 400 percent of the poverty level, you get nearly 90 percent of children in a Federal health care program. And that's what sheds light on the real issue here, the real issue being who ought to be in charge of health care for our Nation's children and for our Nation's families, and for individual people all across this Nation. We believe it ought not be the Federal Government, I think that that's fair to say. And the other side clearly believes that this is the next step, to allow them to have the Federal Government control health care. And I'm happy to yield.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate that because you triggered in my mind something about cost-of-government programs. And I'm reminded of the fact that when Medicaid itself was instituted in the mid-1960s that there was a wonderful estimate that said that Medicaid, at the turn of the century, when 2000 rolled around, would only cost about $8 billion. In fact, it cost about $80 billion. 
   So the Federal Government is always off by a significant factor, and so when you hear an estimate that this will only cost $108 billion, in fact, we can say with relative certainty that that is a lesser amount than it would actually cost, and it would be much greater burden on the American taxpayer. 
   And I'm pleased to yield back.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you so much for you comments. And I think the issues that you point out most recently there on the bargaining chips really speaks to the cynicism with which this leadership leads this Congress because it is, it's purchasing votes. It's purchasing numbers of votes in order to pass a bill. And then to have the, again, the all politics all the time, the bumper sticker politics that goes on by this leadership. And it is, frankly, what the American people are tired of. It's not what they voted for in November. 
   And they are clearly telling each other and telling any individual who will ask that that has decreased their opinion of Congress. 
   And I'm pleased to yield.

I appreciate your perspective this evening so much on the program about which you know a lot and your perspective from the committee, and especially your perspective about representing constituents, real Americans, real Americans who are working just as hard as they can to make ends meet and being so very, very frustrated with a Federal Government and a leadership now in Congress that appears absolutely more interested in dividing and conquering, as opposed to putting in place appropriate policies. So I appreciate your comments. 
   I just want to make a few more comments about the specifics of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, because I think that there are a number of issues that need to be pointed out as we move forward with this debate. The current program, as we've talked about, was meant to cover, was scheduled and meant to cover children up to 200 percent of the poverty level. And as we've heard, many of the States covered to a higher degree than that. Some 235, some 250, some went up to 350 percent of the poverty level. And although that is, I think, a move in a direction that's not consistent, certainly with the intent of Congress, it probably is a move away from where the American people thought that program was going, without a doubt. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, it definitely is a move away from the intent when you look at the programs and realize that even those States that went up to 300 and 350 percent of the poverty level, some even up to 250 percent of the poverty level weren't even covering all of the children under 200 percent of the poverty level. And they were covering adults.     
   So it just was a flawed program. 
   And it is so often what happens here in Washington: Federal programs are enacted. Noble cause is outlined. Wonderful banner headlines provided. Great speeches given about how this will save this, that or the other thing. And then the implementation is so terribly and woefully flawed. And that has indeed happened in this case.  
   This reauthorization, as has been mentioned, is up because the program is about to be 10 years old. It expires on September 30 of this year. As a physician, I joined many of my colleagues before I came to Congress and before I was in the State legislature early in the 1990s, and many of us believed we were at a crossroads at that time as it related to health care. There were many on the other side of the aisle, on the Democrat side of the aisle, who believed that the government ought to take over health care at that point in the early 1990s. And, Mr. Speaker, as you will remember and as many folks will remember, if they think back to that time, there was a huge battle and a lot of expose about what the consequences of that would be. And thank goodness we didn't march down that road. 
   But we are now back at that crossroads. We backed up. We went down another road a little bit, and some of the direction was correct. Some of the direction was putting us further toward government-run health care. But we are now at that crossroads where we have a group of individuals in charge in the United States House of Representatives now, with a Democrat leadership, who believe that a Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care model is what America wants. 
   I don't believe that is what America wants. It certainly isn't what my constituents want. It wasn't what my patients wanted when I was practicing medicine. 
   I think it is important, as we look at this program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, and as we look at the fact that it is up for reauthorization, that we ought to ask some questions. What have the consequences of the program been to date? Indeed, we have covered a number of children who would not possibly have had health insurance. One of the consequences of raising the Federal poverty level eligibility for the Children's Health Insurance Program is that we crowd out children who might otherwise be obtaining insurance through a private plan where their mom or their dad work. But there are other consequences, and some of those consequences are grave. One of them is, I believe, an increased dependence on government for the provision of health care. There is no doubt about that. I believe also that it undermines parental responsibility. And there is no doubt that it increases the burden on the hard-working American taxpayer. 
   I would like to touch on a few specifics on each of those. Increasing dependency on government, where does that come from? Well, when you look at the year 1998 and the percent of American children who were on either Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program, in 1998 it was about 28 percent. Twenty-eight percent of American children were enrolled in 1998 in either Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. In 2005, that number had jumped to 45 percent or 6.2 million children. So it went in 1998 from 28 percent to 45 percent in 2005. So there is no doubt that there is an increased dependency on the government for the provision of health care. Again, I don't think that is what the American people had in mind. 
   State policies also have increased and encouraged the trend of adult enrollees. A couple of examples which just boggle my mind, Mr. Speaker, in Minnesota, for example, 87 percent of those enrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program in 2005 were adults. Eighty-seven percent were adults. That is not what Congress voted on in 1997. That is not what the American people thought was going to be the program to provide health insurance, health access, health care for the neediest children in our Nation. In Wisconsin, the number was 66 percent. So, in Wisconsin, 66 percent, and in Minnesota, 87 percent in 2005 were adults on the Children's Health Insurance Program. That is not what this program was to be about. And State officials, as we have mentioned, didn't stick to the 200 percent. So in New Jersey, for example, the amount went up to 350 percent of the poverty level. Mr. Speaker, that is an income of about $72,000. Now, that may or may not seem to be a lot of money to some folks, but the problem that we get in this doublespeak in Washington, in this Orwellian democracy model that we have by the leadership right now is that, as Congresswoman Blackburn mentioned, on the one hand, $72,000 is deemed to be ``rich'' by the other side of the aisle when it comes to the alternative minimum tax, but $72,000 for a given State under this program is deemed to be needy so that the State has to cover children in their health insurance program. Clearly it is doublespeak. Clearly it is Orwellian democracy. It has become increasingly clear that there are many Members of Congress who believe that expansion into higher income levels for families is exactly what they want because they at their core desire government health insurance over private health insurance. They desire a Washington-controlled bureaucratic model for the provision of health care and medicine in our Nation. So it is clear that the program has increased dependency on the government for the provision of health care. 
   How about transferring family responsibilities, taking the place of parents, transferring family responsibilities to the government? There is no doubt that that has occurred and in a variety of ways. In many cases, for example, the SCHIP program means that children's health coverage will be totally separate than their parents. So they go to different offices. They go to different office locations. There are different office hours. There are different doctors that care for them, different paperwork, all of which makes life more difficult. It makes the Federal Government and the State government the determiners. It makes them making the decisions for parents and for families. 
   I believe that the goal should be to help unite families, to help unite their coverage under one private plan that they select, that they own, not to spread the coverage out through a hodgepodge that increases dependency on the government. 
   Some in Congress suggest that private coverage is unattainable for lower-income families or working families. But the facts tell a different story. Remember, Mr. Speaker, facts are stubborn things and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts? Well, the facts tell a different story. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 50 percent of children whose families earn between 100 and 200 percent of the Federal poverty level have private health insurance coverage. Remember the other 50 percent covered by this program, 50 percent are covered by private health insurance. That number skyrocketed to 77 percent for those families that earn 200 to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. In fact, 60 percent of people covered by SCHIP expansions already had private coverage available to them. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker, because that is a startling statement. It is a startling fact, and it is something that we ought to pay attention to. Sixty percent of the people covered by SCHIP expansions were already covered by private insurance before the program was instituted. 
   Mr. Speaker, what that means is that we are making decisions here in Washington that are providing financial incentives for individuals and businesses and people to move their health care coverage to government, and when we do that, it is incumbent upon us to ask the question, should we be doing that? What are the consequences of doing that? What are the unintended consequences of doing that? In 2012, if we continue down this road, 71 percent of the American children will be in a government-run health care system. 
   Now, what does that mean? What are the consequences of that? As a physician, I am here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, the consequences of that are that more health care decisions are made by bureaucrats and are made by individuals here in Washington than are made by doctors and their patients and children's parents. That is what it means. It means that more personal health care decisions move away from being made by patients and their doctors. That is not what we ought to be about. That is not increasing choice for individuals in the health care system. That is not increasing freedom for individuals in the health care system. That is creating a system that is Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care, and I don't believe that that is what the American people desire. 
   This program definitely has burdened the taxpayer. There is no doubt about  that. You couldn't reach any other conclusion regardless of where you come down on the program. As was mentioned, this will cost hundreds of billions of dollars. And if it is made into an automatic or mandatory or entitlement program, it will increase even greater than that. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have just a few short minutes, but I do want to touch on what we believe, what I believe we ought to do because there are positive solutions. There are positive answers to how we ought to move in a direction that provides patient-centered health care, patient-centered health care, something that I believe is wanted by the American people. It is something that I have termed American values and American vision. And one of those American values and one of those American visions is to have a health care system that is patient centered, that allows patients and their doctors to make decisions, not government officials. Not government officials. That is not where the American people want us to be. So if we are going to have a Children's Health Insurance Program, then we ought to live up to the premise for which it was brought about, and that is to target it to low-income families, low-income, uninsured families. And there is an easy way to do that. There is an easy way to do that. 
   You can empower families to make health care decisions that directly affect their own children. The way that you do that is through a robust system of premium assistance. You can provide and allow parents to utilize the SCHIP funds to be able to purchase private health care coverage without government micromanagement. It is a system that results, in essence, in a defined contribution program so that the Federal Government would, when needed for low-income uninsured children, provide assistance that would allow for the purchase of a private health insurance policy so that the family owns the policy. And when that happens, what that means is that it becomes patient-centered because the individuals, the parents, will select the best program for their child. And that is all that anybody is truly wanting. They want a system that responds to the health care needs of their family and their children; not a system where the Federal Government is making those decisions. 
   It is easy to also provide for a program that would expand the options for individuals and families beyond the narrow confines of the SCHIP program. It is important that the perceived need is for a system that provides appropriate health care, indeed, but the appropriate need is for one that is responsive to patients. 
   I have a few other items that I just want to point out, Mr. Speaker, before I close. And that is, again, that if we move toward the system that is being proposed by the folks who are interested in Washington-controlled bureaucratic health care, 71 percent of America's children will be on Medicaid or SCHIP in the year 2012. Over the next 4 years, if nothing has changed with this program and others, we will move from $11,000 per year, per household, Federal money, $11,000 per household to $13,000 per household spent on health care. 
   And there is a wonderful article that I would like to point out to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that was published on June 28 by Robert Novak called, ``Socialized Medicine for 'Kids.''' And I will include that in the Record. I urge my colleagues to avail themselves of this article. This talks about removing the ability of parents to make personal health care decisions for their children. 
   Socialized Medicine for ``Kids''  
   WASHINGTON--There is no need to wait until a new president is elected next year for the great national health care debate. It is underway right now, disguised as a routine extension of an immensely popular, non-controversial 10-year-old program of providing coverage to poor children. In fact, this proposal is the thin edge of the wedge to achieve the longtime goal of government-supplied universal health insurance and the suffocation of the private system. 
   The Senate Finance Committee was scheduled to mark up this portentous legislation expanding the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) today [Thursday], but disagreement over the size of the program and how to pay for it forced postponement. Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller's version would triple SCHIP's current five-year cost of $25 billion to a level of $75 billion. That would grant federal largesse to more than just poor ``kids'' (as politicians endearingly call children). An estimated 71 percent of all American children in families of four making as much as $82,000 a year would become eligible, with states also continuing present coverage of adults under SCHIP. 
   But where to find money to cover the massive cost? Senators of both parties want to raise tobacco taxes, but that well is not bottomless, as existing taxes have reduced cigarette smoking. Instead, House Democrats want to take money from private elements of Medicare instituted by the Bush administration. The overall effect would make three out of four American children accustomed to relying on government care no matter what course their parents take. In sum, SCHIP turns out to be socialized medicine for ``kids'' (and many adults). 
   A principal sponsor of the $75 billion program is Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose hand is detected in health care struggles the past 15 years. After the Clinton administration's sweeping ``Hillarycare'' failed in 1994 and contributed to that year's Republican takeover of Congress, the first lady miniaturized her goals by limiting coverage to poor children. Republicans, led by Sen. Orrin Hatch in one of his several collaborations with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, had lost their revolutionary zeal after the government shutdown of 1995 and accepted SCHIP as a fallback position at a beginning outlay of $4 billion a year. It was the bargaining chip given President Bill Clinton in return for him signing the Deficit Reduction Act of 1997. 
   SCHIP over the past decade has been a beloved ``kids'' program whose faults were overlooked, much like the Head Start school program. The federal government has consistently granted waivers to permit 14 states to cover adults under SCHIP, which now cost $5 billion a year. Minnesota led the way, with 92 percent of money spent under the program going to adults. 
   The massive expansion was proposed by Sen. Clinton this year, furthering her promise of ``step by step'' advancement toward universal health care. Her proposal extends SCHIP to families at 400 percent of poverty (or $82,000 annually). Hatch after 10 years is back again supporting a Democratic program along with Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Finance Committee's ranking Republican. But they want a mere $55 billion (a $30 billion increase), compared with Rockefeller's $75 billion, causing the postponement of today's markup. 
   The Democratic congressional majority now faces the consequence of its ``paygo'' mandate to account for higher spending. The Senate's preference for tobacco taxes runs into present overall cigarette taxes of more than one dollar a pack, lower legal cigarette purchases and reduced smoking typified by a 19 percent decline in New York City. More creative funding comes with Rep. Pete Stark's scheme in the House Ways and Means Committee for slashing the popular private Medicare program. That not only would fund an expanded SCHIP but move toward government monopoly over all health insurance. 
   An indirect but pervasive impact of Sen. Clinton's grand design would be the impact in the same family of children who are insured by the government while their parents are covered privately. Would the children become accustomed to Washington taking care of them? Would the adults drop private insurance? The future is now for universal health care coverage, and President George W. Bush may soon face the decision of whether or not to veto it going into the election year.  
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to urge my colleagues to make certain that we remember why we were elected. We were elected to represent honestly and hopefully and responsibly our constituents, especially in the area of health care, an area that I knew very well as a physician and about which I became very frustrated because of governmental intervention. We are responsible to make certain that we set in place programs and policies that allow for the most personal decisions of our lives and of our children's lives to be made by individuals and their parents and their families, not by government. 
   So I urge my colleagues to make certain that as we move forward with this debate and with this discussion that we act responsibly and allow patients, their parents, and physicians to make health care decisions.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and honor Miss Katja Martin, a sixth grade student from my district, who is an inspired writer and gifted reader and writer. 
   This year, the Library of Congress has selected Miss Katja Martin of Appharetta, Georgia as one of only six national winners in their annual ``Letters About Literature'' program. With more than 56,000 adolescent and young adult readers in fourth through 12th grades participating, this program encourages students to read and be inspired and to write a letter that might have been sent to an author who has changed the student's view of the world and of themselves. 
   For her entry, Miss Martin wrote about the Robert Frost poem, ``Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.'' Because of her talented efforts, she and the other five national winners will be honored at the National Book Festival on September 29 here in Washington, DC, where they will have the opportunity to read their letters to the gathered audience. 
   I am pleased to have the House recognize this accomplishment. It's a great honor for me to be able to represent and recognize Katja Martin, clearly a dedicated and intelligent young lady.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my leadership on the Republican side of the aisle for allowing me to address the House this evening. It is always an honor to come before the House of Representatives and to discuss issues of importance to this Chamber, to this Capitol and to the Nation. 
   This is a truncated version of the Official Truth Squad because of the hour of the evening. The Official Truth Squad is a group of individuals who come to the floor of the House and try to shed a little light, try to shed a little truth, if you will, on the deliberations going on here in our Nation's Capital and hopefully bring a perspective that will allow Members of the House and this Chamber and men and women across our Nation to be able to gain a little greater perspective on exactly what is going on here in Washington as we struggle with the challenges that we have facing the issues that we have in our Nation that demand so much of our attention and demand, frankly, a greater level of cooperation than is frequently seen here in Washington. 
   It is one of the things that I strive, along with my colleagues, try to bring about, and that is a greater sense of urgency to solve the challenges that we have, and to address honestly and openly and truthfully the issues we have before us. 
   We have one special quote that I like to quote that I think kind of puts it all into perspective, especially when you are talking about issues that are so complex in Washington. It comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. He used to say everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   So often here in Washington, people want their opinions to be facts. It is one of the items or issues that the Official Truth Squad attempts to address, and that is trying to talk about facts, trying to bring facts to the table as it relates to any particular issue. 
   Tonight we are going to talk about at least one issue that is in great need of facts. Madam Speaker, we are in appropriation season. During this period of time, the House works on its multiple appropriations bills and tries to determine exactly how we as a Nation ought to set priorities from an appropriations or a spending standpoint, what level of spending ought to go into the various programs of the Federal Government. And so often, and we just heard it this evening, many people come to the floor and they say, if we just had more money, if we just had more money for this program or that program, that would solve the problem. 
   And so often it is not money that is needed for programs, especially out across our Nation, because what is needed most often is to free up the wonderful enthusiasm of the American people and the wonderful ingenuity of the American people. What happens is along with the money that comes from Washington comes rules and regulations and strings and stipulations, and makes it that those individuals who are trying as hard as they can to make ends meet and improve their communities and make certain that they are providing for their families, so often what Washington does is ties their hands behind their back and makes it so they are not able to realize the kinds of dreams that they would otherwise be able to realize. 
   We cite often the Golden Rule. You know what that is. Most folks know what that is, but the Golden Rule of Washington is not what most people across this Nation know. The Golden Rule across this Nation is to do unto others as you would have them do unto you. But the Golden Rule here in Washington is he who has the gold makes the rules. That is especially true during appropriation season because we put all kinds of strings attached to the money that the Federal Government spends. 
   We often forget, as I am fond of reminding my friends here in the House, of whose money it is, because it is not government's money, it is the people's money. It is hard-earned American taxpayer money. 
   We have had individuals come even to this well and say, ``Keep your hands off my money.'' My money. It is phenomenal when you hear that, when I go home to the Sixth Congressional District in Georgia, and my constituents ask incredibly insightful questions about that kind of mindset that exists here in Washington. ``How can politicians believe it is their money?'' This is so important as we are in this appropriation season and as we determine exactly how to spend that hard-earned taxpayer money, and we ought to do it more responsibly, I would suggest, Madam Speaker. 
   I want to talk tonight about an issue that is near and dear to my heart, and to the heart and well-being of every single American, and that is the issue of health care. Before I came to this body, I was a practicing 
   physician. I was an orthopedic surgeon and practiced for over 20 years in the Atlanta area. 
   One of the things that drove me into politics or had me stand up and volunteer to get into politics was the recognition and the appreciation that year after year after year would go by as I tried the best I could to care for my patients and worked with my colleagues to provide the best and highest quality of health care we could provide, and year after year, and month after month, and day after day each of us appreciated that there were more individuals in our State capital and in this Capital right here who were making decisions about health care that affected very directly what I could do for and with my patients than anybody I ever met in medical school and anybody I met in residency and training as I was training to become an orthopedic surgeon. That was true for every specialty that I talked to, every single colleague. 
   If you talk to your doctor, Madam Speaker, or if the Members of Congress would speak to their physicians and to their neighbors, they would appreciate readily that there are so many rules and regulations that are coming from Washington and from State capitals around this Nation that tie the hands, that make it more difficult, not easier, more difficult for physicians and other health care providers to be able to take care of patients. And that's wrong. That is wrong because what it means is we have a lesser quality of health care system than we would otherwise have if the government weren't involved in the way that it is. 
   And there are all sorts of programs that you can talk about that would lend truth and credibility to that statement, but I want to talk about one specifically this evening that is going to get a lot of discussion, Madam Speaker, here over the next week or two and maybe number of months as we move forward in Washington, and that is the program known as SCHIP, or the State Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   That is a program that was begun 10 years ago. It was part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It was a program that had wonderful goals. The goals were, specifically, there was a recognition that low-income individuals who weren't eligible for Medicaid, they made too much money to be eligible for Medicaid, but they didn't make enough money to be able to afford health insurance for their families, those individuals ought to be able to have some sort of assistance provided by States and the Federal Government in a complex formula that would allow those families to be able to have health insurance for their children. So hence the name State Children's Health Insurance Program. And it was a laudable goal, without any doubt. And it was passed by a significant majority, and the goal was to increase the enrollment of children who were below 200 percent of the poverty level. That is what was selected as the limit at the time. 
   Over the last 10 years what happened, however, is a distortion, a significant  distortion, of the program so that it covered not just children up to 200 percent of the poverty level, but in some States covered up to 350 percent of the poverty level, and it covered not just children. The State Health Insurance Program covered hundreds of thousands of adults. So like other government programs, it grew. 
   Government programs in the area of health don't just grow, as I started this conversation talking about, they insert themselves in terms of rules and regulations into the process and make it extremely difficult for those who are charged with the administration of the program, charged with caring for patients in this instance, to be able to care appropriately for them. 
   So what we saw between 1998 when the State Children's Health Insurance Program was instituted and became effective, at that time there were about 28 percent of the children of this Nation on some sort of government-run health care. In 2005, that number had grown to 45 percent. It is a little more than that right now, but about 45 percent. 
   The proposal that will be on the floor of the House or certainly in Committee of the House is to move it so that in a relatively short period of time, another 5 years, we will have 70 to 75 percent of children on government-run health care. 
   We will talk a little bit more about the consequences of that and why many of us believe that is the wrong direction to head, because most of us, most people, most Americans, I believe, are not interested in having a Washington-controlled, bureaucratic medical model be the one that is making those kinds of personal health care decisions for themselves and their families, and especially for their children. 
   That is what we are going to talk a little bit about tonight. I am so pleased to be joined by one of my good friends and colleagues, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), who has great insights into both fiscal responsibility issues and issues where government tends to intervene in ways that most of us would desire that it not. I am happy to have the gentleman join us this evening, and I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate your comments in pointing out a number of different areas where the government has been intimately involved in health care issues specifically and ones where most individuals across this Nation I believe, Madam Speaker, have questions about the advisability of governmental involvement and the effectiveness of governmental involvement. 
   We're pleased to be joined by another good friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, who has been chair and now is ranking member of the Budget Committee, an individual who has great perspective on both fiscal responsibility and the issue of health care as a member of the Ways and Means Committee.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for his comments and really succinct presentation of the issue of health care and the philosophical difference between the two parties, philosophical difference between the majority party and our party at this point. 
   The majority party believes that Washington-controlled bureaucratic medicine, bureaucratic health care is exactly what the country needs, and we don't believe that. We believe firmly in patient-centered health care and patient-centered decisions as it relates to health care. 
   So I thank you very much, and you point out as clearly as anybody could ever do the philosophy on that side of the aisle, once again, that is, if we just give it more money, give it more money, it will somehow miraculously improve. 
   You know as well as anybody as the ranking member on the Budget Committee that when the estimates are a certain amount, it's never that amount. So if $50 billion is the estimate for the first 5 years and $100 billion for the 10-year period of time, it will never remain at that level. When folks across America hear that kind of comment, they just better say I better hold on to my wallet. 
   I'm pleased to yield to you once again if you have any other comments.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you ever so much for your comments and, once again, succinctly pointing out the rationale for why it doesn't make sense for Washington to be controlling health care. 
   And sometimes I get the question as a physician, what does it mean specifically? What kind of issues would the government insert themselves into? If I think back on personal experience that I have, there are a number of issues where Washington and governments insert themselves into health care. The reason that it sometimes isn't easy to see is because patients don't often see it.     
   I worked for a period of time in a veterans hospital in Atlanta, and every quarter there were a certain number of joint replacements that were allowed to be done at the hospital. When we got to the end of that number, even though it wasn't the end of the quarter, there were more patients that needed joint replacements, we couldn't do them. We weren't able to do them because the resources weren't there to be able to fund them. 
   Now, the patients that didn't get their joint replacement in May or June because they were rescheduled to July didn't know that the reason they didn't get their joint replacement in May or June wasn't because there wasn't anybody to do it, or there weren't any prostheses to implant, or the nurses weren't there, or the operating rooms weren't functioning, no. They didn't know that the reason they weren't getting it is because the Federal Government wouldn't pay for it. That was the reason. 
   So, the government inserts itself in so many ways into the practice of medicine. Medicaid programs are a classic example. Medicaid programs across this Nation, which are government-run health care for lower-income individuals, the vast majority of States have formularies for drug prescription plans in Medicaid, which means that the government is deciding which drugs are available for folks at the lower end of the economic spectrum. That's wrong. That's simply wrong. 
   Now, there is a way to solve that without the heavy hammer of the government, because when the heavy hammer of the government comes in, what happens is that they just put more restrictions on, or they make a change, and for 2 months it's the right change to make. 
   But government isn't nimble, it isn't flexible, it can't change easily. Even if it made the right decision at one point in relatively short order, it would be the wrong decision, because science moves on, medicine moves on, health care moves on. There is no way the government can catch up, which is why the importance of having patient-centered decisions, patients and their families making decisions in concert with the consultation with the physician, is so incredibly important. 
   I yield to my good friend from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for pointing out the shortfall of Federal Government rules, because they can't ever catch up. 
   My State, Georgia, was one of those States that spent too much. It spent too much, we would argue, in Georgia, because we were too efficient at signing up children in the program. 
   Because the formula wasn't flexible, wasn't nimble enough, couldn't accommodate for a State that overperformed, if you will, then it wasn't able to be able to get the match that it was promised. Whether or not that should have happened in the first place is a different question. But the fundamental challenge that we see in all of this is that the Federal Government can't respond, and it can't respond in so many different ways. 
   But what we see with this chart here that my colleagues know very, very well, and that is that there are all sorts of children out there right now across our Nation that are covered by private insurance. What happens when the Federal Government and the States get involved and they say, let's put this carrot in front of you; let's entice you to come and join government-run health care? What happens? 
   The fact of the matter is that there is a crowd-out phenomenon, that individual families who currently have private insurance, either they or their employer looks at the program and they say, well, we could save that money by having you enroll your children in government-run health care.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That's exactly right. That's what we saw with the previous program. It happens every time when you have a government program that potentially can supplant the private program. 
   In 1998, 28 percent of the children in our Nation were covered by some sort of government-run health insurance. In 2005, 45 percent. This is a combination of SCHIP and Medicaid. 
   Now, the problem is that when you look at the number of children that are covered by private health insurance in our Nation, up to 200 percent, 50 percent of them are already covered by private health insurance. If you go up to 300 percent, which is what the Senate proposes, 70 percent of the children in America whose families have incomes less than 300 percent have some form of private health insurance.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That's exactly right. That is the crux of the matter. If everything else were equal in the system, if it were to allow for the same kind of ability for patients and families and doctors to make decisions, that might be one thing. But as we have talked about, and as everybody across this Nation knows, that's not the case. 
   When you have government get involved in the provision of health care, government is going to make decisions about where you can be treated, who can treat you and what kind of treatment you can have. That's where the personal health care decisions go away from the individual. I don't believe, and I know you don't believe, that that's what the American people want. It's up to you.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. No, it doesn't make any sense at all. It lays bare the true motive and the true philosophy, which, on the other side of the aisle, at least the true leadership who are pushing this legislation, their belief is that government knows better how to spend people's money than the people themselves. This stretches all the way into the area of health care, which, as you mentioned, are very personal, personal, health care decisions.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. You are absolutely right. And to give some credibility to that from a pie chart standpoint, these are the mandatory spending programs, and all of what you said happens unless we act. Unless we act as a Congress, all of these things happen. 
   In 1995, those three programs were this yellow portion, about percent 48.7 percent of Federal spending. In 2005, about 53.4 percent. In relatively short order, 2017, 62.2 percent. And, as you mentioned, in 2030 the yellow portion of that will be the entire pie.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. You are absolutely right. And that is why you mentioned the significant increase in taxes that would be required, and that is if we don't do anything. That is why it is so imperative that we act, which is why it was so astounding to me that this new majority that came in with this ``new direction'' that they were going to take us on for our Nation. You know what happened when they had the opportunity to bring about some entitlement reform. 
   What happened with the bill that they passed this year in their budget was no entitlement reform, in spite of the fact that we worked as diligently as we could back in 1997 with the Balanced Budget Act, about $130 billion of entitlement reform, and fought like the dickens, as you remember, in 2005 with the Deficit Reduction Act to get about $40 billion in entitlement reform. 
   But this new majority comes in with the previous chart that we saw, increases in Social Security spending, increases in Medicare spending, increases in Medicaid spending, the prospect of another $100 billion entitlement with the SCHIP program if they have their way, and no reform. Can you imagine what that is going to do to our economy?

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate your pointing out the issue of taxes, because there has also been work that has laid out the tax increase for the average citizen in every State across this Nation. And in Georgia, that average increase is $2,700 average tax increase when those tax increases go into effect if they are not changed. They were included in this budget that included no entitlement reform. In Wisconsin, the average number was $2,964. And New Jersey is a big winner, average increase $3,779.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I want to thank you all for joining us tonight. I do want to close on a positive note, and that is that there is an alternative. And the alternative, as we talk about, is patient-centered health care. And patient-centered health care, as you know, puts the opportunity and the  right and the privilege and the responsibility for decisionmaking among patients and their doctors, among families and their doctors. And the way to do that is to structure a tax system that allows individuals, incentivizes individuals to purchase health insurance, through whether it is tax deductions or tax credits, or advanceable refundable tax credits, through high-risk pools, through risk pools that allow people to pool together, making certain that individuals have the same kind of tax treatment for the purchase of health insurance as employers do now, as businesses do now, all sorts of wonderful ways to bring about the opportunity for folks to purchase health insurance. 
   So it is not whether or not you have the current system or whether you march down the road to more Washington-controlled bureaucratic medicine. There is another way. And I know my good friend from Wisconsin has worked on this extensively on Ways and Means, and I would be pleased to hear your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman's comments from Wisconsin. And this is what we believe, patient-centered health care, and we going to work on putting some limbs and leaves on the tree of this over the next number of weeks and number of months, and make certain that the American people understand, Madam Speaker, that there is an alternative and it is a positive alternative. Because we live in a wondrous and a grand Nation, and a Nation where when individuals are allowed to encourage their own visions and their own dreams and their own entrepreneurship and their own work, that they can decide what is best for themselves, not government. 
   Nobody across this Nation I believe is truly interested in having Washington-controlled bureaucratic medicine, yet that is the road that we are about to march down if this new majority has their way. Our alternative is patient-centered, patient-centered health care and allows individuals to make decisions with their families and with their physicians and with their health care providers. 
   I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make certain that as we move forward on this issue, that we move forward in a way that ensures that those decisions, those very personal decisions are able to be made in a very personal way without the government limiting care, without the government determining where you can be seen and who can see you and what kind of treatment you would receive. 
   Madam Speaker, on that positive note and looking forward to patient-centered health care across this Nation, I want to once again thank the leadership for allowing us to spend this time on the floor. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman for yielding me the 2 minutes' time. 
   I stand in support of more jobs and in support of all workers, understanding that there are consequences to what we do here and some of those consequences are unintended. When we increase the minimum wage, unless employers receive some sort of benefit, they hire fewer workers. Fewer workers. It discourages businesses from hiring the least-skilled workers who need the most assistance. Losing access to entry level positions deprives many unskilled workers of the opportunity to learn the skills that they need to advance up the career ladder. 
   Did you know that businesses actually cut the number of unskilled and disadvantaged workers on their payrolls after an increase in the minimum wage and that raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour would cost at least 8 percent of affected workers their jobs? Minimum wage jobs are entry level positions that teach career skills that make workers more productive and enable them to earn a raise.  Two-thirds of minimum wage earners earn a raise within a year. 
   And, finally, why are there conflicting reports? How can each side produce numbers in their support? Well, it is because it is difficult if not impossible to count the results. Why? Because regardless of what we do here, regardless of what we make the minimum wage, it is really zero. What we can't count are jobs that are never offered. If we pass this, small businesses don't miraculously get more money to pay workers, so they hold off on hiring, and those jobs that are never offered are never counted. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a commonsense plan that will increase the minimum wage and increase business resources to provide that wage and save and increase the number of jobs.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am going to shift gears a little bit right now and just recount a bit of this past week. This has been a remarkable week, first week of a new majority. 
   For the record, the first 100 hours of this new majority, and for the record, Mr. Speaker, you ought to know that the Speaker's Office officially states that we have been in session dealing with the issues of importance to the American people for 12 hours and 28 minutes. That is over 4 days. That turns out to be about 3 hours and 7 minutes a day. 
   Now, if you count the actual time that we have been in session, which I think is important, because if you are going to promise that you are going to do things in 100 hours, then you doggone well better do it, and actually, we have been in session now at 6:18 p.m., 38 hours and 21 minutes, 38 hours and 21 minutes. 
   We are keeping track of the right clock. So for all those folks out there, we want you to know that The Official Truth Squad is keeping an eye on the majority party and making certain that they live up to their promises. 
   We have dealt with some remarkable issues during the first 38 hours that we have been in session. We have dealt with the minimum wage today in a way that left a lot to be desired in terms of bringing about that wonderful bipartisan spirit that has been promised but not seen yet by the majority party. We have dealt with the 9/11 recommendations. As you recall, Mr. Speaker, before the election, the new majority party, the leaders of that party, promised that they would enact every single recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. 
   Well, that bill has come and gone without any input from the minority party. As you know, you know very, very well what happened was not the enactment of every single 9/11 recommendation, because promises made on the campaign trail don't appear to be promises that will be kept in the majority. 
   These are important issues. We have got two more issues to go this week. They are extremely important issues to the American people. 
   The issue of stem cell research, embryonic stem cell research, which is an incredibly important issue, a complex issue, a scientific issue and one, again, that I am very distressed and concerned is not being dealt with in an open and honest way that has been promised, nor is it being dealt with, certainly, in a bipartisan way. 
   We also have this week the issue of Medicare part D prescription drug program that is in place for Medicare recipients, and that, too, is being dealt with in a way that doesn't allow for any input from the minority party, doesn't allow for any amendments, isn't being heard in committee. 
   The gentleman before me mentioned that there were a number of freshmen Members of this body, and there are, there are 54 Members of this body who are now here for the very first time, freshmen Members. They haven't dealt with any of these issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, a majority of this House is not being allowed to deal with the issues that are coming to the floor right now, because they are being done in secret. These bills are being written in secret without input from anybody on the minority side and certainly without any input from any of the new Members of Congress. 
   So the Official Truth Squad is here to make certain that we hold accountable for the majority party, for the promises that they made and make certain that the American people understand and appreciate what is occurring in Washington under this new martial law rule that we have for bringing issues to the floor. 
   The Official Truth Squad has one of our favorite quotes, we have a lot of favorite quotes. One of them is from the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who had one of the most wonderful and appropriate quotes for this building that I know of, and that is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. 
   So what we would like to do this evening, Mr. Speaker, is to talk a little bit about some facts, some facts as they relate to the two issues, Medicare part D prescription drug program and stem cell research, embryonic stem cell research. 
   Now decisions made regarding Medicare part D and the discussion that we are having, many people will think, well, it is just about a narrow prescription drug program for Medicare. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it is about a whole lot more than that. 
   If you back up from the specific debate about prescription drugs and you look at what is really being done, what is happening is that we have a difference of opinion, a philosophical difference of opinion about who ought to be making very personal health care decisions for the American people. 
   On the other side of the aisle, on the majority side of the aisle, we apparently have a majority of those individuals who believe that the government ought to be making those decisions, personal health care decisions. On the minority, on the Republican side of the aisle, we are proud to say that we support health care decisions, medical decisions being made between physicians and patients. That is where those decisions ought to be made. 
   In fact, when you look at this whole issue right now, it is important to ask exactly what it is that the Democratic majority is attempting to solve. 
   When you look at this program that has been in place now just a few short years, the costs are down. In fact, the costs are down for the last year, $13 billion, $13 billion. Actual costs of benefits in 2006 are 30 percent or $13 billion less than was projected. 
   The projected costs over 10 years are down 21.3 percent, which is $197 billion. That is a fact. That is a fact. Premiums are down 40 percent over projections, again a fact. If we would listen to the Democrats on this issue, when the bill was enacted, they attempted to put into law that premiums ought to be for every Medicare recipient, $35 a month. They wanted to make certain that they were $35 a month. 
   So what are the premiums now? They are about $22, $23 a month on average.  If we had listened to them when this was enacted a couple of years ago, every single senior would be paying on average $12 a month more for their prescription medication. 
   I would suggest that if the past is prologue, that we ought to be very careful about what is coming to the floor this week as it relates to Medicare part D. Beneficiaries, those who are using the plan and benefitting from the plan, over 80 percent of them, are supportive and satisfied with the program. That is with nearly 90 percent of those eligible being supportive. 
   Again, people are entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. The costs are down. Access is expansive. Medications are being covered across the whole spectrum of disease. And seniors are happy. 
   I ask, Mr. Speaker, what is it that the Democratic majority is attempting to fix? What problem are they trying to solve? 
   I am pleased to be joined tonight by a number of colleagues to talk about both of these issues. As we talk about Medicare part D, I am pleased to welcome my good friend, Congressman Patrick McHenry, from the great state of North Carolina who has great experience in representing individuals and understanding and appreciating the importance of bringing truth to debate. 
   I welcome you, Congressman McHenry.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate your earlier comment. And I want to get to what the Democrat plan is, but I want to make certain that people appreciate and, Mr. Speaker, it is important that the Members of Congress appreciate that what we are talking about here is who is making decisions. 
   And I appreciate you mentioning that not even a physician in the House ought to be making the decisions, because the collective wisdom here isn't as great in the area of health care in all 435 Members of this body than the wisdom that is between a physician and a patient. That collective wisdom is greater than the 435 individuals here. And when you talk about plans offering programs to seniors to have certain medications and there is this big push to have the government negotiate, isn't it true that those plans are negotiating already with pharmaceutical companies and with pharmacists?

   Because if you think about negotiating with the Federal Government, I don't know, Mr. Speaker, how many times you have had an opportunity to negotiate with the Federal Government, but when I think about negotiating with the Federal Government, whether it is the IRS or the Post Office, when you think about negotiating  with the Post Office those aren't folks that one would think are going to be warm and fuzzy and interested in your best interests, Mr. Speaker, or the American people's best interests.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. And when you mention the decrease in quality of care and the decrease in access to care, people say, well, that is just smoke and mirrors. That is just conjecture. But if you look at programs that have had the effect of price fixing, and we can look at programs in our own Nation. You can look at them around the world and give grand examples for how you decrease access and decrease quality of care to individuals in health care, again, those very personal decisions. 
   But if you want to look at something in this Nation where the government has stepped in and said, okay, we are going to fix prices, all you have to do is look a few short years back to the Vaccine for Children's program, something incredibly important to the American people, something incredibly important to the health of our Nation. In the early 1990s, there were about 30 or so pharmaceutical companies that were making vaccines, and they were aggressive and active in their research and development. The vaccines had a varying price depending on the disease that they were attempting to cover or to prevent, and the government came in and said, oh, those prices are too high. Those prices are too high. In fact, in order to provide vaccines for every single child and individual in this Nation we are only going to allow you to charge this much. That was in 1993 or 1994. 
   Well, 12, 13 years later, remember, Mr. Speaker, there were about 30 or so pharmaceutical companies making vaccines. Do you know how many there are now? Three. Three. 
   Mr. Speaker, men and women and children all across this Nation know the difficulties that they have had oftentimes in getting their vaccines, and that is due to a lot of things but not the least of which is the intervention of the Federal Government and price fixing which always, always decreases the quality and decreases the access.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate that. And it is such an important question, because of the premise of all of this from a policy side. You take away the politics, but from a policy side the premise of all of this presumes that every single patient is just like every single other patient and they are just kind of little blocks that move along, and all you have to do is recognize what disease they have or what problem they have and you just determine exactly by algorithm what they need and so that a bureaucrat can determine that. 
   In fact, that is not the way health care works. That is not the way medicine works. That is not the way patients work. Mr. Speaker, you know as well as anybody that patients are different. Each and every individual patient is different, and what may work in one patient doesn't necessarily work in another. 
   I can give you a real-life example from working in the VA, which is touted as being a wonderful program, as an example for what the other side, what the majority party is trying to do to Medicare part D. 
   When I worked in the VA, and I had an opportunity to do that for a number of years, we were given a list of medications that were available for use in patients. And if you as a treating physician determined that the patient wasn't responding to the medication that was on that list; I am an orthopedic surgeon and treated hundreds of patients if not thousands of patients through the VA, and whether it was a pain medication or whether it was an anti-inflammatory medication or an antibiotic, something that can truly be life and death, and it wasn't working and you needed to use something that wasn't on that list, it was virtually impossible to get the right medication. And that is how you decrease the quality of health care, decrease access to quality of health care for patients, and that is precisely what will happen for 43 million, at least, seniors; and the ripple effect will occur throughout the entire Nation.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman bringing that up. Because if you ask the individuals who are objective experts in this area and you go either to CMS, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or in Congress we go to CBO, Congressional Budget Office, there are some very interesting findings. And these are folks that really don't have a dog in this hunt from a policy side. They are charged with giving us objective information. 
   And the CMS actuary, the individuals who are charged with determining what a program is going to cost, said, regarding having the government ``negotiate'' on this, ``Price negotiations between plan sponsors and drug manufacturers would achieve comparable or better savings than direct price negotiation. This expectation reflects the strong incentives to obtain low prices and pass on savings to beneficiaries resulting from competition.'' 
   And CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, which is charged with providing accurate information, Mr. Speaker, to both Democrats and Republicans, both sides of the aisle, they provide the same kind of information. They attempt to provide objective and accurate information, and what they said was, ``We expect that risk-bearing private plans will have strong incentives to negotiate price discounts for such drugs and that the Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that further reduce Federal spending to a significant degree.'' 
   So those are the two main folks that we look at to determine what the costs of this program will be that is being proposed by the other side of the aisle, and in fact what they say is that it will not be as inexpensive as that currently in place.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, politics is replete in the discussions that we have here in this building. There is no doubt about it. And as I mentioned before, it would be humorous if it weren't so serious. This is a remarkably serious issue. 
   And when you hear the other side of the aisle talk about how they determined that this would be in their first blitz of legislation, again, that it is not open to discussion that could result in any change at all, no amendments being offered, hasn't gone through the committee process, no input from anybody on the minority side, and no input from any one of the freshmen legislators, when questions are asked regarding how did you decide what you would include in this first blitz, the other side of the aisle is proud to say these are issues that 80 percent plus of the American people support. 
   That is where, Mr. Speaker, it is incredibly important to remember what Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, and that is that everyone is entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts. And it is our responsibility as leaders in this Nation to remember that we enact policies that have consequences, and the consequences of not enacting appropriate policy when it comes to health care is not just that somebody loses a little more money or has to pay a few more taxes or is inconvenienced to a certain degree. The consequences of legislation that relates to health care, when it is the wrong policy, results in decreasing quality of health care and harming individuals and even, Mr. Speaker, resulting in shortening the lives of individuals in this Nation. The consequences of this kind of decision are huge, are significant. 
   And when the majority party says, well, we are just doing it because 80 percent of the American people think it is the right thing to do, leadership, Mr. Speaker, means that you investigate the situation and you lead. You lead with information that is factual information. 
   And it distresses me greatly that we find ourselves in this first week of this new 110th Congress with a new majority who is all excited about the prospects of leading and, in fact, what they are doing is putting forward an issue that will result in a lower quality of health care for American citizens and will result in harming, truly harming, many of our constituents. 
   I am pleased to be joined now by my good friend and physician colleague in Congress, a good friend from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, Congressman Phil Gingrey, and I know Congressman Gingrey would like to make a few comments about the part D proposal that has come to the floor.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you for your participation. 
   Let me just close with some final comments about a Medicare prescription drug plan that is on the agenda this week to be dealt with by the majority party. 
   In the program, the costs are down. The access is expansive to medications. All medications in the panoply or the array of plans that are available are available to patients. Seniors are happy. We are negotiating now. There are negotiations going on now between plans and 
   pharmaceutical companies and plans and pharmacists that have decreased costs much below what was projected. 
   The big question in the end, Mr. Speaker, is who is going to be making health care decisions? Is it going to be government bureaucrats and majority parties, or is it going to be patients and doctors? That is the real question. And I am hopeful that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will appreciate the gravity of this issue that they are bringing forward and the importance of making certain that there is input from all Members of Congress as it relates to this issue. And hopefully, hopefully, if we cannot get some sanity in this Chamber, we will get some sanity in the Senate and make sure that we don't do something that would truly harm the health of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to continue now and talk about another issue that is of incredible importance and incredible gravity to the American people and certainly to some very specific individuals, and that is the issue of stem cell research. It is an extremely complex issue. It is a scientific issue. It is an issue, Mr. Speaker, that demands the highest quality debate and input here in the U.S. House of Representatives. And, once again, what we are seeing from the majority party is not that kind of involvement. 
   Nobody, nobody on the minority side of the aisle has been involved specifically in bringing forward the legislation, with the exception of the few individuals who are supportive of what the majority party is doing. Nobody who has a contrary view has been involved in the process. There have been no committee hearings this session on this bill. The Republicans by and large have been shut out and certainly all of the freshmen have been shut out of this issue. An issue that truly, Mr. Speaker, you talk about a life-and-death issue. This is a life-and-death issue. 
   I am so pleased to be joined by many of my colleagues this evening to talk specifically about the issue of embryonic stem cell research and stem cell research in general. I would remind folks again of kind of the hallmark quote of the Official Truth Squad, and that is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts. And if you look at the scientific facts on this issue, Mr. Speaker, you will arrive at the right conclusion. 
   So I am pleased to ask to join us this evening my good colleague from North Carolina, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, who has been passionate in her desire to make certain that we as a Nation have an appropriate and correct policy when it relates to embryonic stem cell research. 
   So I yield to my good friend from North Carolina, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank Congresswoman Foxx for participating and for bringing up the incredible importance of the ethical issues that are real. Regardless of where you come down on this issue, there is no doubt, it cannot be denied there are significant ethical challenges and questions surrounding this entire debate. If we ignore those as a Nation in our debate and discussion about it, it will result in a disservice to the entire Nation. 
   I am pleased to call again on my physician colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey), an obstetrician-gynecologist who practiced for almost 30 years and has incredible knowledge and passion and perspective on this most important issue of stem cell research.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for joining us this evening and truly the recognition that this is a life-and-death issue. 
   As I mentioned, regardless where anybody is, Mr. Speaker, on this issue, whether or not you believe that an embryo is indeed life or not, nobody can deny that there are ethical questions and an ethical dilemma that surrounds all of this. 
   As a physician, I was trained in what is called the scientific model which means you try to collect as much information as possible and determine from that information what course of action you ought to take, and then step back and evaluate what has occurred in treating a patient or in whatever course of action you might have taken, and then make decisions based upon that information. 
   The information we have available to us now, the information, specific information, the facts, not opinions but facts, the facts of the situation right now are that, in the area of stem cell research, which all of us support, all of us support stem cell research, in the area of stem cell research, the work that is being done for patients right now is overwhelming in its benefit now from adult and cord stem cell research and stem cell treatments in the area of adult and cord stem cell as opposed to embryonic stem cell. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you know, there has been no opportunity to amend or bring light in this Congress to that issue. 
   I know that this won't show up very well, but this is a sheet that has 77 different diseases on it for which there are currently either clinical treatments or clinical trials for patients. Seventy-seven different diseases. 
   I think it is important for you, Mr. Speaker, and anybody listening, to appreciate that there are individuals who are being cured of diseases right now from the use of adult and cord stem cells, stem cells that are not derived from situations where there is, indeed, this ethical question or challenge. 
   In fact, there are at least nine patients who have been cured of their sickle cell disease. That is patients who no longer have sickle cell disease utilizing cord stem cells. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is incredible. It is a wonderful thing that has occurred. It is something that all of us ought to embrace, and that is factual. That is factual. 
   If you look, however, Mr. Speaker, at the number of diseases for which there are clinical trials or clinical treatments in the area of embryonic stem cells, and those are the ones where there is that ethical dilemma or challenge, this is the answer to that: None. None. Zero. 
   So you have 77 different diseases that are being either treated in the clinical setting with actual patients, real patients, or there are trials that are going on or there is active study going; 77 with adult and cord stem cells. And then embryonic stem cells, none. Zero, Mr. Speaker.  
   Now, it is wholly possible that something at some point in the future may result in the ability to use embryonic stem cells for the treatment of disease, but I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues here and to anybody who truly is interested in the factual nature of this scientific question, a very complex question, and that is that the scientists are way ahead of the politicians on this.     
   Congresswoman Foxx mentioned one of the wonderful breakthroughs that was just announced from Wake Forest earlier this week, and that is the use of amniotic fluid to find and recover, capture, if you will, embryonic stem cells that have none of the ethical dilemma of whether or not life is being destroyed in order to advance science. None. None of that ethical dilemma. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize that science ought to be listened to in this, and we ought to pay attention to facts. There is no reason to move forward with a bill that will not necessarily result in significant cures for diseases and that will only, only, result in the demagoguing of an issue and hold out a false hope for individuals for whom they believe that if we just pass this bill that their disease will be cured tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, that simply is not the case. The biggest bang for the buck in terms of utilizing taxpayer money, Federal taxpayer money, which is hard-earned taxpayer money, for appropriate research is in the area of adult and cord stem cells and possibly embryonic stem cells that are recovered in a way that has none of the ethical dilemma or challenge. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was honored to be with you this evening.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, Annie Lee Boggs Latimer was born in Milton County, now a portion of Fulton County in north Georgia on January 10, 1907, to Elizabeth and Ben Boggs 100 years ago today. She grew up on a farm on Boggs Road with eight siblings, Glenn, Mary, Frank, Frances, Walter A., Nettie, Ruth and Dorothy, off what is now I-85 in Gwinnett County, Georgia. 
   She attended Duluth High School, Young Harris College and the University of Georgia and went on to become a beloved teacher in Gwinnett and Cobb counties for over 30 years. On June 12, 1937, she married William B. Latimer, and for over 50 years, they lived in what all knew as the ``Rock House'' in Duluth, Georgia. Anne and Bill were married for a wonderful 61 years until his passing in 1998. 
   She is the proud mother of Ben W. Latimer and the mother-in-law of Rachel H. Latimer. She is an inspiration for her two grandsons and their wives, Bill and Lynn and Mike and Laura, and adored by her five great grandchildren Brian, Sara, Claire, Gabrielle and Andrew. She is known affectionately by her family as ``Mama Anne'' and by her friends at church as ``Miss Anne.'' 
   She has imparted wisdom and positive values to all the many students who were in her classes and benefitted from her teaching. Mama Anne is a guiding light for all her family and always brings love, direction, caring and support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know the U.S. House of Representatives joins me in sending our very best on the occasion of her 100th birthday to Anne B. Latimer and recognizing her life as a role model to all for achieving independence, longevity and success, by living the American dream of spirituality, community, hard work, and accomplishment. 
   I am very privileged, Mr. Speaker, to have had the opportunity to recognize one of America's greatest citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the leadership for allowing me to host this hour this evening, an hour once again of the Official Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad is a group of individuals who got together almost 2 years ago now, and we are somewhat frustrated and concerned about the level of not just rancor here in Congress, but the level of disinformation and the kind of information that was often being put forward in support of certain legislation that, in fact, well, Mr. Speaker, just wasn't true. 
   So what we did is to get together, primarily, a group of freshmen from the last Congress and put in place this Official Truth Squad. Our goal, our purpose, is to raise the level of the rhetoric, to be a little more positive than is usually the case here in Washington, and to use facts. To use facts. We have a number of favorite quotes, but one we like to use frequently is one from former United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who kind of crystallized what is a real concern here in Washington, because everybody throws around their own opinions. But his quote was, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.'' 
   We think that it is extremely helpful when we are talking about issues to talk about facts, because if we are not using facts to base the decisions we make here in Washington, if we are not using facts to reach the conclusions, then it is very likely that we will not reach the right conclusion. 
   I have said before, Mr. Speaker, that in my former life I was a physician, and I knew if I didn't use facts and I didn't make the right diagnosis, it was virtually impossible to formulate the right treatment plan and then have the patient get well. So we can look at that as an analogy for what we are trying to do for our Nation, which is to make the right diagnosis, to formulate the right proposals and plans and policies and put them in place so that the patient that is our Nation survives and thrives and does well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to have the opportunity once again tonight to host an hour of the Official Truth Squad; and I will be joined by a number of colleagues, and we will address two or three issues this evening. We are going to start by talking about what many people have discussed around the Nation, and it has kind of captured the attention of many in the media, Mr. Speaker, and that is this issue of the 100-hour agenda that the majority party, the Democrats, have. 
   It is curious to look at that for a variety of reasons, but we will look specifically at the amount of time and kind of what they have been doing with that 100 hours. 
   Secondly, we will talk about the issue of student loans. It is a bill we had here in Congress today, and we are trying to have facts back up policy as it relates to how best to provide appropriate loans for students who are trying to reach that American dream all across this Nation. 
   Thirdly, we are going to talk a little about energy policy, something that I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, needs a lot of facts brought to the table. 
   The common theme that I think people will appreciate if they are truly interested in looking objectively at these three issues, and so many others here in Congress, the common theme about these three issues tonight, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, is broken promises. Broken promises. 
   In fact, when you look at these issues independently, I think you will be able to see as we go through them the broken promises that have occurred just in these first 2 weeks in Congress. 
   And why is it important, Mr. Speaker, for promises to be kept? Well, you know, we hear all the time from the other side that people voted last November for a change. And they did vote for a change; there is no doubt about it. There were a lot of things we in the majority could have done better. But people across this Nation based their votes upon information that they had. They based their votes upon what they were being told and what they were being promised by the other side. So if those promises aren't kept, then that is important. 
   It is important for a variety of reasons. One is that the policies that were promoted and were espoused as being the be-all and end-all for our Nation aren't being carried out by the majority party. But as important as that is, Mr. Speaker, maybe even more important is the fact that when people go to the polls and they vote, and they rely on what Members of Congress who are ultimately successful have told them they were going to do, and then those things aren't done, all that does, Mr. Speaker, is breed a cynicism and a disgust with our form of government and our Representatives, and makes it so that it is extremely difficult to move forward in a positive direction for our Nation. 
   I want to talk a little bit about the 100-hour clock, and then we will have some others, I know, who will be interested in speaking about that. There has been a lot of talk about this 100 hours, this wonderful 100 hours in which the Democrat majority was going to get all these grand things done. And it was promised, it was promised, this 100 hours. 
   Now, what we have seen over this period of time is that that 100 hours has changed. Initially, the first 100 hours was going to be, to quote the Speaker on October 6, 2006, she said, ``In the first 100 hours the House meets after Democrats win control,'' and then she went on to describe what they were going to do. The first 100 hours the House meets after Democrats take control. 
   Then it soon morphed into, well, it will be the first 100 legislative hours. On December 1, after the election, when they began looking at what they were going to do and how they were going to make it happen, they said, on December 1, 2006, ``In our first 100 legislative hours in office we have a bipartisan and an achievable plan.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, that kind of went by the wayside as well. And when we called them on it, we said what 100 hours is it, the new majority leader, Mr. Hoyer from Maryland, put it best when he kind of talked about, well, we will try to do it in 100 hours. Maybe we will get it done, maybe we won't. But then he said, ``It all depends on how you are counting 100 hours.'' 
   And he is right. He is right. It all depends on how you are counting the 100 hours. If you have the desire to deceive the American people and turn the clock on and off whenever you want to, then you get to about 33 hours, which is what the Democrat clock tells us they have taken. 
   This is our third week, Mr. Speaker, our third week here. So what does that mean? It means that we are working about 10 hours a week. About 10 hours a week. I think the American people are working a whole lot more than 10 hours a week. A reasonable amount of time, given that we have been sworn in for about 14 days, 2 full weeks, a reasonable amount of time may be 80. And that is about the sense of how many hours we have in fact been in session. 
   As of 7 p.m. tonight, Mr. Speaker, we will have been in session 81 hours and 53 minutes. So that is a reasonable estimate. But the total, if you really keep track of 100 hours, the total time as of noon today was 336 hours. As of noon today, 336 hours. 
   Now, people may say, well, that doesn't make a whole lot of difference what the time is. But, Mr. Speaker, it does, because the promises were made and the promises have been broken. Again, as Mr. Hoyer says, it all depends on how you're counting 100 hours. Kind of reminds me of the quote about the definition of ``is,'' doesn't it, Mr. Speaker? 
   We are so pleased to have many members of our conference who want to take part in the Official Truth Squad, and tonight we have a new friend to me and to our conference, Congressman David Davis, the gentleman from Tennessee, who is a freshman. This is his first term in Congress. 
   He began a small business, a very successful individual back in Tennessee, and he has great perception on the processes of legislation because he, like I, served 8 years in his State legislature. So I am very, very pleased to welcome Congressman Davis to the  floor this evening to share a few words with us about the first 100 hours, the first couple of weeks, and his experiences. 
   I welcome you and would be glad to yield.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating this evening, and I appreciate your perspective. You have come with a wealth of knowledge and information, especially in the health care issues, but also your legislative experience. And I think you are right. I think that the American people did indeed vote for change. And you outlined a number of the issues that I suspect, had the other side run, during the campaign, on those issues, that the vast majority of the American people, Mr. Speaker, would have said well, that is not what I mean. 
   To not reveal to the American people what kind of votes are occurring in committee? That is not democracy in action. Doing away with the super majority. We know why they did away with the super majority don't we now, because they are about to raise taxes tomorrow, and they couldn't have done it if it required a super majority. 
   To have the United Nations have some significant control over portions of U.S. foreign policy, that is not the kind of change that the people were interested in. 
   And you used one of my favorite lines, and that is that the special interests that you have are the constituents that you represent. And it is so true, that when people in this Chamber talk about special interests, the fact of the matter is the only special interests we ought to be concerned about are the constituents that we represent.  
   And so I can't thank you enough for your participation tonight and the wisdom that you bring and the truth. We don't call it the Official Truth Squad for nothing. And you spoke words of truth and good fact and we appreciate that. 
   I want to move on, Mr. Speaker, to a couple of other issues. But before I do present a specific issue, I want to highlight some comments and a quote that come from our Speaker, from the new Speaker, that she made during her address to the first session of this Congress. And I think it is important for the American people to be reminded the difference between word and deed. People can say a lot of things. But the actions are what speak louder than words. And these are the words that she used on that first day. ``Let us join together in the first 100 hours,'' there it is again, ``to make this Congress the most honest and open in history. This openness requires respect for every voice in Congress. As Thomas Jefferson said, every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. My colleague elected me to be Speaker of the House, the entire House, respectful of the vision of our founders, the expectations of our people and the great challenges we face. We have an obligation to reach beyond partisanship and to serve all Americans.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, those are wonderful words. Would that they were true. Would that they were true. 
   And so that brings us to the issue of student loans, the issue that was on the agenda for the House to deal with today. And I am sorry to say, Mr. Speaker, that what we have here is just one of a repeated series of broken promises. This is another broken promise by this majority party. 
   What did they promise? The promise was, this is a quote from their own publication. ``Our new direction plan will slash interest rates on college loans in half to 3.4 percent for students and to 4.25 percent for parents.'' 
   What is the reality? Well, the reality, Mr. Speaker, is that instead of cutting rates in half across the board, the Democrats, what they did was phase in a decrease in rates over a 5-year period of time, and only for subsidized loans going to undergraduate students, not the statement that was given, not the promise that was given to the American people. 
   And Mr. Speaker, remember when promises are made and promises are broken, it does a disservice to all of America and it creates a distrust in our institution. But more importantly, this whole issue of decreasing student loan interest rates, once the fixed rate for this one category, just one category, reaches 3.4 percent, which occurs in July of 2011, it doesn't get there until July of 2011, but once it gets there it is only in effect 
   for 6 months. The fixed rate returns to its original rate on January 2, 2012. Mr. Speaker, that is a broken promise. That is a broken promise if I ever saw one. And what it means is that the American people decrease their trust. They loose their trust in their leadership. And certainly that is what is happening right now across this Nation as this Nation sees the broken promises that are being piled up one after another. 
   I am pleased to be joined by another good friend and colleague, a member of the Official Truth Squad coming to the floor and assisting in bringing truth and facts and information to the American people, Congresswoman MARSHA BLACKBURN from Tennessee, who has again had a wealth of experience here in Congress, but also wonderful experience back home, and looks out for those special interests that she has, and that is her constituents at home. I welcome you this evening and yield to you and look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate that because I think it is important to highlight that. But I think that what you said, I don't want folks to miss the fact that, and I was stunned when I learned this with the bill that came to the floor today, and I suspect you were as well, and that is that the bill that was on the floor today by the Democrat majority will not assist a single undergraduate student in this Nation. Not one. Isn't that the truth? And I yield back.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlelady for participating tonight and for bringing wisdom and truth to us in this Chamber. 
   I think the part of the challenge that we have is, this really is a difference in philosophy. It is about who ought to be in control. You highlighted that extremely well, talking about the importance of what we on the Republican side believe, and that is that students and parents ought to have the resources in order to make decisions, not government making decisions. 
   What we have seen in this very short 100 hours, depending on how you run the clock in these first couple of weeks, what we have seen is a clear example of the government controlling all aspects of our life from student loans to prescription medication to all sorts of things, wage and price controls. 
   This chart here is the exact chart that determines the definitions that were provided in the legislation that was on the floor tonight or today for student interest rates. 
   Right now, as you know, Mr. Speaker, they are at 6.8 percent, and that was fixed appropriately, our side did that last time, in order to make certain that we had more students eligible for student loans. 
   What happens over the ensuing 5 years with the bill that was passed today by the Democrats? You can see that next year the rate goes down to 6.12 percent, then down to 5.44 percent and on down until you get to 3.40 percent. But again that is only for 6 months. What happens after that 6 months? What happens on January 1, 2012? Goes right back up to 6.80. 
   So the frustration and the disconnect that people hear at home when they think that they have been told something that would occur, but in fact, that is not what is going to occur at all, in fact, they have been sold a bill of goods. It is another broken promise. 
   I think it is very destructive to all of us, all of us on both sides of the aisle, when people aren't able to trust what the Members are telling them in terms of what they would do would they be given the opportunity to lead. 
   We are joined again this evening by another dear friend, Congresswoman VIRGINIA FOXX from North Carolina, who is a stalwart on the Official Truth Squad, and she brings such wonderful wisdom. In this instance, she probably has more knowledge about this than virtually anybody else, that is because she was a college president back in North Carolina. 
   I welcome you and thank you for your participation tonight. I look forward to your comments.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you so much for your wonderful words of wisdom and sharing your personal story. It really is extremely helpful and pertinent and apt. 
   You call this a travesty. It really is a travesty, because what has happened is that the hopes and dreams of so many Americans have been raised by the rhetoric that we have heard from the other side. In fact, if you look at this again, and you see over a 5-year period of time, the rate decreases for a mere 6 months to 3.4 percent and then shoots right back up to 6.8 percent. 
   It really isn't fulfilling a promise; as my good friend from North Carolina said, it is breaking a promise. I think that the American people are paying attention, and over a period of time, this will just add up to their frustration about this kind of hypocrisy and this kind of leadership. 
   My good friends on the other side of the aisle, for the past 2 years or so, have been talking about what they call ``third-party validators'' to make it so that they can cite individuals that are saying that what they are contending is the case. 
   We have got some third-party validators on this. I have before me a couple of quotes from some articles written in some very prominent newspapers yesterday and today. The first is from today's Wall Street Journal. This is about these student loans. It says, quote, ``The ostensible goal is to make college more affordable, but such a move could well wind up having the opposite effect.'' This bill, that is, could wind up having the opposite effect. 
   Further, in the absence of all of this subsidization, colleges would have to be more cautious about raising tuition because their customers would be affected more directly.     
   The biggest winners from this latest subsidy will be the relatively well off professors and administrators who run higher education. ``Ultimately increasing the government's role is a recipe for making college less affordable.'' 
   Then from the Christian Science Monitor yesterday, from a gentleman who is quoted here, Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of financialaid.org for students. He says, ``It's a great sound bite, cutting rates in half, but it is an incredibly expensive proposal with very little student aid benefit.'' ``Very little student aid benefit.'' ``Congress would be better off spending the money on something else, like increasing the Pell Grant,'' which isn't increased with this bill, offered to the neediest students as aid that graduates don't need to pay back,'' Kantrowitz said. 
   Mr. Speaker, really it is just another broken promise, and it is truly, truly a shame to have this be one of the hallmarks of these first ``six for six,'' these proposals that come forward. And virtually every one of them doesn't live up to the promise that was made. 
   Would the promises that were made be the proposals that I would bring to the floor? Well, not likely, Mr. Speaker. But I do believe that it is important that promises that are made for our constituents be promises that are kept when you are in control, in power, in Congress. Otherwise, we do a discredit and disservice to our entire electoral system. 
   How are the American people supposed to be able to decide for whom they should vote, if regardless of what an individual says it is not what they do? I believe in an individual's word, and I believe it is important that individuals make honest comments when they are running for office. In fact, that is not what we have seen to date, Mr. Speaker, and that is very, very troubling, to me and to many of my constituents and many folks around the Nation. 
   I want to switch gears a little bit now, Mr. Speaker, to the issue that will be on the floor tomorrow in the United States House of Representatives. It will be H.R. 6, a bill that has to do with energy policy, national energy policy. 
   The upshot of the bill is this: Mr. Speaker, as we talked about before, it will be the first time that the Democrats have very directly raised taxes on the American people. It took them 14 days to decide that they were going to do it, not a long time. But who are they going to raise taxes on? 
   Well, the Democrat energy plan that will be introduced tomorrow, and I will have some information on it, will be a tax increase on American oil companies. Yup, they are going to tax American oil companies because there is a lot of sentiment and anger out there about energy prices. But what happens to foreign oil companies? Not a thing. Not a thing, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, you talk about a travesty. That is a travesty. This bill tomorrow will drive up our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Again, I want to go to some third-party validators. An article in the Wall Street Journal yesterday talked about this bill and said if you increase the cost of domestic oil production by $10 billion, you are ensuring that U.S. imports of OPEC oil will rise and domestic production will fall. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it ought to be a goal and my constituents back in the Sixth District in Georgia believe that  we ought to be utilizing American resources for Americans, having American energy for Americans. There is a three-pronged way to do that: Conversation, utilizing resources and alternative fuel. What we are doing is increasing the amount of foreign oil being used. It doesn't make any sense at all. It doesn't make any sense at all. 
   The Wall Street Journal article goes on to say the House energy bill is nearly a carbon copy of California's Proposition 87. That 2006 ballot initiative would have taxed California's home-produced oil in order to subsidize green technology alternatives. 
   California is a fairly liberal State, the home State of our Speaker. Maybe that is where they got this idea. California is a fairly liberal State, but even those voters understood that Proposition 87 would have damaged the State's home oil and gas industry, increased foreign oil consumption and raised the energy bills for State residents, and it was clobbered at the polls. 
   This is a quote from the Wall Street Journal. ``The House will plow ahead anyway, but let's hope the Senate has more wisdom.'' 
   I include a copy of that article for the RECORD, Mr. Speaker.  
   The OPEC Energy Security Act 
   House Democrats have finally released the details of their ``Energy Security Bill,'' which will be voted on this week, and they must be cursing their rotten luck. Just when they want to stick it to Big Oil for alleged price gouging, oil and home heating costs are plunging. Never mind; this was a campaign theme amid $3 gasoline, and a detail like $2 gas isn't about to stop Democrats now. 
   This bill is said to promote America's energy independence, but the biggest winner may be OPEC. This is a lengthy, complicated bill, but the central idea is simple: Raise taxes on domestic oil producers and then spend the money to subsidize ethanol, solar energy, windmills (so long as they're not on Cape Cod), and so on. But if you increase the cost of domestic oil production by $10 billion, you are ensuring that U.S. imports of OPEC oil will rise and domestic production will fall. 
   The bill also includes a ``Strategic Energy Efficiency and Renewables Reserve'' fund for alternative fuels. That sounds a lot like the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corporation--one of the more notorious Washington boondoggles of all time, having spent $2.1 billion of tax dollars on alternative fuels before declaring bankruptcy. Today there is no under-investment by the private sector in alternative energy. The research firm New Energy Finance has found that between 2004 and 2006 investment in alternative energy doubled to $63 billion. Venture capital funding of green-energy technologies has quadrupled since 1998. 
   The Democrats also insist that the big five oil companies have received sweetheart deals from the government that have ripped off taxpayers. So let's take a closer look. The most controversial issue involves $6 billion in royalty payments that oil companies are said to owe the government for oil pumped from federal waters. The facts suggest otherwise. 
   These were leases for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico signed between oil companies and the Clinton Administration's Interior Department in 1998-99. At that time the world oil price had fallen to as low as $10 a barrel and the contracts were signed without a requirement of royalty payments if the price of oil rose above $35 a barrel. 
   Interior's Inspector General investigated and found that this standard royalty clause was omitted not because of any conspiracy by big oil, but rather because of bureaucratic bungling in the Clinton Administration. The same report found that a year after these contracts were signed Chevron and other oil companies alerted Interior to the absence of royalty fees, and that Interior replied that the contracts should go forward nonetheless. 
   The companies have since invested billions of dollars in the Gulf on the basis of those lease agreements, and only when the price of oil surged to $70 a barrel did anyone start expressing outrage that Big Oil was ``cheating'' taxpayers out of royalties. Some oil companies have voluntarily offered to renegotiate these contracts. The Democrats are now demanding that all these firms do so--even though the government signed binding contracts. 
   The Democratic bill strong-arms oil companies into renegotiating the contracts or pay a $9 per barrel royalty fee from these leases. If the companies refuse, they lose their rights to bid for any future leases on federal property. So at the same time that the U.S. is trying to persuade Venezuela and other nations to honor property rights, Congress does its own Hugo Chavez imitation. 
   Are American taxpayers worse off because of these leasing agreements? Hardly. It's fortunate these contracts were issued when oil prices were so low, because the oil discovered from those leases will do precisely what the Democratic energy bill will not: reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil. One of the largest oil deposits in the Gulf was recently discovered as a result of these leases. 
   Democrats also want to raise about $5 to $6 billion by snatching away alleged tax breaks for Big Oil in the Republicans' 2005 energy bill. Sorry, that isn't true either. The Congressional Research Service reports that the net impact of the 2005 energy bill was to raise taxes on the oil and gas industry by $300 million. Nor does it make sense to repeal a domestic oil company's eligibility for a 2004 tax cut that reduced the effective corporate income tax rate to 32% from 35% on U.S. manufacturers. This tax cut increases the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers that are now penalized by a U.S. corporate tax rate that is among the highest in the industrialized world. Our objection is that every U.S. company should pay the same, lower rate. 
   The House energy bill is nearly a carbon copy (if we can still use the word ``carbon'' in polite company) of California's Proposition 87. That 2006 ballot initiative would have taxed California's home-produced oil in order to subsidize ``green technology'' alternatives. California is a fairly liberal state, but even those voters understood that Prop 87 would have damaged the state's home oil and gas industry, increased foreign oil consumption, and raised the energy bills of state residents. It was clobbered at the polls. The House will plow ahead anyway, but let's hope the Senate has more wisdom.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to also refer to some good work done by the Heritage Foundation. The Heritage Foundation is a group of individuals who talks about responsibility, talks about making certain that individuals have opportunities to succeed in our Nation, and they came out with a memo to Speaker Pelosi citing this bill that is coming on the floor tomorrow, H.R. 6, saying that it risks making energy more expensive. 
   There are a number of quotes I would like to refer to, Mr. Speaker. First, it says, ``The public has responded with anger to recent high energy prices,'' and that certainly is true as I go home and hear what folks are concerned about, especially when gas was up around $3 a gallon people were very concerned, and understandably so, and home heating oil and all the like increasing, and that puts many individuals in significant trouble. 
   It goes on to say, ``Doing something about energy prices is understandably high on the agenda.'' No doubt about it. ``Unfortunately, the wrong approach to meeting Americans' energy needs is H.R. 6. H.R. 6 will at best do nothing to reduce gasoline prices, and could actually increase them over the long term.'' 
   They go on to describe very clearly the consequences of what this will do, increasing taxes on the American oil companies, which will drive America to be more dependent on foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, that doesn't make any sense. When I go home and explain things like that to my constituents back in Georgia, they say, well, why in Earth would you do something foolish like that? And all I can tell them is, well, it appears to be that the other side thinks that hollow rhetoric is what the American people want, that they aren't interested in real substance. 
   This Heritage Foundation memo goes on to say, ``The underlying assumptions that the domestic oil and gas sector is currently undertaxed may have been popular campaign rhetoric, but it is not supported by the evidence. Total income taxes paid by this sector reached a record $71 billion in 2005, the last year for which there is data available. This is up from $48 billion in 2004 and $32 billion in 2003.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, what we see is that as revenues increase to oil companies, taxes increase, the amount that they pay in taxes increases as well. 
   What happens with H.R. 6? ``Most importantly, H.R. 6 will cause harm in the long run by discouraging investment in new domestic drilling for oil and gas.'' 
   If you tax something, you get less of it. That is an economic principle that my friends on the other side of the aisle seem not to appreciate. If you tax something, you get less of it. 
   ``America's demand for energy is growing, along with its economy.'' 
   Again, that is the three-prong approach needed for energy: Conservation, utilizing responsibly American resources, and then alternative fuel. 
   But I think it is important, as this memo goes on to state, that we learn from history. The bottom line is that H.R. 6 will raise taxes and will reduce domestic supplies of oil and gas, it will increase imports to fill that void, and it will ultimately increase prices for consumers at the pump and for energy supplies. 
   How do we know that? Well, this is the lesson of the infamous windfall  profit tax on oil firms that was imposed under the Carter administration in 1980. It was repealed ultimately under the Reagan administration in 1988. But, Mr. Speaker, people around the Nation who knew what was happening at that time will recognize, and this will kind of ring a bell, it will remind them of what happened in 1980. 
   This goes on to say, ``In 1980, anger at Big Oil,'' and a lot of people were mad at Big Oil over high prices, ``led to this punitive tax, the windfall profit tax. But America learned the hard way that this approach does not benefit the American people. According to the Congressional Research Service, the windfall profits tax reduced domestic oil production between 3 and 6 percent.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say that again. This tax, similar to the one that the House is about to vote on tomorrow, reduced domestic oil production between 3 and 6 percent. It increased oil imports between 8 and 16 percent. This made the U.S. more dependent upon imported oil. We ought to take pains to avoid repeating that energy policy blunder. 
   This goes on to say, ``The best thing that can be said for the proposed tax changes and royalty relief provisions in H.R. 6 is that they might not be large enough to seriously reduce domestic energy production, in which case they would not cause much harm. But even so, they set a bad precedent, and if repeated in subsequent bills, could do as much damage as the infamous windfall profits tax.'' 
   So if the past is any guide to the future, most of the money in H.R. 6 will be wasted. On the other hand, these tax revenues, if left in the hands of the energy companies themselves, will be reinvested. And how do we know that? Well, in 2005, the energy industry reinvested $131 billion, $131 billion, an amount that at that time actually exceeded and was higher than their net income of $119 billion for the year. 
   So what is the better way? Well, as this memo goes on to describe, Mr. Speaker, ``The better way, the real answer to high energy prices, is not to tinker with tax and royalty rates on existing domestic energy supplies, but it is to expand those supplies so that more oil and gas become available. Recent Department of Interior studies conducted pursuant to the 2005 energy bill confirm that the United States has substantial oil and natural gas deposits.'' Without a doubt. ``These studies also show that much of these offshore and onshore resources are off limits due to legal and regulatory constraints.'' 
   This next sentence, Mr. Speaker, kind of caught my eye. ``In fact, America remains the only nation on Earth,'' the only nation on Earth, ``that has restricted access to a substantial portion of its domestic energy potential.'' 
   We are the only nation on Earth that does this. And why we think that there is no connection between that and us being more reliant on foreign oil today than we ever have been is beyond me. It doesn't make any sense. Again, Mr. Speaker, my constituents back home don't think it makes any sense either. 
   In the early seventies, when we all waited in those gas lines and pounded our fist on the dashboard and said never again, we will never be this reliant on foreign oil again, and all of us who can remember that vividly know that sense of emotion and know that sense of frustration as the gas shortages in the early seventies occurred. 
   But the dirty little secret, Mr. Speaker, is at that time we were about 25 percent reliant on foreign oil. Now we are about 60 percent reliant on foreign oil. And if the Democrat majority has its way, we will be even more reliant on foreign oil, because what we are doing is punishing American companies who assist us in trying to have a greater production of American resources. 
   This article goes on to say, ``Reducing the restrictions on domestic exploration and drilling, not rewriting the Tax Code or revising royalty agreements,'' as in the bill to be dealt with tomorrow, ``will allow for greater supplies and lower prices in the years ahead, and by expanding the resource base it would lead to far greater increases in tax and royalty revenues than H.R. 6 ever could.'' 
   So if my good friends on the other side of the aisle are truly interested in having more money, more taxes to spend as they see fit, to increase the power of government, they would be well advised to allow for increasing production, which would increase the ability for them to receive greater tax revenue. This should be the main focus of any genuinely pro-consumer energy policy; that is to not tinker with the tax policy and the royalty policy. 
   Again, a good energy policy, a quality energy policy, is one that we dealt with last year in Congress, Mr. Speaker. It was primarily three-pronged. One, it dealt with conservation. This bill tomorrow doesn't do significantly anything with conservation. And it encourages Americans to do all they can to conserve, because certainly all of us can do more to make certain we are not utilizing resources that are so, so precious.     
   Second is to make certain that we utilize American resources responsibly. Again, Mr. Speaker, as I said before, America remains the only nation on Earth that has restricted access to a substantial portion of its domestic energy potential. 
   Finally, the solution in the long run and the long term is, indeed, alternative fuel, and we worked diligently to try to make certain that we had resources that would be put forward for hydrogen fuel cells and encouraging inventiveness on the part of the American entrepreneur, because I know, as I suspect you do, Mr. Speaker, that when the American entrepreneur puts his or her mind to it, there is nothing that they are not able to do. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have had this opportunity to come before the House and to share with this House and with you, Mr. Speaker, and with the American people three issues: the issue of process here in the United States House of Representatives, the 100-hour clock; the issue of student loans, the interest on student loans; and the issue of energy policy. 
   I mentioned at the beginning, Mr. Speaker, that the common thread between those three issues tonight, that the majority party has brought to us, are really broken promises. It made multiple promises on the campaign trail, and it truly is a shame that promises kept on the campaign trail do not appear to be promises that will be kept in their majority in Congress. 
   I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that the American people are understanding this. When I go home, I hear people's frustration about a lack of leadership, the broken promises that have occurred even in this short 2 weeks in Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are a wonderful and great Nation, and it is an incredible privilege to represent my constituents in this House, this House of Representatives. I know that the challenges that we face as a Nation are not Democrat challenges and they are not Republican challenges. They are American challenges, and when we work together, we come up with the best solutions. 
   So I would encourage the Speaker to reread her words of the comments she made to this Chamber, to this United States House of Representatives on that very first day. I look forward to the day when we do, in fact, have the most open and honest Congress. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, we have not reached that day yet.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the time to discuss this matter. 
   Madam Speaker, the speeches and claims that we have heard from the other side sound so wonderful. They sound so good. If only this bill did what they say. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is the hollow fulfillment of a solemn promise. It is the epitome of form over substance. And, Madam Speaker, it would be humorous if it weren't so serious. It would be humorous if it didn't increase the hopes and dreams of young people around this Nation only to callously and knowingly dash those hopes and dreams. 
   A couple of specific items. This really is bait and switch. Supporters of this bill contend that a borrower with $13,800 of subsidized debt will save up to $4,400. This assumes that they will see 4 years of loans made at the 3.4 percent rate. Under this legislation, however, no borrower will get more than one year of the 3.4 percent rate. And what happens in 2012? The rate goes right back up to 6.8 percent. Bait and switch. It is a shell game. It will result in damaging cuts to the program that has worked well for the vast majority of colleges in this country and in my own district, and not one single new undergraduate will be helped by this legislation. Not one. It is the fulfillment of a hollow promise. Very, very sad. 
   And it is the principle. Finally, as matter of principle, Madam Speaker, this proposal is a political gimmick. The majority proposes to rob $6 billion from the private sector loan programs, programs that work to not only offer and provide funding for college but also use market competition to drive down rates and offer borrower benefits the government can't match. And what will they do with the money? They will lower some rates for a short time on some borrowers who have in common only the fact that they have either graduated or left school and don't need the help as much as those who may lose the benefits and services that were cut in order to lower the rates. 
   It is a shame that those of us who desire to have a real debate about government's role in assisting middle class students achieve the American Dream of higher education are instead asked to support an expensive counterproductive cut in a student loan program that is working. Madam Speaker, this would be humorous if it weren't so serious. 
   I strongly support financial assistance for students who are in true financial need. Sadly, H.R. 5 is not a bill that will accomplish any of that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support a commonsense recommit that will indeed help students who are in financial need, and oppose the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your leadership on this issue. I want to thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their work on this committee. 
   My amendment in this en bloc amendment addresses the issue of eliminating waste, fraud and abuse within the DOD system by addressing the issue of government-wide purchase cards. These cards are used to acquire supplies such as pencils, paper, computers, but also to even make payments on government contract. And these cards, while they've proven to be valuable as they reduce administrative costs and increase flexibility, they can be used or abused and misused, as has been evident by a recent GAO study. That study showed that, over a 1-year period of time, 41 percent of the purchase card transactions failed to meet basic internal standards. 
   My amendment will ensure that purchases are independently verified and received by an authorizing official. It asks for an inventory of property to be updated promptly. Without doing this, property such as laptops and computers can go missing or even stolen. 
   And for those personnel who abuse the purchase cards, this amendment would dictate that DOD will have the option of having them reimburse the government for unauthorized or erroneous purchases. 
   I know my colleagues will support this wise amendment to decrease waste, fraud and abuse. I thank my colleagues for their support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding, and I want to commend the ranking member of the Rules Committee and the former chairman for his comments because I think they bring some truth and veracity to this discussion. 
   I am truly pleased to join my colleagues here who are interested in good government, responsive government, but accountable government. And as a matter of principle, as a matter of principle we believe it is imperative that elected officials be held accountable for what they say and what they do. 
   Now, while on the campaign trail, Democrats made the promise over and over again that they wanted to have the most open and fair government in history. In fact, the new Speaker said herself, ``More than 2 years ago, I first sent Speaker Hastert proposals to restore civility in Congress. I reiterate my support for these proposals today. We must restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order for considering legislation, and ensure the rights of the minority, whichever party is in the minority. The voice of every American has the right to be heard.'' 
   And she is right. But far from regular order is what we are dealing with here. There are a couple of items I want to present. We have heard that these issues to be dealt with over the next 100 hours of debate have already been vetted, already been through committee. In fact, the freshmen, who are at least 39-strong Democrats, have not had any opportunity. So there is no regular order there. 
   We also note that in the rules package under Democrat control, the Rules Committee would become anything but transparent, being that the votes that are required or will take place in the Rules Committee will not be available to the public. I do not think that is what the American people voted on when they voted in November. 
   A minority bill of rights is what we will propose in our previous question amendment motion, and it is that kind of common sense and that kind of accountability and fairness that Americans expect and that we are asking for. Hearings, amendments to bills, 24 hours' notice, it is that kind of thing we need because it is that process that ensures that the House will work for all Americans to decrease taxes and to make certain our security is maintained in solving the health care challenges that we have. 
   Mr. Speaker, it appears that promises made on the campaign trail are going to be promises broken in the majority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate once again the opportunity to come to the floor of the House, and I am pleased to do it on the first day of the 110th Congress. It is an exciting day, a historic day. 
   I want to thank the leadership for allowing me the opportunity to host an hour of the Official Truth Squad. We started this 2 years ago, and did so because there were many of us who were concerned about the fact that on the floor of the House oftentimes the words that were spoken and the presentations made oftentimes bore little resemblance to the truth. So we began 2 years ago to institute the Official Truth Squad, to try to come to the floor like this every so often and try to do it at least once a week to bring light to issues of concern to the American people. 
   Today is no different. This is a historic day, the first day of the 110th Congress. It was an exciting day. The first day is always exciting. It is full of families and celebration and children on the floor of the House sharing the remarkable experiences of Members being sworn in, oftentimes new Members, of which we have today, Mr. Speaker, as you know, over 50 new Members in the House of Representatives. So it is an important occasion. 
   We heard a lot of discussion leading up to today, and that discussion was culminated in November by a vote by the American people, and the American people voted and changed the majorities in the House of Representatives. And in terms of the American people's decision, it was the right decision for them because it was the decision that they made at the polls. It was important for us, it is important for all of us to appreciate that, yes, they did, the American people spoke. 
   I think one of the things that they said is that they want a different process here. They were tired of some of the things that had gone on here in the past, so they spoke and said a different process is needed. 
   Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, as you well know, talked as we led up to the November elections about the need for civility in Congress, which we believe wholeheartedly, about the need for openness, which is imperative for us to have in our system of government, openness, and then fiscal responsibility, kind of three tenets that they brought to the American people. I would concur with each and every one of those. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that those principles by the now-majority party ought to last longer than one day of speeches. So we have some concerns about what has occurred and some disappointments already, and we would like to share some of those with the American people as we are presenting things to the House of Representatives this evening. 
   Now, in pointing these out, the purpose is not to say how good it was when we were in the majority, because it can always be better. As many of us talked in the election process, the campaign process, we talked about the kinds of improvements that we would like to see. The purpose is to shed light on both word and deed, and it is important, because what folks say and what they do, it is important for the American people to know that those two things are the same. 
   In our system of government, we have elections where people go to the polls and vote. They vote based on a lot of things, but probably most importantly they base their vote on the fact that they believe that the person that they voted for and what they said they were going to do was in fact what they were going to do. So when individuals say things that they are going to do once they get into office and then they break those promises, then it is important for people to be held accountable. The American people do that time and again. 
   It is also important as a Member of now the minority party for us to hold the majority party accountable. One of the responsibilities we have in our dynamic form of government is to hold them accountable, and we do this as a matter of principle. It is a matter of principle, and we believe it is a matter of principle that elected officials ought to be held accountable for not just what they say, but also what they do. 
   To that end, I would like to share, Mr. Speaker, some quotes. We are going to talk a fair amount tonight about what individuals have said in the past, oftentimes the recent past, and what we have some concerns with in terms of their action. 
   This first quote is from the ``Declaration on Honest Leadership and Open Government,'' which was one of the Democrat Party's publications that they had prior to the election. The quote there is from the now-Speaker. It says: ``Our goal is to restore accountability, honesty and openness at all levels of government.'' It is a noble goal. It is a noble goal. We would agree with that. It is just important that when one says that that is your goal and that is your purpose that, in fact, you comply with that. 
   The Washington Post on December 17, 2006, said Speaker Pelosi is determined to try to return the House to what it was in an earlier era ``where you debated ideas and listened to each other's arguments.'' Where you debated ideas and listened to each other's arguments. That is important as we go through the process of what is of concern to many of us here in the House of Representatives about how the process is already being implemented. 
   This is a quote from July of 2005 from Representative RAHM EMANUEL, now the chairman of the Democrat Caucus, and he voiced some frustration about the inability to have either an amendment or a vote on the floor. He said, ``Let us have an up and down vote. Don't be scared. Don't hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it on the table and let us have a vote. So don't hide behind the rule. If this is what you want to do, let us have an up and down vote.'' 
   It is important to remember that the purpose of that was to say that every Member of the House of Representatives ought to have the opportunity to in fact offer amendments and have their opportunity for people to say, yes, I agree with you and your amendment or your bill, or, no, I don't. 
   Here is a quote from Representative STENY HOYER, now the majority leader, in October of 2005. The one that I would like to highlight here is a quote where he said these provisions are an outrage, talking about the rules that were in place: ``These provisions are an outrage and this process is an outrage. As one Member of this body complained, once again the vast majority of Americans are having their representatives in Congress gagged by the closed rule committee.''     
   Now, we will talk a fair amount this evening about what a closed rule is and why Representative Hoyer in October 2005 would have made that comment, saying that the representatives were being in effect disenfranchised in the House of Representatives.  
   This quote comes from our now Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, who, in a letter to then-Speaker DENNY HASTERT in October of 2006 said, and this is an important quote, because this is one of those promises that were made prior to the election and that I believe affected individuals all across this Nation and what they were going to do when they went to the polls in November. 
   This, again, is from now-Speaker Pelosi to then-Speaker HASTERT. And what this says is, ``More than two years ago, I first sent you Democratic proposals to restore civility to the Congress. I reiterate my support for these proposals today. We must restore bipartisanship to the administration of the House, reestablish regular order for considering legislation,'' and we will talk about what that means, ``and ensure the rights of the minority, whichever party is in the minority.'' Restore the rights of the minority, whichever party is in the minority. ``The voice of every American has a right to be heard.'' 
   We would certainly concur with that. And, again, we will point out some of the concerns and disappointments that many of us have about the process that we have already seen in place today. 
   This quote here, Mr. Speaker, is from a Washington Post article of January 2, 2007, 2 days ago. And it says, ``As they prepare to take control of Congress this week and face up to the campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness, Democrats are planning to largely sideline Republicans from the first burst of lawmaking. Instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations as promised after the Democrats victory in the November 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures.'' 
   And so we think it is important for people to be held accountable for what they say and what they do. We also think it is important, Mr. Speaker, as a matter of principle for people to do what they say they are going to do, especially elected officials. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I place into the RECORD an article which appeared in The Washington Post on January 2 that included this quote, in addition to that an editorial which appeared in the Washington Post yesterday entitled, ``A Fairer House, But Not Quite Yet.''  
   Democrats To Start Without GOP Input: Quick Passage of First Bills Sought  
   As they prepare to take control of Congress this week and face up to campaign pledges to restore bipartisanship and openness, Democrats are planning to largely sideline Republicans from the first burst of lawmaking. 
   House Democrats intend to pass a raft of popular measures as part of their well-publicized plan for the first 100 hours. They include tightening ethics rules for lawmakers, raising the minimum wage, allowing more research on stem cells and cutting interest rates on student loans. 
   But instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories. 
   Nancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders. A few Democrats, worried that the party would be criticized for reneging on an important pledge, argued unsuccessfully that they should grant the Republicans greater latitude when the Congress convenes on Thursday. 
   The episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power. The Democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after 12 years in the minority, while honoring their pledge to make the 110th Congress a civil era in which Democrats and Republicans work together to solve the nation's problems. Yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning reelection and expanding their majority, the Democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics Republicans used the past several years. 
   Democratic leaders say they are torn between giving Republicans a say in legislation and shutting them out to prevent them from derailing Democratic bills. 
   ``There is a going to be a tension there,'' said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``My sense is there's going to be a testing period to gauge to what extent the Republicans want to join us in a constructive effort or whether they intend to be disruptive. It's going to be a work in progress.'' 
   House Republicans have begun to complain that Democrats are backing away from their promise to work cooperatively. They are working on their own strategy for the first 100 hours, and part of it is built on the idea that they might be able to break the Democrats' slender majority by wooing away some conservative Democrats. 
   Democrats intend to introduce their first bills within hours of taking the oath of office on Thursday. The first legislation will focus on the behavior of lawmakers, banning travel on corporate jets and gifts from lobbyists and requiring lawmakers to attach their names to special spending directives and to certify that such earmarks would not financially benefit the lawmaker or the lawmaker's spouse. That bill is aimed at bringing legislative transparency that Democrats said was lacking under Republican rule. 
   Democratic leaders said they are not going to allow Republican input into the ethics package and other early legislation, because several of the bills have already been debated and dissected, including the proposal to raise the minimum wage, which passed the House Appropriations Committee in the 109th Congress, said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Pelosi. 
   ``We've talked about these things for more than a year,'' he said. ``The members and the public know what we're voting on. So in the first 100 hours, we're going to pass these bills.'' 
   But because the details of the Democratic proposals have not been released, some language could be new. Daly said Democrats are still committed to sharing power with the minority down the line. ``The test is not the first 100 hours,'' he said. ``The test is the first 6 months or the first year. We will do what we promised to do.'' 
   For clues about how the Democrats will operate, the spotlight is on the House, where the new 16-seat majority will hold absolute power over the way the chamber operates. Most of the early legislative action is expected to stem from the House. 
   ``It's in the nature of the House of Representatives for the majority party to be dominant and control the agenda and limit as much as possible the influence of the minority,'' said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University. ``It's almost counter to the essence of the place for the majority and minority to share responsibility for legislation.'' 
   In the Senate, by contrast, the Democrats will have less control over business because of their razor-thin 51-to-49-seat margin and because individual senators wield substantial power. Senate Democrats will allow Republicans to make amendments to all their initiatives, starting with the first measure--ethics and lobbying reform, said Jim Manley, spokesman for the incoming majority leader, Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). 
   Those same Democrats, who campaigned on a pledge of more openness in government, will kick off the new Congress with a closed meeting of all senators in the Capitol. Manley said the point of the meeting is to figure out ways both parties can work together. 
   In the House, Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who will chair the Rules Committee, said she intends to bring openness to a committee that used to meet in the middle of the night. In the new Congress, the panel--which sets the terms of debate on the House floor--will convene at 10 a.m. before a roomful of reporters. 
   ``It's going to be open,'' Slaughter said of the process. ``Everybody will have an opportunity to participate.'' 
   At the same time, she added, the majority would grant Republicans every possible chance to alter legislation once it reaches the floor. ``We intend to allow some of their amendments, not all of them,'' Slaughter said. 
   For several reasons, House Democrats are assiduously trying to avoid some of the heavy-handed tactics they resented under GOP rule. They say they want to prove to voters they are setting a new tone on Capitol Hill. But they are also convinced that Republicans lost the midterms in part because they were perceived as arrogant and divisive. 
   ``We're going to make an impression one way or the other,'' said one Democratic leadership aide. ``If it's not positive, we'll be out in 2 years.'' 
   House Republicans say their strategy will be to offer alternative bills that would be attractive to the conservative ``Blue Dog'' Democrats, with an eye toward fracturing the Democratic coalition. They hope to force some tough votes for Democrats from conservative districts who will soon begin campaigning for 2008 reelection and will have to defend their records. 
   ``We'll capitalize on every opportunity we have,'' said one GOP leadership aide, adding that Republicans were preparing alternatives to the Democrats' plans to raise the minimum wage, reduce the interest on student loans, and reduce the profits of big oil and energy companies. 
   Several Blue Dog Democrats said they do not think Republicans can pick up much support from their group. 
   ``If they've got ideas that will make our legislation better, we ought to consider that,'' said Rep. Allen Boyd Jr. (D-Fla.), leader of the Blue Dogs. ``But if their idea is to try to split a group off to gain power, that's what they've been doing for the past 6 years, and it's all wrong.'' 
   To keep her sometimes-fractious coalition together, Pelosi has been distributing the  spoils of victory across the ideological spectrum, trying to make sure that no group within the Democratic Party feels alienated. 
   Blue Dogs picked up some plum committee assignments, with Jim Matheson (Utah) landing a spot on Energy and Commerce and A.B. ``Ben'' Chandler (Ky.) getting an Appropriations seat. At the same time, members of Black and Hispanic caucuses obtained spots on these panels, as Ciro Rodriguez (Tex.) was given a seat on Appropriations and Artur Davis (Ala.) took the place of Democrat William J. Jefferson (La.) on Ways and Means. 
   Democrats acknowledge that if they appear too extreme in blocking the opposing party, their party is sure to come under fire from the Republicans, who are already charging they are being left out of the legislative process. 
   ``If you're talking about 100 hours, you're talking about no obstruction whatsoever, no amendments offered other than those approved by the majority,'' said Rutgers's Baker. ``I would like to think after 100 hours are over, the Democrats will adhere to their promise to make the system a little more equitable. But experience tells me it's really going to be casting against type.'' 
   ``The temptations to rule the roost with an iron hand are very, very strong,'' he added. ``It would take a majority party of uncommon sensitivity and a firm sense of its own agenda to open up the process in any significant degree to minority. But hope springs eternal.''

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate those comments so much, because they really bring into focus and clarity exactly what happened today. 
   As I mentioned before, the purpose of this is not to say to folks, well, it was better when we were in the majority. The purpose is to say the promises that were made to the American people and decisions that the American people made upon those promises are not being followed. They are not being followed. And when they are not being followed, what that means when it comes to rules, it means that the individuals who represent those 140 million people are not allowed a voice, which means in essence that those 140 million people have no voice in the House of Representatives as it relates to the rules that have been put in place. 
   I also think it is important to talk about the fact that it never happened before. There is kind of this general sense by some that this is just business as usual. Well, it is not business as usual. And one of my colleagues who knows better than most, who understands and appreciates that, is my good friend from Georgia, fellow colleague from Georgia, Congressman Gingrey, who is a former member of the Rules Committee, who I think has a wonderful perspective on the rule that will enact bills in place on this floor of the House without any review by committee, any review by anybody other than potentially, I guess the Speaker, and that may be it. 
   So, I am so pleased that you joined us this evening to talk about what is a closed rule within a closed rule and to talk about the bills and the consequences of that for the American people. I welcome my good friend, Congressman Gingrey.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate those comments, and I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey). 
   I think it is appropriate now to ask my good friend, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), to make some comments about civility. Congresswoman Foxx is a dear friend and has had great concern about the level of discourse in this House of Representatives, has participated actively in the Official Truth Squad. I know you had some comments that you wanted to make about the level of civility and the importance of that in this House.

   I am so pleased to be joined by another good friend and colleague from Tennessee, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who has participated actively in the Official Truth Squad. I guess I share the gentlewoman from North Carolina's lament in having to be here on the first day because there is some straightening out in terms of bringing truth to the issue that has occurred even on this first day. We welcome you and look forward to your comments as they relate to the issues that have already occurred in this 110th Congress.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I wanted to highlight the new rule for the Rules Committee, which says that votes don't have to be recorded, and I appreciate so much your bringing that up because nobody at home, none of my constituents, believe that any Member of Congress ought to be able to come here and vote and not have their constituents be able to look and see what they have done. 
   And, in fact, part of this rules package that I think breaks a number of promises that were made by our friends in the majority as they ran up to the election, part of this package says that those votes don't have to be recorded. And I would be happy to yield to you, but for the life of me, I can't think of a reason that one would want to do that.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman and I thank my good friend from Georgia for his answer to my rhetorical question, because the answer was the only thing that can be possible as a reason to do it is 
   politics. That is it. That is the only thing that can be possible. There can be no good reason, from a process standpoint, for this House of Representatives not to record those votes. So I appreciate so much your enlightening me and helping me understand why that would have been done. 
   I do know that constituents at home are tired, are tired of decisions that are made up here in Washington based solely on politics. And, in fact, I would suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle who now find themselves in the majority that decisions like that and being held accountable for those decisions make it so that lives in majorities can sometimes be very, very short. 
   So I appreciate your comments and appreciate your input and would be happy to yield if either of you had anything else to comment regarding the rules. 
   If not, I do want to comment a little bit about the process and about why discussion of the process is important. My good friends know and most Americans know we live in the longest surviving democracy ever in the history of man, ever in the history of man. And there is a reason for that. I think people can conjecture about why that is the case, but I think one of the reasons for that is that we as a Nation have respected the process by which we develop policy. And the reason it is important is because everybody that is an elected official, is a representative of the people, has an opportunity to have input into the process, and that process itself not only produces the best product because as you have more people involved who represent more diverse areas, I think you get a better product, but what it does do is it ensures that people trust the outcome. 
   They trust the outcome of not just elections, but they trust the outcome of the process of legislation. And when that process gets truncated or gets cut down or is closed, we use that term ``closed rule'' here, when the American people hear about a closed rule, what that means is that it does not allow your representative at home to be able to offer amendments, be able to have input into what the ultimate work product is, what the ultimate bill, what the ultimate law is. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, many individuals across this Nation who went to the polls and voted in November have elected people who because of changes in these rules today will not be able to have input into very, very important issues like 9/11 Commission recommendations and whether or not they are adopted; like stem cell research and whether that goes forward paid for with Federal taxpayer money; minimum wage, an important issue, but it ought to be debated, ought to have opportunity for amendment; and then something that is near and dear to my heart as a physician in my former life along with Dr. Gingrey and my other colleagues is the issue of prescription drugs and the Medicare part D prescription drug program. An extremely complex issue. Extremely complex issue. 
   And today, what the majority party did was say that we will bring within the next week to the floor of this House a bill that has never been discussed in committee. It has never had a hearing. It has never had anybody in this body be able to offer an amendment officially and have folks vote on it and say ``yes'' or ``no,'' they believe that that is the case, that has never been through that process that results in the best work product that is available for a bill and for ultimately a law. And from the rumors that we hear, and we only hear rumors because we don't have the legislative language, because we do not know what is going to be in that bill, but from the rumors that we hear, the result of that bill will be a decrease in the kinds of medications that are available to the American people. 
   That may go into effect, Mr. Speaker, if the majority party goes forward with the rule that they adopted today. That may go into effect without anybody in this House of Representatives ever having an opportunity to affect that outcome.     
   Some on the majority side would say, well, it has been talked about for a long time. It was voted on, the Medicare prescription drug program was voted on in 2003, got a lot of hearings then. There were a lot of people that talked about it and voiced their opinion on it at that time. 
   That is true, Mr. Speaker, but what hasn't happened is that every single freshman Member of this House was duly elected in their districts and has a right, a right, under our system of government to have input into a bill that comes out of the House of Representatives. Every single freshman will have no input into that bill or into the bill as it relates to minimum wage, as it relates to stem cell research or anything else that was included in the rules package today. Never. 
   That has never been done, as my colleagues said before, never been done in the history, in the history of this Nation, to have that kind of substantive legislation dealt with in a way that does not allow that kind of input. 
   Mr. Speaker, that kind of rule, that kind of process, which is difficult to get your arms around, but that kind of process, I would suggest to you, is an abuse of majority power. Our job, on the minority side, is to hold people accountable for their actions and for their decisions. 
   It is important that the American people understand and appreciate that these decisions that were made on the very first day, which, by and large, are procedural issues, that are difficult to get folks interested in, but they not only set the tone for this Congress, but they set the rules under which we make major decisions that will affect the American people as it relates to their income, as it relates to their security, and as it relates to their health. Nothing, nothing could be more important. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a historic day. But it is also a day of concern. It is a day of concern, because what goes on here is extremely important. Within these walls we can effect change that will benefit citizens all across our Nation. We can also effect change that will harm citizens all across our Nation. If we work together, we will do much more of the former and very little of the latter. 
   Let me close by just saying, Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, the challenges that we face in this Nation are huge. They are immense. But they are not Republican challenges, and they are not Democrat challenges. They are American challenges. 
   If we work together as a body of elected representatives from all across this wonderful and glorious Nation, we will come up with the best product, the best legislation, the best laws that will result in the most amount of benefit to our citizens all across this Nation. So I challenge, I challenge my Democrat colleagues to fulfill the promises that they made on the election, during the election campaign, to fulfill the promises that they made, to fulfill the promises that they made when they talked to citizens in their districts all across this Nation about openness and about civility and about fiscal responsibility. That challenge, that challenge making certain that you fulfill those promises is what will ring true to the American people. 
   I appreciate once again, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity to come to the floor tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (POPCORN WORKERS LUNG DISEASE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from South Carolina for his leadership on this, as well as so many other issues. 
   Mr. Chairman, I represent the Sixth District of Georgia, one that is interested actively in the input of Members of Congress and the actions of government. But they have some suspicion about the actions of government. 
   When I came to Congress, I was told a story by a former Member who told an amusing story about his sense that when Members of Congress get on the airplane and they head toward Washington to come to work, they think they are pretty smart folks. As they get closer to Washington, they think that their intelligence increases. As they begin to descend and come into Reagan National Airport, they really think they are getting mighty smart. And then once they step off the plane, they think they are the brightest people on the Earth.  
   I tell that because folks listening to this might be surprised that there actually is a process in place for rulemaking within OSHA. There is a process in place that maximizes workplace safety while it sets standards based upon the strongest and the most complete scientific information. 
   Now, today, the House of Representatives is considering a bill which bypasses this process, bypasses the process and sets a permissible exposure limit for diacetyl, making Members of Congress the ones who are the experts on scientific evidence. 
   As my friend mentioned, before I came to Congress, I was a physician. One of the things that concerned me greatly was that Members of Congress, many Members of Congress think that they know best about so many issues. One of them was how to practice medicine. In this instance, it's what the level of appropriate exposure for a worker in this Nation ought be for diacetyl. 
   Diacetyl is an artificial flavoring commonly used for popcorn. It has been determined to be safe for general consumption, but the inhalation, the breathing in of large quantities may be harmful, although there is not any evidence that demonstrates that it can be solely harmful to an individual, which is what this bill actually assumes or presumes. 
   You have heard talk about the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH. NIOSH is the group that studies these kinds of things. In fact, they produced a study that concluded, ``There is insufficient data that exists on which to base workplace exposure standards or recommended exposure limits for butter flavorings.'' 
   Those are the folks that are the scientists that are involved in setting standards. We ought to listen to their recommendation. I commend the author and I commend the individuals who want to push the process forward more rapidly. I think that's an appropriate thing to do. But by adopting this bill, Congress is effectively saying to OSHA that your rulemaking process doesn't make any difference, that we don't need to hear the folks who have the greatest amount of knowledge about an issue, and that Congress is about to set standards based upon incomplete scientific evidence. 
   Now that may not be of great concern to some, but it ought to be. It ought to be. Regulations of this nature should only be based on the most sound and thorough scientific data. Otherwise, Congress is coming back every 6 months, every year, every 2 years and revising what they have put in place because they haven't based their decisionmaking on appropriate scientific information. 
   If this legislation is to go forward, then I would encourage my colleagues to allow it to do so with the adoption of the Wilson amendment. This amendment would ensure that a final safety standard for diacetyl is in fact based on adequate scientific and complete review by NIOSH. The Wilson amendment will guarantee that the most effective worker protections are put in place with the backing of science rather than identifying one compound without complete information. 
   If the goal here is workplace safety, if the goal is workplace safety, then we ought to make certain that that safety, those guidelines, those regulations are put in place and done correctly. Members of Congress should have a critical eye on the OSHA rulemaking process, without a doubt. But it's important that we not implement mandates based upon incomplete scientific evidence and without all of the facts. 
   So, for those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I once again thank my colleague for his assistance and leadership in this area. I would urge adoption of the Wilson amendment, and if that does not occur, then I would urge defeat of the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the ranking member and appreciate his indulgence. 
   I strongly oppose the underlying bill, as I believe it to be unconstitutional.  
   The House of Representatives stands on the verge of voting on a flatly unconstitutional, historically egregious bill, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. This bill would grant the District of Columbia a full voting seat in the House of Representatives by circumventing the Constitution. While I agree that it is an injustice that any United States citizens not have voting representation in Congress, the contorted logic some have used to justify this bill is quite troubling. 
   In supporting this proposal, Kenneth Starr wrote, ``There is nothing in our Constitution's history or its fundamental principles suggesting that the Framers intended to deny the precious right to vote to those who live in the capital of the great democracy they founded.'' While this may be true, the fact remains that the Constitution exclusively affords House representation to the states. Just because the District of Columbia was denied a seat in the People's House does not mean that Congress can ignore the Constitution. 
   Advocates of the DC Voting bill are discounting as unpersuasive the ``plain language'' of Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, which states, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several states.'' As if that weren't enough, the next sentence declares, ``No Person shall be a Representative who shall not ..... when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' 
   It is indisputable that House representation is constitutionally limited to the states. In fact, the Bush administration recently declared the bill unconstitutional, citing 12 provisions in the Constitution that expressly link congressional representation to statehood. Certainly, no one is claiming that the District of Columbia is one of the 50 states. 
   Sadly, constitutionality is not a concern of proponents of this legislation. The central argument from supporters of this bill is fairness. They argue that Members of Congress have a moral responsibility to right this wrong by any means. The Founding Fathers would be aghast at this brazen disregard for the Constitution in pursuit of a quick fix. 
   Supporters of this feel-good legislation frequently cite the ``District Clause'' of the Constitution as justification, which reads, ``Congress shall have power ..... to exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District.'' It is correct that Congress has the power to govern the District of Columbia, but this does not mean that the residents of the District of Columbia have the right to a seat in Congress, giving them the power to legislate over the 50 states. 
   The District Clause is found in section 8 of article I, the same section that gives Congress the power to ``establish Post Offices'' and to ``make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces.'' Surely no one would propose granting Fort Gordon a seat in the House, but the promotion of this would follow the same logic. 
   To be clear: I support representation for the residents of the District of Columbia but not under this bill's approach. It is truly unjust that these tax-paying citizens are denied the right to have their voice heard in the people's House. But Congress cannot create voting rights for D.C. residents by simply ignoring or contorting the Constitution because it is our will. There are two proper, constitutionally just courses of action to remedy this unfairness. 
   First, the Founders gave Congress and the people the authority to amend the Constitution. This course would provide for a 51st state of the District of Columbia. But as the constitutional amendment process can be protracted and complicated, I support the second course--retroceding the non-federal portion of Washington, D.C., to the State of Maryland. Following this plan, most of the residents would have full representation in the House and Senate, as residents of Maryland. This is a commonsense proposal with historic precedent. In 1846, the land west of the Potomac was ceded back to the Commonwealth of Virginia, and these people now enjoy full congressional representation. 
   There is a great responsibility in supporting the republican form of government that our Founders created. And where injustices lie in the Constitution, Congress is right to try to correct them. But the greatest respect is owed to our Founders and our Nation as the longest surviving democracy in history. There is a reason for that and it has much to do with respecting the genius of our founding document. We must not ignore the principles of the constitutional republic our Founders laid out. 
   It is fundamentally antithetical to pursue representative fairness while disregarding the Constitution. I am hopeful that supporters of this bill will see the great fault in their logic, and resolve the injustice of the residents of the District of Columbia not having a voting representative in Congress properly within the bounds of the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that recognition. I want to thank the leadership on the Republican side for the opportunity to address once again the House of Representatives and talk about some important issues that our Nation is dealing with, and bring the latest version of the Official Truth Squad. This is a group of folks who have determined to try to bring some sunlight and some truth to the issues that we talk about here in Washington. And after the last hour, Mr. Speaker, a lot of truth needs to be shed, because the amount of misinformation and disinformation that our friends on the other side of the aisle have put forward needs to be corrected, and so we are here as the Official Truth Squad to do just that. It is a great privilege, and I want to thank the Republican Conference, the Republican leadership for that opportunity. 
   The Official Truth Squad started as a group of freshmen last term who were frustrated by, as I said, the disinformation and the misinformation that was perpetrated and brought forward on this House floor day after day after day after day, and we thought that it was appropriate to get together and attempt to bring some light to issues, attempt to bring some facts to issues. And we have a favorite quote. 
   We have a lot of favorite quotes, but one of our favorite quotes is indeed one of my favorite quotes that I think crystallizes exactly what the mission is here. And in Washington it is so difficult to try to get to the second clause of this sentence. But this is from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Senator Moynihan, a former United States Senator from the State of New York and a former United States representative of the United Nations, a wonderful gentleman, a very wise individual. And he said, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.'' Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. 
   So it is in that spirit, Mr. Speaker, that we come to the floor tonight and talk about a number of issues, and try to shed some of that light, try to bring some facts to the table. 
   We get visited oftentimes here in Washington by folks who are constituents, folks from back home. They come here and they visit us, and they talk about the kinds of issues that are important to them. And today, Mr. Speaker, and yesterday in Washington we have been visited, all of us have been visited, I know, by members of the VFW, by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. And it is very humbling to sit and to talk with members of the VFW, to listen to their stories, to hear their concerns, to appreciate the challenges that they have and the issues that they believe Congress ought to be addressing. 
   These are truly heroes. They are truly heroes from previous conflicts that our Nation has been involved in. And it is distressing when you talk to these members of the VFW and you hear their same kinds of concerns about facts. 
   Many of them from my district came, and they wanted to know why there was not the kind of correct information that was getting out on the floor of the House of Representatives, why we weren't talking about the truth as it relates to, not just our veterans, but the current situation in the world. They were extremely concerned that so many of our friends on the other side of the aisle were distorting the truth, were not bringing real information to the American people, and were causing great challenges for all of us to try to do the right thing as it relates to our Nation and to our members of the military right now who are defending liberty around the globe, and to assist veterans in their time of need. And so I shared my concern with them about the information that was being brought forth, especially about the situation in Iraq. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, we have heard what the strategy of the Democrats is as it relates to Iraq. They have preemptively surrendered. One of their Members has defined what has been described as a slow-bleed policy. It kind of gives you chills when you think about it, Mr. Speaker, a slow-bleed policy. That individual was interviewed 2 or 3 weeks ago, and during that period of time when asked how is he going to institute this, how is he going to institute this slow-bleed policy on the military as a Member of the House of Representatives, an influential Member of the House, a member of the majority party, a member who has an opportunity to do great things, and what he has said is, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is chilling. That is chilling. 
   It is made all the more disgusting because of the comments of our own Speaker who said that funds would never be cut off from our troops in harm's way. And here the individual who is charged with developing the strategy for the majority party in the House of Representatives on Iraq says, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know about you, but I get e-mails and communications sent to me from constituents who are serving in Iraq. I know men and women  who are serving in Iraq who are doing their duty. To have a Member of the House of Representatives in a remarkably influential role say he is going to do all he can to limit the equipment that will protect our men and women in harm's way in Iraq and around the world is deplorable. It is deplorable. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is a fact. Not an opinion, not my opinion. That is a fact. That is what he said. That is what he plans on doing. That is what he said he will work to convince his party to do. 
   About that same time, our Speaker was quoted as making the following claim, ``Democrats have proposed a different course of action over and over again, and we have suggested a different plan.'' That is the claim. That is the facts of the statement. 
   The truth, according to United States Senator Joe Lieberman who has been a stalwart in recognizing the danger that the world finds itself in and recognizing the importance of supporting our troops who are in harm's way, the truth, as he states it, is, ``Any alternatives that I have heard ultimately don't work. They are all about failing. They are all about withdrawing. And I think allowing Iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the Iraqis, for the Middle East, and for us.''     
   Mr. Speaker, I find the double talk that is coming out of the majority party's mouth at this time as it relates to protecting our troops and fighting for freedom and liberty to be not only disingenuous, I find it to be a disservice to the American people, because when we are not talking about facts, it is impossible to reach the right conclusion. 
   All of us come to this body with various experiences, different backgrounds, different professions, different work experience. Mine is as a physician. I spent over 20 years, nearly 25 years practicing medicine. And I knew that when I took care of patients, that if I didn't do my level best to make certain that I had made the right diagnosis, that I had dealt with truthful items to get to the right diagnosis, I couldn't institute the right treatment. 
   And so I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues that unless we recognize truthful statements, unless we recognize the facts that are presented to us, that we will not make the right diagnosis. And I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that the other side, the majority party has failed to make the correct diagnosis, so it will be difficult for them to institute the right treatment. 
   Now, I won't go so far as to say, although I might be legitimate in doing so, that occasionally, when physicians make the wrong diagnosis, they are charged with malpractice. But I would ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to appreciate and recognize that truth will get you to the right diagnosis, which will allow all of us to work together to identify what the right treatment ought to be. 
   And that is in the case with this reprehensible, ``slow bleed'' policy that has been put forward by the majority party, as much it is with the rest of the policies that we will address, some of which we will address tonight. 
   I want to just highlight a couple other matters as it relates to this ``slow bleed'' policy. And Mr. Speaker, as you know what that has been defined as is cutting off the funding or decreasing the funding, not for the troops specifically but for the equipment, for the logistics, for the support staff that is required, all of the things that make it so our men and women can be secure in the knowledge that they are able to have all the equipment and the personnel available to protect themselves and to carry out their mission. 
   So, once again, the quote from our Speaker, another quote from our Speaker about, almost now 2 months ago, from January 19, 2007. The quote was, ``Democrats will never cut off funding for our troops when they are in harm's way.'' 
   The reality is, and it goes into a broken promise that I believe, we believe, the other side is getting very adept at. They are continuing to break promises that they make with the American people over and over again. This one, the promise was, we will never cut off funding for the troops. 
   The reality, according to Mr. John Conyers, Representative John Conyers, ``The founders of our country gave our Congress the power of the purse because they envisioned a scenario exactly like we find ourselves in today. Not only is it in our power, it is our obligation. It is our obligation to stop President Bush.'' 
   Another quote from Representative Maxine Waters, Representative from California, made just a couple of weeks ago, ``I will not vote for one dime. I will not vote for one dime.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we see the promises that are being made, that are being talked about to the American people, but the truth of the matter is that the majority party is continuing to break promises, and I find that very distressing. I also find that of great concern to being able, once again, to reach the right diagnosis of the challenges that we have before us and then moving forward with the correct treatment. 
   I want to talk for a little bit, now, Mr. Speaker, about another item that has, another issue that has not had a whole lot of light from the other side of the aisle on it, and that is our economy and the remarkable economic growth that this Nation has seen over the last three to 4 years. 
   If you look at truth, and you look at facts, one would have to admit that this has been a remarkably robust economy. We have now seen nearly 3 1/2 years of solid, consistent economic expansion which followed the downturn, the economic downturn and the recession of 2001. 
   The measure of economic expansion can be measured by all sorts of different parameters, and we are going to look at a couple of them this evening. Measure of economic expansion can be measured by real GDP growth, gross domestic product growth. And that has averaged a robust 3.6 percent since the enactment of what, Mr. Speaker? Tax reductions in 2003. The tax relief measures of 2003 have resulted in, I believe, we believe, a remarkably robust economy. 
   And so as we move through these facts tonight, as we move through these measures, it is important to appreciate, well, how did that all come about? Why did that happen? It didn't just happen willy nilly. And so what we have seen over the last 3 1/2 years is a remarkably robust growth in the gross domestic product; 3.6 percent, as I mentioned, over that period of time. Mr. Speaker, that is faster than the averages of the 1970, which was 3.4 percent, the 1980s, which was 3.1 percent, and I know this will come as a shock to some folks, Mr. Speaker, but those glory days of the 1990s, when we all thought that the economy was booming as rapidly as it could and as good as it could; in fact, that growth during the 1990s was 3.3 percent, again, compared to 3.6 percent since the tax reductions, appropriate tax reductions in 2003. 
   What we have on this chart, Mr. Speaker, is the unemployment rate, and it is another kind of gauge of how the economy is doing. How many jobs is our economy creating? And that is the good news, Mr. Speaker, that since June of 2003, 7.4 million new jobs; 7.4 million new jobs, Mr. Speaker, which is a remarkable number, an average of 169,000 new jobs each and every month. 
   Now, you would say, well, that had just been going on just like that before the reductions in the tax rates in 2003. But this poster, Mr. Speaker, speaks to that. What this poster shows is the level of unemployment, the percent level of unemployment in our Nation and plots it over a period of time. 
   Here on the far left portion of the graph, we have 2001, and on the far right portion, we have 2007. So over the past 7 years, 6 to 7 years, what we see is this red line that demonstrates the level of unemployment. And we see it climbing from a rate of mid 4 percent until 2003, at this point where it reached its apex, its highest amount of about 6.3 percent. And at that point, something happened. 
   Something happened, Mr. Speaker. And what happened was that this administration recognized and this Congress recognized that the economy needed stimulating, needed some encouragement, needed some investment. And our good friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes say, well, when the economy needs more money what we need to do is to get more taxes from the American people. We need to take more money from them so that government has 
   the amount of money that it needs to be able to do whatever they would like to do with revenue that comes into the Federal Government.  
   But what we understand, and what fiscal conservatives understand and what true historians understand is that, when you cut taxes, when you decrease taxes on the American people, revenue goes up, the economy booms, and jobs are created. And that is what happened in 2003, Mr. Speaker. And you see, since then, a steady decline in the unemployment rate. Why? Because the American people had more money in their back pocket, because American people know best how to spend their money, not government. It is not the government's money. It is the American people's money. And when they have that money and can make those decisions, those personal financial decisions, then our Nation is helped in ways that are incalculable. Incalculable. And what happens is that the economy grows, the economy booms, and more jobs are created. 
   What about household net worth? We have heard, well, it is not getting down to real people. It is not getting down to those who own homes. In fact, Mr. Speaker, there are more individuals, more people, more percent and more numbers of Americans owning homes now than ever before in the history of our Nation. Mr. Speaker, that is a good thing. That is a good thing. 
   I know there is a lot of doom and gloom out there, and a lot of people in this town don't want the American people to know that there are some good things that are happening in our Nation. I, frankly, get tired of all the naysayers. I know that people in my district do as well, because they know what is happening on the ground and what is happening out there across America is that more Americans own their home now than ever before in the history of our Nation. 
   And that is not just absolute numbers. That is a percent. Nearly 70 percent of the American people own their home. That is a record. That is a record, Mr. Speaker. 
   And when you look at household net worth, household net worth, the value of homes for the American people has reached an all-time historic high, and in the last year, it increased by 7 percent. We see the unemployment rate down to 4.6 percent in January of this year. 
   We talked about some averages for economic growth over the last couple of decades, comparing now, where we are right now, to where we have been over the last couple of decades. 
   What about unemployment? Well, the unemployment rate that we have right now, at 4.6 percent, is lower than the average for the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and yes, Mr. Speaker, the 1990s, too. Isn't that something? That is wonderful news. That is great news. And I would suggest to my colleagues in the House that it would be important to relay that news to your constituents. That is a good thing. 
   The average rate in the 1960s of unemployment was 4.8 percent. Right now, 4.6 percent. The average for the 1970s, difficult time, 6.2 percent. Right now, Mr. Speaker, 4.6 percent. The average through the 1970s, 7.3. Right now, Mr. Speaker, 4.6 percent. And you remember the 1990s? Again, that wonderful time, those halcyon days of the 1990s, when our economy was booming and everybody was doing just grand? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, the average unemployment rate in the 1990s was 5.8 percent. Today, 4.6 percent. Mr. Speaker, that is a fact. 
   And remember, Mr. Speaker, people are entitled, as Senator Moynihan used to say, they are entitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts. 
   And then we hear, well, there are jobs, yes, but they are not good jobs. They are not real jobs. They aren't jobs that have seen any real economic growth. Well, let's look at some facts there, too, Mr. Speaker. 
   Productivity growth, which is a fundamental driver of the potential long-term economic growth, what kind of productivity, what kind of output our economy is producing, grew at a rate of 2.1 percent in 2006. The average growth between 1993 and 2000, remember those halcyon days, Mr. Speaker, the average growth during that period of time in productivity was 1.8 percent.     
   The average growth now, productivity growth: 2.1 percent. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, these are good days from an economic standpoint. 
   And then wage growth, we hear from some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, well, they just aren't good jobs. Real wage growth isn't happening. But wage growth plus benefits growth, total compensation, which had lagged behind productivity growth earlier in this recovery, surged in the last year, in 2006. It was up 6.3 percent, 6.3 percent on an analyzed rate in the fourth quarter of 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is good news. That is good news. I would once again urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to convey that good news to their constituents. And then I would urge them to ask why is that happening, why have we seen this kind of good news. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, it is because of the appropriate tax reductions that this Congress, this administration passed on to the American people in 2003. 
   We have many folks who will say, well, when you cut taxes, what happens is that the government doesn't have enough money to be able to do what it needs to do. And that sounds plausible, I guess. But when you look at what really happens, when you look at what happens historically and you look at what has happened with this tax reduction in 2003, what we have seen is a significant increase in revenue coming into the Federal Government. And it ought not be a surprise, Mr. Speaker, because in the two major tax reductions that have occurred in this Nation over the last 45 years, the tax reductions of President Reagan's administration and, yes, Mr. Speaker, the tax reductions of President Kennedy's administration, both of those tax reductions saw a significant increase in the amount of revenue that comes into the Federal Government. And why is that? It seems kind of counterintuitive. Why is that? 
   Well, again, when you allow the American people to make decisions about their own money and not have the government making decisions about that money, they decide for themselves when to save or to spend or invest that money, and what that does is stimulate the economy in ways that the government never, never can stimulate. 
   And consequently what you see, Mr. Speaker, is this kind of graph: here we have the capital gains tax revenues. These are revenues from taxes on the gains that are seen across all types of investments. And what we have is the amount of money from that capital gains that came into the Federal Government in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 on the same track as heading for 2007. And the yellow line on the bottom here, Mr. Speaker, is the projection that the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, made prior to the tax reductions, appropriate tax reductions. So we see a gradual, steady increase in the amount of money coming into the Federal Government based upon capital gains tax revenue. The same graph would hold for dividend taxation revenue. 
   And what we see actually happened when the tax reductions were instituted is the blue line, and it tracked a little bit above it for the first year. But what we always see, when you keep tax reductions in place, is more economic development, more job growth, more gross domestic product growth, more revitalization of the economy; and so what happens is that annual revenues coming into the Federal Government actually increase, and they increase by a huge amount. Increase by a huge amount. 
   The tax relief has resulted in significant economic growth that has resulted in significantly higher tax revenue. After the declines from 2000 to 2003, revenue surged in 2004, 2005, and 2006. In 2005 the revenues grew by 14.6 percent. In 2006 they were up by 11.8 percent. 
   This next statement, Mr. Speaker, is important because it speaks to the permanence and the penetration of the result of these tax reductions and how they affect the economy and how they affect our Nation. Those two revenue increases, 14.6 percent in 2005 and 11.8 percent in 2006, that was the first time since the mid-1980s, and you will recall that that was the last time we had significant tax reductions, the first time since the mid-1980s that our Nation has generated double-digit revenue growth in consecutive years. Remarkable, Mr. Speaker. It really is.  
   And I would think that any individual charged with representing this Nation and charged with having some input into how to keep this economy moving and how to generate more growth in this economy would want to know why, why did that happen? What happened in 2003 to turn that around? 
   And it is still continuing. Revenues continue to surge in fiscal year 2007. Through the first 4 months of the year, revenues are up by 9.8 percent, with 12.6 percent for individual receipts and 22.1 percent for corporate receipts. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are incredible numbers, truly incredible numbers. So one would think that Members of the House of Representatives, Members of the Senate, who are charged with formulating national policy that by any estimation anybody would look at these numbers and say, yes, that kind of looks pretty good, maybe we ought to continue that. And if you are charged with developing policy, Federal policy, national policy that results in these kinds of good numbers, you would think that they would want to know why, how did that happen. 
   How did that happen? Well, there are some other charts that I would like to share with you that will demonstrate how that happened and the effect of it. 
   I think it is always helpful, Mr. Speaker, to compare what happened before the tax reductions and what has happened since because unless you can point to a date on the calendar when something concrete changed and identify the occurrences in this Nation from an economic standpoint before that date and after that date, it becomes difficult to answer that question why, why did these seemingly good things happen? 
   So this poster here demonstrates business investment before and after the tax relief of 2003. And this is remarkably telling. As you see, the middle line here is the percent of business investment, either increased investment or decreased investment. And you could say, Mr. Speaker, that through 2001 and 2002 and the first quarter of 2003, virtually all of those quarters had decreased business growth or investment. In fact, the average was a decrease of 5.6 percent. And that is a decrease from year to year to year. So, in fact, the cumulative amount of decreased investment is huge. 
   And then something happened here. Mr. Speaker, on this vertical line, something happened. And it answers the question why, why did we see these remarkable improvements? And it was the appropriate tax reductions of 2003. And these are undeniable numbers. This is the business investment after the tax reductions of 2003, and they have averaged since that time 7.29 percent every quarter. So you see it over and over and over and over again. In fact, we have had 15 straight quarters of economic business investment increase. And that is not because the business of America says it is not a good idea to invest, it is not a good idea to grow. That is because they say it is a great idea. And the policies that have been put in place at the Federal Government level will result in their opportunity to succeed, their opportunity for their employees to succeed, the opportunity for employees to then take that success from the company and from the employee and go buy homes and go buy cars and go buy all sorts of items that are needed by each and every American. And what happens then is that it just becomes a wonderfully self-perpetuating cycle. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the reason that it is important to look at this and the reason that I am talking about this tonight and that we on our side of the aisle are trying to bring truth and light to this issue is because there is a plan on the other side of the aisle to do away with the tax reductions that have resulted in all this wonderful, wonderful economic news. And that is just baffling to me when I think about again the challenge, the charge that each of us in this House has, which is to, I believe, develop policies that will work to the benefit of the vast majority and as many Americans as possible. 
   And these types of numbers here, these facts, Mr. Speaker, not opinions, but facts, demonstrate that that is exactly and precisely what the tax reductions have done from 2003. And they have done so by decreasing also the budget deficit. And, again, if the economy is booming to a greater degree, if it is more successful, more people working, more people investing, more people participating in the American Dream, that is a good thing. And what happens is that more revenue comes into the Federal Government, and what happens, Mr. Speaker, to the budget deficit? It decreases. It goes down. In fact, if we allow the tax reductions to remain in place, which is what we absolutely ought to do, and some of our friends on the other side of the aisle, some of our friends in the majority party have already said they don't believe any of those tax reductions ought to remain in place, that every American ought to have a tax increase, but if we allow them to stay in place, what this chart demonstrates, Mr. Speaker, is that the budget will balance of its own accord because of the policies already in place within a 4-year period of time. Within a 4-year period of time. 
   Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle, they will come up to the well of the House and they will say, sure we have got to balance the budget, but we have got to raise taxes to do it. 
   Mr. Speaker, it just isn't so. It just isn't so. So I would encourage all Members of the House to look at these numbers, to appreciate the trend that has occurred, the facts of the economic numbers that we have available to us in this Nation, and to appreciate that there is a reason, there is a reason that more people are working now. There is a reason that more people are owning their own home. There is a reason that more individuals are able to invest in this economy. There is a reason that there is more money coming into the Federal Government. And that reason is we are allowing more Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
   Oftentimes I hear in committee meetings many Members of Congress who will talk about the government's money as if it is the government's, as if it is ours in Congress, that we have ownership of this money and that we ought to be able to just spend it as we please without absolute priorities. 
   We heard our good friends earlier this evening talk about PAYGO, pay-as-you-go, making certain that new programs that come before the Congress, that any costs for those new programs will be offset by decreasing the expenditures for another program. But what they don't tell you, Mr. Speaker, is that in that small print of the rules that they have passed, it doesn't apply to the vast majority of the budget. It doesn't apply. And, in fact, what the Rules Committee upstairs does over and over and over again is to say we are going to bring this bill to the floor and we are going to adopt this program and we will adopt it and not require it to comply with the PAYGO rules that this House has supposedly adopted. 
   That is what happened in the very first 100 hours, Mr. Speaker, the vaunted 100 hours, that period of time when the new majority was taking this Nation in what they called a ``new direction.'' Well, they were. And the direction they were taking them was into the red, further into the red, by spending more money without any offsets. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think that is what the American people voted for in November of 2006. I just don't believe that. And when I go home, that is what people tell me at home. They don't believe that the Federal Government ought to be spending more money. They think that we ought to be decreasing the expenditures, not increasing them. 
   So the challenge from an economic standpoint is truly the size of the Federal budget and the lack of ability of this Congress, this new majority Congress, to prioritize where it wants to spend the hard-earned taxpayer money.     
   Again, Mr. Speaker, it is not the government's money. It is not the government's money. It is the American people's money, and they work hard, hard, for that money, and we ought to be very diligent about how we address spending their hardearned money. 
   I believe that we ought to allow them to keep a whole lot more of their hardearned money. I believe, if you look objectively at the facts of our economy right now, we are moving along pretty well. But there is caution on the horizon. 
   We are moving down a highway, and we are ticking along pretty well, our speed is pretty much at the speed limit, but the signs are flashing. They  are flashing, and they are saying, caution ahead, caution ahead, because, in our Federal budget, there is automatic spending that is occurring, and it is occurring primarily in three programs: Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, three wonderfully successful programs providing great comfort and assurance to the individuals who receive the benefits from those programs. 
   Each of those programs have been promises made to the American people, and those programs ought to continue for the individuals who are eligible for those programs currently in the manner in which they were instituted. But if we continue them in that manner for every American who reaches that wonderful age of 62 or 65 and becomes eligible for them, then this is what happens, Mr. Speaker. 
   This chart demonstrates the entitlement programs, and I don't like that word ``entitlement,'' I like the word ``automatic,'' because it is automatic spending. It just keeps on going. These programs have a formula built into them that generates increased money going into those programs year after year after year because there are more individuals who become eligible for them, because of the demographics of our society. But we are an aging society. There are more individuals who are becoming eligible for these programs, and consequently, it takes more money. 
   This poster demonstrates the percentage of the Federal budget that is generated in tax revenue, and this line here is the revenue of the Federal budget. So we average somewhere a little below 20 percent of the gross domestic product coming in as tax revenue. If we continue that right along, that is, if we don't raise taxes on the American people, which is what we are committed to doing, that is, not raising taxes, this is about the level of revenue that we will have as a nation. 
   Down below are the fiscal years starting with 2007, this year, and moving forward all the way to 2050. People say well, that is a long way away, and they are absolutely right. But if no changes are made in these three programs, Medicare being the blue, Medicaid being the yellow and Social Security being the green, this chart demonstrates that those three programs, those three automatic spending programs, will consume the entire Federal budget, the entire Federal budget by the year 2045 or 2046. 
   That seems like a long way away, Mr. Speaker, but do you know what? That is under 40 years from now. Under 40 years ago was the late sixties, and I remember the late sixties very well. Many of us will remember when the United States landed on the moon. That is about 40 years ago, 38 years ago. Many individuals, most individuals who were alive at the time will certainly remember when President Kennedy was assassinated. On the one hand, it seems a long time ago. On the other hand, it doesn't seem like very long at all. It doesn't seem like very long at all. So this is not a long way away. 
   What this is screaming at us, what this is shouting at us, what this is saying to us as we travel down that road and those caution lights are flashing, is that we as a United States Congress, in order to be wise and prudent and spend taxpayer money appropriately, these programs need to be reformed. We need to keep the solemn promise that we have with the American people who are in these programs currently, and we need to make certain that we move forward aggressively and actively with programs that will make it so these are financially sound programs. 
   Now, there are a couple ways you can go. There are a couple directions you can head when you reform programs like this. The real question that becomes asked when you reform these kinds of programs is this question, Mr. Speaker. It is the question that is really being shouted right now in Washington. That is the question, who decides? Who decides? 
   We all come to Washington as Members of Congress with different experiences, as I mentioned. We come to Washington with different political stripes. We come to Washington with different political philosophies. We come to Washington with various degrees of understanding or appreciation for our Nation's history and how we became great. 
   Right now, we are at a crossroads, Mr. Speaker. We are at a crossroads for our financial programs. We are at a crossroads for so many of our social programs. We are at a crossroads for, I believe, our Nation when it relates to freedom and liberty. And the question being asked is, who decides? 
   Are we going to, with our tax policy, allow the Federal Government to make more and more decisions as it relates to how to spend the hard earned taxpayers' money? Are we going to allow the Federal Government to be the ones that prioritize how the American pocketbook ought to be spent? Are we going to allow the Federal Government to increase its involvement in American lives? 
   Our friends in the majority party talk about new direction. Mr. Speaker, that is the new direction that I see. When they talk about it, bill after bill and policy after policy, if you look at each and every one, whatever the policy is, the question that they are answering is, who decides? 
   Their answer to that question, more often than not, Mr. Speaker, is that the Federal Government ought to be deciding, not the States, not the local communities and not the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I happen to believe firmly in the rectitude of decisions made by the American people. I believe strongly that decisions are best when left to the American people, about almost anything. I believe that the American people know best how to spend their hardearned money. 
   That is why I believe that it is incumbent upon all of us to ask those questions, why is the economy doing as well as it is right now, appreciating the truth in the facts that have been presented this evening that demonstrate that the reason that the economy is doing so well right now is because Americans have more of their hardearned money in their back pocket so that they can decide when they spend or they save or invest their money. What that results in is the ability and the opportunity for them to make those personal decisions; not the Federal Government. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, when you see people coming down to the floor of the House and they are asking questions about or asking their colleagues to support this program or that program or this policy or that policy, I would ask you to think about this question: Well, who is deciding? Who are they asking to make decisions in this bill? And more often than not, Mr. Speaker, I think you will appreciate that this new majority, the Democrat majority that is currently controlling this House of Representatives, is answering that question with the 
   Federal Government. The Federal Government is deciding. 
   I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, that I am a physician. In my previous life, I was a doctor. I practiced medicine outside of Atlanta for nearly 25 years. I have great concerns about the direction of health care in our Nation. 
   We are at one of those crossroads, and this is the question that this Congress will have to answer as it relates to health care: Who decides? Who is going to be allowed to make personal health care decisions? Is it going to be patients and doctors, is it going to be families and their children, along with the guidance of a medical professional, or is it going to be the Federal Government? Is it going to be individuals in buildings around this Capitol and around this Nation who may or may not have any medical training or any medical experience at all that will be making decisions, personal health care decisions, for people? 
   I don't think that is the direction in which we ought to go, Mr. Speaker, and I don't think that is what the American people believe we ought to do as it relates to health care, and I certainly don't believe that that is the new direction that the American people thought they were going to get when they went to the polls last November. 
   You say, well, what kind of program could that be? Well, Mr. Speaker, there are a number of proposals that have been put forward by members of the majority party, and not just freshman members, not just members who don't have any input, real input, into the nuts and bolts of health care policy that is coming forward. In fact, what we have are the chairs of the committees of jurisdiction, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee that has jurisdiction over health care  and the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee that has jurisdiction over health care in this Nation. 
   Those individuals, certainly the latter, has said that what he believes we ought to move toward in terms of health care in this Nation is what he describes as Medicare for all. Medicare for all. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here to tell you that all patients have to do around this Nation, all citizens have to do around this Nation, is the next time they talk to their doctor, ask their doctor, do you believe that our health care system would be better if it were to look like Medicare? Do you believe that my personal insurance would be better if it were like Medicare? Do you believe that allowing the Federal Government to make health care decisions like they do in Medicare for our entire Nation is the right way to go? 
   I don't believe that is the case, Mr. Speaker. I don't believe that is what the American people want, and I know, I know that when patients ask their doctors around this Nation, that is not what they will want. 
   Why? Why wouldn't we want Medicare for all? Let me give you an example or two, Mr. Speaker. 
   We had a huge debate a couple of years ago in this Nation about whether or not Medicare ought to cover prescription medication for Medicare recipients. That debate went on for a few years. It was a proposal by this administration, passed by this Congress in 2003, and we have seen that program instituted over the past 14 months, 15 months, and it is a relatively successful program. 
   But I don't want to talk about the merits of the program, because that is a different debate. I want to talk, Mr. Speaker, about a program that takes 40 years to decide that it needs to cover prescription medication for seniors in this Nation. That is Medicare. It is a government program that cannot, it is impossible for it to be responsive to people. It is impossible for it to incorporate the kind of new inventions and wonderful treatment options that are available to the American people in a private system. It is impossible for them to be able to incorporate those treatment changes to benefit patients. 
   Why is it impossible? Because it is a massive government bureaucracy, and a massive government bureaucracy cannot be by its very definition nimble and flexible and responsive to the American people. And that is the answer to this question, who decides? Who decides? 
   This new majority thinks that the Federal Government ought to be deciding personal health care decisions for people. I, and most of my colleagues on our side of the aisle, simply believe that ought not be the case; that patients and doctors, that families and children in consultation with their doctor, that those people ought to be the ones that are making those personal health care decisions. 
   So I urge my colleagues to ask as we go through the next number of months, as we go through the kind of policy suggestions and bills that will come to the floor, to ask this question. I know what my answer is. Who ought to decide in terms of the policies that we brought forward? I know what my answer is. I believe that the American people ought to be the ones deciding.     
   I believe that the American people ought to be the ones that have an opportunity to say, I think that my hard-earned money ought to be spent in this way. I ought to be allowed to decide when to spend or save or invest my money, not the Federal Government, not the Federal Government. As well intentioned as they are, and individuals who work in the Federal Government by and large are extremely well intentioned, they are encumbered by the very apparatus that is in place because of the size and massive nature of our Federal Government. It is impossible for them to be responsive to the American people. It is impossible for them to be as nimble as they ought to be, to be as flexible as they ought to be. 
   Health care is one example where science is exploding, and all sorts of wonderful opportunities are available for the treatment of disease. But should we in this House of Representatives be the ones deciding what kind of health care treatment ought to be given in a very particular instance? I would say no. Those decisions ought to be the decisions of people, individuals with their doctor and their family. 
   So I urge my colleagues as we look at the issues that come before us over the next number of months to ask this question: Who decides? Who ought to decide? I think if they answer honestly, they will come down on the side that I have come down on, and that is on the side of the American people. 
   I would encourage my colleagues when they go home this weekend when they talk to their constituents to ask their constituents, who do you think ought to decide how to spend your money? Should you, should the American people decide that, or should the Federal Government? Should the American people be able to decide what kind of health care treatment they ought to receive, or should the Federal Government? Should the American people be able to decide what kind of education system they want for their children, where they want their child educated, what kind of curriculum they want for their children in their community, or should that decision be made by the Federal Government? 
   Huge questions, Mr. Speaker. We are at a crossroads. We are at a crossroads in this Nation on so many areas. Our time right now is to govern responsibly. It is our time to make certain that we listen to our constituents. It is our time to do our due diligence to make certain that we appreciate how we became this wonderful and glorious and grand and great Nation. It is our responsibility in the United States Congress to listen to the truth, to appreciate how we got to where we are right now and to incorporate the structure that allowed us to become this great and wonderful and glorious Nation, to be the Nation that truly is the beacon to all who love freedom and love liberty around this world. How did we become that Nation, and to incorporate the reasons, the rationale and the policies that brought us to that point into the policies that we promote to move our Nation forward. 
   I am confident that if we do that, we will answer the question of who decides, with the American people being first and foremost. I am confident if we do that as a Congress, we will make the right conclusions. I am confident if we do that as Congress, we will make the right diagnosis for this Nation, and we will develop the right treatment plan as we go forward. 
   I want to thank once again the leadership for allowing me the opportunity to come and speak to the House this evening and bring some truth and light to some issues that are oftentimes very complex, but oftentimes very simple because we ask simple questions. We ask simple questions: Who should decide? Should it be the American people or the Federal Government? Mr. Speaker, I vote for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, right now, brave Americans are going door to door in some of the most dangerous parts of Iraq. They are working with the Iraqi people to bring stability to Iraq, and they are doing this because it is their duty and because they understand our enemy, what is at stake should we not succeed. 
   Right now, in households all across this country, there are families praying for the safe return of their loved ones. They understand the dangers. They know what is at stake. Unfortunately, in Washington, it would seem that too many politicians do not realize what is at stake, what the consequences are of failure. Instead, some propose we tell these soldiers and their families that Congress believes that the only choice is to close the door. They say retreat is our only option. Their desire is to adopt a policy of slow bleed, methodically squeezing off the necessary funding. 
   We all know our enemy is committed. We also know that this slow-bleed tactic, supported by some here in Washington, is a weakly disguised measure to turn our backs on our soldiers. That is something, Madam Speaker, that I cannot support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (PAY ATTENTION AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, the American people mostly don't pay  a whole lot of attention to what goes on here on the floor, and it's probably better, but hopefully they're paying attention now because it's a sad day, and they need to take note. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that what has happened today on this floor has been an abrogation of duty, an abrogation of our duty as representatives of the people, the finest Nation on the face of the Earth. But given what we've done today, we may not be there long. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are individuals who have as their stated goal the destruction of the West. You can call them what you will, radical jihadists, terrorists. Their threats are real and they are continuing. And this House, under this liberal Democrat leadership, is ignoring their words. 
   You don't have to take my word for the fact that these threats are real. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated on December 27, allegedly on orders from al Qaeda. And one might say, well, that's 6 weeks ago. Well, just in the past 48 hours we have seen threats from other radical jihadists. In Denmark, three jihadists were arrested in a plot to murder a cartoonist for drawing an editorial cartoon years ago that they found objectionable. Mr. Speaker, I know that some on the majority side view this as comic relief, I guess, but the three jihadists who were arrested to plot the murder of a cartoonist in Denmark within the past 48 hours didn't view it as comedy. And this Democrat majority and leadership says, oh, that's okay, don't worry about it. Mr. Speaker, I hope the American people are paying attention. 
   In the last 48 hours, in the Philippines, jihadists with two terrorist groups associated with al Qaeda are said to be plotting to assassinate the Filipino President and bomb western embassies. And this Democrat majority leadership says, oh, that's okay, don't worry. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the last 48 hours in Iraq, the reputed leader of al Qaeda in Iraq posted on a jihadi Web site a call for war with Israel and for jihadists to use Iraq as a launching pad to seize Jerusalem. And this Democrat majority leadership says, oh, that's okay, don't worry about it. 
   And just this morning, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah raised the prospect of war with Israel declaring, ``Zionists, if you want this kind of open war, let the whole world listen: Let this war be open.'' And the Democrat majority leadership in this House said, that's okay, don't worry about it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am astounded that the House of Representatives will leave town today and go home when Saturday of this week the opportunity and the ability of our intelligence community to protect us and other freedom-loving people around the world will expire. I'm astounded. 
   Most of what we do on this floor my constituents think doesn't make a whole lot of difference in their lives. Mr. Speaker, this makes a whole lot of difference in the lives of my constituents, in the lives of your constituents, in the lives of every single American. And not to have acted today on this bill to allow our intelligence community to keep us safe and protect us, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, is an abrogation of duty. 
   I call on the Democrat leadership and the Speaker of the House to bring us back into session as soon as possible and, on behalf of the American people, act responsibly, live up to your oath, and pass this bill, the Protect America Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would draw my colleague's attention to the context in the stated ``whereas'' that on at least one occasion, if not countless others across this Nation, in the Charleston Post and Courier, it was written that the House of Representatives' Democrat leadership was described as ``indeed causing a potentially dangerous gap in the Nation's defenses'' and ``creating an unnecessary cloud of uncertainty in a critical area of intelligence operations where there should be great clarity.'' 
   There have been multiple articles and multiple references across this Nation as to why this House of Representatives is bringing discredit to the House and also not fulfilling its responsibility, in fact, abrogating its responsibility and its duty. An abrogation of duty by this House of Representatives brings discredit to the House, and, therefore, this is a question of privilege.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it used to be that there were just some things you simply didn't play partisan games with: Our military, our kids, and especially our veterans. 
   But not in this Congress. In this House of politics, no matter is safe from political posturing and exploitation. From playing class warfare with every proposal, to using children as political props, politics has trumped policy from day one. 
   Now the new majority has sunk to a new low, holding our Nation's proud veterans hostage. And for what, Madam Speaker? Pork. 
   Though the veterans spending bill passed this House months ago with 409 votes, the new majority has refused to allow the legislation to move forward, and veterans demand action. 
   This is a clear demonstration of where the majority's priorities lie. It's shameful and sad that the loony left in this House are willing to exploit our veterans as a political tool so that they can get their hands on ever more hard-earned American tax dollars. 
   Madam Speaker, bring up the veterans bill free from pork and free from politics.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you so much, Dr. GINGREY. It is a great pleasure to share the floor with you once again and talk about an issue that is so very, very important, not just to seniors but to all Americans. And I appreciate, as has been said, your leadership on this issue. It has been wonderful and greatly appreciated. You are serving extremely well in this area, and I appreciate that. 
   I also want to point out to the Speaker, as I know he knows, and to other Members of Congress that I think it is instructive to note that the individuals who have come to the floor tonight to talk about this issue are physicians or at least were physicians in their former lives. And I think that is helpful to think about, because the individuals who are charged with caring for the health of this Nation, the physicians all across this Nation understand and appreciate that the consequences of government decisions can oftentimes be huge in their effect on the ability to provide quality care for the patients of this Nation. 
   So we come down here tonight and talk about an issue that is of just most importance to American people and to all seniors who participate in the Medicare program, and we do so because we have been on the other side, the other end of these decisions. And when decisions are made in Washington that provide for greater control of health care by Washington, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that always, always, by and large, results in a decrease in the quality of care that is able to be provided. 
   I would also wish to point out, Mr. Speaker, that I think this is an issue that really is part of a bigger question. And the bigger question is, who is it that ought to be making fundamental personal health care decisions? And it appears that we in this body have a philosophical difference about who that ought to be. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle tend to believe that the decisionmaking authority in those personal health care decisions ought to rest with patients and with physicians, that that is where those decisions ought to be. And I know that my colleagues who are here this evening would concur with that, because we know how difficult it is when somebody else, especially a nonmedical person, is making those kinds of decisions and it most often adversely affects the health care of that patient. So we believe as a matter of principle that patients and physicians ought to be making health care decisions, including which medication to utilize, because patients and physicians are the ones that know best which medication that ought to be utilized. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle it appears believe as a matter of principle that government ought to be making those decisions, that government bureaucrats, Washington bureaucrats who may or may not have any fundamental knowledge about, in this instance, personal health care issues, that government ought to be making those decisions. 
   So I think it is important for people to appreciate, Mr. Speaker, that that really is one of the fundamental principles that we are talking about here: Who ought to be making health care decisions? Should it be patients and physicians, or should it be the government? 
   My good friend mentioned that this was a solution in search of a problem, as I had said before, and it really is. And so when you have an issue like that, I think it is also important, Mr. Speaker, to look at why is it that the Democrat majority is even attempting to solve this problem that I would suggest doesn't exist? And I would use as rationale for the fact that there is no problem to solve so many issues that have been brought up here on the floor already and in this debate. 
   The cost of the benefit to seniors all across this Nation in 2006 are 30 percent lower, 30 percent lower, $13 billion lower in 2006 than were projected. The projected costs over 10 years are down over 21 percent which equals $197 billion. The premiums are down over 40 percent over that that was projected. And in fact, if you think about the last time that the majority party, the now majority party tried to effect this program, one of their proposals was to mandate, was to dictate, was to make certain, was to guarantee that the premium per month for each and every senior would be $35, $35 a month. They wanted to make certain that it would be absolutely that amount and not a penny less. And in fact, what we have seen is that the current premium per month is about $22 or $23.     
   So if the other side had had its ways 2 years ago, 3 years ago, when this was adopted, seniors all across this Nation would be paying $12 to $13 a month more, more on top of the premium that they are already paying, if the other side had had their way. So I think it is important to think about and to appreciate what they have had in mind all along. Why they want to do that is beyond me, but I would suggest to you that it has something to do with whom they want to be in control of these health care decisions. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, I would tell you, looking at this issue, that it really is a solution in search of a problem. The Medicare beneficiaries all across this Nation, over 80 percent of them are pleased with this program, are happy with the program, believe that it helps them greatly in caring for their health. And that is in a program that has over 90 percent of those who are eligible to participate involved. So 80 percent of those participating are  pleased with it. So you have got to ask, why? What kind of problem are we trying to solve? 
   It is also important, I think, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, to ask the question, if the program is working so well, why is it working so well? And as has already been mentioned, there is this big kind of proposal that is being put forward now that would say that the government ought to be able to negotiate, that nobody is negotiating drug prices. Well, in fact, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, the plans themselves right now are negotiating and negotiating extremely well. Otherwise, you wouldn't see the kind of savings that we have already seen in just a year's history of the program. Plans are negotiating with both pharmaceutical companies and with pharmacists, and, in fact, that is what is resulting in the decrease in premiums that seniors all across this Nation are seeing. So the system is truly working extremely well in spite of all the naysayers on the other side. 
   I want to bring up again what happens when the government gets involved, and my good friend has a poster down there about government-negotiated prices on certain drugs and the actual cost. And the numbers are striking. They truly are. And the reason that it is important to look at what happens when the government gets involved with a negotiation is to remember what negotiators have to be able to do. The individual doing the negotiating has to, in this instance, be able to say to the drug company: If you won't meet my price, then I am not going to put your drug on the formulary, on the list of drugs that are available for patients. However, when the government is doing all the negotiating, what will happen is that they will say: If you don't meet my price, you won't be able to have your drug on this formulary, and the consequence of that is that your drug will not be available to seniors or physicians who are trying to make those personal health care decisions. What that means, Mr. Speaker, is that there will be fewer drugs available. Fewer drugs available. That is what happens when the government gets involved in the process. So the price may be lower for a period of time. I do not believe that is the case, as we have had good examples and quotes from very learned individuals in the economic system that will tell you that the government cannot dictate a lower price in this instance, but what certainly will happen is that there will be fewer drugs available. 
   Somebody may say that is just conjecture; that is just somebody dreaming about what might happen. But if we look at a program that the government did affect relatively recently and see what happened, we can see exactly by example what happens when the government gets involved. And the program I would cite is a program called the Vaccine for Children's program, and, Mr. Speaker, folks all across this Nation may remember that there was a very robust vaccine industry in our country not too long ago, in fact, about 12 or 13 years ago, and then the government got a bright idea and said, oh, but the price for those vaccines is a little too high. In some instances they believed it was a lot too high. So instead of working on how to assist individuals who didn't have the resources with which to purchase those vaccines, what the government did was come in and say, all right, you can only charge this amount of money for that vaccine. And what happened was that we saw a huge decrease in the number of companies that now provide vaccines. In fact, it went from about 30 companies that made and did research and development on vaccines, and now in this Nation, Mr. Speaker, we only have three, three, in about 12 years. That is what happens when the government gets involved in a program. Price fixing occurs and a decrease in the quality of health care that is provided occurs, and certainly a decrease in the number of medications available. Everybody across this Nation knows that that is what happened with the vaccine program. Fewer innovations, fewer new vaccines, shortages of vaccines, and less access to vaccines. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I just want to close and finally talk about, just to reiterate, the issue of who is making health care decisions. When I go home and I talk to my constituents at home, and I know that is true for Congressman Gingrey and Congressman Boustany and certainly when we see our former patients in the post office or at a restaurant or a church, I know that what they tell me is, please, please don't let the government get more involved in health care. And so I would suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that where health care decisions are made between the physician and the patient is something that is extremely important to men and women and children all across this Nation. And this issue is one of those issues that will strike a cord among people all across this Nation if the government gets involved and says, no, you may not have that drug, you may not have that medication because the price is too much. 
   So, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I will tell you that if what is on the floor tomorrow is adopted, we will see a lower quality of health care, a decrease in access to health care, and I believe strongly that we will see patients across this Nation harmed. I know that is not what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to do. At least I hope that is not what they want to do. But I will tell you that that will be the consequence of this bill if it passes tomorrow. 
   So I am very hopeful that our friends on the other side of the aisle will recognize the consequences of decisions that they are about to make and will appreciate that, indeed, what they must do, if they truly believe in looking out for the best interest of their constituents and our former patients, is to make certain that health care decisions remain in the hands of physicians and patients. 
   And with that, I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia once again for his leadership on this issue and for the opportunity to participate in this message tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my leadership for the opportunity once again to come to the floor and to shed a little light. Tonight, we are going to shed a little truth on some of the messages that we have heard just now and maybe previously here in Washington. 
   This is another edition of The Official Truth Squad. The Official Truth Squad is a group of Republicans who desire to make certain that some sense of factual information is provided, Mr. Speaker, as we talk about the issues that are dealt with on the floor of this House. 
   We have a favorite, a number of favorite quotes. One of them is from Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Senator Moynihan said, everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not to their own facts. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is curious to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle and their righteous indignation, the righteous indignation that they have about so many various things, particularly tonight when they talked about spending and funding the troops. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, it is curious because the bill that this House passed under the leadership on the other side, the majority party leadership, just 2 weeks ago, I know you will find this amazing, but that is a bill that could have been passed the first or second week of January of this year to appropriately fund the troops who are standing in harm's way, who are defending our liberty and our freedom and attempting to carry out what they believe, we believe, to be a role that will result in a more safe and secure Middle East and a more safe and secure United States of America. 
   That bill was held up literally for 5 months because of political posturing and gamesmanship and all sorts of things that, frankly, Mr. Speaker, Americans are tired of. They are tired of it. 
   We all got back in Washington from a week at home. Most of us went home to our districts. It is good to go home and hear what people are really thinking. The folks in my district on the northern side of Atlanta, they are mad as can be about the partisan games that are played here in Washington. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am here to bring a little truth and light and fact to many different areas. But I think it is important for everybody to appreciate, especially in this body, that the bill that was passed to appropriately fund the troops, 2 weeks ago we passed that bill, that is a bill that could have been passed by virtually every single positive vote in this House the first or second week of January had our good friends, the Blue Dogs and others, not participated in the kind of gamesmanship that the American people are, frankly, tired of. 
   I want to talk a little bit about the fiscal house being put back in order. Our good friends on the other side of the aisle talked about putting the, quote, ``fiscal house back in order'' which is why the Blue Dogs felt that they increased their numbers and assisted the election of the majority. 
   I think it is curious when they talk about putting the fiscal house of this Nation back in order. Because if you look at the truth, if you look at facts, if you listen to facts and not just opinion, Mr. Speaker, you will appreciate I know that what has happened over the first, a little over 5 months of this new Congress under new leadership is that we have seen an increased authorization for over $50 billion in new spending. So are they putting the fiscal house back in order by decreasing spending? No. Over $50 billion in new spending authorized by this new majority with the Blue Dogs supporting virtually every one of those bills. 
   So they must be then decreasing taxes, right, Mr. Speaker, in order to put the fiscal house back in order. Well, no, they are not doing that either. Because the budget that they adopted, this Democrat majority with I think the unanimous support of the Blue Dogs on the other side of the aisle, the budget that they adopted, over $400 billion in new taxes for the American people. It is the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation. I guess that they would argue that is putting this fiscal house back in order.  
   Well, I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it has many folks at home asking me if the Blue Dogs are not just lap dogs and if they are not just kowtowing to the Democratic leadership and doing what they are told to do, as opposed to being fiscally responsible. Which is what so many of us on our side of the aisle are working so hard to do. 
   So things are a little curious, which is why I think it is important to bring some truth and facts to the debate and the discussion. 
   We had some curious things happen on the floor of the House today, Mr. Speaker. I know that you were as puzzled as I at some of the events that occurred yesterday. There was an indictment that was passed down in a court that indicted a Member of Congress, a Member of the House of Representatives. They indicted him I think on 16 counts. So the new majority party came to the floor of the House today, having known about the problem that this individual has had for years, literally. They came to the floor of the House today and they were stumbling over themselves to get to the microphone and to the floor as fast as they could to address this issue that could have been addressed long ago, and passed a resolution that said that anybody who had any criminal charge against them as a Member of Congress, a Member of the House, or any indictment would be referred to the Ethics Committee.     
   That may be appropriate. It passed by a wide margin. I was pleased to support it. I think the process was flawed. It didn't go through the regular committee process and, consequently, was a pretty poorly written bill, but it moves us in a little bit of the right direction. 
   In that whole process of talking about it on the floor of the House this afternoon and evening, the majority leader said something to the effect of anyone accused of wrongdoing needs to be investigated. Any Member of the House who is accused of wrongdoing needs to be investigated, which brings up, Mr. Speaker, the whole issue of earmarks, of special projects. 
   That's what I'd like to spend a little time talking about this evening, the whole issue of pork projects, special projects, earmarks, things that have inflated our budget to a huge degree and things that, frankly, ought not be included in the vast majority of bills, and if they are, they ought to have the greatest amount of scrutiny by both sides of the aisle, Members from both sides, and certainly greatest amount of scrutiny from our constituents, from people all across this Nation, and a great amount of scrutiny from the press. 
   That's what we call sunshine. That's what I call sunshine for earmarks, and it's an important thing. And the majority party made a huge deal as they ran for office last fall about the importance of spending restraint and getting the fiscal house in order, as it were, although we haven't seen a whole lot of that since they took over, but they made a huge point about controlling earmarks and putting a lid on earmarks and special projects. 
   And this past week, we've heard a lot about it, but what has happened is that things have actually gotten worse. Mr. Speaker, I know it's hard to believe, but they have actually gotten worse. And there are a number of people who believe that and a number of objective individuals. Again, facts will back up this case. 
   There was a letter written by the minority leader to the Speaker recently in which he said, We now have reached the point at which the congressional earmark process has become less transparent and less accountable than it was during the 109th Congress, directly violating pledges made last year by Democratic leaders. 
   That goes a long way. I tell you that's a major statement, less transparent, meaning not the kind of sunshine, and less accountable so that who knows where these projects are coming from. How are the people, how are the American citizens, supposed to hold their Member accountable if, in fact, they're doing what they don't believe they ought to do? 
   It has gotten so bad that a Member of even the Democrat majority has said, A lot of Democrats believe it's our turn at the trough. Quite a statement, Mr. Speaker. A lot of Democrats believe it's our turn at the trough. That's a fact that that was indeed said, and in fact, it's distressing because it appears to be that that's the fact of action on the part of this new majority. 
   Now, what did they do in fact? I have coined it Orwellian democracy because so often what has happened with this new majority is that they have said the right thing, they said they were going to do something, and then in fact either done exactly the opposite or ignored what they said they were going to do. 
   Well, what do I mean by that, Mr. Speaker? I have in my hand here the book of rules of the House of Representatives. It's a pretty dry read, but it's got some important points in it, and these are the rules by which the House operates and by which we supposedly make certain that individual Members of this House are held accountable for their actions. 
   One part of the rules talks about congressional earmarks. What's an earmark? How do you determine what an earmark is? How do you determine what a special project is? It's important to know that so you can say, yeah, that ought to be subject to a certain amount of scrutiny, hopefully more scrutiny, a certain amount of sunshine, that the individual Member of Congress ought to have to stand up and say that's my project, I support that project, I'm interested in having us spend Federal taxpayer money on that project. 
   So what's the definition of a congressional earmark? Well, in House rule XXI, subclause 9(d) it says, congressional earmark means a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority or other expenditure targeted to a specific State, locality, or congressional district other than through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process. 
   Now, what does that mean? That means that if an individual Member of Congress says I believe that certain Federal tax dollars, hard-earned taxpayer dollars ought to go for a specific project in my district for a specific purpose, and it's not part of any other authorization that the Federal Government has for another role or another aspect of its responsibility, it's something that a specific Member requests, that's a congressional earmark. 
   Now, how do you make certain that there's appropriate accountability for that? Well, Mr. Speaker, another portion of the rules it says that a list of those earmarks have to be in any bill that has an earmark, and the list has to include the Member's name who requested it. That's an important point because that allows for the sunshine. That makes it so that all Members of this body know who's requested that. It makes it so that the press know who's requested it and they can follow up on it and do investigations if they deem it to be appropriate. It's necessary so that constituents, people out across America, can know who's requesting these things. 
   And it goes on to say that if a list isn't included, the way that you can follow the rules as well is that a statement that the proposition contains no congressional earmarks may suffice. So, if the bill actually contained no earmarks, then all that it took was the chairman of the committee to write a statement to the Speaker and to the Rules Committee that, in fact, the bill contained no earmarks, no special projects. 
   Now, one of the reasons that I've dubbed this the new Orwellian majority and Orwellian democracy is that what we've seen is that multiple bills, Mr. Speaker, multiple bills have come to the floor of the House with special project after special project after special project, millions and sometimes billions of dollars, and yet what is included in the report language from the committee is the sentence from the chairman that no congressional earmarks are in the bill, in spite of the fact that they're in the bill. That's why I call it Orwellian democracy because it just simply takes the chairman, an individual, to say, well, there aren't any earmarks in there, and so it satisfies the rule. 
   Now, I went to the parliamentarian on this because I couldn't believe it. I  said, Do you mean to tell me that if the chairman of the committee just says, regardless of its truth, just says there are no earmarks in this bill that that satisfies, that means there are no earmarks, even if there are? And the parliamentarian said absolutely correct, absolutely. 
   And so the only option that we have is to come to 
   the floor and say, look, what they've said just isn't the truth. Remember, it's an opinion. It's not a fact. And the fact of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, that time after time this new majority has brought bill after bill to the floor with earmarks and special project after special project after special project and simply gotten around the rules because they say, oh, no, there's no earmarks here. 
   Let me give you a couple of examples, Mr. Speaker, because I know people would be interested in looking at that. Members of the House, if they're interested, H.R. 1100 was a bill that we voted on just a couple of weeks ago. The whole legislation really was one big earmark with a $7 million estimate cost by CBO over a number of years, and it specifically dealt with one congressional district, one specific project, and it did not have any other statutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award process. The whole thing was an earmark, but it had in the language of the report from the committee, no earmarks here, no earmarks here. Mr. Speaker, that emperor has no clothes I promise you. 
   H.J. Res. 20 was the continuing resolution to make certain that there was the money in place to continue the Federal Government's responsible activities. What did that have? Multiple earmarks, multiple. Millions and millions of dollars of earmarks, and in fact, got around the rule by just saying, oh, there are no earmarks here, there are no earmarks here. Orwellian democracy, Mr. Speaker. 
   And then most recently, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill had billions, billions of dollars in special projects, and in fact, all that was done in order to comply with the rules of the House was to have one of the chairmen of the committee say, oh, no, there are no earmarks here. 
   It reminds one of the Wizard of Oz, you know, where the wizard says, oh, don't pay any attention to that man behind that curtain. Well, that's kind of what the majority party is asking; don't pay attention to these earmarks even though we say there are none. 
   So what's the solution now? They have taken a lot of heat, this majority party has taken a lot of heat for trying to put these special projects, pork projects into bills. And so what's their solution? Well, they have come up with a solution. 
   Before we talk about that solution, it's important to remember what they promised. What did this new majority promise? And what they said was, We're going to adopt rules that make the system of legislation transparent so that we don't legislate in the dark of night and the public and other Members can see what's being done. We need to have earmarks subject to more debate. That's what debate and public awareness is all about. Democracy works if people know what's going on. That was Majority Leader Hoyer last fall after the election. That's what he said about the earmark process. 
   And the now-Speaker said about a year ago, It's the special interest earmarks that are ones that go in there in the dark of night. They don't want anybody to see, and that nobody does see and then they're voted upon. So transparency, yes, by all means, let's subject them all to the scrutiny that they deserve and let them compete for the dollar. That's now-Speaker Pelosi. That's the statement that she made just a little over a year ago. 
   What's happened? What's the reality, Mr. Speaker? What's the facts, not the opinion, not the Orwellian democracy of, oh, there aren't any earmarks in that bill, don't bother looking because there aren't any earmarks in that bill? But what's the facts? 
   The fact is that after promising this unprecedented openness regarding Congress' pork barrel practices, what the majority party, the House Democrats, have done, they've moved in exactly the opposite direction. As they draw up spending bills, the new appropriations bills are coming on line for this new budget year, they're side-stepping the rules approved on the very first day that they took power in January where they said we need to identify earmarks. Remember those rules, Mr. Speaker, where you had to have a list of earmarks? You had to have the individual that requested them? Had to make certain that there was sunshine? 
   Rather than including specific pet projects or grants or contracts in the legislation as it's written, this is what's new, Mr. Speaker. Democrats are following an order by House Appropriations Committee Chairman to keep the bills free of such earmarks until it's too late in the process to challenge them. Too late in the process to challenge them. Phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal. 
   Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor said just 2 days ago, After promising unprecedented openness regarding Congress' pork barrel practices, House Democrats are moving in the opposite direction. 
   From an article by Andrew Taylor, the Associated Press of January 3, Representative DAVID OBEY, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, says that those requests for dams, community grants and research contracts for favored universities or hospitals will be added spending measures in the fall. That's when the House and the Senate negotiators assemble their final bill. So, as a result, most lawmakers will not get the chance to oppose or even identify specific projects as wasteful or questionable when the spending bills for various agencies get their first vote in the full House this month. 
   So what's going to happen, Mr. Speaker, is that instead of this wonderful transparency, instead of the sunshine, all the accountability that this new majority talked about, in fact what they're doing is going way back, way back to an old time long, long ago when these special projects were put in late at night with nobody watching, no ability to gain accountability for it, no ability to see what's happening, no opportunity for average Members of this House of Representatives to see and appreciate what's happening in terms of spending in the appropriations bills as they go forward. 
   The House-Senate compromise bills due for final action in September cannot be amended, and it's extremely pivotal because you can't say, well, this is a project that we ought to have more discussion on, more debate on. So it can't be amended and they're only subject to 1 hour of debate.     
   It's not just those of us who believe in sunshine for earmarks, something that I have fought for a number of years. It's not just those of us in the House of Representatives who are concerned. Tom Shatz, the President of Citizens Against Government Waste says, ``Who appointed him judge and jury of earmarks? What that does is leave out the public's input.'' 
   The article from Mr. Taylor goes on to say what Mr. Obey is doing runs counter to new rules. The Democrats promised they would make such spending decisions more open. Those rules made it clear that projects earmarked for Federal dollars and their sponsors were to be made available to public scrutiny when appropriations bills are debated. The rules also require lawmakers requesting such projects to provide a written explanation describing their request in a letter certifying that they or their spouse wouldn't make any financial gain from them. 
   So it's important to appreciate what is happening with this new Orwellian democracy, Orwellian majority, is that what we are seeing is them saying one thing and then doing something exactly the opposite. 
   Again, it's not just those of us on this side of the aisle who believe that and have documented that. This is an article from the St. Petersburg Times that explains in an editorial, ``The new game that House Appropriations Chairman DAVID OBEY intends to play with budget earmarks this year is worse than the usual hide-and-seek. He's taken the whole thing underground, as though he is to be trusted as a one-man auditor for congressional pork. If this is to be the new ethic the Democrats promised, voters might want to get their ballots back.'' 
   Something that I have talked about, the American people are paying attention, they are watching, and they are disappointed with what they see. This  new majority talked about taking the Nation in a new direction. They have taken it in a new direction, and it has been exactly backwards, backwards to a time, as documented or given the opinion by the St. Petersburg Times. It's worse than what has happened in the past. 
   The Las Vegas Review Journal notes that it didn't take long for Democrats to break their promise on earmark reform. ``When Democrats took control of Congress 4 months back, incoming House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi bragged that it would take her party less than 100 hours to curb wasteful pork spending by requiring Members to attach their names to their earmarks, exposing such waste to the harsh light of public scrutiny. She failed to mention this reform would remain in effect for little more than the 100 days.'' 
   Didn't even last that long, because, as we have documented already, what has taken place is this process of bypassing or skirting the rules by saying, oh, no, there is no earmarks there, when, in fact, there is a laundry list as long as your arm in there. That's the fact. That's the fact of the matter. 
   So while Democrats plot to hide their wasteful spending from the American people, our side, House Republicans, will continue to work to make the earmark process much more transparent and more accountable; and we will work to root out that wasteful spending and balance the budget without raising taxes, without raising taxes, which is so remarkably important. 
   I mentioned that I was home last week, many of us were home in our districts last week. That's what I heard, that individuals all across my district that I talked to have been concerned about spending. Over and over and over they said, we know that you can balance that budget without increasing spending and without increasing taxes. 
   So when our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about getting the fiscal House in order, yet they authorize more spending and they increase in their budget taxes by over $400 billion, the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation, my folks, the folks in my district at home say, well, that just doesn't wash. That's not the kind of leadership we want. 
   So that new direction, those ballots that that editorial talked about, folks getting back, may, in fact, need to occur. And it's a wonderful thing to be able to have accountability for Members of Congress every 2 years. I believe firmly that the American people are, indeed, watching; and they are already tired of what they see on the part of this new majority, especially in the area of earmark reform. 
   I have been joined by a very good friend from Arizona, who truly is the champion of earmark reform, a fellow who has worked tirelessly in his time in Congress to bring light and shed light on the egregious activity that occurs here in the special project. I am so pleased to have my good friend join me, Mr. Flake from Arizona. I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so much for your comments and for your good work on this matter. It's an issue that really strikes a chord, because it gets to the heart of irresponsible activity and irresponsible spending here in Washington. 
   So many of our friends back at home just are tired of it. They are tired of it. I think that's the message this they sent in November. I think that's the message that they sent. It wasn't some of the things that our good friends on the other side of the aisle, the message that they were sending. The message that they were sending is be responsible about your spending. 
   I will bet that if you had a referendum last November and you asked every single voter who went to the polls, would you think it would be a better idea to hide from the American people the special project spending that goes on in Congress to a greater degree than currently exists, yes or no, I bet you couldn't find a soul in this Nation that would support that.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. That really brings to light the issue of accountability, what your constituents want. I know what my constituents want me to do is to make certain that I am paying attention to all of these items and that I raise questions about items that I believe they would not support. 
   Sometimes just a question of clarification, I have been so pleased to be able to support you in many of your efforts to shed light on so many earmarks that have been brought to the floor, and maybe you wouldn't mind sharing with our colleagues the process that that takes and how to get just one vote on a specific earmark and how this process would foil all of that and make it so that there would be no transparency at all.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you again for your comments. 
   And I think it's important, Mr. Speaker, for our colleagues to appreciate that this is a proposed process that is being put in place by the majority party to correct what they have perceived as a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability. But their solution will result in less accountability and less transparency. And as I mentioned before, I don't think that's what the American people want. It certainly isn't what my constituents want, and it's not what you fought for for years and years to have greater transparency and greater accountability to the whole special project earmarking process. 
   Does the gentleman have any more comments?

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so very much. I appreciate you coming and joining us this evening. 
   So folks say well, what is it that you're asking for? Well I've talked about American values and American vision. And what we believe, what I believe Americans are asking for in this instance is open and honest leadership. It's what we oftentimes here in Washington give lip service to. But the fact of the matter is that the American people desire and I believe are demanding open and honest leadership. I believe, we believe that they have a right to transparent and fair legislative process. And the process that has been described for dealing with these earmarks, these special projects, these pork projects is neither transparent nor is it fair because it puts, it's not transparent because there's no light on it. There's no sunlight. There's no ability for, as my good friend from Arizona said, there's no ability for anybody to know who's asking for these earmarks during the process. And then there's no way for the House to work its will on an individual special project as to vote them up or down. Maybe thousands, literally thousands of them included in a particular bill. So that's not a transparent process. It's not a fair process because it concentrates power into the hands of too few individuals, the chairman of Appropriations or the subcommittee chairmen on Appropriations. 
   We believe that Americans have a right to sunshine on how taxpayer money is spent. That again gets to the transparency. You ought to shed light on it. How does this process work? Who's asking for the money? And so that they have to stand up and defend it in front of their constituents, in front of their colleagues and in front of the media, in front of the press. 
   And finally, that Americans have a right to merit based spending that's open to the public debate and open to public scrutiny. 
   Those are principles that I believe, we believe incorporate American values and an American vision that individuals all across this Nation have as the kind of vision for their government, how they believe their government ought to act. 
   Again, in November, if one had asked on everybody's ballot across this Nation, do you think that there ought to be less transparency, that there ought to be less accountability for special projects in Congress, Mr. Speaker, I'll bet you wouldn't have got 1 percent of the people across this Nation to vote in favor of that. Not one. So what we're asking for is accountability, is transparency. 
   I think it's also important, again, to appreciate that there are others across  this Nation who are concerned and dismayed by this process proposal that's been put forward by the new majority party. And I'd just like to highlight some of them, because I think it's important for folks to appreciate that this isn't just your usual political backbiting. This is serious business. This is how we're spending hard earned American taxpayer money. And the proposal is such that I believe, we believe, that it would be much less responsible, certainly much less transparent and much less accountable, and there are folks who believe that all across this Nation. 
   As I mentioned, the editorial in the St. Petersburg Times, one of the lines there said, ``The result then is that the earmark projects will receive almost no public scrutiny and no Congressional debate.'' Significant, major paper in an editorial today. 
   The Review Journal in Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review Journal said, ``Democrat earmark reforms lasted 100 days. When Democrats took control of Congress just 4 months back, incoming House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi of California bragged that it would take her party less than 100 hours to curb wasteful pork spending by requiring Members to attach their names to their earmarks exposing such waste to the harsh light of public scrutiny. She failed to mention that this reform would remain in effect for little more than 100 days. The anti-earmark reforms are just for show, mere window dressing.'' That's the Las Vegas Review and Journal from an editorial today. 
   There is a gentleman on CNN, Mr. Cafferty, Jack Cafferty, who has had a lot to say about Washington spending. Yesterday he said, ``Remember when the Democrats took control of the Congress back in January? On their very first day in power they approved rules to clearly identify so-called pet projects or earmarks in spending bills. You know, part of their promise to bring openness and transparency to government. Well, guess what? The Associated Press reports Democrats are not including the spending requests in legislation as it's being written. Instead they're following an order from the House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey to keep the bills free of these earmarks until the fall. Now, by doing this, nobody will know what the earmarks are when the bills are first voted on in June. And when they're finally announced in the fall, well, then it will be virtually too late to do anything about them. Clever, don't you think?'' That comes from CNN's Jack Cafferty, June 4, yesterday. 
   And so it's people all across this Nation who are concerned about the process that's been defined. The Toledo Blade, newspaper in Toledo, Ohio, in an editorial a little over a week ago, said, ``Backtracking on earmarks. Here's the outrage of the week from Washington. Democrats who took control of Congress by pledging reform and whacking Republicans over the issue of special interest earmarks already are perpetuating this odious waste of taxpayer money. Democrats promised to end such abuses. Now that they are in charge, they should live up to their rhetoric.'' That's an editorial in the Toledo Blade a little over a week ago. 
   From Montana, the Missoulian in Montana said, ``Congressional pork too tasty to leave alone. Congress is ignoring election promises and feasting on pork projects. What's on the menu on Capital Hill these days? Pork of course. Not that we're surprised, but we're scratching our heads given the promises and pronouncements of the last election season. In their first half year in office, the newly powerful House Democrats have seemingly lost their reformist zeal.'' 
   Editorial from the Missoulian Montana this May 31 of this year. 
   How about Pennsylvania? Reading, Pennsylvania, the Reading Eagle in Pennsylvania said, ``Democratic vows remain unfulfilled. They can talk the talk but they seem to have difficulty walking the walk. As the approval ratings of Republicans plummeted prior to last November's general election, Democrats saw their chance to regain Congressional control. Representative Nancy Pelosi, who was soon to become Speaker of the House, said, `We pledge to make this the most honest, ethical and open Congress in history.' That pledge,'' this is now from the Reading Eagle, from Reading, Pennsylvania. ``That pledge was broken in March when democratic leaders pushed through a $124 billion emergency supplemental bill to fund the military in Iraq and Afghanistan that was laden with $21 billion in pork barrel spending known as earmarks. A House rule instituted by Democrats that prohibits swapping earmarks for votes also seems to have fallen by the wayside.'' 
   In fact, that brings up a specific point that is of grave concern to many of us. We highlighted on our side of the aisle a member of the Appropriations Committee who challenged and literally threatened a Member of the minority party, Republican Member, with saying that if he didn't support a certain bill, a certain provision, that his earmarks would be pulled from the appropriations bill. And it happened on the floor of the House. Many people witnessed it. And what did the new majority, when that was brought to light, what did they do with that complaint, with that concern, with that issue? 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, as you know, and you remember, they moved to table the motion, the resolution that would have simply required an investigation of that process. And tabling, as you know, Mr. Speaker, means that it kills the issue. It's dead. So the majority party wielded their muscle and made certain that an individual who is in the majority, who is muscling another Member of the House of Representatives and threatening to withhold certain funds from a bill because he wouldn't support another provision, that will go uninvestigated. That will just be tossed under the rug, swept under the rug. That, Mr. Speaker, is not the kind of United States House of Representatives that Americans desire or that they deserve. 
   Further, a couple of others, Mr. Speaker, of objective individuals citing their concern about this new process for spending on the part of our new majority. CNN investigative reporter Drew Griffin said on May 25, ``The new open Democratic Party-controlled Congress promised the earmark process would no longer be secret. All earmark requests are made public with plenty of time for debate. But DAVID OBEY, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and one of those Democrats bragging about those changes, has decided that earmarks, those generous gifts of your money, will be inserted into bills only after the bill has cleared the House floor. In other words, earmarks will still be done in secret with no public debate. There was supposed to be some kind of change. In the next few months, in what Congressman Obey says is the most open earmark process ever, the bills will be drafted, the earmarks added. But only then, just before those bills are passed, will the public learn where the treasure is buried.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that's not the kind of process that my constituents desire. That's not the kind of process that they voted for. It's not the kind of process that we've proposed. It's not the kind of process that is becoming of a House, especially when the majority party says that they are desirous of getting this fiscal house in order. It's more of that Orwellian democracy. Just because you say it doesn't make it so. 
   Associated Press on June 3 said, ``After promising unprecedented openness regarding Congress's pork barrel practices House Democrats are moving in the opposite direction as they draw up spending bills for the upcoming budget's year. Democrats are sidestepping rules approved their first day in power to clearly identify earmarks, lawmakers' requests for special projects, and contracts for their states in the documents that accompany spending bills.'' 
   And finally, CNN's Drew Griffin said on May 31, ``Thousands of pages of earmarks in a bill time after time, and the Democrats promised reform and it's not happening.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what a shame. Truly what a shame. What a great opportunity we have to work together and fashion a system and a process that provides greater transparency, that provides greater openness, that answers the concerns of our constituents who say we want to make certain that there's sunshine on this process. We want to make certain that folks are held accountable. We want to make certain that our hard earned tax money that's going to Washington is  being spent in the most responsible fashion. 
   And so what is it that we desire? Open and honest leadership, Mr. Speaker. Americans have a right to transparent and fair legislative process. They have a right to sunshine on how taxpayer money is spent. They have a right to merit based spending that's open to public debate and to public scrutiny. 
   So I would ask my colleagues, I would challenge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to talk to their leadership, to implore them to urge them to move in the direction that they said they would move and that is greater transparency and greater openness and greater scrutiny of how these public monies are being spent.     
   So all is not lost. This is recoverable. I know that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said that it would be so, but this is a 435-Member body, and it ought to act in a majority fashion, and I am hopeful that at least some members of the majority party will see that that is not the kind of leadership and not the kind of process that their constituents desire. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I close this evening, I do want to touch on one other item very briefly, because I know that time is getting late, and that is the whole issue of taxes and spending. 
   As I mentioned, I was home this past week in the district over the Memorial Day break. And person after person, constituent after constituent kept coming up to me and talking about issue after issue, and one of the major issues was spending, spending in Washington, and taxes, making certain that tax money was being spent responsibly and that taxes didn't go up, which was why it was so concerning to them that this new majority has increased the authorization for spending already, in just 5 months, by over $50 billion; also why it was concerning to them that this new majority has passed a budget that incorporates $400 billion in new taxes. The largest tax increase in the history of the Nation, $400 billion. Phenomenal, absolutely phenomenal. 
   So when you think about how our economy has been relatively rolling along over the past number of months, over 16, 17, 18 quarters of growth in a row; more homeownership than ever before in the history of the Nation; the unemployment rate at its lowest continual rate in decades, lower than the average of the 1960s and the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s; remarkable success in terms of an economy that is performing extremely well, one would think that it would behoove the majority party to say, well, I wonder how that happened. I wonder how that economy got to be so strong. 
   There are issues and points in time that you can recognize and point to and say there were changes made then that resulted in a very strong economy, and one of them occurred in 2003. This graph highlights it. These are tax revenues coming into the Federal Government. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, as you know, between 2000 and 2003, Federal tax revenue was declining. We had been hit by some significant challenges, 9/11, a recession, the tech dot com boom burst, and so tax revenue was decreasing. So what happened in 2003, whatever this was, whatever happened on this vertical line here at that point in time, it resulted in significant increases to the Federal Government tax revenue because of a significant increase in the economy, a significant increase in productivity. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, as you know, what happened at that time was that appropriate tax reductions were put in place. Fair tax cuts for the American people were put in place so that the marginal rates were decreased for everybody, so that there was a decrease in capital gains and dividends tax, a decrease over a period of time in the marriage penalty and the death penalty. All of those appropriate tax reductions were decreased. 
   Tax cuts result in more economic activity and more economic growth. It sounds counterintuitive, but, in fact, it happens every single time that you cut taxes. If you cut taxes, if you give the American people more of their hard-earned money, what they do is they determine when they save or they spend or they invest that money, and that results in a flourishing, increasing economic development and an increasing economic activity in our Nation, and it is undeniable what happened. 
   There is another graph that demonstrates it, that talks about jobs growth. Here you have a number of jobs created on the horizontal line from 2001 through 2007, and you see again, Mr. Speaker, before the appropriate tax reductions in 2003, what happened was a relative decrease in job growth, month after month after month after month. And what happened with the tax cuts on the American people, allowing people to keep more of their hard-earned tax money, what happens is an incredible increase in job growth, and that is why we have seen over 7 million new jobs created since August of 2003. Incredible economic activity. 
   So it astounds me that the majority party believes somehow that if they increase taxes, again by passing a budget that has the largest tax increase in the history of the Nation, nearly $400 billion in increased taxes to Americans, almost $2,700 for every single Georgian, a phenomenal increase in taxes, it is incomprehensible to try to understand why the majority party believes that that is the appropriate kind of policy to put in place if they want to continue this kind of activity. 
   If they wanted to continue this kind of activity, one would think that they would conclude appropriately, objectively, looking at the facts, that the appropriate tax reductions ought to continue. But what they have said is, no, they ought not continue, that those marginal rates ought to go up, that we ought to increase taxes on every single American who pays taxes, that we ought to increase the marriage penalty, that we ought to do away with the decreases in death tax, that we ought to have increases in taxes on capital gains and dividends and we ought to decrease the incentive for investment. It just doesn't make sense. 
   I know that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are responsible. I know that they desire to do the right thing. I know that they have heard from their constituents back home, and I suspect what they have heard is please make certain that we continue an economy that allows our Nation to grow, that allows our Nation to defend itself, that allows our Nation to create jobs, that allows our communities to thrive. And one way to do that, one of the most effective ways to do that, is the way that it has happened every single time that it has been tried in our Nation's history, and that is to decrease taxes on the American people. Allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money. Allow them to be the ones who determine when they spend or they save or they invest their money. 
   So I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a good look at what has happened. Take a good look at history. Take a good look at the remarkable economic growth and development that we have had across this Nation over the past 3 to 4 years. And I think what you will conclude, Mr. Speaker, is that those tax reductions ought to remain in place. 
   We live in an incredible Nation, a Nation that allows those of us who represent districts all across this Nation to come to the House of Representatives and to try our best as honestly and openly as we can to represent our constituents. It is a wonderful Nation. It is a beacon of hope and liberty for folks all around the world, and it is so because we are responsible when we act responsibly and we listen to our constituents and we decide issues based upon what their desires are and what is in the best interest of them and our Nation. 
   So I call on my colleagues to think seriously about the issues as they relate to taxes and economic development of our Nation. And I know that they will conclude what I have concluded; and that is decreasing taxes results in increasing economic development, increasing economic activity, and, amazingly enough, increasing revenue to the Federal Treasury.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (FORECLOSURE PREVENTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I appreciate my colleague on the committee for attempting to clarify an issue which is, I think, significantly problematic. 
   The issue of defining foreclosure time, and length, the particulars have always been the purview of the States. And I know that this amendment is an attempt to try to clarify that. In fact, I think it confounds it, and my concern about the unanimous consent request is that it doesn't make it clear still. So I have significant concerns about the amendment. 
   I'm happy to yield to my friend from Ohio for any clarification that he might offer.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate those comments and I would agree. I think that all of us, many of us in the House, many certainly on this side of the aisle, want to retain the States' prerogative in the area of foreclosure. And I would suggest to the gentleman that his comment about that, and the discussion that's gone on on the unanimous consent request and the language therein, is something that ``they can live with.'' 
   And I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this probably should have been dealt with in committee, and it might have been able to be clarified to a much greater degree. My concern remains.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   There's a general sense, Mr. Speaker, that it's this bill or nothing, and that certainly isn't true. In fact, much has been done. As has been talked about, the FHA Secure program has created greater flexibility, helping hundreds of thousands stay in their homes. The Hope Now program has already helped 1.4 million individuals stay in their home, getting borrowers and lenders together. Loan limits have been increased, FHA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac. The Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates. So the notion that the Federal Government has been unresponsive or slow to move is disingenuous and is repeated as fact solely as an excuse for the Democrats to continue outbidding each other on how much taxpayer funding they can spend or bail out imprudent borrowers who either bought too much house or lenders who were gladly willing to give them the money. So much has been done to date. 
   We have also heard the chairman and others say that it's unlikely that this will cost $300 billion, that it will only be $2.4 or $2.7 billion. Well, then why doesn't the bill say that? It doesn't, Mr. Speaker, because the taxpayer will be on the hook for risky loans and the number may significantly rise, and that's because this bailout plan irresponsibly disregards borrowers' payment history and credit scores. Borrowers could have missed the majority of their monthly payments over the life of the loan; yet those borrowers would still be eligible for a government-backed mortgage, and taxpayers would be on the hook. Americans don't believe that's fair. 
   There has also been discussion about the voluntary nature of this program. However, Federal Reserve Board Governor Randall Krozner said in our committee, ``If Congress decides to move down this road, then it should carefully consider the steps that should be taken to mitigate moral hazard, avoid adverse selection, and ensure that the financial interests of the taxpayer are adequately safeguarded.'' 
   But if you listen to the chairman, this program isn't so voluntary. At that same hearing, the chairman said, ``If we were to get this approach adopted but we don't get much of a voluntary buy into this, then I have to say the response will probably be more regulation than people might like to see.'' 
   He went on in an article quoted yesterday here in Washington to say, ``Meanwhile Chairman Frank has warned the mortgage industry that if it doesn't support something like this plan this year, it could be in for far more regulation next year.'' And that article went on: ``If after this we continue to get very little participation by servicers, I can guarantee you that the servicer industry will look very different ..... If after everything we do in this cooperative way falls short, then you are going to see legislation that puts some very real restrictions on the role of servicers.'' 
   All of a sudden, Mr. Speaker, this program doesn't sound so voluntary. It seems to me that the chairman's comments will exacerbate the moral hazard that the Federal Reserve Governor warned us against. 
   In addition to the incentives, the chairman provides in his legislation for holders of mortgages, and they are real and enticing. We have actual threats of harmful regulation if they don't sign up dutifully for this program. That's not voluntary.

   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that these threats do no favors to the American taxpayers across our country.

Mr. Speaker, that's irresponsible and it's unwise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank Mr. Carter for his leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is to prevent further delay in the construction of border fencing as prescribed in the Secure Fence Act. 
   Last Congress, Republicans responded to public opinion and national need and authorized the creation of more than 700 miles of fence along the southern border. Instead of providing resources for the border fencing and surveillance, however, the majority has crafted a lengthy list of reporting requirements to delay the building of the fence. 
   One requirement would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to wait before taking any border security action that warrants the use of environmental waiver authority. This invites frivolous litigation and inhibits the Department's ability from addressing vulnerabilities. 
   Another requirement would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to solicit local advice and support before constructing infrastructure. This gives communities veto authority over Federal policy to control the border, including some sanctuary cities. The American people are watching Congress and what it is doing on immigration reform. 
   The American people are looking to trust the Federal Government again. 
   The American people are looking to trust the Federal Government again to live up to its promises and enforce the rule of law. The provisions of this act undermine the people's trust and signals that it is business as usual in Washington, that it's not serious about dealing with our immigration crisis. Many believe that the clear goal of this bill is not to fund border security. This amendment will go a long way toward moving us in the right direction.

   The final question I have is in the past it has appeared that the agreement between the majority party and the minority party regarding the unanimous consent and time limits on appropriations bills has tended to be during the process of the debate, and if the debate was moving along expeditiously, there was no need for a unanimous consent agreement. 
   My question is: Is it the intent to operate traditionally as has been done, or is the intent to adopt a unanimous consent agreement prior to the bill being taken up?

Funny thing is, the budget that they passed will do this: Between 2010 and 2011 their budget will raise taxes on ordinary income from 35 to 39.6, capital gains from 15 percent to 20 percent, dividends from 15 percent to 39.6 percent, estate tax, 0 percent to 55 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for yielding and for his leadership on this issue. 
   I would like to just comment about both the rule and the bill; and, Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to just tell you that Orwellian democracy continues to be alive and well here in the House Chamber. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle seem to think that, if they just say something, that it is, that their action does not make any difference. This is the open rule that is not. That is what this is. 
   Because what we have, as my good friend from California described, is in fact a modified open rule. What has occurred with this rule is that there is a requirement for pre-filing amendments to this bill, and in fact, the pre-filing had to occur about 72 hours before the final portion of the bill will be voted upon. That is not an open rule, Mr. Speaker. 
   An open rule is when the bill comes to the floor and anybody who has an idea and wants to offer an amendment is allowed to offer an amendment. Why is that important? Well, that is important because each of us represents a certain number of constituents around this Nation, and at some point, each of us may have a better idea about how the bill ought to progress through the process. 
   But right now, what has happened is, unless we had that idea 2 days ago, yesterday, then it is not able to be entertained. So this is not an open rule. 
   I would ask my friends in the majority party: What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? What amendment is it that you are afraid of that might be brought to the floor that is so dangerous to the American people that you do not want to even talk about it? That is what I would ask. 
   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Massachusetts says that he thinks it is important for people to be able to read amendments and read bills. Well, we do, too, but that is provided for in the rules. That is provided for in the rules. This rule does not address that. The fact that somebody might bring an amendment to the floor under a truly open rule would not affect that at all. 
   So he also asked whether he should apologize to the gentleman from California for having what he described as on open rule. No, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that he apologize to the American people for not carrying out the responsibility of democracy in this Chamber. 
   So this is not an open rule. This is the open rule that was not, and it is important for the American people to appreciate that. 
   I do want to mention a couple of items about the merits of the bill itself. We all had an opportunity to be home for the past 2 weeks. This was  one issue that constituents in my district wanted to talk about. They wanted to talk about whether or not it was appropriate for Washington to insert itself into the compensation for CEOs in this Nation. 
   Many people, I being one of them, are confused and concerned about some of the compensation that major CEOs are getting in this Nation, but everybody in my district appreciates and understands that the place to solve that problem is not Washington, DC. In fact, that is the last place that you want this problem to be solved because Washington, DC, cannot respond in a nimble enough fashion to be able to do so. In fact, there will be significant, unintended consequences, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker. 
   As you know, the challenges that all businesses have across this Nation are encumbered by the taxation that they are required to pay by the exposure to litigation and, yes, Mr. Speaker, by the regulations that come down from on high, and this will be another regulation. So what the majority party is doing is saying to our businesses across this Nation, our public companies across this Nation is, you have got another reason to go offshore; you have got another reason to take American jobs and remove them because we are going to make it too difficult for you to engage in your business here in America. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, what they are going to do is to make it so difficult for many businesses with their onerous regulations that not only will individuals take their businesses offshore, many of them will say it is just too much of a challenge to comply with all of your ridiculous regulations, so we will go private so that Americans all across this Nation will be precluded from participating in a greater way in the American Dream. 
   Mr. Speaker, this rule is a bad idea. The bill is a bad idea. Washington cannot solve this problem. You know that, and I urge my colleagues to oppose both.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues, at least on this side of the aisle, for working as diligently as possible to introduce amendments that will result in fiscal responsibility, or at least the start of fiscal responsibility, here in Washington. 
   This amendment is affectionately known as the Hefley amendment. A former Member here from Colorado, Mr. Hefley often introduced an amendment that would reduce the increase in appropriations bills by 1 percent. I suspect we will hear another cry of ``devastating cuts'' from the majority party, but in fact, Mr. Chairman, this is a minimal reduction for the Federal budget, but a huge win for the American people. 
   When we talk about amendments that are reducing appropriately the spending that goes on by the Federal Government, it is always important to remember whose money we are spending. This isn't the government's money. This is the people's money, and they work extremely hard to make certain that they can make their ends meet. And in so doing, they generously, they generously, provide the Federal Government with the resources with which to run our government and our country. It is incumbent upon us to be as responsible as possible with that spending. I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we can be more responsible than we are being. 
   We have heard a lot of pronouns bantied about on the floor today, mostly ``I'' and ``you.'' I wish, Mr. Chairman, we would have a few more ``we's,'' because when we work together on behalf of the American people to decrease spending, to responsibly spend, what we do is come together in a way that I think the American people desire us to, and certainly I believe that is one of the messages they sent last November. 
   We have heard also discussions or comments saying this is a big waste of time. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would suggest to you that any time we are fighting on behalf of the American taxpayer, that is not time wasted. I would also suggest that they don't believe that fighting on their behalf to make sure that the Federal Government spends less than is planned by this majority, that that is a waste of time. 
   Now, what is the big picture in this bill? The big picture is that last year the programs under this bill spent $19.5 billion. The committee has come forward with a proposal to spend $21.4 billion, an increase of $1.9 billion, nearly 10 percent. 
   This amendment, this amendment that is before us right now, is to decrease that increase, that nearly 10 percent increase, decrease that increase by 1 percent. So it is not, it is not, something that could be described as a devastating cut. 
   The numbers again: Last year we spent $19.5 billion. The committee proposes $21.4 billion. When this amendment is enacted, we will spend $21.2 billion on behalf of financial services and general government operations. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that the American people have lost a great deal of trust, a great deal of trust, in our Federal Government, and part of that is the irresponsible way in which we spend the people's money. This is a small step, a small step forward in order to begin to regain that trust. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I am not certain that she recognizes that, in fact, AARP, which is the letter that she provided earlier for the record, in fact, AARP is in competition for health insurance policies with Medicare Advantage. That's the dirty little secret that nobody wants you to appreciate. 
   So when these letters are put in the Record, it may seem that there are wonderful endorsements out there for this program. However, in fact, that isn't the case. It isn't the case with the AARP letter that was provided, and it likely isn't the case with the letter that has been provided right here. 
   So I think it's incumbent upon all Members of this Chamber to appreciate where people stand, and where we stand is to make certain that Medicare recipients receive the Medicare policies that they currently have. Under Medicare Advantage, we believe that those individuals ought to be able to continue to receive those policies. 
   In fact, what the other side is trying to do is to cut Medicare. That's exactly what they are doing, is cutting Medicare. They are doing it under the guise of covering children. That's not we believe is appropriate. We believe that individuals ought to have the flexibility  and choices in their health care policies, in their Medicare policies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the conversation that just went on and the gentleman from Florida's amendment and his desire to modify his amendment because I think it brings out the point clearly that this is, in fact, a closed rule and should be recognized as such by our colleagues and by the American people. 
   This amendment I am offering, along with Representatives Capito and Campbell and Pearce, and I want to thank them for their leadership on this issue and urge my colleagues to look at this amendment carefully. This amendment would prevent illegal immigrants from owning or renting housing built by funds from the Affordable Housing Fund by requiring the adult occupants of that housing to establish their legal residency through the use of secure forms of identification. 
   Across the country, whether it is Denver, where in 2006 there was an estimated 20,000 illegal immigrants holding FHA-insured loans, or L.A., where banks have begun offering them credit cards, clear reform and oversight is necessary. 
   In some of these cases, like the FHA loans, the documents submitted with their applications to GSE are later proved to be false, resident alien numbers that have never been issued, Social Security numbers that belong to other people, and W-2 forms that are fabricated. 
   In the case of financial institutions, minimal documents are required by their regulators to establish a new customer's identity to open accounts, and then after a few short months pass, banks are giving these illegal immigrants credit cards. 
   So the current loopholes in Federal law are an invitation to illegal immigration, and we shouldn't reward those coming here illegally with the privilege of the services afforded to American citizens. This would clearly result in back-door amnesty. 
   Our amendment would require the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to ensure that any assistance provided from the Affordable Housing Fund should be for adults who are legal residents in the United States. Occupants of this housing may either use a foreign service or U.S. passport; a Citizenship and Immigration Services, CIS, photo ID card; or a Social Security card in conjunction with a State or Federal ID. These forms of identification are considered to be the most secure types of identification because they are harder to forge or to duplicate. They are all issued by a government agency which has more checks and balances against illegal immigrants, criminals, or terrorists from obtaining these documents. 
   The current regulations to establish a customer's identity do a disservice to the American people. And I am confident that greater clarification in this area will help stem the tide of illegal aliens, which has been promoted due to a lack of clarity on this issue. The Federal Government should not be operated under obscure parameters that do not serve our Nation. We can strengthen these regulations to help protect America. 
   The CBO estimates that over the period from 2008 to 2011 that the housing fund created by this bill will generate roughly $3 billion. This is not an insignificant amount of money, and that will be available to build new housing as a result of this legislation. 
   To the best of our ability, we must eliminate the ability of someone here illegally to use new taxes from hardworking Americans to ``buy a home.'' That is not leadership and it is the wrong incentive. 
   So I urge my colleagues to reject back-door amnesty for illegal immigrants and to support this commonsense amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concerns that have been voiced from the other side, but in fact, they are not legitimate concerns. We've heard a lot about the REAL ID Act. We're not debating the REAL ID Act. What we are debating is the requirement of specific pieces of identification in order to be eligible for these loans. 
   As the gentleman from New Mexico stated over and over, the Social Security card with photo identification works, a driver's license works, a passport works, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services works. So we are not debating the REAL ID Act. 
   We've heard from a couple of gentlemen on the other side of the aisle that this has already been adopted in the amendment that was accepted by the gentleman from Arkansas. And although we appreciate the magnanimous nature of the chairman, in fact, this is a significantly different amendment because it provides specificity to the documents that would be required. 
   If the chairman truly believes that the director or a regulatory body makes certain that individuals are here legally, then I would suggest that the gentleman look at the issue of the ability to gain access to credit from illegals in many areas across this Nation with banks that are indeed regulated. And they are regulated with the same kind of language that says that you ought not provide credit to individuals who are here illegally. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to appreciate and understand that greater clarification, greater specificity in the documents that ought to be required should be accepted. I think it's a commonsense amendment. I appreciate my colleagues for supporting it.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments of my good friend and colleague from Georgia about the previous amendment. I wasn't interested in revisiting it, but I was compelled to do so because of the obfuscation that I believe occurred. 
   The amendment, my amendment, states on line 9, page 1, that the personal identification shall be one of the following forms. ``One of the following forms.'' 
   The first item is Social Security card. The second item is in fact a driver's license with a State complying with REAL ID. And then there is an ``or'' between the two. An ``or'' means one of them. Not all of them. Not always in compliance with REAL ID. 
   Then it goes on to have the two small ii's on page 2, line 9, where it says a passport. 
   Then there is even a third way that you can do it. Line 12, page 2, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Documentation. 
   Lo and behold, it is just one of those, Mr. Chairman. It is not all of them. 
   So I would suggest that my good friend from Georgia be complete in his characterization of my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield to my good friend from Texas (Mr. Sessions).

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment which I believe enhances the oversight of the Director over the payments into the Affordable Housing Fund. 
   The underlying legislation takes the responsible step of providing criteria that the Director of the new regulatory agency should use to suspend contributions to the Affordable Housing Fund created by this bill, and that is a responsible step. However, I and others are concerned that this language doesn't go far enough to ensure the GSE safety and soundness, which indeed is the intent of this important legislation that we are dealing with today. 
   In the underlying legislation, if the Director finds that contributing to the Affordable Housing Fund would contribute to the instability of the GSE, would cause the GSE to become undercapitalized, or would prevent the GSE from successfully completing a capital restoration plan, then payments to the Housing Fund would be suspending. 
   I have three specific concerns. 
   First, nowhere in this language does this legislation provide an explicit requirement for the Director to actively seek out this information and to report on his or her findings. 
   Second, the language in this section doesn't explicitly list the safe and sound operation of the GSE as one of the factors that the Director should consider. 
   And, third, the Director does not consider the extent to which these payments into the Housing Trust Fund will result in an increase in costs to the borrowers under residential mortgages. 
   This amendment very simply would require the Director to study the additional factors that I just mentioned, safety and soundness, and increased costs to the borrowers. Along with those factors already in the text of the underlying bill, and to certify to Congress that they won't be adversely affected before the GSE makes a payment into the Housing Fund, it is imperative that we make certain that all of the hard work that went into creating this new world-class regulator in the underlying legislation isn't undone because of the mandatory payments the GSE will have to make into the Affordable Housing Fund. And we can do that by requiring the Director to look at all of these safety and soundness issues that might be affected, and to provide a responsible signoff requirement before payments are made into the Housing Fund. 
   I think this greatly improves the accountability and the success and the appropriateness of this bill, and I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this legislation because, at its core, its purpose is to punish thought; and to respectfully suggest that this new majority continues to bring sad and divisive legislation to the floor. 
   All violent crime is wrong. All violent crime is founded in hate. 
   This legislation will easily move us to the point of punishing thought and punishing motive. Hate crimes have already been used to suppress speech opposed by cultural elites. In New York, for example, city officials recently cited hate crime principles to force a pastor to remove billboards containing biblical quotations on sexual morality. 
   Many pastors and ministers from around this Nation adamantly oppose this legislation. And to bring this forward on the National Day of Prayer adds insult to injury and may, in fact, be hateful. 
   The hate crimes bill creates a new Federal thought crime. The bill requires law enforcement officials to probe, infer, or deduce if a crime occurred because of a bias towards a protected group. A criminal's thoughts will be considered an element of the crime. 
   Mr. Speaker, I respectfully suggest that one can never reliably determine the true thought or motive of a criminal. 
   And with thought crimes come thought police. What a sad day.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Delaware for allowing me to come and chat on a little different topic, a topic that we tried to bring to the floor today on this bill, and a topic that I think would truly expand and protect children in the Head Start program, but a topic that wasn't allowed to be brought to the floor because an amendment wasn't allowed. I think this issue truly demonstrates where the priorities of the majority party are. 
   This issue that I attempted to bring to the floor would have resulted in significantly greater safety for the children who are transported in Head Start programs. 
   In 1992, Mr. Chairman, Congress required the issuance of regulations that related to rear-door emergency exits and safety restraints on Head Start transportation. That was in 1992. Since the final rule for these new regulations was published, the effective date has been delayed three times. 
   Last week, buried deep in H.R. 1591, the emergency supplemental for Iraq, was language that delays these transportation safety requirements for Head Start programs once again. The fine print reveals that the rear emergency exit requirements are delayed for another year, and a seat belt safety requirement is delayed until another study is done. 
   Well, Congress required these regulations to ensure the safe operation of vehicles by Head Start agencies; and currently, the leading cause of death for children ages 3 to 7 is motor vehicle, traffic crashes. The reason why these transportation requirements were put forth is that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration does not approve of the use of vans or cars or vehicles of other types for the purpose of providing planned transportation services. School buses are the safest form of transportation because they include many special features. Further delaying these requirements means authorizing that Head Start grantees can transport children using vehicles that are not designed specifically for the purpose of the safe transportation of children. 
   My amendment, which wasn't allowed, would have ended this delay and make the regulations for emergency rear-door exits and seat belts on vehicles used to transport children effective immediately. 
   Mr. Chairman, as you know, on the first day of this Congress, children were paraded in front of the American people, and the new majority claimed that the House would come to order for the children. Well, today, if it is truly about the children, then the majority would have allowed this amendment to be entertained. Any further delays endangers lives of children. 
   So I suggest, Mr. Chairman, that the hypocrisy of this process is telling, and that if we truly are interested in making certain that our greatest resource, our children, the future of our Nation, are protected, then we would have allowed this amendment, and I am distressed it wasn't allowed. I encourage through the process the majority party make certain that we address this as this bill moves forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment. I would urge my colleagues to support it. This is an amendment of expansion and educational opportunities for our young children. 
   In 1965, when Head Start was implemented, State-run early childhood development programs didn't exist. Since then, and most recently, and in the past 15 years, States have invested considerable resources into early childhood initiatives. This amendment seeks to provide an incredible opportunity for eight States to participate in a 5-year demonstration program and leverage their resources and experience to improve school readiness. 
   It would allow eight States to coordinate Head Start and early childhood State-run programs, thus improving coordination, preventing duplication and expanding the number of children that can be served by the early childhood services. To carry it out, safeguards would be put in place. States would have to ensure that participants receive services that are as good or better than those in the Head Start program, including health, nutrition, mental health services on top of the educational services. 
   Enacting a demonstration program will result in expanding the number of children that can be served, which is not possible in Head Start or just a State-run program alone. This is an innovative program that would help more children in our Nation, and I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

This is not a block grant. This is a demonstration program that would allow States to serve more children, not fewer children, more, more than is currently possible than just with Head Start or with State-run early childhood development programs. 
   Economies of scale, it works. Funding levels for Head Start and early childhood services would be protected. Demonstration program States will be able to eliminate overlap, eliminate duplication of services, and participants must have access to services that are as extensive or greater than those found in Head Start. That's what the amendment states. 
   I urge my colleagues to read the amendment. I appreciate the fact that they have had previous amendments in legislation before them, but I urge them to read this amendment. I think they will find the common-sense aspect of it. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to offer it, and I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment.

I would argue that we need to prioritize appropriately in our Federal budget and provide much greater resources in the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health and the CDC and others that ultimately work and derive huge benefit to our entire society and, in fact, to the world. 
   But I commend my good friend from California for bringing this amendment forward because, although I may not have pulled out a couple of the items that he notes, for the life of me, I have a difficult time understanding and appreciating why on earth it would make any sense, and I would ask my good friend from Washington can you fathom how studying bison hunting on the Late Prehistoric Great Plains might have some effect on contemporary society that would make a difference with the compelling argument that you made regarding the study of cross-cultural emotions?

   And I appreciate the comments of my good friend from Washington, who said, and I think it got down correctly, ``We are neither trained nor have expertise in this area.'' And you are absolutely right. But consistency is a wonderful thing and inconsistency is a challenge.     
   I would suggest that none of us are pure in this area, but my good friend talks about we ought to delegate decisionmaking to authorities who have expertise, and we should. As a physician, I am compelled and have strong affinity for all of the advocacy groups that come to my office, as I know they come to yours, and advocate on behalf of specific diseases. Most recently this week, the folks who have suffered under the scourge of breast cancer have come, and they are asking for more resources. And I always suggest to them that it is appropriate for those decisions to be made by individuals at the National Science Foundation, at the CDC, at the National Institutes of Health. But, in fact, what my good friend from Washington does all the time, in his capacity in Congress, is to determine exactly what that line item ought to be from an appropriations standpoint. 
   As a physician, the medical profession has suffered under the decisions that have been made in this Chamber and in the Chamber on the other side of this building because individuals thought they had greater expertise in the area of health care. And as my good friend from New Jersey clearly stated, and appropriately stated, that just this week we've been dealing with folks who believe they have greater expertise in the area of military competence and battles than our generals on the ground. 
   So I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that my good friend from Washington is absolutely correct, that we ought to delegate in certain instances, but we ought to also utilize the prerogative that we have and the responsibility that we have as representatives in this body, representatives of our districts, and make certain that we are good stewards of the taxpayers' money.

   Mr. Chairman, the angst most recently demonstrated is curious in light of the events of recent history regarding what this House has dealt with over the past week or two or three, and a little longer history in light of what this House and what this Congress deals with over and over and over again; and that is not the kind of appropriate kind of decisionmaking that my good friend from Washington so passionately advocates here in this bill, which is to delegate appropriate decisionmaking to people who have the expertise and have the knowledge to determine where those resources ought be spent and where those decisions ought be made. 
   Would that we as a Congress and we as a House use that same brilliance in our decisionmaking when we make decisions regarding health care. Again, as a physician, this Chamber makes incredible decisions that affect the very personal health care of individuals about which it has no knowledge whatsoever, and takes the decisionmaking authority from physicians and patients in an inappropriate way, I believe.  
   We also this past week determined as a Chamber, the majority party has determined that they have greater knowledge about the specific military activities that ought to occur on the ground as it relates to our brave men and women who are fighting to defend our liberty and our freedom. However, the majority party apparently believes that it is appropriate for them to make specific decisions what our commanders ought to be doing on a day-to-day basis. 
   So I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that it would be appropriate to have some consistency in the arguments that are being brought to the floor here this evening regarding delegation of appropriate decisionmaking to those who have the expertise. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I know the hour is late and we are drawing to a close on this, and I think this is an appropriate amendment upon which to end for this is the amendment that allows us as a Congress to say, yes, indeed, we believe that fiscal responsibility is important. 
   As you know, Mr. Chairman, this bill, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act, authorizes $20.973 billion, nearly $21 billion, over 3 years and creates five new Federal programs. The National Science Foundation Authorization Act establishes a pilot program of 1-year seed grants for new investigators to help improve funding rates for young investigators and to stimulate higher-risk research. It encourages the NSF to foster relationships between academia and industry in order to spawn U.S. competitiveness and furthers the Agency's traditions of education in science, technology, engineering, and math. 
   The NSF has a mission to achieve excellence in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education at all levels and all settings from kindergarten through postdoctoral training, from classrooms to science museums and online resources, having done so for the last half century. And while what this bill does is extremely important, equally important is this amendment that will apply the principle of pay as you go to any new spending authorized by this legislation by requiring that any new spending have a specific offset. 
   The amendment provides that no authorization of appropriations made by this Act that results in costs to the Federal Government shall be effective unless there are decreases in spending elsewhere in the Federal Government. 
   Mr. Chairman, common sense dictates that that is what we should do. Not only common sense, but previous promises by this new majority. An excerpt of ``A New Direction for America,'' which was proposed by House Democrats in the 109th Congress as their plan for the majority, it reads: ``Our New Direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting, no more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' 
   Well, hear, hear, Mr. Chairman. I heartily agree. But on April 18, Majority Leader Hoyer was quoted in Roll Call as saying, ``We want to get the budget deficit under control. We have said that fiscal responsibility was necessary, but we're not going to be hoisted on the torrent of fiscal responsibility.'' 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, Americans all across this Nation are being shaken down by a ``torrent'' of fiscal irresponsibility.  
   I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, the rules are not rules if you only follow them when you want to. The Democrats promised pay-as-you-go rules for everything. Instead, they are picking and choosing, picking and choosing when to do so. At home, we call that breaking a rule and breaking a promise. 
   So while what this bill does is extremely important, $20.973 billion is a considerable amount of money even here in Washington, and it is equally important that we are good stewards of the hard-earned money of the American people. We should not limit our talk about fiscal responsibility only when it is politically convenient. 
   So I urge the new majority to rededicate itself to the principle of pay-as-you-go spending. Fiscal responsibility shouldn't be something that is just talked about only on the campaign trail. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this commonsense, fiscally responsible, pay-as-you-go amendment.

   The role of the Official Truth Squad is to attempt to try to bring some honesty and factual information to the floor of the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, as you well know, oftentimes that is difficult to find. Today was no exception on the floor of the House as we tried to, through the debate we had, make sure that facts were being presented and information was reliable upon which people make their decisions was being presented. 
   I am honored by the leadership on the Republican side of the aisle to come to the floor tonight and share with the American people and talk about issues that are of great concern, some of which have been dealt with as recently as today. 
   On the Official Truth Squad, we have a favorite quote which comes from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was a United States Senator from New York. He said, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they are not entitled to their own facts.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, no place could that ring more true than right here in the halls of Congress. We get a lot of opportunity to observe process here. We talk about process a lot. We talk about rules a lot. Many people say, what difference does that make? What difference do the rules make? And a lot of people, many people, say, on my side, say you don't want to talk about process. It is difficult for the American people to understand or appreciate. 
   But what process does in a democratic institution, and this being the finest democratic institution in the world, the people's House, what process does is allow all voices to be heard and allow all points of view to be heard. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, if you think about it and if my friends on both sides of the aisle would think about it, we all appreciate that we don't have Republican challenges or Republican problems or Democrat problems or Democrat challenges. We have American challenges, American challenges that are best solved when we all work together and come up with the best and most correct solution for our Nation. 
   But, sadly, Mr. Speaker, we haven't had much of that with this new Congress. That is, the opportunity to have input into the process. Again, the reason that the process is so important, because if you lock people out of the ability to have input into the process, then what happens, the individuals, the citizens, the American citizens that those people represent, those people who are locked out of the process, those American citizens are without a voice. They don't have a voice in the process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that is not only unfair, it is undemocratic, and so I would respectfully suggest to my friends on the other side of the aisle that they ought to look at the rules that they have adopted and they ought to look at the process that they have gone through for these first 3 or 4 weeks that we have been in Congress and try to be true to their principles, or their stated principles, and make certain that all folks are able to be involved in the process. Because it makes a difference. It does indeed make a difference. 
   Today, we took up on the floor of the House what was called a continuing resolution. It was, in fact, an omnibus bill. It was a spending bill. 
   The last Congress, the one that was in place prior to the beginning of this month, the House did its job from a financial standpoint relatively efficiently. We passed all of our spending bills, appropriations bills, to try to figure out how to spend the hard-earned money from the taxpayer. We got our business done pretty quickly. 
   The bills that we sent over to the Senate sat there and sat there and sat there. Consequently, what happened  was we came to the end of 2006 and there was no agreement between the Senate and the House about those appropriations bills. So what we passed was a continuing resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the continuing resolution that we passed, which was truly a continuing resolution, which just meant that you continued to spend the same amount of money in the programs that were in place in the Federal Government; and to do that it doesn't take much language. In fact, the bill was two short pages. If you had a little larger page, it would be one page. Because all it says in legal terms is we will continue to spend the amount of money that we spent last year. That bill runs the government spending through February 15. 
   So something else had to be done; and the other side said, we will do a continuing resolution. We will continue spending money at the same rate on the same programs because their committees haven't got up and running. They cannot figure out exactly what the process ought to be to allow people to have input into it, so we will just have a continuing resolution. So they presented their, quote, continuing resolution. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that continuing resolution I have here, this H.J. Res, is 137 pages long. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is a fact. It is not an opinion, that is a fact. 
   Now the continuing resolution that could continue the spending for our Nation, responsible spending at the lowest possible level given the amount of spending that has occurred over the past number of months of this fiscal year, could just be continued with a two-page resolution that says, yes, indeed, we will continue that spending. 
   In fact, what the majority party has done is passed a 137-page omnibus bill. It is not a continuing resolution in spite of what they say. The reason that is important is the process was not in place to allow input by almost anybody. Not just Republicans, but Democrats as well, and certainly freshmen Democrats, had no input into the process. 
   What is in this bill is all sorts of special spending, picking winners and losers and rewarding friends in this bill that the other side, the Democrat majority side, says is just a continuing resolution. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, we have some principles on our side, and one of them is that no process deserves more public scrutiny than the way in which the hard-earned taxpayer money is spent. No process deserves more scrutiny than the way in which hard-earned taxpayer money is spent. 
   In fact, what happened today is the spending or the concurrence by the House of Representatives, the vast majority of them being Democrat, that we would spend $463 billion, that is with a ``B'', Mr. Speaker, $463 billion on the omnibus bill that they have presented. 
   And there are so many things that we would like to talk about tonight that relate to process and to policy, and I am pleased to be joined by good friends who will highlight some of those items. 
   A member of the Official Truth Squad, a Member who brings highlight and honesty to our deliberations joins me this evening, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn). I appreciate your being with us, and I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you so much. I appreciate your perspective and your insight and your wonderful words about accountability, because that is really what it is all about, Mr. Speaker. It is about accountability. It is about holding people here in this House accountable for what they said they were going to do. 
   Elections are wonderful things. Every 2 years, the American people get to go to the polls and they get to say we like how things are going and we want to support that or we think there ought to be a change. In November of last year, the American people voted for change, but I do not believe, as I know my good friend from Tennessee does not believe, that the American people voted for higher spending or greater deficits, which is what the Democrat majority in the House of Representatives today adopted. 
   I do know also that they did not vote to decrease money for our armed services, for our military men and women who are working as hard as they can, day and night, to make certain they keep us safe. In fact, what they have done indeed with this bill that was adopted today is to decrease the amount of revenue available for our fighting men and women and especially the base realignment and closure which is what gives the efficiency to the system. 
   Nobody knows about that better than the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee than my good friend from California, the honorable DUNCAN HUNTER, and I appreciate so much his taking part in this hour this evening. I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight a statement in a letter from the Office of Management and Budget from the Executive Office of the President about these BRAC closings, because I think that it highlights one of the very egregious activities that occurred in passing this omnibus, this appropriations bill, that the Democrat majority did today. 
   It says, quote, the President's budget requested $5.6 billion to implement the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. 
   That is something that all of us had voted on here on the floor of the House. 
   The administration strongly opposes the committee's reduction of $3.1 billion from the President's request. 
   Remember, this is $3.1 billion cut out of a $5.6 billion appropriation. 
   This will, quote, significantly delay BRAC implementation, increase the risk that the Department of Defense would not meet its statutory deadline to implement BRAC, reduce BRAC savings, delay or postpone scheduled redeployments of military personnel. 
   Did you hear that? Delay or postpone scheduled redeployments of military personnel and their overseas stations to the United States and negatively impact many specific plans in response to BRAC. 
   So, in addition to the challenges and the difficulties that we have in trying to make certain that our men and women have anything at their resource to be able to fight this global war on terror, I doubt that anybody on the other side of the aisle, when they ran for office last November, said, boy, I sure want to cut the military's budget as they fight the global war on terror. I doubt that happened, but, in fact, that is exactly what happened on the floor of the House today. 
   What we are here to do today, as The Official Truth Squad, is to make certain that we hold people accountable. There are people watching. There are people listening. The American people know that there are two different philosophies of how government ought to work. We have a philosophy that it ought to be efficient, that it ought to be as small as possible, that it ought to respect individuals, that it ought to strongly support the global war on terror in our military. 
   Our good friends on the other side of the aisle oftentimes talk like that. But when it gets right down to votes, that is not how they vote. We are here today to bring some facts to the issue and some accountability. 
   I am so pleased to be joined by my good friend from Texas, who was past budget chairman for the Republican Study Committee during the last term and this year has assumed the helm of the Chair of the Republican Study Committee, I think one of the finest groups of individuals in this Congress, the individuals who are as concerned as anybody that I know about economic responsibility, financial responsibility, and accountability for this Congress. 
   I thank you for joining us this evening and look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman from Texas so much for his wonderful cogent comments. And talking about the individuals on the other side of the aisle, who have indeed said one thing and then come here and done another, one would think that they are beginning to foster a culture of hypocrisy. That kind of has a little ring to it that rings true on the other side of the aisle. 
   I do want to thank you as well for your comments about tax revenue. Sometimes a picture tells a better story than words, although your words were cogent and so appropriate. 
   But this graph helps me understand the benefits of tax decreases, Mr. Speaker. When you decrease taxes, which is what we did here in Congress in 2001 and 2003, this line here is revenue to the Federal Government and what happened was that the revenue was going down, but we decreased taxes appropriately, as the gentleman from Texas said, and what happens is that the revenue goes up. The Federal Government, in fact, gets more revenue because there is more economic activity, more economic vitality. 
   We have touched on so many things tonight. My good friend from Virginia has joined us. We are running a little short on time, but I do want to make certain that you get an opportunity to join us for the Official Truth Squad and make some comments possibly about BRAC. 
   My good friend from Virginia, Thelma Drake, is just so wonderfully active here in Congress and so cogent and appropriate on issues of the military, representing the military installations in southeast Virginia. 
   So I welcome you and look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you ever so much, Congresswoman Drake. We appreciate your heartfelt words and the message from your constituent and that perspective on what truly is a portion of this global war on terror. The incredible importance of making certain that we as a Congress and we as a people support our men and women at every turn. So I thank you very, very much. 
   And that highlights what happened today on this floor about the appropriations bill, the omnibus bill, that the other side of the aisle, the Democrat majority, passed. And, in fact, what they have done is made it more difficult for our military to function. We have heard a letter from a lieutenant general in the Army about that. We heard from our own administration about that, about how it makes it more difficult. And we heard from our good friend from Texas about the Olympics award that the Democrats won today by spending more money in 1 hour than any Congress in the history of the Nation. And, again, it would be humorous if it weren't so serious, Mr. Speaker. It would be humorous if it weren't so serious. 
   And I am so pleased to be joined by a good friend from Florida, Congressman Mica, who has some interesting perspective on what went on here today on the floor of the House. 
   I appreciate your coming and bringing some accountability to what occurred today.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida. I appreciate so much his emotion and his passion and his perspective. 
   As you are living through these times, it is oftentimes difficult to get people to pay attention to what truly are historic occurrences, and I share with you that disappointment and sadness. I truly do. 
   Having served in a legislative body at the State level and seeing how bipartisanship can work and seeing how democracy truly is supposed to work, this has been a disappointing month. It has been a disappointing month, because most of what you can talk about in terms of getting your arms around where the problem is is process. I talked about that at the beginning of this hour, Mr. Speaker, and I mention that the reason that process is so important is because that is what enables the minority to have participation. But not just the minority. It enables every single Member of this House of Representatives. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, every single Member represents approximately the same number of people. We go to great pains to make certain that districts are basically of equal size every 10 years through the census process and through redistricting; and we do that because each individual in this body, each Member of this body, represents basically the same number of people and therefore should have essentially the same say in the process and in the deliberation. 
   Some folks have called this month the death of deliberation, and that truly has been. That is disappointing. That is very saddening for all of us whose constituents, whose American citizen constituents who go to the polls and vote, do indeed express their will to us. 
   If we are unable to express their will through this process here, then they are muted, they are silenced, they are disenfranchised; and that, Mr. Speaker, I would suggest is an unfair process, is a wrong process and is an undemocratic process. It doesn't have to be that way. 
   So I encourage my good friends on the other side of the aisle, and I know some of them are feeling pained by some of the decisions that their leadership has made over this past month, and I encourage them to continue to work for a process that will allow for the inclusion of all. 
   Because, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. Speaker, we do not have Republican challenges or Democrat challenges, we have American challenges. The American people send us here to take care of those challenges and put forward the best solutions, and the best solutions come when all of us are involved in that process. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in a very positive way as we move forward and do what is best and what is right on behalf of the American people. 
   I want to thank my leadership once again for the opportunity to spend this hour on the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much for the time and for her charity and her leadership on this issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening with a whirlwind of senses and emotions. I am disappointed. I am disappointed by the emptiness and the hypocrisy of this resolution. 
   Our men and women in the field, valiantly serving to protect our freedom, they deserve more than this. They deserve a real debate that honors the job that they are doing. 
   Instead, what we have this week is a resolution that is eight short lines, eight lines, that in their entirety stab at the motives and undermine the difficult work that our patriot military is doing. I am so disappointed in a majority party that has no more respect for our military than that. 
   This debate has been called historic, and historic it is. It is historic in its hypocrisy. If you truly believe that this is not winnable with what has been proposed, then it is incumbent upon you to do everything that you can do to stop it and stop it now. Doing anything less belies your duty and your responsibility. 
   This resolution says we support you but we are going to hang you out to dry, and this from the folks who say they want a new direction. What a disgrace to the integrity of this body. How disappointing. 
   I am saddened. I am saddened by the apparent fact that everything done by the majority is absolutely political, all form, no substance. Is there nothing above politics? Surely the defense of our Nation and the preservation of freedom should be above politics. 
   How did a once proud party, the party of FDR, who said, ``We have nothing to fear but fear itself,'' and the party of JFK, who said, ``Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty,'' how did a once proud party drop to such a depth? How very sad. 
   I am astounded by the seeming lack of desire to study and to call upon historical events for a basis upon which to develop policy. America is a great and a good Nation, and we are great and good because we have been blessed to have been led by men and women who until now did their level best to utilize all the information available. 
   I urge my colleagues to be true to the oath that we took just a few weeks ago. Don't you remember, we stood right here and said, ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic?'' All enemies, foreign and domestic. 
   What is a glimpse of the recent history of our current enemy? 1983, a truck bomb kills 241 Marines in their barracks in Beirut; 1993, six killed in the first World Trade Center bombing; 2000, al Qaeda's attack on the destroyer USS Cole, killing 17 American sailors; and then September 11, 2001, al Qaeda's hijackers fly planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, while passengers on a fourth plane bring it to a crash landing in Pennsylvania, total number killed, 2,973. 
   Since then, there have been attacks in England and Spain and elsewhere, and just last summer, Scotland Yard in Britain arrested a couple who planned to destroy 10 civilian planes over the Atlantic. They were going to use their 8-month-old baby to disguise the bomb material as baby food. We as a Nation are ill-prepared for the ferocity and the hatred of people who will kill their own baby in order to get a chance to kill us. 
   American public policy failed to grasp the scope of the threat posed by radical Islam until September 11, 2001. On September 11, we reaped the consequences of decades of inaction against the very real threat posed by militant Islam. 
   These are extremely challenging times. Some would credibly suggest that these are more difficult times than we have faced since World War II, with the demographics of our society, the changing nature of the world and globalization and the nature of our competitors, all overshadowed by the nature of our avowed enemy, those who have publicly stated their goal to see the end of the Western world and America and who are working to secure the means to accomplish that goal. 
   I am perplexed. I am perplexed by the apparent inability of many in Congress to grasp this fundamental fact. We are currently facing an enemy who is calculating, patient, indiscriminate and murderous, an enemy actively waging war against us. 
   That is not just an opinion. That is not just my opinion. That is their stated purpose and fact. 
   In their own words, Osama bin Laden said, ``Hostility toward America is a religious duty, and we hope to be rewarded for it by God ..... I am confident that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that is America.'' 
   Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman said, ``Oh, you Muslims everywhere, sever the ties of their Nation, tear them apart, ruin their economy, instigate against their corporations, destroy their embassies, attack their interests, sink their ships, and shoot down their airplanes. Kill them in land, at sea, and in the air, kill them wherever you find them.'' 
   So the impact of this resolution, Mr. Speaker, is to give aid and comfort to the enemy and to dishearten our own military. 
   In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on January 23, General David Petraeus, now commanding officer in Iraq, agreed that a resolution of disapproval for this new strategy would ``give the enemy encouragement.''  
   What are the consequences of failure? The consequences of failure would be catastrophic to the region, to the United States, and yes, to the world. The consequence of the next step of this majority party plan is defeat. They may say it is inevitable or unavoidable, but it is, nonetheless, a strategy for defeat. 
   What message does that send to our allies around the world? What will the Chinese think of our commitment to Taiwan? Will the North Korean, the Iranians, the Syrians, the Venezuelans, will they be more cautious or will they be bolder after an American defeat? 
   It is inconceivable to me how a remarkably weakened United States in the eyes of the world is a good thing for us or will result in a less emboldened Iran or North Korea or al Qaeda. The consequences of failure are clearly unacceptable. 
   So I am disappointed, I am saddened, I am astounded and I am perplexed, but I am also enthusiastic and I am optimistic, Mr. Speaker. I am enthusiastic in my support of our valiant men and women who defend our freedom day in and day out, and I am optimistic because I believe so strongly in the United States and in her people, and I am optimistic because I am certain that they will appreciate and recognize the consequences of this debate and the remarkable differences in our approach and our desire to defend America. 
   Thomas Paine said, ``He that would make his own liberty secure, must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach to himself.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, let us honor our troops. Let us honor all who work for freedom on our behalf. Let us work together for liberty. Let us recall and recommit ourselves to our oath and our duty to defend our blessed Nation. It is that action, and that action alone, with the grace of God, that will ensure the wonder and the survival of our great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, America, the State of Georgia and this House of Representatives have lost a great public servant, an uncommon leader, and a proud patriot. 
   I am profoundly saddened by the passing of Congressman Charlie Norwood, a gentleman who selflessly served the people of Georgia and this House for more than 12 years. 
   Charlie spent his entire life helping others as a soldier, as a dentist, as a legislator. He served valiantly in the defense of our Nation in the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam. He returned home to serve his community in Augusta as a dentist. And for 12 years, he was a faithful servant to the people of Georgia in his district as a Member of Congress. 
   In Congress he was a passionate supporter of our military and of our veterans. He was a tireless advocate for patients and patient centered health reform. And he never forgot for whom he was to work in Washington, his constituents. 
   Congressman Norwood was a dear friend to me. His friendship and his perspective and his guidance in this House are things that I will always cherish. Anyone who knew Charlie knew that he was as tough as they come and he always stood up for what he believed in. Rarely, rarely in any walk of life are we privileged to come to know someone who stood for his principles as strongly as Charlie Norwood. His legacy in the House of Representatives will be one of integrity, one of vigor, and one of loyalty. 
   Congressman Norwood's devotion to this body and to our country will be sorely missed, but his legacy will never be forgotten. And I shall never forget that wry smile and that twinkle in his eye. What a hero. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues in expressing our deepest sympathies to Charlie's wife Gloria, his family and his friends.     
   And while we mourn the loss of this great patriot, we celebrate his lifetime  of noble and heroic service and we thank God for giving us the gift of the life of Charlie Norwood.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleague from Georgia in support of this legislation. This legislation is simple and direct, and as my colleague stated, is necessary. It is basically a technical correction for the Presidential $1 Coin Act enacted in December 2005. That bill sought to use the mechanism of a regularly changed design on the $1 coin to draw that coin into circulation, and it had specific language directing that retail operations on Federal property, including vending machines, accept and dispense $1 coins. It makes sense since the coin is an official form of U.S. exchange, and not to handle the coin would be inappropriate. 
   But certain vending machines, such as soda machines, only accept change and bank notes of no greater value than $1. Logically, there would be no reason for these machines to dispense a $1 coin. To convert them to do so and to stock them with a stack of coins that never would be dispensed clearly would be unnecessary and not intended by the original bill. 
   Worse, as my friend from Georgia mentioned, oftentimes that cost for doing so would fall on our servicemen and women. So there really is no point to this change that was mandated, and we can easily fix that today. 
   Mr. Speaker, the language of this bill exempts solely those $1 vending machines from the requirement to dispense $1 coins. I urge all Members to support this bill, and I commend my colleague from Georgia for bringing this bill to the House floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership and for yielding. 
   As a physician, I recognize clearly the imperative of all having health insurance, and I strongly support providing low-income kids with greater access to health care coverage, which is why I support a positive bipartisan reauthorization of SCHIP. 
   The problem is that's not what this bill is, and today, we're debating a 2-week delay. Now, there's no reason for a delay. It delays solving the problem, and it delays providing health care to some needy youngsters. 
   But I welcome this time because it gives Americans more time to realize this is all about politics. It gives Americans more time to realize that the bill is paid for with 22 million new smokers. It gives the American people more time to realize that the bill covers kids in higher-income families before lower-income families. It gives the American people the opportunity to understand the irresponsible and cynical nature of this bill. 
   We're sent here to solve challenges, Madam Speaker, and I call on my colleagues to work positively together now. Let's cover kids most in need now. Vote ``no'' on the postponement now.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND SELF-DETERMINATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer this commonsense amendment to H.R. 2786. 
   This bill, as you know, would reauthorize the Native American and Native Hawaiian Block Grant programs, and the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, estimates that appropriation of the amounts necessary to implement this bill will cost approximately $2.2 billion over the 2008-2012 period of this reauthorization. 
   This bill originally was authorized, or passed, in 1996 and then reauthorized in 2002, and the reorganization of the system of Federal housing assistance to Native Americans was accomplished by eliminating several separate programs of assistance and replacing them with a single block grant program. 
   In addition to simplifying the process of providing housing assistance, the purpose of this is to provide Federal assistance for Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the right of Indian self-determination and tribal self-governance. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, equally as important I would suggest is fiscal responsibility. We've all come back from a month in our districts, working and listening to our constituents, and I heard repeatedly from my constituents that they continue to appeal to us to be more fiscally responsible. Many of my colleagues on our side of the aisle have attempted to offer amendments and bring about that kind of fiscal responsibility. This is another one of those amendments. 
   This amendment will not prohibit funds from being spent on this program, but it will protect taxpayers by applying the principle of pay-as-you-go to the spending that's authorized by this legislation by requiring that any new spending as a result of this legislation must have a specific offset before the legislation can take effect. 
   Now, if there is to be a taxpayer subsidy, as good stewards of the American hard-earned taxpayer money, we should provide a specific spending decrease to offset any new spending that would be required by this legislation. 
   To be sure, this is important legislation, and I want to commend Congressman Pearce for his hard work on the legislation, ensuring its consideration on the floor. It's a testament to his hard work that he does every day for his constituents back home. 
   But fiscal responsibility isn't something that we ought to just trump out during campaigns. We heard a lot about it during the last campaign; but I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that it is way past time that we act in this responsible manner. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment for PAYGO for authorization of the appropriations that will come as a result of this bill, and I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Iowa and I appreciate his support. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the vigor with which the other side opposes this amendment, because I think it sets up a clear distinction. The vigor and the enthusiasm with which they oppose responsible spending is clear. It's clear to us. It will be made clear to the American people repeatedly over the next number of months, and then the American people will decide. 
   The enthusiasm that the gentleman has voiced in opposition to this, which clearly states that if any new spending, any increase in spending occurs because of this bill, then there must be offsets elsewhere. The gentleman clearly knows, the gentleman clearly knows the rules are germane. This requires that that's the way this be written, clearly. 
   We can start at this point being fiscally responsible, or we can never start. But it's clear that what we desire and my colleagues desire to do is to begin that fiscally responsible move now and support this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, as you know, this bill, the Water Quality Investment Act of 2007, would reauthorize an expired Federal program that provides grants to States for the purpose of providing money to a municipality or municipalities for planning, designing and construction of treatment works for combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows. 
   This bill authorizes, at least did prior to the last amendment, $1.8 billion in Federal grants. And while this bill is important, equally important is that my amendment will apply the principle of pay-as-you-go, something that we have heard a lot talked about here by the new majority. 
   Any new spending authorized in this bill would be required to be offset by a specific amount to make it so that there would be no increase in Federal spending. 
   Simply, the amendment provides that no authorization of appropriations made by this act that results in costs to the Federal Government shall be effective, except to the extent that the act provides for equal decreases in spending somewhere else in the Federal Government. 
   An excerpt from the ``New Direction for America,'' which was proposed by the now majority party last year when they were running for the majority, said, ``Our new direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting. No more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, that sounds great, and I agree with that. My concern is what we may have here is another example of Orwellian democracy where just because you say something means it is so. But, Mr. Chairman, rules aren't rules if you only follow them when you want to. 
   So this is a matter of principle. It is a matter of accountability. My amendment is very simple and would provide that no additional spending would be undertaken unless it were offset elsewhere. 
   I would urge my colleagues to adopt this sensible PAYGO amendment to this Water Quality Investment Act of 2007.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Well, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I appreciate the passion that this has resulted in on the other side. 
   I want to make it very clear, this is an important bill. There is no doubt about it. I have municipalities, cities that are certainly in need of assistance. But it is also important that we make certain that we prioritize here in Washington how we spend hard-earned taxpayer money. And if we are not going to start on that road now, when are we going to start? 
   We have heard a lot about fiscal responsibility from your side of the aisle. We heard a lot last year. We have heard a lot of promises. But what, in fact, has happened is that so much of the spending that we do here in Washington doesn't come under this umbrella of PAYGO that has been adopted by the House. 
   In fact, I would venture to say that the press releases that were released by my good friends when they adopted PAYGO didn't have any fine print in it that said, oh, by the way, it doesn't apply to discretionary spending. So PAYGO isn't PAYGO unless it is PAYGO for everybody; come one, come all. 
   So I would respectfully suggest that my good friends ought to, in the spirit of true fiscal responsibility, ought to support this amendment, and we can  move forward arm in arm and make certain that we are spending the hard-earned taxpayers' money of America wisely.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his simple motion to recommit. 
   This really is a simple motion to recommit. What it says is that the money that is authorized and appropriated should go for its intended purposes. It would expand upon existing law by specifically prohibiting Federal funds from being used to pay for membership in any association or organization. It is important to make clear that the funds should only be used for the purposes intended by Congress, mainly the construction of facilities and infrastructure to treat combined sewer overflows. 
   Now, while associations and organizations can sometimes provide very meaningful opportunities for collaboration and knowledge dissemination, it would not be appropriate to use scarce, hard-earned Federal taxpayer dollars to pay for membership in such associations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know if my colleagues are aware of this, but some of these dues in these associations and organizations run up to $48,000 to $50,000 a year. Certainly, hard-earned taxpayer money should not go for that purpose. So, in the spirit of responsible spending and to decrease the abuse of hard-earned taxpayer dollars, I urge the adoption of this motion to recommit.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment that I will offer to this piece of legislation. I was going to attempt to refrain from further comment on the legislation, but I think that some light needs to be shed on the discussion that has been going on here. 
   Equal pay for equal work is the law of the land. It is the law of the land. It has been for 45 years. What our friends on the other side want to do, and some of them have been very candid in coming down to the well and commenting about it, and that is to open up a huge opportunity for one of their grand friends, group of friends, the trial lawyers. 
   Now, let's be honest about this. I have here the bill that we are going to vote on, H.R. 1338, and you could go to any page but I will just pick a couple. 
   Page 10, lines 17 and 18. Be liable for such compensatory damages or punitive damages as may be appropriate. 
   Page 11, line 3. Except with respect to class actions. 
   Page 11, line 7. Any action brought to enforce. 
   Page 11, lines 13 and 14. In any action brought to recover the liability prescribed. 
   Page 11, line 17. Including expert fees. 
   Page 11, line 23. Additional compensatory or punitive damages. 
   Page 12, lines 2 and 3. Or such compensatory or punitive damages as appropriate. 
   Page 12, lines 6 and 7. Additional compensatory damages or punitive damages. 
   Page 12, lines 18 and 19. In the case of a class action suit brought to enforce section 60. 
   And it goes on and on and on. 
   Mr. Chairman, this issue isn't about equal pay for equal work. Equal pay for equal work is the law of the land. There isn't a single American Representative in this Chamber--I was going to say there probably isn't a single American, but I won't speak for them. But there is not a single Representative in this Chamber who believes that there ought to be unequal pay for equal work. Nobody. That is not what we are debating here. 
   We are debating whether this majority party, whether this Democrat majority party is once again going to bring a bill to the floor and reward their cronies in the trial bar. That is what it is. That is what it is. Take a peek at the bill. Line after line and line. That is what it is all about. 
   So for those of us who love our mothers and love our daughters and love our sisters, and have grandmothers and great-grandmothers who were remarkably successful in the work that they did, please don't be misunderstood; we believe strongly in equal pay for equal work. We believe strongly that this Nation stands on the principle of equal pay for equal work. 
   What we don't believe is that the trial bar ought to be the ones deciding what the pay ought to be in a private business. What we don't believe is that the Federal Government ought to insert itself into every single aspect of every single life of every single contract in this Nation. Should we do that, then we will destroy the greatest nation on the face of the earth. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill isn't about equal pay for equal work. Equal pay for equal work is the law of the land. We all support equal pay for equal work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes implementation of the new wage discrimination provisions in this bill contingent upon a study that demonstrates that these provisions do not hinder recruiting and hiring. 
   Equal pay for equal work, as has been mentioned multiple times today, is the law of the land. It is now and it has been since the passage of the Equal Pay Act in 1963. And generally, businesses do a tremendous job paying employees fairly, regardless of gender. 
   But the plan before the House today treats wage discrimination as systemic. Consequently, the conclusion of the majority party is to take this measure and turn power over to bureaucrats and to trial lawyers to interject, distort and oversee how wages are determined through lawsuits and regulations. If this happens, employment opportunities may actually become more limited, and flexible job structures may become more scarce or a thing of the past. In short, the very real problem that this legislation attempts to correct may, in fact, exacerbate others, very real challenges, already facing American workers. 
   With these reforms, there would be less incentive for employers to offer a variety of working situations like flex time or more limited travel if doing so puts an employer at risk of being sued, and this bill would do that. 
   Such rigidity and limitations means increased expenses for employers. Current and prospective workers then suffer through lower wages and slower job creation, or simply fewer opportunities to meet individual workers needs. Overall, it may prove to be a drag on the economy by adding additional friction to labor markets. 
   This amendment calls on the Secretary of Labor to study the impact of these new wage discrimination provisions on the ability of employers to recruit and hire employees, regardless of gender. 
   A strong contention, I believe, can be made that these changes will have a detrimental effect on labor markets, increased lawsuits, unlimited damages may discourage hiring and perhaps further segregate employment preferences for one gender in favor of another. 
   In order to determine this, the Secretary should have time to quantify and evaluate the bill's impact on recruitment and hiring decisions. This is information that everyone should want, I believe, in this House, prior to voting on an implementation of this bill. If there is no harm to job creation, then these provisions would go forward. 
   All that this amendment is asking is 90 days for the Secretary to undertake an informed review. The impetus for this bill's passage shouldn't rest on faulty comparisons of male and female median annual earnings that do not take into account all sorts of things, such as education or experience or occupation. 
   Mr. Chairman, equal pay for equal work is already the law of the land. The revisions before us today are a departure from this standard, and may radically alter how labor markets work through increased litigation and regulation. If that happens, it is best for all of us to have a clear understanding of its impact beforehand. 
   I urge adoption of the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would like to put into the Record an article from Independent Women's forum talking about just that. 
   As such, I believe that a study is indeed appropriate. That is all that the amendment does, requests a study, 90-day study, and then report back and move forward if there is no evidence of difficulty in hiring and recruitment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, equal pay for equal work is currently the law of the land, and it has been since the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. Generally, businesses do a tremendous job paying employees fairly, regardless of gender. But the bill before the House today treats wage discrimination as systemic, and is a boon for trial lawyers. It also fails to address the very real challenges affecting Americans' wages and the purchasing power of their paychecks. That is why we Republicans are offering this motion to recommit, in order to expose the errors of this Democrat majority. 
   The first half of this motion points out the simple fact wages are being stretched thin by the price of gasoline, and this Democrat majority has repeatedly failed to take action. The  high price of gasoline is squeezing family budgets, and no one is being hit harder than working women and families. Yet, this Congress has yet to cast a vote during this energy emergency to expand exploration and production of American-made energy. 
   Republicans have a plan to increase production and open up access, to provide tax credits to promote clean and reliable sources of energy, and encourage conservation to ease the demand for gasoline. With this productive plan, a positive plan to open up access, provide tax credits, to promote clean and reliable sources of energy, and encourage conservation to ease demand, roadblock after roadblock has been erected in this Congress. 
   Exploration and development of the Outer Continental Shelf, deep sea exploration. Rejected. New refining capacity on closed military bases. Denied. Facilitating clean coal-to-liquid technologies. Absolutely not. Reduce regulations in the number of boutique fuels. Not a chance. And producing oil and gas resources in ANWR. Forget about it. 
   Of course, this doesn't come as a surprise to the American people or this Congress. Most of our friends across the aisle have repeatedly rejected efforts to expand domestic energy capacity. All you have to do is take a look at the record, the facts. 
   Exploration and development of the Outer Continental Shelf, 83 percent of House Democrats have routinely opposed it. Facilitating coal-to-liquid technologies, 78 percent of them rejected it. And producing oil and gas resources in ANWR, 86 of percent of House Democrats have fought the proposal time and time again. 
   But maybe, just maybe, if we naively believe long enough that drilling it not necessary because all Americans need to do is inflate our tires and get a tune-up, all of these problems will go away. But they won't. And it's why the American people and Republicans are asking for one vote up or down to increase the supply of American-made energy. That is all our constituents ask and that is all we ask this Congress before we adjourn. A vote. 
   If the Congress is not being responsible by addressing rising energy prices, what are we doing today? Well, we are rewarding one of the majority's favorite special interests, trial lawyers. 
   Mr. Speaker how much time remains?

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   As some have correctly described this bill, it's a boondoggle for trial lawyers. They will be able to collect unlimited, unlimited compensatory and punitive damages. This serves no legitimate purpose and turns the Equal Pay Act into a lottery. 
   It's why the second half of this motion is a simple, commonsense change that caps ``reasonable,'' as described in the bill, attorneys' fees at $1,000 an hour. With a cap on attorneys' fees, it's the intent that lawyers would take cases based on actual discrimination and prevent lawsuit abuse. 
   Today's litigation system, unfortunately, does little to restrain the filing of lawsuits. It's why lawsuits can result in millions of dollars in lawyers' fees, yet plaintiffs end up with pennies on the dollar. It's why tort costs consume approximately 2 percent, 2 percent of our entire gross domestic product, and why 10 cents of every single dollar spent on health care is attributed to the costs of liability and defensive medicine. Over $200 billion a year. 
   A cap on attorneys' fees can ensure that victims of discrimination are protected, yet not without financial gain. Without a cap, trial lawyers will be able to interject, distort, and oversee how wages are determined through litigation, and all this will end up doing is increasing expenses for employers and harm current and prospective workers through lower wages and slower job creation. 
   Let's adopt this motion to recommit. If it's not adopted, the record will reflect that while this Congress stood by and did nothing to address the price of gasoline at the pump, we had ample time to reward trial lawyers. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, there is a common misconception in Washington that simply talking about a problem is as good as solving it. However, we know that actions speak louder than words. In 34 of the last 38 years, the Federal Government hasn't balanced its own checkbook. 
   It's time Washington stop looking for ways to afford bigger government. Yesterday, the Republican Study Committee introduced the Taxpayer Bill of Rights to restore budget accountability to Washington's checkbook, and it couldn't come at a better time. It is imperative that we prioritize America's financial responsibilities and reform the way Washington spends hard-earned taxpayer money. We can't expect different results if we keep on doing the same thing. 
   This is all about accountability, about reducing wasteful Washington spending, about balancing the budget, about fundamental tax reform, and about adapting programs to America's changing demographics. 
   Madam Speaker, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights isn't merely a slogan, it's a solution, a way we should all be thinking. Imagine this positive change to the way Washington spends hard-earned taxpayer money. Just imagine.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the House, and I rise today to alert my colleagues to a bill, H.R. 328. And I rise to alert them and to speak in disbelief, truly disbelief, at this bill that the majority is preparing to bring to the House floor. 
   Now, it is hard to say, after some of the legislation that has been offered this year, but this is clearly the most egregious and unconstitutional bill that we have seen proposed to be brought to the floor of the House. In fact, some folks, some constitutional scholars, have said this is the most unconstitutional bill that they have ever seen. 
   Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states unequivocally: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' 
   Now, the majority has held hearings on a bill and they have passed a bill out of committee that totally disregards this portion of the Constitution. It is a bill to give the District of Columbia a seat, and a voting seat, in the House of Representatives, a clear violation of the Constitution. 
   The Democrats have apparently taken their majority to mean that they can run roughshod over the Constitution. Madam Speaker, this is a sad and distressing state of affairs. 
   It is really a very simple issue. The Founders of our Nation wisely determined that the House of Representatives was to be composed by Members elected by the States. Now, the last time I looked, Washington, D.C. is not a State. 
   Madam Speaker, we are the longest surviving democracy in the history of the world and on the face of the Earth for a reason. There is a reason for that. 
   The Founders of our great Nation, the authors of our Constitution, were brilliant individuals. People around the world still marvel at what they created in our Constitution. 
   Now, do Democrats think that Washington, D.C. was not given a seat in the House of Representatives as an oversight? 
   Was the over-200-year history of our Federal city's place outside of statehood the result of a lapse in judgment? 
   Constitutional scholars have repeatedly found that the Founders did not believe it to be appropriate for the site of the Federal Government to be a State. They never wanted the seat of the Federal Government to be considered a State, clearly, because of the conflicts that creates. 
   Congress simply does not have the authority to grant a non-state full congressional representation. But why are they doing this now? Why is the Democrat majority doing this? 
   Well, Madam Speaker, it is because they can, because they have got the votes. What an incredible abuse of power. 
   The Constitution addresses House membership very clearly. The legislative branch and the House of Representatives was so important to our Founders that it is the first thing discussed in the Constitution. 
   Article I, section 1, literally, the third sentence of the Constitution reads: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by people of the several States.'' The several States, Madam Speaker. It is clear. And Washington, D.C. is not a State. 
   Now, some may try to construe that statement to mean that the United States is the whole Nation, but the Constitution goes further to make this point even more clear. It says: ``No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' You must be a resident of a State. 
   This isn't just my opinion. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research service of Congress, filled with constitutional and congressional scholars, released a report that affirms that this bill is unconstitutional. It violates the Constitution. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a clear power grab. Now, I believe strongly that the citizens of the District should have representation. The right to vote is a sacred one, but so is the document that every one of us takes the oath to support, uphold and defend. We can't just disregard the Constitution. It is the supreme document of our land. 
   The options are to pass a constitutional amendment identifying the District of Columbia as a State, or to cede the land of the District of Columbia that has residents back to the State of Maryland. It is what happened in 1846 when the land west of the Potomac was ceded back to the State of Virginia. 
   Madam Speaker, the process that the majority is employing here is completely unfounded. We shouldn't be surprised, however. This new majority has taken the liberty to throw process out the door when they took over. Now they are tossing the Constitution out the door. 
   Madam Speaker, I will continue to honor the oath to support and defend and uphold our Constitution. It is a sacred document, the bedrock of our Nation. 
   This new majority claims to be the most open and honest and ethical government ever. 
   Madam Speaker, what is open about trampling on the Constitution? What is honest about trampling on the Constitution? What is ethical about trampling on the Constitution? 
   Madam Speaker, the American people are watching, and they don't like what they see.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, today is April 15th. It's a momentous day for Americans as all Americans know it's Tax Day. And it's a day that Americans tend to focus a little more attention on the amount of money that they send to Washington. And it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money, Mr. Speaker. 
   And most folks that I talk to say that would be okay, a lot of them have said that would be okay if they were getting good things for their money, if they were seeing progress happen here in Washington. But that's just not the case. 
   I, like most of my colleagues, go home every weekend. I went home last weekend, and what I hear from my constituents is what is happening? Where is the leadership in Washington? Mr. Speaker, I believe there is a crisis in leadership in Washington and here in the House of Representatives. 
   Whether it is supporting our troops, the leadership here apparently is determined that they are going to use our military troops as pack mules to carry their special projects across the finish line. Mr. Speaker, that's leadership lacking. 
   Whether it's protecting our Nation in the area of intelligence, this leadership believes that our intelligence community doesn't need to have the tools necessary to tell what the bad guys are going to do before they do it. Mr. Speaker, that's leadership lacking. 
   You have heard a lot about gas prices this morning. Sixteen months ago when this leadership took charge, a barrel of gasoline cost about $52, $53 a barrel. Today, it is about $112, $113 a barrel. Mr. Speaker, that's leadership lacking. 
   What's changed in Washington since that time? New leadership here in the House of Representatives. Mr. Speaker, that's not the kind of change that America voted for. 
   We need to work together in the area of energy. We need to make certain that we, as Americans, conserve more. We need to make certain that we utilize American resources for Americans. There's incredible resources in our land. We could utilize those resources in environmentally sensitive and technologically sound ways to make certain that we decrease our dependence on foreign oil. 
   And finally, Mr. Speaker, we need to make certain that we accelerate the use of alternative fuel, not picking winners and losers like this leadership in this majority wants to do, pick ethanol and raise the gas prices significantly by that, raise food prices around the world because of the action of this leadership. Mr. Speaker, that's leadership lacking. 
   Where else is leadership lacking here in the House? Well, Mr. Speaker, it is in helping our friends around the world. We have a former President meeting with Hamas terrorists. Where is the outcry from this leadership saying that that's not the correct thing to do for a former leader of our Nation? 
   In the area of fair trade, free trade, last week this leadership decided they were going to take one of our friends, Colombia and South America, who have worked with us time and time again, one of the glimmering hopes for democracy in South America, and what does this leadership do? Kick them in the teeth. 
   It is not just me saying that. Headlines all across the Nation last week: Financial Times, ``A setback on trade in Washington;'' Knoxville News Sentinel, ``House Democrats holding free trade hostage;'' Corpus Christi Caller Times, ``Congress should pass Colombia trade deal;'' Charleston Post Courier, ``Politics trump free trade;'' Orange County Register, ``Trading on ignorance;'' the Plain Dealer, ``Sidetracking American trade deal hurts U.S. businesses and workers;'' the Chicago Tribune, ``Caving on Colombia;'' Los Angeles Times, ``Pelosi plays politics;'' The Oklahoman, ``Pelosi's ploy: Colombia Deal Succumbs to Politics;'' New York Times, ``Time for the Colombian Free Trade Pact;'' the Denver Post, ``Historical failure on Colombia trade pact;'' San Francisco Chronicle, ``Trade pandering;'' New York Post, ``Pelosi's Putrid Sellout;'' Seattle Times, ``The Washington 6: tampering with trade;'' the Boston Herald, ``The Pelosi Doctrine: Duck;'' Las Vegas Review Journal, ``Trade Talks;'' National Review, ``Free Choice;'' St. Louis Post-Dispatch, ``The Politics of Trade;'' Washington Post, ``Drop Dead, Colombia;'' and the Wall Street Journal, ``Pelosi's Bad Faith.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis of leadership here in Washington, here in this House of Representatives. The American people are paying attention. The American people want positive change. The American people want us to work together. I call on the Speaker of this House to bring forward the free trade deal with Colombia, to work together on gas prices, to make certain that we pass a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allows our intelligence communities to act positively. 
   Mr. Speaker, I call on our leadership to be responsible.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, isn't it true the Chair has ruled multiple times on the fact that a bill reported promptly out of the House may return to the House floor at the discretion of the committee, and the fact that the Ways and Means Committee brought this to the floor, it could easily do so within a relatively short period of time, a matter of days?

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the Iraq supplemental bill being brought to the floor today is a bad idea wrapped in the wrong intentions. This is a time when Congress ought to be working together to provide our troops with the tools and the resources necessary to do their job. 
   Instead, the Democrat leadership is committed to a strategy that spells nothing but failure in Iraq. They are telling the commanders in the field that 535 politicians know better how to do their job. It is irresponsible for Members of Congress to play Commander in Chief. There is too much at stake in Iraq for political grandstanding. 
   This bill sends the wrong message to our soldiers, our allies and our enemies. It tells our troops that we have got no faith in them. It tells our allies that we lack the resolve of our stated commitment, and it tells our enemies all they have to do is wait. 
   This is shameful partisan politics that puts our troops at greater risk. It is wrong, and the American people are watching.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (A SAD AND SOBERING DAY FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, this is a sobering and sad day for America and for the House of Representatives. The Iraq supplemental war bill came to the floor this evening. It is a bill where the President had requested the resources of the American  people to support American men and women in harm's way nearly 11 weeks ago. The bill that came to the floor tonight had that amount of resources, and then some. It had over $20 billion in extra money, Madam Speaker, money that nobody could honestly say with a straight face was appropriate in an emergency supplemental bill. 
   In addition to that, it also had all sorts of timelines and arbitrary benchmarks that make it so that the Speaker of the House and every single Member of this House is in fact a commander-in-chief. 
   There was celebration on the other side of the aisle when this bill passed, muted. I would suggest, Madam Speaker, it was a little embarrassed, because they understand in their heart what they have done. What they have done is a shameful action, Madam Speaker. 
   General Petraeus came to visit the Congress today. General Petraeus is the Commander of Coalition Forces in Iraq. General Petraeus and his men and women are putting their lives on the line, day in and day out. 
   He came to the House today. He came to Congress today to ask for clarification of what Congress had intended. He asked for the opportunity to inform the House of Representatives, the Members of the House. And from what I heard this evening, Madam Speaker, the majority party didn't listen and they didn't learn. All they have done, apparently, is to work on legislation that will ensure defeat. 
   Madam Speaker, this majority party is vested in failure. Vested in failure. Their actions do a disservice to our troops. They say to our troops, we have got no faith in you. We don't believe in your mission. We don't believe in you. That is what this majority party says. 
   They send the wrong message to our allies. What they say to our allies is that you can't trust America. America's word is not good, given this majority party. 
   And they send the wrong message to our enemies. What they say to our enemies is, all you have to do is wait. 
   Madam Speaker, this is a sad and a shameful day. The majority leader in the United States Senate has said that this war is lost. ``This war is lost.'' 
   I stood with parents of a constituent of mine this weekend, Madam Speaker, this past weekend, who was on his way to Iraq that very day. They asked me, what am I supposed to say to my son? It is a heart-wrenching question, Madam Speaker, when you have the majority leader in the United States Senate saying that the war is lost. It is in headlines across this Nation that the majority leader says this war is lost. 
   Madam Speaker, I think it is incumbent, given that kind of statement by the majority leader in the United States Senate, for the House Democrat leaders to come down to this floor and say what they believe. Do they believe the war is lost? Do they agree with Senator Reid? 
   Madam Speaker, their silence is deafening. Do you hear them? What do they say? Are they here tonight? Are they here to say what they believe about our troops? Are they here to say that they believe in the men and women who are protecting our freedom and working as hard as they can to protect themselves? 
   Madam Speaker, this Democrat silence is deafening. What a shame. What a terrible shame. 
   Madam Speaker, it pains me and it saddens me to say what appears to be leading these new Democrats is the same as the old, and that that it is all politics all the time. What a shame.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to thank you for the opportunity, and I am pleased to have yielded to my good friend earlier and think that she brings into perspective some of the differences that we have in this Chamber that I would like to chat about for a little bit this afternoon. 
   It is a great privilege to come to the floor of the House and to present another edition of the Official Truth Squad. One of the goals that we have on our side of the aisle is to bring some light, bring some truth to the discussions that we have here on the floor of the House, so important if we are going to be making decisions, when we make decisions, on behalf of the American people. 
   I represent the Sixth District of Georgia, which is a wonderful district, all northern portion of suburban Atlanta. And from the very youngest to the very oldest, they give me great enthusiasm, and I am heartened by the opportunity to represent that district. It is one of the districts that has one of the greatest amounts of interest in and numbers of individuals who desire appointment to our Nation's military academies. 
   One of the privileges of being a Member of Congress is the opportunity to nominate individuals who avail themselves of the opportunity and have certain accomplishments at their young age to be able to be considered for appointments to military academies. Most of us get somewhere between four and eight individuals appointed to military academies each year; I was privileged last year to get over 25 people from my district appointed to the United States military academies. 
   When I was given the opportunity to call those folks who had been appointed, I asked my staff to put together the list, and I thought I would kind of be able to knock that out in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours, calling those 25 or so folks who had reached an incredible accomplishment in their life. And I started down that list, and the first call was an extremely emotional call, very moving, because this individual had worked his entire life to be able to have the opportunity to serve his Nation. 
   And so by the end of that phone call, which lasted about 10 minutes, he was crying and I was crying; and we were all celebrating his wonderful accomplishment. And I moved on to the next call, and it was basically a repeat of that first one, and I realized that it was going to take a long time to be able to make those wonderfully exciting and accomplishment calls. And I recognized that there are young men and women across this Nation who recognize and appreciate the value of service and the importance of making certain that there are members all across our society who stand up to serve, who stand up and appreciate the beauty and the wonder and the awe that is the United States of America. And they are proud to serve; they are proud to be able to attend one of our military academies and make that kind of commitment. 
   At another end of the spectrum, I have also some advisory councils in my district, different members of our community who get together and assist me in making sure that I am formulating the kinds of proposals and policies that are consistent with that wonderful Sixth District of Georgia; and recently we met. 
   One of the groups I have is a military and veterans group that gets together and provides information to make certain that we are addressing the kinds of issues that are of concern to military and veterans, members in the Sixth District and across the Nation. These are true heroes. They are folks kind of at the other end of the spectrum from those young men and women who have volunteered to attend military academies. But these are men and women who have served and who recognize the commitment that it takes and recognize the importance of this Congress, of this Nation stating clearly, through both word and deed, that they respect and appreciate the kind of service of our military men and women. 
   And those folks told me recently, they said, Congressman Price, we are a little perplexed, we are a little concerned by what we hear coming out of Washington. Again, these are heroes of a past time for our United States, continued heroes, but they are concerned because they believe that the information that is being put forward and the policies that are being promoted by the new majority party here in Washington as it relates to our Nation's security are troubling to them and threaten truly our very existence as a Nation. 
   I would suggest, Madam Speaker, that the most recent proposal as it relates to our war on terror as a Nation, is a proposal that has been coined and termed ``slow bleed,'' slow bleed in terms of our efforts in Iraq. It kind of gives you just chills thinking about that term, doesn't it, Madam Speaker? The slow bleed policy that has been put forward by Members on the other side of the aisle, they are very troubled by this at home; and I am very troubled by it. And that is what the Official Truth Squad, part of our purpose is trying to bring light and truth to the debate as it goes on here in Washington.  
   We have some favorite sayings on the Official Truth Squad. This is one of them. It comes from Senator Patrick Moynihan, who was the United States Senator from the State of New York. He said, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts.'' And, Madam Speaker, we would go a long way here in Washington if we heeded this statement and belief by Senator Moynihan: everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts. We hear a lot of opinions here, and it would be wonderful if the majority of them were more supported by facts. 
   One of the facts, though, is that the majority party here has the power of the purse; and if they so desire to bleed our troops dry in their mission, which is the mission of all Americans, which is to preserve and protect and defend our Nation; if they desire to slow bleed our troops, then they have the power to do that. They have the power to do that. And that is why it is called the slow bleed policy, because it would bleed dry our troops in terms of the ability for them to defend our Nation. 
   I quote, Madam Speaker, from Representative John Murtha on February 15 of this year when he was asked about this strategy. And he said: ``They won't be able to continue,'' they, referring to the United States troops, our military. He said, Madam Speaker: ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.'' 
   What a sad commentary it is, Madam Speaker, when you have the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that has jurisdiction over our military talking about a mission that our military is on to defend freedom and to defend you and to defend me, and say proudly, proudly, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment.'' Madam Speaker, that is a sad commentary on the level of discourse and the level of involvement and the level of support that this new majority party has for our military. 
   And then when asked just 2 weeks later, this same individual, same Member of Congress, was asked by a member of the press, Why not cut off the funding for the war? And at this point he said, ``Well, you can't. You 
   can't go forth. The public doesn't want that. They don't want that to happen.'' They don't want that to happen. But then the Speaker of the House reaffirmed her support for Mr. MURTHA's policies. 
   The greatest amount of truth and light on this issue comes from an individual who stands tall and proud when he talks about the truth and talks about defending our Nation, Senator Joe Lieberman from Connecticut. When the Speaker said, ``Democrats have proposed a different course of action; over and over again we have suggested a different plan,'' then Senator Lieberman said, ``Any alternatives that I have heard ultimately don't work. They are all about failing, they are all about withdrawing. And I think allowing Iraq to collapse would be a disaster for the Iraqis, for the Middle East, and for us.'' That is a little truth, Madam Speaker, on an issue that is so incredibly important to us as a Nation and to us as it relates to the stability in the Middle East, and, yes, to the world, to world stability and world peace. 
   I am so proud to be joined today by many of my colleagues to talk about the policies of the other side, to talk about the war on terror, to talk about defending our Nation and freedom and liberty. And the first individual to join us here on the Official Truth Squad is my good friend John Kline from Minnesota who knows of what he speaks. Colonel Kline, we are so proud to have you join us today, and I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. And I appreciate, Congressman Kline, your perspective in bringing light to one of the important fundamental principles of our Nation.     
   And that is that the responsibility for controlling our military, waging war, rests with the Commander in Chief, with the executive branch. And as you know, our good friend Congressman Blunt from Missouri, our minority whip, Republican whip, he is fond of saying, look, when the Nation began under the Articles of Confederation, there was no Commander in Chief. And the first thing that was easy to do once the Constitutional Convention organized to try to put together a Nation that would survive, one of the first things they were able to do, almost without dissent, was to provide that the executive branch would be the Commander in Chief because you can't fight a war with 535 generals. 
   And I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Maybe you could stick around and we can talk a little more about that supplemental and the slow-bleed policy. 
   I recall the comment that was made just a little earlier, Madam Speaker, by a friend on the other side of the aisle where she was quoting a general saying there was ``no military solution'' in Iraq. And, in fact, that is true. There is no isolated military solution. But that doesn't mean that the military doesn't have a role because it is a three-pronged strategy, which is military, economic, and political. And we are striving in all those areas to make certain that that area of the world is much more stable and much more secure so that we are much more stable and much more secure. 
   With that I am pleased to welcome my good friend VIRGINIA FOXX from North Carolina. I thank you for joining us today, and I look forward to your perspective and your conversation on this issue. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her perspective and especially bringing to light the interesting articles that we are now seeing come out in the national press. 
   And the editorial that you and that Colonel KLINE brought to us today from the L.A. Times saying, ``Do we Really Need a General Pelosi?'' And the underheading of that was ``Congress can cut funding for Iraq, but it shouldn't micromanage the war.'' And, in fact, that is what we would suggest, that if the majority party believes so strongly that we ought to end our involvement in Iraq, then let us have that vote. Let us have that debate, and let us have that vote. And if that is what they believe we ought to do, then we should have that vote. I would be interested to see what the outcome would be. I suspect that we are not having that vote because the majority leadership is afraid of the outcome of that vote because it doesn't fit with what they have been telling people and with what they would like to see. So I think it is important that we do concentrate on what they are doing, and that is proposing to micromanage the war. 
   And if I am able to bring a few quotes from some other folks to talk about this slow-bleed micromanagement of the war plan, about a week ago it was quoted in one of the local newspapers that ``House Democratic leaders said the measure, expected to put conditions on the President's use of funds ..... '' And then quoting the Speaker on March 8, she said: ``The House Democratic plan for the Iraq funding bill could force a pullout of U.S. combat troops starting on July 1, with all American units out of the country by the end of 2007.'' 
   And then another quote from the Associated Press on March 8: ``Speaker Nancy Pelosi ..... told reporters the measure would mark the first time the new Democratic-controlled Congress has established a `date uncertain' ..... ''     
   That is micromanagement by anybody's definition. In fact, Representative Dan Boren, a Democrat from Oklahoma, said, ``It is still micromanaging the war.'' Goodness knows that is the last place this Congress needs to be is micromanaging the war. Again, that is why we have the principles of the system in place that we have, that it is the executive branch's responsibility to conduct a war, to conduct the defense of our Nation. 
   Again, if we in Congress believe that it is appropriate to cut off funding for that, then let's have that vote. Let's have that vote, Madam Speaker. I would welcome the opportunity to defend the action of our military currently and would welcome the opportunity to oppose that kind of vote. But I suspect the majority leadership in this House is not interested in having that vote. That would be a truthful and honest debate about what this Nation ought to do; and, frankly, we haven't seen that to date on this issue. But I encourage them to bring that forward. 
   I am pleased to be joined by my good friend and fellow Georgian, Congressman Lynn Westmoreland. Georgia has a strong history of relationship with our military and with our Defense Department, and Congressman Westmoreland represents a number of those areas. We welcome you and appreciate you joining us today and look forward to your perspective. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman's comments and your perspective on it. It is chilling. Slow bleed is chilling, because it is not just slow bleed for our allies. It is slow bleed for our troops and our military. You talk about the consequences of failure. This is a list of the consequences of failure. This doesn't come from the national Republican Party or the House Republican Caucus. This comes from the National Intelligence Estimate. 
   What it says clearly crystallizes what would happen if the majority party here enacts the slow bleed policy that is promoted by their leadership. It says: ``Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources and operations, remain an essential stabilizing element in Iraq. If we fail in Iraq, the Iraqi security forces would be subject to sectarian control, interference by neighboring countries in open conflict,'' which means Iran and others would pour into Iraq, ``massive civilian casualties and population displacement.'' 
   That is what the colonel was talking about earlier happened after the conflict in Vietnam. 
   ``Al Qaeda in Iraq would plan increased attacks inside and outside of Iraq and spiraling violence and political disarray, including Kurdish attempts at autonomy in Kirkuk.'' 
   But the spiraling violence is again the important thing to concentrate on, because that is not our conference, that is not our caucus saying that. That is the National Intelligence. 
   Colonel, if you would like to comment and make a few words, then I know we have Congressman Davis here.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate so much your comments and your perspective on this because you bring light to some important information. 
   One is visiting the men and women at Walter Reed, and how moving is that experience every time we take part in that, and thank those young men and women for the work they have done in defense of our liberty and of our freedom. 
   If anyone wants moving accounts, all they have to do is read or listen to conversations or e-mails sent back from our men and women who are in harm's way right now. I get chills every time somebody forwards to me an account by one of our brave military men and women as they describe what is going on on the ground, and the enthusiasm and the passion that they have for the wonderful work that they are doing to bring freedom and liberty to that land. 
   You bring light to who our enemy is. I think it is important that we appreciate exactly the magnitude of this. This is a battle, a war against an enemy who is more ferocious than any we have ever faced. 
   When I try to put that in perspective, I am reminded of the airline debacle that was stopped last August or so in Britain by good intelligence on the part of our British allies and Pakistanis and our own intelligence agents. What they did is identify a group of individuals whose whole goal was to bring down or destroy as many jumbo jet airlines flying from England or Europe to the United States at one time so they could kill more innocent civilians than were killed on 9/11. That is chilling enough. That is enough to get your attention. 
   But when you appreciate that two of the people who were involved in the planning of that and involved in what would have been the execution of that tragedy were two parents who were using their 8-month-old child and the baby food for that child as the vessel for the explosive that would bring down a plane, and they were going to be on that plane with their 8-month-old child, they were going to kill themselves and their 8-month-old child in order to kill innocent civilians, Madam Speaker, that is an enemy that carries with them the ferocity that we cannot even comprehend. It is an enemy that Musab al-Zarqawi crystalizes in his quote of January 2005 when he says, ``We have declared a fierce war on this evil principle of democracy and those who follow this wrong ideology.'' 
   Madam Speaker, it is extremely important for us as a nation to appreciate the fundamental objection and the fundamental fight that we have is against people who oppose our own freedom and our own liberty and our own democracy. 
   Madam Speaker, it is imperative that this Congress appreciate the magnitude of the challenge that we face as a nation. It is imperative that in so appreciating that magnitude, that we recognize that facts and truth are important when we talk about this and we make certain that we as a Congress do not institute a policy that would result in tying the hands of the men, the brave men and women in our military who are defending our liberty and our freedom and our democracy. 
   It is a privilege for each and every one of us to be able to represent our districts in the United States House of Representatives. We should do nothing to thwart the activity of those who are defending our liberty and our freedom and our democracy.

   CONCLUSION 
   While we recognize that colorable arguments can be made in support of the contrary conclusion, we believe that Rule XLIV's disclosure requirement for limited tax benefits is applicable to Section 301. 
   Mr. Speaker, this new majority is all politics all the time. 
   Now, the Speaker gave seven reasons to vote for this bill. Funny, she didn't include the tax boondoggle for trial lawyers. That is right, a tax break for trial lawyers. 
   The bill allows plaintiffs' trial lawyers to take deductions for the payment of contingency fees. I ask you, under current economic conditions, should we be using the Tax Code to give the plaintiffs bar possible financial incentives to bring more and costlier lawsuits against American business? 
   Second, by definition, in the rules of this House this bill contains earmarks and pork. The restructuring of the New York Liberty Zone tax credits provide pork, a limited tax benefit of over $1 billion to New York City. 
   Pork for powerful Members of Congress. Pork for trial lawyers. Mr. Speaker, two good reasons to vote ``no'' on this bill.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, today I call on the Speaker to open up a positive dialogue with Republicans to find SCHIP solutions that put poor kids first. House Democrats have wrapped their expansion of bureaucratic Washington-run health care in so much deception and political theater that they have lost focus of what SCHIP is really all about, helping underprivileged kids. But as a recent Gallup poll has shown, American people now see through this insincere ploy and support keeping SCHIP rightfully focused on poor children. 
   It is unacceptable for the majority to continue exploiting the neediest of children in pursuit of an ideological agenda controlling health care decisions. This charade has gone on long enough, and the American people want solutions, not these political games. If Democrat leaders truly want to help needy children, now is the time to support a plan that reflects the original bipartisan intent of the program and the views of the American people. A positive solution will put poor kids first and promote the purchase of personal health care for all Americans. H.R. 3888 is such a bill.

As such, it has already been designated as a National Historic District, which makes it eligible for about $3 million in funding. 
   I would point out, as my friend from Texas said, that it is the National Park Service that said it didn't meet the criteria, not us. I am pleased, though, to hear from my friend from New Jersey that, in fact, the partnership with the State will be ongoing. I had understood that the State of New Jersey had not agreed to provide matching funds. I wonder if the gentleman might be able to clarify that.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. That is information I had not had. My concern is kind of rising to the 30,000- or 40,000-foot view for the National Park Service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent the Sixth District of Georgia, which is on the northern side of the City of Atlanta, and through my district runs the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area, a 48-mile long linear park, the longest linear park in our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have been trying to get accurate communication from the National Park Service about how they determine how much of their resources, their finite resources that they have, come to the various national parks across this Nation. 
   We asked that because, as my friend from Texas mentioned, the National Park Service appears to be at least $1 billion, if not more, in arrears on their maintenance and operations budget. So the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area has trails that are, in fact, a danger to those that visit this beautiful park. It is unable to patrol the park, again, a 48-mile linear park. It doesn't have the number of full-time equivalent employees that ought be there for this size park. When we look at other parks around the Nation, we see that parks of equivalent visitation, the same number of folks visiting each year, get a significantly greater budget. So as we try to drill down and find  out why that is, it appears that that is all political. For example, there is a park that a former Speaker of the House of Representatives had in his district, and that park gets four or five times the amount of funding that parks with the same visitation across this Nation get. 
   So we asked the National Park Service, what is your formula? How do you determine how much of your budget goes to various national parks and national recreation areas. Of course, we haven't been able to get that answer. It hasn't been just a week or two, Mr. Speaker; it has been years, years, that we have been trying to get that answer. 
   So I rise with great concern about the political nature of the relationship of the National Park Service and the priorities that they set. And as my friend from Texas raised, there may be some concerns about this bill that we have on the floor today about that matter as well. 
   So I raise a greater concern, a concern that I believe would be appropriate, to pull back this resolution and find out from the National Park Service the answer to those pivotal questions that Americans want to know, and that is is there any rationale to how you are spending your money. Where is the accountability in how you spend your money. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey and his passion for this area. I am sure it is a beautiful and wonderful area, and I look forward to visiting it at some point in the future. But I believe we have got challenges and problems within the National Park Service. I hope we address those first.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Far be it for me to defend oil companies, but my understanding is that the profits in oil companies has been about 8 percent for the past couple of years. I don't know what it ought to be, but I know how you figure that out in our society, and that is you allow markets to work. I also know there are some significant increases, there are some major companies that are making 15 and 20 percent margins. 
   And the gentleman is right, it is a philosophical question, when should the government step in. I think the points that have been made are very good points to talk about the strategic petroleum reserve and to talk about alternative fuel and conservation and geothermal and the like. 
   My point would be that we on this side believe we ought to have a comprehensive solution, that it ought to include all of these things, and all of these things means utilizing more of the supply that we have, American supply, whether it is offshore, whether it is deep-sea exploration, or whether it is on-shore exploration. Or oil shale. 
   We haven't talked about oil shale at all, and I think it is a bit of a transition into the speculation discussion because oil shale has been taken off the table earlier by the new majority. And oil shale is, as many of my friends know, estimated to have 2 trillion barrels of oil. That's a hard number to get your arms around. But when you look at in perspective, 1 trillion barrels of oil is what the entire human population has used since we began using fossil fuels. And we, America, have 2 trillion, estimated to be 2 trillion barrels of oil in terms of reserves. 
   I do know when you take that kind of supply off the table, the speculators, those who look at how much reserve, how much supply is out there in the world, when we as the government take that off the table, that immediately jacks up the price because that is not even there. That is not even there to be talked about or utilized. 
   So I look forward to the comments of my friend from Michigan about the issue of speculation because I think that we would again give the message that we are interested in talking about all of these things and having a comprehensive solution. 
   I would hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle are also interested in a comprehensive solution and not a targeted solution that picks winners and losers and picks friends and punishes enemies from a governmental standpoint.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And I want to thank all of my colleagues for working together to bring this evening to reality because I think it's what the American people want, and that is a discussion about what's going on. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have talked about the need for increasing supply, and I appreciate my friend from New York's saying that the SPR ought to be released because what that argument signifies is an appreciation that supply is important. And supply is important. And that's what the American people understand and appreciate. They know that when there's an increase in supply that there's a decrease in price. 
   We have talked about how much of the Outer Continental Shelf has been utilized, and different maps and different charts do different things and demonstrate different things. This is a pie chart that demonstrates that the dark purple area is the portion of the Outer Continental Shelf that is able to be leased. And 97 percent is not, 97 percent is not right now. 
   And that's what the American people see. They see that we have got all sorts of wonderful resources that we ought to be utilizing, American energy for Americans, that we're not. The same can be said for on-land areas that ought to be leased or could be available for leasing. Onshore, the dark purple, 6 percent is that area that is able to be leased right now for oil and gas development, and 94 percent is not. And I think that it's imperative that we concentrate on that area that could be utilized by Americans. Americans are frustrated because they understand and appreciate that we're not using the resources that we have. 
   My friend from Michigan talks about the fact that we have got more than enough supply. I would suggest to my friend that Americans don't believe we ought to be gaining 70 percent of our supply from foreign sources. I would suggest to my friend that Americans want to utilize American resources for Americans and that that's the kind of work that they would appreciate our doing together on this floor, as we're discussing tonight. 
   So I hope that as we move forward this evening and talk about these issues that we identify that available energy, the resources that we have that are available to Americans. We don't have to worry about Hugo Chavez. We don't have to worry about folks in the Middle East. We don't have to be held prisoner of folks that, frankly, don't like us very much. We can utilize American resources for Americans. And I hope that as we move forward in this discussion over the next couple of weeks that we'll concentrate on that and have that as the hallmark for our solutions.  
   And I thank my friend for yielding.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6455, the NASA 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act. I want to thank the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank, for his willingness to bring this bill to the floor. 
   This is an easy bill to understand. What is a little difficult to fathom is why this bill has been so star-crossed, pun intended. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson) proposed this idea first several Congresses ago, and the House has passed it several times in substantially the same form, this year with the help of the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). 
   For reasons that aren't clear, it has always had a harder time escaping the gravitational pull of the other body; although, it's always had support. This year, the Senate acted but sent back a Senate-numbered bill with some minor amendments, and since the bill contains a revenue provision and thus has to be a House-numbered bill to go to the President, we are sending the Senate-amended language to them in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson) speaks eloquently about the importance of the space program to the American economy, to United States national security, and to the advancement of science, and I'm honored to yield to my  friend from Texas at this time for such time as he may consume.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to say how pleased we are that this bill has come to the floor. I want to commend my friend from Texas for shepherding this through previous Congresses. I want to commend the gentlelady from Texas for painting a picture of the wonder of NASA that we all know and love. The byproducts of the NASA program have been remarkable. 
   I remember myself that day in July of 1969 when we landed on the Moon, and watching that, and what a special source of pride that was for all Americans. I remember thinking--actually, every time that NASA has a flight--the incredible energy that it takes to boost those rockets into space. 
   This bill is going to get something that's very special on the floor of this House, and that's a vote; that's a vote, Mr. Speaker. We would appeal to the Democrat majority leadership to allow a vote on other bills, other bills that have items of import, like the energy that it takes for every single American to live each and every day. Just a vote, that's all we ask for, just a vote. 
   We had many of our friends come to the floor earlier today and talk about the issue of energy. And we, on our side of the aisle, believe that a comprehensive solution is absolutely necessary. 
   We've got to have conservation, and Americans are doing their share on that score as we speak. We've got to have an alternative fuel source. And I'm one of those that's hopeful that it's not a source of energy that is selected by this Congress but that utilizes the ingenuity and the entrepreneurship and the genius of the American people to come up with that alternative fuel. 
   But we know that we also need a short-term, a near-term solution, and that's the increase in supply. And that's what we ask for for the floor of this House is to allow a vote on an increase in supply for onshore fossil fuels, for offshore deep sea exploration, for clean coal technology, for oil shale, for increasing refining capacity so that the energy that was put into the space program can be harnessed for the energy that will solve the challenges that we have for our Nation in terms of American-made energy for Americans. 
   So that's what we ask for, Mr. Speaker, a vote, a vote not just on this bill--which we know we'll get, and we're very grateful for that--but a vote on the bills of significant import to the American people in this day and in this time so that we can make certain that we do, in fact, increase American-made energy for Americans.

   In closing, I will just say that my constituents and many constituents and many Americans that I hear from all across this Nation say they remember fondly the wonderful enthusiasm with which this Nation gathered around, challenged by a President in the early 1960s to go to the Moon. And NASA was absolutely pivotal and instrumental in that. And it's that kind of enthusiasm that my constituents and so many Americans believe we ought to be putting into the same kind of program to discovering that alternative fuel that will lead us and allow us to lead throughout the 21st century.     
   So this bill will get a vote. And for that we are very, very grateful. 
   We would ask, Mr. Speaker, and appeal to the leadership to allow a vote on increasing the supply of American energy for Americans and providing a program that allows for the expansive development of alternative fuel. 
   With that, I am pleased to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my colleague from Georgia. 
   Dr. Gingrey, the two posters that he showed--because I think that the Taunton River, wild and scenic river poster that he showed, demonstrate the contortion to which the Democrat majority will go to not, to not increase supply of fuel, of fossil fuels for the American people, the contortions that they will go through to try to make certain that people pay more at the pump and have to pay more for heating their home in the winter. It is truly astounding. 
   We believe in a comprehensive solution. We don't believe in just one thing. We don't believe in just conservation, we believe strongly in conservation, but not just conservation. We don't believe just in alternative fuels, we believe in alternative fuels without a doubt, but we don't believe in just alternative fuel. We believe also in increasing supply, because, as my friend knows, we believe in the laws of economics. 
   The law of supply and demand is a law. That's why they call it a law. When you increase supply, you decrease cost, and that's what the American people know. That's why the American people are so supportive of the efforts that we are trying. Seventy-six percent support increasing oil drilling in the United States immediately, 76 percent. 
   A year ago, that wouldn't have been that number. In fact, it might have been 25 percent, absolutely the reverse, 73 percent favor--said they favor offshore drilling for oil and natural gas immediately, 73 percent. Sixty-eight percent said they supported increasing exploration for oil and natural gas immediately. 
   These are the American people who understand and appreciate that when the price goes up that one of the ways to bring down the price is to increase the supply, increase the supply.

They don't understand, they think that back in the fourth grade and the sixth grade when they learned about how Congress works, and they thought that votes just happen on the floor of the House whenever there was a bill that was introduced. Well, the challenge that we have is that the majority party, the Speaker, determines whether or not a bill gets a vote on floor of the House, and the Speaker will not allow a vote on this. 
   That's all we are asking. We are not asking to game the system, to tell us what the result is going to be. We will let every Member vote, all 435 Members, let them vote. That's all we are asking. Let's vote for the utilization of deep sea exploration for oil, on-shore exploration for oil, use of oil shale, clean coal technology, increasing refining capacity, increasing energy for Americans. 
   That's what we would like to see a vote on the floor of this House, and I know that's what the American people want to see. I am so pleased to be able to join my colleague from Georgia tonight and the leadership that he has shown on this issue.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, this week is ``Cover the Uninsured Week,'' highlighting the fact that the health and well-being of our Nation's future is at stake. 
   Over 45 million Americans will be without health insurance at some point during this year. It's past time that Washington helps find real solutions to this very real problem. With colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and in the House and Senate, we have introduced legislation that will begin to take a meaningful approach to bringing down the cost of health care and help cover all Americans. 
   The Health Partnership through Creative Federalism Act, H.R. 506, empowers individual States and regions to develop unique solutions to fit the needs of their citizens. We are fighting to put the needs of patients first. 
   Unlike many other proposals, our reform rejects a one-size-fits-all model. The inflexibility of such an antiquated approach has continually proven ineffective in addressing individual health care needs. Working together, we can find a way to provide health care coverage for all Americans, so that American families will have a brighter and healthier future.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I'm so pleased to rise today to congratulate the State of Israel on its 60th anniversary as an independent and sovereign Nation. Our friends have realized this historic milestone in the face of innumerable challenges to their very existence. 
   Constant threats of terrorism and attacks have not defeated the hopes and dreams of the Israeli people. And with remarkable restraint, and despite great odds, the State of Israel proudly stands and has secured the creation of a new and enduring Jewish society in their ancestral homeland. 
   As a vibrant and strong democracy in the Middle East, Israel is a model for the region. A lack of natural resources has not prevented Israel from becoming home to one of the world's most dynamic economies. Its achievements in agriculture, solar energy, medical electronics and telecommunications have gained worldwide recognition. Each of these accomplishments can be directly attributed to Israel's greatest asset, her people. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we continue to promote peace and stability for the people of Israel and all in the region, let us congratulate Israel on the occasion of her 60th anniversary and reaffirm our steadfast support for one of America's greatest allies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend and colleague from Georgia, Congressman Deal, for his leadership on this issue and for the time today. 
   I also want to express my gratitude and thanks to Representative Gordon, who was extremely cooperative and helpful and productive throughout this entire process. I want to thank the American College of Pathology and all of the pathologists across the Nation who are working day in and day out to make certain that they provide quality care for the patients for whom they are charged. 
   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a copy of an article by Dr. George Nagy that documents the dysfunctional federally mandated proficiency test in cytopathology. 
   The Dysfunctional Federally Mandated Proficiency Test in Cytopathology--A Statistical Analysis 
   Proficiency testing in cytopathology and in other disciplines should be based on firm statistical and scientific foundations, because test theory in general is a heavily statistical subject. Statistical considerations have demonstrated that the design of ``short'' proficiency tests in cytopathology, including the current federally mandated test, fundamentally is unsound because of the lack of sufficient validity and reliability. Examinees too frequently are misclassified by such short-format tests: Competent examinees fail the test in surprisingly high numbers, whereas most of the examinees who have insufficient cytologic skills eventually pass the test after the allowed retakes. Only dichotomous tests are suitable for accurate computation of the effects of test design on reliability, but the statistical conclusions also are generalizable to nondichotomous tests. In conclusion, the current federally mandated proficiency test cannot reliably measure the level of expertise of cytologists and, thus, cannot assure that only adequately skilled individuals evaluate Papanicolaou test samples. To render the test suitable for its intended purpose, the authors believe that complete redesign of the test, with the participation of experts in modern test theory, would be advisable. 
   Proficiency testing in cytopathology (PTC), which was established in the 1991 regulations to implement the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLlA'88), has only recently been enforced on a national scale. For more than a decade, during which logistical hurdles hampered the development of a national program for PTC, there was not much incentive to think about the value and potential of PTC or its theoretical background or to worry that the test design was so poor. In 2004, however, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that a national PTC program developed by the Midwest Institute for Medical Education had been approved and that the regulations finally would be enforced on a national level. Suddenly, the shortcomings of the test were everyone's problem. What followed was a flurry of comments, articles, proposals, and Internet discussions about the PTC and its future. Although the testing has proceeded nationwide in conformity with the original regulations, the dust has not yet settled on the subject. The professional organizations agree that PTC, as prescribed in CLIA'88, is inadequate and is in great need of improvement if indeed it should remain in place at all. Regarding the projected revisions, it is a real impediment that some regulatory authorities that are in a position to make decisions about the implementation of PTC apparently are not familiar with most of the theoretical implications of test theory, which is an exceedingly complicated subject. So long as the test is mandatory for every practitioner of gynecologic cytopathology in the United States, it is in the best interest of all participants for PTC to become a scientifically well-founded, valid, and reliable quality assurance method. In the current article, we have attempted to shed light on some gaps in the knowledge about the theoretical underpinnings of PTC that seem to endure in the cytopathology literature.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor again today and appreciate the confidence of my leadership in allowing me to organize this hour and come chat a little bit with our Members here and to point out some interesting information in another edition of the Official Truth Squad. 
   The Official Truth Squad is a group of individuals who try to come to the floor on this side of the aisle at least once a week in an effort to bring some truths and some facts to the items that we talk about on this floor. I know it won't surprise you, Mr. Speaker, but oftentimes some of the things we hear on this floor aren't necessarily the truth. So what we try to do is to point out items that are of importance in terms of information to the American people and how we on this floor ought to be making decisions on their behalf. 
   And in so doing, we have a number of individuals we like to point to as kind of leaders in the public arena, both present and past, who have had as one of their hallmarks making certain that they discussed truth and made certain that they used facts in developing their positions. 
   One of my favorite quotes comes from Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, former United States Senator from New York, and he had a quote that said: ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts.'' I think that is incredibly important as we talk about this issue that we are discussing today, the economy and the budget and issues that relate to how Washington spends hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   One of the most important facts is it is the taxpayers' money, it is not the  government's. And there are many people who are here in Washington who believe that somehow, just by some miraculous nature, when the money is sent to Washington that somehow it becomes the government's money. Well, Mr. Speaker, I would hope you would agree with me that in fact it is the taxpayers' money and we need to spend it very, very wisely. 
   One of the other relative issues that I think has seen a lot of naysayers and a lot of misinformation is the state of our economy right now. If you ask folks, most people across this Nation will say that their own economic situation is pretty good and they feel pretty good about the future. If you ask them how the economy in the Nation is going, the majority of them say that it is not going well at all. And that, I believe, to be in large part due to much of the messaging that comes out of Washington. Our good friends on the other side of the aisle have been down-talking this economy for years, literally years. 
   So I was curious that over the weekend the Wall Street Journal had an editorial that they entitled: ``The Current `Depression,' '' and they used ``depression'' in quotes, because if you really look at the numbers, if you look at the facts, Mr. Speaker, they kind of belie the naysayers in what they have been saying: 110,000 new jobs in January, 41 straight months of job growth in this Nation. The average job growth in 2006 was 187,000 jobs; 2.2 million new jobs in 2006, and 7.4 million new jobs since 2003; 7.4 million new jobs since 2003. 
   When you compare this expansion to the expansion that all sorts of folks talk about as being the be-all and the end-all, and that is with the expansion of the 1990s, when you compare this expansion, the expansion that we are currently in, the economic success that we are currently in is better when you look at many, many parameters. 
   Unemployment, for example. The first six years of the 1990s, 1991 through 1996, had an average unemployment rate of 6.4 percent. The average unemployment rate for the first 6 years of this decade: 5.4 percent. And as you know, Mr. Speaker, that unemployment rate is at 4.6 percent. And the last time I looked, if the average unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, it means that 95.4 percent of folks are working. 
   Real wage growth. Our friends on the other side of the aisle often talk about, well, this is a recovery, an economy that isn't resulting in real jobs; the wage growth isn't occurring, people's wages aren't increasing. Well, if you compare it to the vaunted years of the early 1990s, real wage growth for those first 6 years averaged 0.6 percent per year increase. 2001 through 2006, real wage growth in this Nation up 1.5 percent, and last year it was 1.7 percent increase. And that is accounting for inflation. It is accounting for inflation, Mr. Speaker. 
   Now, one might want to ask, given the success of the current economy, how did that happen? What happened? How did that occur? How are we seeing the kind of results in the economy, the good news that we are currently seeing? 
   And I am fond of using charts because I think that they paint a picture that is oftentimes, at least for me, easier to comprehend and easier to get my arms around. This is a chart that runs from 2000 through 2006, and we are going to update the numbers for this most recent quarter. But what it shows here on this vertical line, this dotted green vertical line is when we began this remarkable expansion. And what occurred on that at that point was, you guessed it, Mr. Speaker, appropriate tax reductions for the American people. So when you decrease taxes, what happens is that the blue line, you get more jobs; the red line, you get increasing business investment; and, lo and behold, something that President Kennedy knew and President Reagan knew, when you decrease taxes, which occurred at the nadir of this graph here, what happens is that you increase government revenue. 
   It sounds counterintuitive, but in fact it isn't. If you decrease taxes, if you allow individuals to have more of their hard-earned money, what happens is that the economy grows and, because of that, tax revenue flows to the Federal Government. 
   Now, an individual who is joining us today for this edition of the Official Truth Squad, an individual who is a new member of our conference from California who knows a lot about taxes and a lot about the issue of taxes and how they affect us on a daily basis, I am pleased to ask my friend Kevin McCarthy from California to join us and give us some insight into exactly where those taxes come from and how often we are taxed. I think that is the kind of truth and facts you would like to bring to us today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for coming and joining us today and helping out and bringing truth and facts to the issue of the economy and especially taxation, because oftentimes people don't think about the times that they do indeed pay tax. 
   I try to visit as many schools as I can in my district back in Georgia, and when I am in front of student groups, I oftentimes ask them, Do you pay any tax? And of course most often they say, Oh, no. We don't pay any tax. Our parents pay some tax, but we don't pay any tax. Then you ask them, Did you buy a pack of gum? Paid for any of your shoes lately? Have you bought any food? Anything that you buy, anything that you buy has taxes on it. So any consumable product whatsoever has taxes on it. So everybody contributes into it. And when individuals are able to keep more of their own money, what happens is that the economy is able to flourish to a much greater degree. So I appreciate the information that you brought about taxes. 
   I also want to point out that you mentioned that our good friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be moving in the direction of allowing the appropriate tax reductions that resulted in this success, to allow those tax reductions to go away, which means a tax increase for the vast majority of Americans all across this Nation. And if they do what they have basically said they are planning on doing, and that is allow those tax reductions to expire, allow taxes to go up, the marginal tax rate, that is the rate, the percentage of income that each and every American pays to government to run the services, will be over 50 percent for the first time since the late 1970s. And, Mr. Speaker, some of our Members may not remember the late 1970s, but I remember it and I know that my good friends here remember it, and that is that we had something called the misery index.     
   It was the last time that inflation and unemployment were just skyrocketing, both of them because of poor programs of the Federal Government. 
   So I fear that what will happen if our good friends on the other side of the aisle get their way is that we will revisit the misery index. So we are here to try to bring truth and fact and light to the issue of the economy and taxation and the budget. 
   I am so pleased to be joined by my good friend from Tennessee, the congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, who understands business, understands the economy and budgetary issues as well or better than the vast majority of folks in this Chamber. I look forward to your comments today as we talk about budget, economy and taxes.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you so much for joining us again today and bringing light and truth to an issue that is so remarkably important because it gets to the bottom line for each and every American and each and every American family. 
   What we do at home, when we have discussions about our family budget, is that we determine how much money we have to spend and then we determine what our priorities are. Depending on what those priorities are, that is how we allocate money, and we try to make certain that we set aside some savings as well for a rainy day, for a difficult time. That ought to be what the Federal Government does, as you well know, but, sadly, that appears to be not the plan of the new majority here. 
   So it is important that we talk about family budgets, about how family budgets ought to parallel Federal budgets, government budgets. 
   I would be pleased to yield if you have a comment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for her comments and for again pointing out how important it is to have our budget here at the Federal level compare or track what we do at home. 
   In fact, what we do at the State level, virtually every single State has a balanced budget because they cannot do what Washington does, and that is print money. Having served in the State legislature, we would spend days and weeks and months sometimes dealing with the hard-earned taxpayer money, again not government money, but hard-earned taxpayer money and make certain that our budget was balanced at the State level. 
   In fact, in Washington I am distressed that is not exactly what occurs. I am a strong supporter of a balanced budget, and what you will see on some of the charts and information that we currently have is that the tax policies that have been put in place and the program changes that have been put in place, something that is not well-known, is that the nondefense discretionary money, which is about 16 to 17 percent of our overall budget right now, has been actually decreasing as it relates to inflation. So Congress has been trying diligently to try to make certain that it reins in costs and spending. Because, Lord knows, we have not got a revenue problem; we have got a spending problem. 
   If you track out the budget itself, and this is with Congressional Budget Office numbers, they are not the kind of numbers that I think demonstrate the upside that we receive from tax reductions, but, in any event, what they do show is that at about 2011 the budget is balanced. The budget is balanced, and that is if we keep our current programs in place. Now, we can get to that point a lot sooner if we get more responsible on the spending side. 
   Now, my good friends on the other side of the aisle will tell you, well, we are going to balance the budget, too, and they can do that if they just left things alone. We would get to a balanced budget. But what they will tell you is we need to spend more in other areas, and so we need to tax Americans more. We are going to balance the budget, yes, but we are going to do it by taxing the American people more, and I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that that is not the way in which we need to move forward. 
   We will talk about some other revenue items and some other aspects of a balanced budget, but I want to address what has been termed by many myths, 10, 12 number of myths about President Bush's tax reductions. These are the tax reductions, appropriate tax reductions, that our friends on the other side of the aisle say they have to 
   end. They have to increase taxes on the American people. 
   The Democrat majority has to write a budget. They have to write a budget. Each year, the majority party has to write a budget, and the House has to pass a budget. 
   The new majority, the Democrat majority, has three options in that budget as to how they are going to deal with these appropriate tax reductions that were put in place earlier in this decade. They can extend them. They can continue the appropriate tax reductions, something that I and the vast majority of folks on our side of the aisle believe ought to occur. They could allow them to expire. Virtually all of them are slated to expire in 2011. 
   So, if no action is taken, then the other side will, in fact, increase taxes, or they can repeal them. They could increase taxes right way. So they have the responsibility of determining exactly what they are going to do with those appropriate tax reductions. 
   There are a number of myths that have grown up around these tax reductions that I would like to highlight. One is that the tax reductions themselves or the tax revenues themselves remain low. In fact, Mr. Speaker, as I have on a previous chart shown, the tax revenues are above the historical average, even after these appropriate tax reductions. 
   Tax reductions in 2006 were about 18.4 percent of the gross domestic product, which is actually above the 20-year, 40-year and 60-year historical averages. Now the inflation-adjusted 20 percent tax revenue increase between 2004 and 2006 represents the largest 2-year surge in tax revenue since 1965 and 1967. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. The revenue to the Federal Government increased 20 percent over a 2-year period between 2004 and 2006, which is the largest increase in revenue to the Federal Government since 1965 and 1967. So claims that Americans and the American people are undertaxed according to history are simply patently false, absolutely untrue, and so it is important to remember that tax revenues are up because of a decrease in taxes, decrease in liability to the American people. 
   When you compare the tax revenues in the fourth fiscal year after each of the past recessions, it shows that the tax revenues were basically the same. So, in 1987, tax revenues were about 1.4 percent of gross domestic product; 1995, 18.5 percent; and 2006, 18.4 percent. 
   All of that is to say, Mr. Speaker, that when you decrease taxes, the revenue that comes into the Federal Government stays about the same as a percentage of the overall economy, but you decrease the number for each and every American because the economy is increasing and the revenue increases to the Federal Government. So tax reductions are good for the government. Tax reductions are good for the American people. 
   The second myth that I want to talk about and discuss as it relates to the appropriate tax reductions that were adopted by this Congress back in 2001 and in 2003, the myth that is out there is that these tax reductions substantially reduced 2006 revenues and expanded the budget deficit. Well, the fact of the matter, Mr. Speaker, is that nearly all of the 2006 budget deficit resulted from additional spending above the baseline. 
   I am the first to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the Federal Government, Washington, has been spending too much money, too much of hard-earned taxpayer money. That being said, I think it is important that our friends on the other side of the aisle, who say that they want to balance the budget, do so by doing the responsible thing and that is decreasing spending and not increasing taxes. 
   In the first place, if you increase taxes, what you do is, over the long term, you get less revenue to the Federal Government, but in terms of budget deficit, what you see is that you will decrease the deficit more rapidly by decreasing taxes and by decreasing spending.     
   Now critics tirelessly contend that America's swing from budget surpluses in 1998 through 2001 to a $247 billion budget deficit in 2006 resulted chiefly from what they call ``irresponsible'' tax reductions. This argument, however, ignores the historic spending increases that pushed Federal spending up from 18.5 percent of GDP in 2001 to 20.2 percent of spending in 2006. 
   Furthermore, tax revenues in 2006 were actually above the levels projected. We have talked about that before. They were above the levels that were projected before the 2003 tax cuts. 
   Now, immediately before the 2003 tax cuts, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the 2006 budget deficit would be $57 billion. Yet the final 2006 budget deficit was $247 billion. Now, the $190 billion deficit increase resulted from Federal spending, resulted from Federal spending that was $237 billion more than projected. So revenues were actually $47 billion above projections even after the $75 billion in tax cuts that the other side says hurt, hurt the bottom line and hurt the deficits. 
   So these myths, I think, are important to correct to point out the factual nature of what is going on as opposed to just flying by the seat of your pants, which is not the way folks do their family budget and certainly ought not to be the way that we do our Federal budget. 
   The next myth I want to talk about is the capital gains taxes; tax cuts do not pay for themselves. There is kind of this sense that folks say, well, if you keep capital gains low, those are the taxes that people pay on the profits that they made on investments. 
   I am in favor of doing away with them all together. But if you keep  them low, what happens is you don't get the same amount of revenue into the Federal Government. Well, the fact of the matter is that capital gains tax revenues doubled, doubled following the 2003 tax cut. 
   Did you hear that? Capital gains tax revenues doubled following the 2003 tax cut. 
   Now, whether a tax cut pays for itself depends on how much people alter their behavior in response to that policy. Investors have shown to be the most sensitive to tax policy because capital gains tax cuts encourage new investment to more than offset the lower tax rate. 
   This chart here is a demonstration of exactly that. What we see here is a chart that shows capital gains tax revenues that doubled following the 2003 tax cut. The yellow line here projected from 2003 through 2006, the yellow line demonstrates what the Congressional Budget Office said would be the taxes gained from capital gains tax revenue. The blue line which you see is significantly higher than that are the actual revenues that came into the Federal Government following the 2003 capital gains tax reduction. 
   So in 2003 capitalize gains tax rates were reduced from 20 percent to 10 percent, depending on income, to 15 percent and 5 percent. Now, rather than expand by 36 percent from the current $50 billion level to $68 billion in 2006, as the CBO projected, capitalize gains revenue more than doubled $103 billion, $103 billion, more than twice what was projected. Past capital gains cuts have shown similar results as well. 
   The fact of the matter is, remember, you can have your own opinions as you walk through this discussion of the economy and of tax policy and of budget policy, but it is important that we look at facts so that we are making appropriate decisions here on behalf of the American people. 
   The fact of the matter is that when you decrease capital gains taxes you increase investment in America and you increase the revenue to the Federal Government, which is demonstrated clearly by this chart that we see right here. 
   Another myth that I want to talk about is the myth that says that the tax deductions are to blame for the long-term budget deficits. In fact, that isn't true at all. Projections show that entitlement or automatic spending, automatic costs, will dwarf the projected large revenue increases of the current tax reductions. As you remember, the graph that I had up here had revenue to the Federal Government increasing because of the appropriate reductions in taxes to the American people. 
   However, those increases will all be eaten up by automatic spending that occurs here in Washington. Some folks call these programs entitlement programs. They are primarily Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. 
   These are the automatic programs where the spending continues to increase based upon a formula. 
   I have a chart that I would like to share with you that demonstrates clearly the challenge and the problem that confront not just those of us representing Americans but all of America. These are three pie charts that demonstrate the mandatory or automatic spending that occurs, primarily again in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. This is 1995. Those programs comprised approximately half of the Federal budget, 48.7 percent of the Federal budget. 
   Now, the percent of the Federal budget that was utilized at that time for interest on the debt was 15.3 percent, a point much greater than current, and then discretionary spending where we have all of the Federal programs that people think about in terms of transportation, national park programs, all of those kinds of things, in addition to defense, that portion, in 1995, was 36 percent. 
   Again, about 48.7 percent was the mandatory portion of the budget. In 2005, just 2 years ago, that portion had grown from 48.7 percent to 53.4 percent. Again, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, there were automatic spending increases over a period of time with those three specific programs. 
   If you track out to 2016, you get to 63.9 percent of the Federal budget. So those are the automatic programs that are in place, the automatic spending programs that are in place. This is clearly, clearly unsustainable. Spending of the entire GDP has kind of hovered around 20 percent for the past half century. 
   However, with the retirement of the baby boomers, this is the first year that baby boomers will begin to receive Social Security. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will see significant increases in the amount of revenue projected to increase over 10.5 percent over the next 10 years. What you see is an increase to 63.9 percent by 2016. 
   Clearly, clearly, these French-style spending increases, not tax policy, are the problem. In Washington, lawmakers, all of us, all of us have a responsibility and should focus on getting these entitlements under control, as opposed to raising taxes on the American people. That not only will not work, they may be good bumper sticker politics, but they will not work to solve the problem. This is hard work, significant challenges that confront all of us. 
   Next myth I would like to address very briefly is that raising tax rates is the best way to raise revenue. There is kind of this general belief on the other side of the aisle that all you have to do to get more money is to raise more taxes. 
   As you know, tax revenues themselves correlate with economic growth, not with tax rates, so that as the government increases its revenue as the economy grows, many of those who desire additional tax revenues regularly call on Congress to raise taxes. But tax revenues are a function basically of two variables. One 
   is tax rates and two is the tax base. 
   Since 1952, the highest marginal income tax rate has dropped from 92 percent to 35 percent, dropped from 92 percent to 35 percent. At the same time, tax revenues have grown in inflation-adjusted terms while remaining basically a constant percent of GDP. They are basically a perfect correlation between those two. 
   I think it is exceedingly important for all of us here and the American people to realize and appreciate that raising taxes doesn't raise tax revenue. In fact, as we saw from the previous charts, it is decreasing taxes that increase tax revenue. 
   One other myth that I would like to talk about very briefly is that there is this myth that reversing the upper income tax reductions, the upper income tax cuts, would raise substantial revenues. In fact, the lower income tax cuts reduced tax revenue more than the high income tax reductions. 
   I have a chart that will show that as well. This chart oftentimes comes as a real eye opener for the American people and for so many of my colleagues here, as a matter of fact. This chart shows the share of individual income taxes that are paid by different portions of our society, and I would like to just point to the last two bars, the last two bar graphs down there. 
   This one, the larger one, that demonstrates that over 96 percent of all tax revenue comes from folks in the upper half of the income bracket of this Nation, and that the bottom 50 percent, the lower 50 percent pay less than 4 percent of the tax revenue that comes into the United States. 
   Now, that is important because if you try to concentrate on just the middle-income folks, in fact, you will not generate the kind of money that you are talking about or that you need, and you also will significantly depress the economy. 
   Again, it is important to talk about facts. It is important to talk about truth as we talk about making certain that we have the right policy here at the Federal Government. 
   Finally, there is a myth out there that these reductions, tax reductions, haven't helped the economy. In fact, the economy has responded to the 2003 tax reductions in remarkable ways, as we have already pointed out. GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the six quarters before the tax reductions. The six quarters that followed the tax reductions, it grew at 4.1 percent; 1.7 percent before, 4.1 percent afterward. It is a fact. 
   Nonresidential fixed investment declined for 13 consecutive quarters before the 2003 tax reductions. Since then, it has expanded for 14 consecutive quarters. Down 13 quarters before, up 14 quarters afterward. It is a fact, not an opinion.  
   Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 18 percent in the six quarters before the 2003 tax cuts. After, increased 32 percent over the next six quarters; before, down 18 percent; after, up 32 percent. That is a fact, not an opinion. 
   The economy, six quarters before the 2003 tax cuts lost 267,000 jobs. In the six quarters after, increased 307,000 jobs, and, as you well know, since then we have burgeoned by having 7.3 million new jobs since the middle of 2003. 
   What we have tried to do today is try to bring to the American people some truth, some facts as we talk about the budget that will have to be laid out here over the next month to 6 weeks, pointing out the remarkable fallacy of so many of the arguments that are used on the floor of this House to say that, well, we have just got to raise taxes. You have heard some of the Presidential candidates out there on the stump, saying, we have just got to raise taxes. In fact, some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle say just that, nothing we can do except raise taxes. 
   You know and I know that the truth of the matter is that when you look at how the economy operates, how the Federal Government gains revenue, that, in fact, decreasing taxes, maintaining the appropriate tax reductions, allowing the American people to keep more of their hard-earned money is exactly what is the prescription that is necessary for America and for the economy to continue to flourish. 
   So I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I look forward to a spirited debate. I think the question really is, when you get right down to it, the question becomes who ought to decide; who should decide how the American people spend their hard-earned money. Should it be the government? Should it be more government programs? Regardless of whatever area of the society you want to talk about, is it the Federal Government and State governments that ought to be making those decisions? 
   Or should it be, as I and so many of my friends on this side of the aisle believe, that those decisions are better left to individual Americans? They make better decisions about what to do with their hard-earned money when they are allowed to keep their hard-earned money and not have it rolled into the Federal Government as tax revenue. 
   I am pleased to be able to provide hopefully a bit of light, a bit of truth, a bit of fact for this Chamber, and deal with the issues that are coming before us over the next 4 to 6 weeks. I look forward to this discussion on this debate.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (ORWELLIAN EARMARKING -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in his novel, 1984, George Orwell presents this concept of doublethink, which is defined as, ``The power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and accepting both of them.'' 
   I come to the floor today, Mr. Speaker, to review the repetitive lack of openness and accountability that we have seen on this House floor over the last month. Time and again, this new majority has governed on the premise that if you simply just say it, it will become true. It is Orwellian doublethink, an amazing concept. 
   They believe that if you simply just say you are lowering drug prices, poof, it's done, ignoring the reality that prices really won't be lowered and fewer drugs will be made available to our seniors. 
   They believe that if you just say you are implementing all of the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, it changes the fact that the bill that was passed here on the floor doesn't reflect the totality of those recommendations. 
   They believe that if you just say you are cutting interest rates in half for college students, it doesn't matter that in reality you've pulled a bait-and-switch, with the rate cut lasting just 6 months. 
   Mr. Speaker, saying it doesn't make it so. And Democratic doublethink does a disservice to this Nation. 
   Now this makes for great talking points and great press releases, but yields very little for the people back home. Rather than bold policy initiatives, people are starting to realize that the Democratic agenda has been more pop than fizz. And now, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are using this Orwellian newspeak, doublethink, in regard to spending Americans' hard-earned tax dollars. 
   On December 11 of last year, 2006, the two chairmen of the Appropriations Committee in the House and Senate, Obey and Byrd, said, and I quote, ``There will be no congressional earmarks in the joint funding resolution that we will pass.'' No earmarks. But sadly, once again, the facts just don't match the promises. Democratic doublethink is alive and well. 
   The majority used a loophole in the House rules to include millions of dollars of earmarks by simply saying that there were none. Clause 9 of rule XXI of the House rules says that it shall not be in order to consider a bill or joint resolution unless the chairman of each committee of initial referral has a statement that the proposition contains no congressional earmarks. So the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, conveniently submitted to the record on January 29 that prior to the omnibus bill being considered, quote, ``does not contain any congressional earmarks, limited tax benefits, or limited tariff benefits.'' But, in fact, Mr. Speaker, this omnibus spending bill that the Democrats passed last week contained hundreds of millions of dollars of earmarks. Democrat doublethink. 
   If we follow this Democrat policy as long as you submit to the record that there are no earmarks, you can feel free to just load up any appropriations bill with as many earmarks as you like with absolutely no accountability. 
   Their actions completely violate the spirit of our earmarking rule, designed to bring greater transparency to our spending process. Rather than take the new rule seriously, the Democrat majority has used this sly interpretation that essentially allows for unlimited earmarks. In this new Democrat majority, if you just close your eyes and say there are no earmarks, miraculously millions of dollars of earmarks are wasted on things like rain forests in Iowa. 
   This isn't the type of open and honest government that our constituents expected in this Congress. Mr. Speaker, this doublethink is unacceptable to the American people, who work hard every day to provide for their families only to have Washington throw away their money, unsupervised, on pork projects. 
   There was a positive and honest and principled alternative to this spending injustice. Republicans offered an alternative eliminating these earmarks and targeting funds for military housing and drug enforcement. Our friends on the other side of the aisle chose to ignore it and throw money at their pet earmark projects.  
   For 12 years our colleagues on the other side blamed Republicans for every ill under the sun, and now that it is their time to govern, they hide behind bumper sticker and press release politics. Never before has such an enormous amount of taxpayer money been spent so quickly, over $400 billion in one hour. 
   If our friends on the other side of the aisle truly desired to clean up earmarks and bring greater transparency to our spending, why would they then make this their first act? Their actions simply don't match their rhetoric. The American people expect more than a wink and a nod that they have gotten so far from this Democrat majority. Democrat doublethink does a disservice to our Nation. 
   In George Orwell's 1984 Doublethink Newspeak, he said that the lie always was one step ahead of the truth; but the American people are catching up, Mr. Speaker. Just saying something doesn't make it so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding on this extremely important issue. I, too, rise with great respect for the individuals who are Delegates and our Resident Commissioner. I also want to make it certain that I state up front that we commend all of the men and women who fight our battle in this war on terror with the recognition and appreciation that those men and women serve in a voluntary capacity, and our hearts and prayers go out to them and their families. 
   I do want to say, however, Mr. Speaker, that this process is a remarkable abuse of power. I oppose the rule and the underlying bill on the basis of both process and policy, which I believe to be flawed, and also because it is remarkably unconstitutional. 
   I am oftentimes reminded of the Lewis Carroll book, and sometimes I feel that way: Just because you say it is so doesn't make it so. 
   Individuals who promote what we are doing right now believe, in fact, that they can just make up rules at a whim. In fact, we are tied by the ultimate document of our Nation, and that is the United States Constitution. It makes it very clear in that Constitution, Article I, section 2, that the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. It doesn't say territories, it doesn't say the Delegates of the territories, it doesn't say Resident Commissioner. 
   I might, indeed, support a move for statehood for any of those entities. However, this is an unconscionable action. This is a violation of the public trust, and it is a clear abuse of power. 
   Under this strategy, under this Democrat plot, the majority party could seat anybody, anybody, in the House. Who is next? Who would you like to seat next? Howard Dean? He has a significant constituency. Why not have Howard Dean have a seat in the United States House of Representatives and a vote in the Committee of the Whole? 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are disgusted with this level of arrogance and the abuse of power that this demonstrates. I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and to defeat the underlying bill. We will ultimately see the final defeat of this in the Supreme Court of the United States.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the gentleman's leadership and his yielding time. 
   Regrettably, Madam Speaker, the New Year didn't bring any new ideas or new strategy on the part of our majority here. Less than 1 week into this new session, it remains all politics all the time. And you don't have to believe me. Just listen to their chairman, who was quoted in the New York Times on September 17 of last year: ``If the President vetoes this bill, it's a political victory for us.'' So all politics all the time. 
   As has been stated by others, we solved this issue for the time being, the next 18 months, in a bipartisan manner last year, 411-3. And don't believe me if you don't want to. Believe the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, no great friend of our side of the aisle, which says, ``Thanks to the infusion of Federal dollars, Georgia's embattled health insurance program for working class children is safe for another year and even has room to grow if the economy declines. The program called PeachCare, which was disrupted and debated last year by State officials, Congress, and the President, will have enough funding to cover the 254,820 children now enrolled and to grow by up to 40,000 children. `I'm just relieved,' said the State Health Department Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows. `This will ensure these children are taken care of.' 
   ``Relief echoed Monday through the Georgia health care advocacy community, which fought throughout the last year to save the program known as SCHIP. `The advocacy community can do nothing but rejoice.' '' And these comments have been voiced all around the Nation. 
   Last Thursday the Congressional Research Service issued a statement to Georgia officials that said that the State will receive $325 million for the 2008 Federal budget, which runs through October of this year, and that funding level is expected to continue through March of 2009. 
   So this isn't about policy. This isn't about policy. It's all about politics, self-admitted on the other side.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to draw my colleagues' attention to what it is we are doing here today and what they think we might be doing. I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, today we are considering legislation that will change the way the mortgage industry is regulated in its entirety. Not just for the subprime market, in its entirety. 
   I and others are fond of saying that Congress does two things very well: one is nothing and two is overreact. And here today we are considering what the Wall Street Journal has dubbed the Sarbanes-Oxley for the housing industry. As you will recall, Mr. Chairman, there is general consensus that the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation that was passed was indeed an overreaction and resulted in damage to the business arena and also decreased jobs across our Nation. 
   What the Wall Street Journal has said about this bill is that it's ``an attempt to punish business in general for the excesses of an unscrupulous few and the perverse incentives created by Washington policy.'' Hence Sarbanes-Oxley for the housing industry. 
   Now, we have had a period here where some credit, some loans were unwisely given and that allowing individuals, allowing Americans to purchase homes and to realize their American Dream is a good thing. 
   For this reason I am offering an amendment that would limit this legislation to the area of lending that is of most concern today, that is, the subprime arena. Again, this bill regulates more than just the subprime market. Despite the fact that at our hearing in our committee on the legislative proposals, and we had an array of witnesses from all across the market and all across the political spectrum, during 9 hours of hearings, not a single individual, not one, advocated that we change the way that all mortgages are regulated. But that's what we are doing here with this bill today. 
   What we heard from those testifying was that they agreed that the subprime market might be underregulated, but not the prime market, not the jumbo market, not the other markets. What they said was that something needed to be done with the subprime market. Now, why are we here today? Well, there must be something else going on. 
   Later in that hearing, Chairman Frank asked the third panel, comprised of representatives of various segments of the industry, a similar question: Do you think that all of the loans that were made over the last couple of years in the subprime area should have been made? And the panel's answer was clear: no, not all loans. 
   It's worth noting that Mr. Lackritz, the president and CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, appropriately pointed out to the chairman that there was obviously credit that was imprudently granted, but that we have to also think at the same time that it's important that we take a lot of pride in what this committee has done and in what the industry has done to broaden the circle of homeownership. Don't ban that, he said. Don't ban that. Yet that's exactly what will happen if this legislation passes. 
   Mr. Dugan, from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, testified that as a result of this legislation ``some creditworthy borrowers would be denied loans.'' 
   For that reason, I believe it is important that we focus and take a measured approach. Adopt this amendment and we will confine the bill to the area that everyone says needs some assistance, where everyone says there is a problem: the subprime arena. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are 44 million mortgages out there across our Nation. Fourteen percent of them are in the subprime arena. Fifteen percent of those are challenged. That is a challenge for those individuals who are having that difficulty right now, but that doesn't call for entire re-regulation of the overall market. In the prime area, 3 percent of those loans are challenged. All loans, all loans, including prime loans, would be subject to the murky new requirements of this legislation which would require lenders to determine if borrowers have ``a reasonable ability to pay'' or a ``net tangible benefit'' from the refinancing of their loan. There is no reason to restrict the availability and the affordability of prime loans to eligible borrowers, especially when we have demonstrated how well these loans are operating even in today's market. 
   For that reason, I urge the adoption of the amendment. Let's not subject prime loans that are operating well today to the same burdensome regulation that is proposed for subprime loans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my ranking member for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in opposition to this legislation, legislation that prompted the Wall Street Journal to say that this bill is essentially a ``Sarbanes-Oxley for housing, an attempt to punish business in general for the excesses of an unscrupulous few.'' 
   Now, while the chairman and ranking member and other members of the staff have done really remarkable work to address some of the most problematic provisions, this legislation still raises serious concerns about the future access to credit. I believe that this bill will lower homeownership. It will harm the American Dream. 
   A good number of the new duties and requirements which this legislation imposes on loan originators are both vague and highly subject. Words like ``reasonable ability to pay'' and ``net tangible benefit,'' these are required of lenders. This is greater regulation, and, as my friend from Texas said, greater regulation means less liquidity. That means not as much money in the market. That means fewer individuals able to buy homes. 
   Dr. Ronald Utt with the Heritage Foundation says, ``This provision effectively deputizes the mortgage industry as a quality of life police force by requiring them to pass judgment upon what it exactly is that a borrower intends to do with any additional moneys required by the way of loan refinancing.'' This creates increased litigation. 
   In fact, when H.R. 3915 was being marked up in committee, I asked him, the chairman himself, if there was a disagreement between the lender and the borrower about whether something achieved a net tangible benefit, where would that disagreement be settled, and he said, ``Like any disagreements in this country, they go to court.'' 
   The legislation also creates a new civil action for rescission, the ability to get all of one's money back. Clearly the result of this will be less availability of money to buy a house for all, but mostly for those at the lower end of the economic spectrum. 
   Now, there are alternatives. There are positive alternatives: increasing financial literacy, greater flexibility in refinancing, and greater penalties for fraud. And I hope as this process moves forward that we will be able to incorporate those things in a stand-alone bill that increases the ability to achieve the American Dream.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend from California for his wonderful and diligent work in this area, an area that we ought to have had a bipartisan bill. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill is interesting and a curious work product of this House, one that I believe will be troubling to the Nation. What the Democrat majority has done is brought together the ingredients in a huge recipe for bad policy. 
   So far, the new majority has kept the Republicans out of the process. Not a single House Republican, not one, was involved in the conference committee report or signed it. They have manipulated the recommendations of the administration to serve their ulterior motives, and they have disregarded input from key stakeholders and students and parents across this Nation. 
   As a result of this recipe, the Congress has a final product that distorts the reconciliation and puts at risk expanding college access for students over the long term. 
   We predicted, during the debate of the budget resolution, that the ``savings,'' ``savings'' in the reconciliation process were a fig leaf. Today the House is debating a bill which spends nearly $22 billion more in new entitlement spending just to get $750 million in savings. That's fuzzy math. 
   Fact, entitlement growth, automatic spending is unsustainable and consumes more than half the entire Federal budget. It is also fact that if left on autopilot, by 2030 that automatic spending will consume the entire Federal budget. 
   Without true spending reform, entitlements will crowd out all other spending. This bill, H.R. 2669, makes a major mistake of magnifying the problem by adding new entitlement monies. 
   In fact, the conference agreement dedicates $1.17 billion to new automatic spending programs. At a time of run-away spending, the Democratic majority is intent on creating these massive new spending programs instead of dedicating the savings to deficit reduction. Such an approach continues us down the path to fiscal irresponsibility. 
   Now, all of that might be okay if, if the changes offered would truly help students, but they don't. The Democrats have decided to favor a Washington-run bureaucrat student-lending system rather than a flexible, responsive free market alternative. This bill cuts over $22 billion in the Federal Family Education Loan program. The only conceivable reason to do that is to paralyze it and put it at a disadvantage to the direct government loan program or Washington-run program. 
   This is unfortunate because that Federal Family Education Loan program has proven to be far more successful, does a better job of providing student loans. This is reflected in the fact that for nearly every government loan, there are four loans by the Federal Family Education Loan. 
   In the end, Democrats want to cripple this program because they favor a centralized governmental approach to this Nation's challenges. All these drastic cuts do is put at risk the need for students and the access that they will have to a college education over time. 
   For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the bill on the floor.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and to congratulate Mayor Cecil Pruett of Canton, Georgia, on a tremendous career and a well-deserved retirement. A true public servant and outstanding leader, Mayor Pruett will be retiring this month after 12 years as mayor of the City of Canton in Cherokee County, Georgia. 
   Mayor Pruett has always strived to better his community, and his broad experience has served his constituents well. The mayor was formerly the president of the Georgia Municipal Association, president of the Cherokee County Chamber of Commerce, and a member of the Atlanta Regional Executive Committee. 
   An educator, he remains active in leadership posts at Reinhardt College, Georgia Baptist Children's Home, North Georgia Regional Development Center, and his own church where he serves as a deacon. 
   Mayor Pruett oversaw substantial economic growth in Canton over his 12 years, but he has always worked to preserve the small town charm that is a hallmark of Cherokee County. A southern gentleman in every way, Mayor Pruett and his honest leadership will be sincerely missed. We wish Cecil and his wife, Myrna, a happy and a healthy retirement.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for yielding and for his leadership. 
   There's a recurrent theme that we've heard this month and that is from this majority party that continues to lament the work product of this 110th Congress. You'd think they weren't in the majority. 
   But it's time to set the record straight about a couple of items. One is SCHIP. The reason that SCHIP hasn't moved forward in the way that they envisioned is because the American people didn't believe that over half of the American children ought to be on a government-run system. 
   Were there alternatives? Absolutely. The alternative that we put on the table was to reauthorize the program, provide premium assistance for families up to $63,000 and give States greater flexibility. That's a positive solution. 
   In the area of SGR or the physician reimbursement in Medicare, it's important to appreciate that this 6-month extension is wrong. Medicare is woefully flawed. The 6-month extension is an insult to both patients and physicians. 
   What we call for is for bipartisanship, for working together to solve the Medicare physician payment program that works well for patients and works for physicians and makes certain that patients and their families control health care, not government.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for his leadership on this issue and for bringing important distinctions to the floor. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to ask a question, though, of the body, and it's curious what's going on here. The chairman of the subcommittee yielded back his time, didn't even want to engage. 
   Can you hear it, Mr. Chairman? That's silence. That's silence on the part of the majority party because they aren't even interested in defending the spending that is in their bill. 
   Before I came to Congress, I was a physician. I knew that I needed to listen to patients in order to make the right diagnosis. 
   Well, the right diagnosis, Mr. Chairman, here, is that Washington doesn't have a revenue problem; it's got a spending problem. And the ways that the Democrats are moving forward with their spending spree of 2007 are very frightening, as the gentleman before me spoke. 
   There are a couple of ways to pay for it. One, you can charge it. And so they've increased the debt ceiling. They've increased the debt ceiling to over $9 trillion for the first time ever in the history of this Nation. 
   The other way you can pay for it is to tax folks. Mandatory withholding, tax increases. And already we've seen the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation adopted by this majority party. 
   Mr. Chairman, if that were my record, I wouldn't want to talk about it either. I wouldn't want to talk about it either. 
   So I want to commend my friend from Ohio who is standing tall for fiscal responsibility. It's clear that there's a distinction between the majority party and the minority party. And the minority party says, the Republicans say, we believe in fiscal responsibility. We believe that we can hold the line on spending to holding it to where it was last year.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment. This amendment is what became affectionately known as the Hefley amendment. Mr. Hefley was a former Member of the House and offered a 1 percent decrease in the reduction of the increase on appropriations bills routinely. And he no longer serves with us; so many of us believe that it is an appropriate way to try to bring about some kind of fiscal restraint and fiscal responsibility here in the United States Congress. 
   I think it is important to look at the big picture, and the big picture is that we always have to remind ourselves whose money this is. And there is a sense in this Chamber and in Washington that this money is the government's money, that the government somehow makes it and discovers it and that it ought to just spend it willy-nilly. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, as you know, this isn't the government's money; it is the people's money. This money comes to Washington through the hard work of the American taxpayer. And it is imperative that we remember that because only when we remember that will we have that touchstone to make certain we spend it responsibly. 
   What are the big numbers here that we are talking about in the Interior, Environment Appropriations bill? Last year, fiscal year 2007, this bill appropriated $26.4 billion. This year the proposal is to spend $27.6 billion. That is an increase of $1.2 billion, an increase of 9.5 percent, an increase three times the rate of inflation. 
   This amendment would decrease that increase by 1 percent. It would decrease that increase by $276 million. It would trim one penny out of every dollar spent in this appropriations bill. It is the kind of thing that American families all across our Nation do when they find themselves in times when they are spending more than they are taking in, which is what the Federal Government is doing, spending more than we are taking in. 
   This is a responsible amendment. It starts us down that road of being fiscally responsible. It tells the American people that we care about their budget and in caring about their budget, we will be responsible with the Federal budget. It will begin to restore some of that trust that the American people have lost in Washington's ability to restrain spending. 
   So I offer this amendment in good faith. I believe it is an appropriate way to begin the process of gaining back fiscal responsibility here in Washington. I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I find that particularly offensive to the American people. This is not government's money. It is the American taxpayers' money. It is incumbent upon the party that is proposing to spend billions and billions of dollars to increase the debt ceiling in this Nation over $9 trillion for the first time, to ignore the entitlement spending, to ignore $50 trillion in liability. This is the majority party that is silent, silent when it comes to this kind of spending. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to reconsider their desire not to defend their spending.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I appreciate the attempt at defending the remarkable increased spending on the part of the majority party. To describe this amendment as a devastating cut is curious. Only in Washington is a decrease in the increase a cut. 
   It's important that the American people appreciate that the proposal of the majority party is to spend in this bill $27.6 billion. This amendment, if enacted would provide for the spending of $27.4 billion, hardly, Mr. Chairman, a devastating cut. 
   I would also ask my good friend from Washington to simply read the amendment. It talks about an across-the-board cut. The amendment states that ``appropriations made by this Act are hereby reduced in the amount of $276 million.'' That's not an across-the-board cut. That's a 1 percent reduction in the total allocation in this bill. So it is disingenuous of my good friend to make those kinds of comments. 
   I would also say that he says that we need to move quickly. I would say, Mr. Chairman, that any time we spend defending the American taxpayer is time well spent. 
   And then they talk about priorities. Mr. Chairman, the correct priority we have is defending the American taxpayer. 
   I am pleased to yield 1 minute to my good friend from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).

   I just would point out to my good friend from Ohio that no specific programs are identified in this decrease in the increase. So to identify specific programs is a spurious argument, truly. 
   I would also say that this points out fundamentally the difference between the two parties. We believe fundamentally that individuals spend their money more wisely than the government. It is clear that the majority party does not believe that. They believe that they spend the taxpayer money much more wisely. We just think that is a fundamental difference.

   I appreciate my good friend from Colorado for yielding. I want to commend as well my friend from Washington, the subcommittee chairman, for the work that he has done and the ranking member for work that they have done. The subcommittee chairman said that there was nothing personal in his opposition to this amendment, and that's true. There is absolutely nothing personal here in this Chamber. 
   But this discussion is personal to the American taxpayer, and it's all about priorities. We have offered today a series of amendments. One amendment said we ought to spend exactly what we spent last year, tens of billions of dollars in this area of the government. The majority party declined to accept that amendment. 
   Then we offered an amendment that said instead of increasing spending by 9.5 percent, we ought to increase spending by 8.5 percent, and they said, no, they weren't interested in that. 
   So the gentlelady from Colorado says, well, if you can't save $1 out of every $100, how about 50 cents? How about 50 cents out of every $100? 
   What Congress is spending in this appropriations bill and in every appropriations bill, because of the increase in spending, is money that we don't have. It's money that the Congress doesn't have. This money represents the debt that Congress is burdening on future generations, our children, and our grandchildren. It is simply time, it's time for Washington to stop finding ways to spend more money.  
   I commend the gentlelady from Colorado for her amendment. I urge my colleagues to support her amendment by decreasing by one half of 1 percent the increase in this appropriations bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this amendment would strike section 738 of this legislation, which, as drafted, would have the same effect as language already included in a number of the Democrat majority's other appropriations bills, preventing funds from being spent to conduct public/private competitions. 
   While this policy may be good for increasing dues payments to public-sector union bosses, it is unquestionably bad for taxpayers and for Federal agencies because agencies are left with less money to spend on their core mission when Congress takes the opportunity to save money through competition away from them. 
   In 2006, Federal agencies ``competed'' only 1.7 percent of their commercial workforce, which makes up less than one-half of 1 percent of the entire civil workforce. This very small use of competition for services is expected to generate savings of $1.3 billion over the next 10 years. Competitions completed since 2003 are expected to produce almost $7 billion in savings for taxpayers over the next 10 years. This means that taxpayers will receive a return of about $31 for every dollar spent on competition, with annualized expected savings of more than $1 billion. 
   But the particular language included in this bill is even worse. The underlying language goes further than past Democrat efforts to gut public/private competition by unnecessarily delaying and complicating how the most efficient delivery of commercial activities is determined. This newest attempt to stack the deck against competition for services that can easily be found in the Yellow Pages also creates uneven and duplicative protest rights and intrusive new data requirements, while ignoring the consideration of quality in determining the best source of commercial services for the taxpayer. 
   In short, Mr. Chairman, by allowing this language to remain in the underlying legislation, approximately $200 million in expected annual savings from planned competitions will be placed at risk. 
   Additionally, by removing quality from the list of factors in determining who wins a competition, this bill would double costs in many competitions. In this time of stretched budgets and bloated Federal spending, Congress should be looking to use all of the tools it can to find taxpayer savings and reduce the cost of services that are already being provided by thousands of hardworking private companies nationwide. 
   At this point I will insert into the Record a letter of support for this amendment from the Fair Competition Coalition. A portion of that letter reads, This provision will discourage many private-sector firms from participating in the competitive sourcing contracting process. Section 738 would penalize private-sector bidders that offer health insurance benefits to their employees. The Office of Management and Budget reports that the competition under the A-76 process creates an average savings of 15 to 20 percent for the American taxpayer.

   I, too, have respect, as well we all do, for all Federal employees. But this is serious business. Spending the taxpayers' money is serious business. And outsourcing does one thing, private contracting does one thing: It provides for an opportunity to save hard-earned taxpayer money. 
   The majority says that they oppose and fight adamantly as they oppose no-bid contracts. So how can be it be consistent to oppose a competitive contracting process that allows private firms the opportunity to have outsource contracts? 
   This is a commonsense amendment. I offer it on behalf of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions). 
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense, fiscally responsible amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for yielding, and I think the underlying bill has some merit. 
   I'm curious, my friend from Oregon getting so exercised and excited about this debate. I appreciate his passion. I would, however, correct his amnesia because bill after bill after bill that resulted in legislation passed through this House that would increase American-made energy for Americans did so over the previous 6 years before this Democrat majority came into office and was stymied in the Senate by 41 Democrats. That's all it takes in the Senate, as you know, Mr. Speaker. That's all it takes. 
   So what we heard over the last 5 weeks--I know it's what my friend from Oregon heard at home--is that the American people are tired of all this. They want action. They want American-made energy for Americans. They want to decrease our dependence on foreign oil, and they want action. 
   And so over the last 2 days we've been debating bill after bill, and they've been some wonderful bills. We've named a number of post offices. We've done a lot of interesting work, but what we haven't done is address the number one issue of the American people, and that is the high cost of gasoline and energy. 
   So we look forward with great anticipation to the bill that will be rolled out later this week. Granted it hasn't been an open process. Granted it hasn't been a fair process. But we hope that an open rule will allow that bill to come to the floor so that we can have an opportunity to have Members of this House of Representatives, as the rules would allow, have input, to represent their constituents, again, on the most important issue of the day. 
   We hope that the bill doesn't include remarkable tax increases on domestic  oil producers so this Democrat majority takes us further in the direction of dependence on foreign oil. We hope that isn't the case. 
   We hope that the bill doesn't include ridiculous components that make it so that it would be impossible to utilize 80 percent of the resources that we have offshore.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it's that time of day in the House business when Members of the House have the right and the privilege to come to the floor and speak to colleagues both here and back in their offices and to constituents via the cameras for a period of 5 minutes. And you've heard some important speeches tonight, some heartfelt speeches, various topics, issues that Members of Congress felt were the most important thing that they could communicate today, and it's their right and their privilege. 
   Why do I bring that up? Well, on August 1, Friday, August 1, the last day before the 5-week paid vacation that the Speaker sent everybody on from the House of Representatives, the Speaker brought down the gavel at 11:23 a.m. before more than 40 Members of the House of Representatives were given the right and the privilege of addressing this Chamber. 
   Why? Well, it appeared that the Speaker wasn't interested in having the message that we were concerned about as we were summarily dismissed across this Nation to be delivered. And what was that topic we were concerned about? Mr. Speaker, it is the number one issue for Americans: the high cost of gasoline, the high cost of energy. And the Speaker said, no, go on home. 
   So what happened then was a spontaneous uprising, a spontaneous speak-in of over 134 members of the Republican Conference who came back and stayed not just that day, but there were members of the Republican Conference every single day here in Washington on the floor of this House, with lights dimmed, with cameras off, with microphones silenced, speaking to constituents about the number one issue of the day: the high cost of energy. 
   So we've been back in town now a little over 24 hours. Each of us had gone home for a period of that time, that 5-week period of time, and heard from our constituents about their concerns. And their concerns are based primarily on the economy, which is based primarily on the high cost of energy. 
   So when you see jobs lost, when you see the unemployment rate rise, it's directly related to the inaction of this Congress on the number one issue of the day: increasing gas prices. 
   We've had a bill that we have put before the House of Representatives that we believe addresses all of the above; that says we ought to embrace all of the solutions that we can as America; that we ought to end our dependence and our reliance on foreign oil; that we ought to increase our domestic production of oil; that we ought to increase our incentives for conservation; and that we ought to rapidly explore alternative fuels and alternative resources. That's what we believe ought to be done. But the Speaker and the Democrat leadership, the majority Democrat Party in this House of Representatives says, no, not going to allow that. 
   What are they afraid of? What are they afraid of, Mr. Speaker? Well, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, it's just all politics all the time. They believe they are beholden to a group in this Nation that doesn't want to increase American energy. Their friends on the other side of the aisle are saying, as we approach this election season, are you better off now than you were 4 years ago or 8 years ago or they will pick a time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask you, are you better off now than you were 2 years ago? Just 2 years ago. Because what's changed in this 2-year period of time is that we have leadership now in the House of Representatives that refuses to address the number one issue. 
   We believe that the American Energy Act is what ought to come to the floor. We implore the Speaker to put this bill on the floor and have an up-or-down vote, have debate like it ought to occur in this House, not close debate, not silence Members in this House of Representatives. Have an up-or-down vote on the American Energy Act, an all-of-the-above approach to energy independence. 
   That is what American people support, an all-of-the-above policy. Over 80 percent of them have said, yes, we ought to do all of these things. We ought to do more conservation. We ought to make certain that we have renewable fuels and explore as much as possible to find those new technologies, and we ought to make certain that we increase American supply of energy for Americans. That's all we ask, Mr. Speaker. 
   So during this period of time, I thought it was appropriate that since we weren't able to give speeches on August 1, that I come and share the message that is the most important message that the American people want to hear, and that is, that the United States House of Representatives will get down to work and do what the American people desire, and that is pass an all-of-the-above energy policy.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I go home, as most Members of Congress do, every weekend and talk with constituents and try to get a sense of what their concerns are and make certain that we are representing them responsibly here, and upon my last visits home on the weekends over the past 3 or 4 months, their concerns are the concerns of Americans all across this country, and that is the concern of energy prices, of gas prices. They aren't just concerned, Madam Speaker; they are mad. They are mad because they see absolute and utter inaction here in the United States Congress. American values and American vision dictates that we do all we can to solve the challenge that we have before us as it relates to gas prices.     
   Four dollars a gallon, we hit that mark over this past weekend. 
   I wonder what price per gallon it will take to get this Democrat majority to act, to work to increase supply. Is it $5 a gallon, $6 a gallon, is it $10 a gallon? Will it happen then that this Democrat majority will then allow this Congress to vote on increasing supply? 
   Now, there are all sorts of things that ought to be done. The kinds of things that have been described by my friend on the other side of the aisle are appropriate, and we ought to do them. I support, strongly, conservation. We can do a lot more in the area of conservation and should incentivize conservation. 
   I support, strongly, finding that alternative fuel and incentivizing genius of the American people to identify what that is so that future generations won't be reliant on fossil fuel. But right now, it's imperative that we work to increase supply. 
   This problem isn't new. This distinction between folks on the Democrat side of the aisle and the Republican party on this side of the aisle isn't new. We have had vote after vote after vote over the past 10 or 15 years on increasing the supply of oil in this Nation, and time after time after time our friends on the other side of the aisle have not risen to the occasion. You talk about Alaska exploration, ANWR exploration, House Republicans have supported that 91 percent of the time, 91 percent of House Republicans have supported Alaska exploration; Democrats, 86 percent have opposed it. 
   Jay Leno, I don't know if you heard, Jay Leno said Democrats right now say that it will take 10 years if we explore in Alaska to realize any new gasoline, and then he said, that's exactly what they said 10 years ago. 
   It goes on and on. Coal-to-liquid technology, 97 percent of Republicans have supported coal-to-liquid technology, 78 percent of Democrats have opposed coal-to-liquid technology. Oil-shale exploration, every time it has come up 97 percent of Republicans have supported it; House Democrats, 86 percent have opposed it. Deep-sea exploration, House Republican support, 81 percent; House Democrats, 83 percent opposed. 
   What about increasing refining capacity? House Republicans, 97 percent support; House Democrats, 96 percent opposed. So 91 percent, in summary, of House Republicans, have historically voted to increase the production of American-made oil and gas and 86 percent of House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. 
   It has been said that every other Nation on Earth views their natural resources as an economic asset. House Democrats, this majority, believes that natural resources in this land are an environmental hazard. 
   What do we do? Well, I want to commend Representative Tim Walberg of Michigan, who is leading the fight to decrease gas prices. He has filed a discharge petition on House Resolution 3089, which will increase refining construction and capacity, boost alternative energy development, provide incentives to increase nuclear energy and allow for environmentally friendly domestic oil production. 
   I call on the Speaker, and I call on the leadership of this House to bring this commonsense bill to the floor. These are real solutions for the American people, American energy for Americans. It's the American vision, it's the American values that are across this land. 
   The American people understand and appreciate the challenges we face. They just can't understand and appreciate why this majority won't act to increase supply.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, my constituents and Americans are asking, where is the bill? When will House Democrats bring forward a real plan for families being hammered by record gas prices? 
   Today, the majority will spend hours considering no less than 10 nonbinding resolutions. Yet this Democrat Congress will do nothing, nothing, about outrageous energy prices. We fill the day with recognitions and commemorations, but there is no urgency for struggling Americans. 
   It is shameful that with energy prices rising 70 percent on their watch, House Democrats remain stubbornly opposed to offering any ideas to increase supply and lower gas prices. All we see from this majority is brazen neglect. 
   Republicans, on the other hand, have brought forward an energy action plan. We are ready to act. We are ready to increase American-made energy resources. We are ready to provide a broad mix of energy options. We are ready to streamline regulations allowing for increasing refining capacity. We are ready to help. 
   Madam Speaker, we are ready. Americans are begging to know, when will this Democrat majority be?

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (PORK-BARREL SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend from Texas for organizing this period of time and for highlighting what Americans all across this land are concerned about, and that is the culture of spending that you talked about, and you mentioned these wonderful promises that were going to be enacted with this new majority. 
   And there is a culture of spending that continues and persists, but there's also a culture of hypocrisy. It's saying one thing and doing another. It's saying one thing on the campaign trail, and then when you come to Washington, you do something exactly the opposite. And when I go home to the Sixth District of Georgia, that's what I hear about. I hear people say, ``Why on Earth can't people live up to their word? Why can't they do what they said they were going to do when they ran for office?'' 
   And the spending is one of the things that gets them so terribly irritated and so terribly annoyed because they see it. My good friend from Texas talked about selling a piece of the Green Mountains in Vermont to a specific entity. That's using hard-earned taxpayer money to benefit one entity. Madam Speaker, that's wrong. That's not the way we ought to do business here. 
   In fact, it hasn't been the way forever. There are some wonderful quotes about pork barrel spending, about earmarks. One from Thomas Jefferson, who said that, in essence, if we allow the process of earmarking, pork barrel spending, to go forward, ``it will be a scene of eternal scramble among the Members, who can get the most money wasted in their State; and they will always get most who are the meanest,'' which is a phenomenal quote when you think about it, Madam Speaker, because what we have now are individuals in this House of Representatives who have been so successful in getting earmarks, getting pork barrel money back to their districts that we now have defense contractors in this Nation who are moving their headquarters to one specific district in Pennsylvania because they believe it will benefit them to a greater degree in getting contracts from the Federal Government. A phenomenal thing. 
   Madam Speaker, this process is corrupt and it's corrupting. When I talk to folks back home about why it's imperative that we stop the earmarking process, something that I believe we must do, and I tell them that it's corrupt and it's corrupting, that didn't have the resonance until I put a face on that, a face that we have seen in this House by so many individuals but it's most championed in a corrupt way by a gentleman by the name of Duke Cunningham. 
   Duke Cunningham now sits in a Federal prison in California. He does so because he earmarked money for a personal company, that benefited one company, one company, and then they, in turn, benefited him politically. And it's happened on both sides of the aisle. But it's a process that's corrupt and it's corrupting. 
   Now, why do I mention Duke Cunningham by name, Madam Speaker? I do so because when he came to Washington, he was the individual who was the inspiration for the ``Top Gun'' movie. He was a war hero. He was an American hero. And what happened with the process of Washington was that the corruption and the corrupting influence of Washington spending that is being perpetrated and continued and expanded by this majority, that process corrupted that individual. Now, there were certainly some personal characteristic flaws, but the process itself that remains in place right now and, in fact, is being championed by this majority is a corrupt process and it's corrupting. 
   Madam Speaker, I would suggest to all of my colleagues that this is a process and a system that has got to end. It's got to end. The American people want fiscal responsibility. They want to make certain that they have financial security and peace of mind. That peace of mind will never come when we have a process that is this sordid, that is this offensive to the American people. 
   So I want to commend my good friend from Texas for his remarkable leadership in this and so many areas in Congress, a conservative stalwart, an individual who understands the importance of being fiscally responsible at the Federal level and the consequences of not being fiscally responsible, which means that middle class Americans all across this Nation are having more of their hard-earned taxpayer money taken out of their back pocket, out of their wallet, and out of their purses in order to fund the reckless spending, irresponsible spending, culture of spending, and culture of hypocrisy that this majority has brought to Washington. 
   So I want to commend my good friend from Texas, and thank you so very much for the opportunity and the privilege of joining you tonight. I thank you for your leadership in this area.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to welcome to Washington, DC, a special group of World War II veterans from Georgia's Sixth District. These proud patriots are here for one remarkable day as part of the Honor Flight Program. 
   Thanks to the generosity of the Roswell Rotary Club, these men and women will have the opportunity to visit the stirring World War II memorial built in their honor and to pay their respect to fallen comrades at Arlington National Cemetery. 
   As young Americans, these proud patriots showed courage and compassion, answering the call to serve at a time of great need. Through amazing sacrifice, they are responsible for the preservation of our treasured American way of life. Our community is extremely proud to be home to so many of the brave veterans who fought for freedom at a critical moment in our history. 
   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of Georgia's Sixth District, I offer our deepest appreciation. And I know that my colleagues will join me in welcoming our veterans to our Nation's capital and thanking them, these soldiers of the greatest generation, for their invaluable service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, once again this misguided Democrat majority is looking to set a record. But like their tally for broken promises and historic tax increases, this isn't a record of which anyone should be proud. No, Madam Speaker, this Democrat leadership is overseeing the record price of gasoline. 
   Today, the national average for gas reached $3.44 a gallon, an all-time high. The American people want to know what Congress is going to do about it, but a crisis of leadership in this Congress continues to leave American families struggling to fill up their tank. 
   Under this leadership, the price at the pump has shot up more than a dollar a gallon in just 16 months. Now on the campaign trail, they talked about a commonsense plan to bring down gasoline prices. Yet instead of easing the pain at the pump, this majority offers only more gas taxes and less domestic production, and the gas bill only rises. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people demand relief, and their pleas are being ignored. That is the definition of leadership lacking.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Representative Gary Miller to recognize the importance of homeownership in America and to commend him on his resolution. 
   On May 29, 2008, President Bush designated June as Homeownership Month, as he has done for the past 7 years. To complement this designation, this resolution, H. Res. 1271, provides congressional recognition of National Homeownership Month and the importance of homeownership in the United States. 
   Owning a home is a fundamental part of the American dream and is the largest personal investment most families will ever make. For millions of families across this country, a home is more than just a symbol of the American dream. It is the backbone of the American way of life.     
   Despite all that's occurring in the housing market, we need to remember that homeownership has historically been the single largest creator of wealth for most Americans. Not only does homeownership provide economic security by building wealth over time; it also strengthens and builds communities. Affordable housing is vital to resolving the current crisis the United States' housing market has in preserving homeownership. 
   National Homeownership Month is a reminder of the importance of housing issues in America. This bipartisan resolution, 1271, recognizes the need for National Homeownership Month and for the overall importance of homeownership in America. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution to reinforce our commitment to housing opportunities and to help guarantee the dream of homeownership for more American families. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

There are remarkable programs that have helped, literally, millions of Americans remain in their homes, programs that we strongly support and encourage the expansion of.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the chairman, and I'm pleased to come to the floor today and offer this amendment. And it's a little different vein and spirit than we've offered other appropriate fiscally responsible amendments for other appropriations bills, but it's similar. But I urge my colleagues to listen closely, because the nuance has changed greatly. 
   Before I do begin, though, I want to make certain that any Member listening, or anybody who has heard the previous discussion and the assertion that the amendments that are offered by this group of fiscally responsible individuals can't even get a majority of our own conference, that's not true. But there's a lot of untruth spoken on this floor. For a significant majority of the Members of at least the Republican side of the aisle clearly support fiscally responsible amendments. I'm hoping and praying for the day that our friends on the other side join us in that. 
   I do agree with my friends who spoke previously that this is about priorities. It is indeed about priorities. This amendment before us today would reduce the increase in the spending in this portion of the appropriations bills by $750 million a year, or $7.5 billion over 10 years. Mr. Chairman, I would ask that you remember that number, $7.5 billion over 10 years, because it's there for a reason. 
   But before I get into the specific reasons of that, I want to talk a little bit about the process and the disappointment that so many of us on this side of the aisle have in this process, and so the disappointment that many folks who have to be muted on the other side have in the process. 
   There were grand promises of bipartisanship as we began this session of Congress earlier this year. And bipartisanship is the least that we have had on virtually every single issue. And I understand at the beginning the new majority felt that they had to move forward with many of their issues, and that's appropriate. That's appropriate. That's their due, given the results of last November. 
   However, what we've seen recently has buried any guise of bipartisanship. And, in fact, the last 2 weeks have been astounding and actually point to more astounding activities over the next 10 days. 
   The SCHIP bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Plan, which was adopted in a bipartisan way 10 years ago, is up for reauthorization; and now this new majority plans in a unilateral and anti-bipartisanship way to cut Medicare to aid State bureaucracies; cut Medicare and give that money to State bureaucracies in an anti-bipartisan way. 
   The flood insurance bill we've got in the committee right now that passed last year never got through the Senate but passed the House last year. It passed, over 400 individuals to 4. And now we have in our committee today an anti-bipartisan bill that belies any attempt at bipartisanship by the other side. 
   And then the farm bill that was alluded to by my good friend from Georgia just a little bit ago. This farm bill that's going to be on the floor apparently tomorrow or today, depending on when the majority decides to bring it, came out of committee virtually unanimously, virtually unanimously, both sides of the aisle, bipartisan. And yet over the past 24 hours what we have seen is an anti-bipartisan bill that puts in that bill a tax increase of $7.5 billion. 
   Mr. Chairman, you remember the $7.5 billion that I mentioned before. 
   So this amendment before us today is an amendment to reduce the increase from 3.1 percent over last year's bill to 1.6 percent. So it would take that reduction in the increase and would utilize $750 million a year, or $7.5 billion to, attribute to the farm bill that would then make it so there wouldn't have to be any tax increases that my friends on the other side so love, but there wouldn't have to be any tax increases for that portion of the farm bill. 
   This is a fiscally responsible way. This is the kind of flexibility that I believe our constituents desire when they ask Congress and they ask Washington to be responsive to their needs, to respect their pocketbook, to make certain that they are able to keep more of their hard-earned money and not be subject to the kind of remarkable tax increases that we've seen by the other side of the aisle. 
   So I would encourage my colleagues to adopt this amendment, utilize those extra monies that the majority is so adept at finding, make it so that the farm bill needs no tax increases whatsoever. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I'm somewhat amused by my friend's comments. It brings to mind what I have come to describe this Congress as, and that is the Orwellian democracy that we see day in and day out. The accusation is that this side of the aisle spent too much money, so that side of the aisle is going to ``stop digging.'' Well, they're stopping digging to the tune of a 3.1 percent increase, billions of dollars of increase. So their response to don't spend that much is let's spend more. And that's where the Orwellian democracy comes in. 
   And the accusation from the other side that comes, that says, well, you don't want to spend this, you're going to cut this program, you're going to cut COPS, you're going to cut programs that are vital to our Nation, it's kind of like having your child come to you and say, I'd like to have an increase in my allowance. And say they were getting $5 a week. They wanted $10 a week, and you settled on $7.50 a week, and then your son or your daughter says, hey, you just cut my allowance by $2.50. That doesn't make any sense. But that's the argument. That's the argument on the other side. 
   So we endeavor to have fiscal responsibility. We endeavor to be responsible with the hard-earned tax money of the American worker.

   The fact of the matter is the departments that run these programs that we are addressing right here asked for $2.3 billion less than our good friends on the other side are proposing us to spend, which means that they believe they can accomplish the goals that have been given to them with $2.3 billion less. 
   And they talk about all this wonderful caring they have for families. Well, the largest tax increase in the history of our Nation that they passed in their budget, about $2,700 per family, is a peculiar way of showing you are caring for the American family.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I do want to point out that there isn't a corporation in this world that pays taxes that don't come from somewhere other than the back pockets of the American people. There isn't a single corporation in this Nation that doesn't pay taxes where that money doesn't come from individuals. 
   Corporations don't pay taxes; it's passed through, it goes to the individual. So to say that any increase in taxes on corporations doesn't affect the American people is ridiculous. It's ridiculous. To talk about the oil companies that have their taxes increased, all that the majority has done is driven us to greater reliance on foreign oil. 
   This amendment would decrease the increase of spending in this portion of the appropriations bill by 1.4 percent, $750 million a year, $7.5 billion over 10 years, in order to cover what the majority says is the desire and the need to have a tax increase for the farm bill. 
   This is the kind of fiscally responsible spending and appropriations that the American people are demanding. They aren't interested in a government that is so large that it can take away everything that they need. They believe they can make better decisions with their money than the government makes with their money. 
   And so we strongly urge our colleagues to adopt this amendment to avoid a tax increase on the farm bill.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise and with all due respect would ask my colleagues to simply read the amendment. The amendment states, total appropriations made in this act are hereby reduced by $750 million. That is not an across-the-board cut. That allows the agencies to determine where best they are able to absorb a decrease in the increase that they would be provided by this underlying bill. What we challenge with this 1.4 percent reduction in the increase is for each of those agencies to find 14 cents out of every $10. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that is what families do all across this Nation every day. So our priorities are the American family. Our priorities are the American family. We take our responsibility seriously to keep it fiscally prudent and fiscally responsible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues who are endeavoring to bring about some responsible spending here in Washington. I think this debate is helpful. It is helpful for the American people, because what it demonstrates is a difference in philosophy. 
   Before I get to the specifics of my amendment, I want to mention, we have just heard a litany of projects that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee said would be cut with the previous amendment, and he went through: No Child Left Behind cut $1.2 billion; title I, $684 million; IDEA, $519 million; Pell Grants, $717 million cut. 
   In fact, Mr. Chairman, what the American people understand is that the amendment that was just proposed would keep funding level. Not cut, level, which means that there wouldn't be any decreases over this current year of spending; there would be the same amount of money. It is what Americans do every year when they have a difficult challenge financially. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that we have a difficult challenge financially this year in our Nation. And, consequently, to label those things cuts just isn't so. 
   But I rise to offer my amendment, which is affectionately known as the Hefley amendment. Former Congressman Joel Hefley from Colorado offered this amendment on multiple occasions. It is a 1 percent reduction in the increase of this Appropriations bill. 
   Now, to look at the big picture, look at where we are in terms of numbers right now, this current year enacted for this portion of the Federal Appropriations covered $144.6 billion. The President's request, the administration's request, as we all know, was less than that, $140.9 billion. The bill that we have before us is $151.7 billion; $10.8 billion more than the administration's request, more than the request of those that we charge for running this portion of our Nation. 
   My amendment that I am offering now would, instead of having this bill be $151.7 billion, would say let's have it be $150.2 billion. So, a significant increase over last year but a 1 percent reduction from the increase, an increase that would be greater than the rate of inflation but a 1 percent reduction than that that comes from the committee. And the reason for that is because of the financial situation that we find ourselves in as a Nation. 
   If you, Mr. Chairman, or I or any of our constituents find themselves in a situation where they need to save some money, then oftentimes what they will do is say we need to cut back across the board on the kinds of things that we are spending. And this amendment simply states that, out of a 1 percent cut, we ought to be able to find one penny out of every dollar to save for our children's future. And the rationale for that is because it is not our money, Mr. Chairman, it is not Congress's money. It is the hard-earned money of the American taxpayer. And we hear a lot about priorities, and we ought to be prioritizing. And that is what budgetary bills are, that is what appropriations bills are, making priority judgments for the hard-earned American taxpayer money. Our priority on this side is that hardworking American taxpayer. 
   So we rise to offer this amendment that we believe to be a responsible amendment. It outlines the differences between the two sides very clearly. We believe that there ought to be at least one penny out of every dollar that we ought to be able to find in terms of savings for this area for the next year, and offer it sincerely and honestly and respectfully. I would encourage my colleagues to accept the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

It was a bit of an Orwellian speech there, because the actions of this bill don't match the wonderful sunshine that the gentleman paints, but that is all right, because that continues to be the mantra that we hear. 
   Americans know that when you hear the word ``investment'' in this Chamber that what that means is taxes, and it points out the fundamental difference between the majority party and the minority party. The majority party believes that government spends hardworking American taxpayer money better than hardworking American taxpayers. That is the fundamental difference, and that is what this discussion is about. So I am pleased that the gentleman who just spoke shed light on that, because he indeed did.

It troubles me and many on our side that we're not proceeding with that business today, and I think that it's important that we know, the Nation knows, Representatives here know that this House is not acting when it could, and I would suggest respectfully, Mr. Leader, we should.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time and continuing to reserve the right to object, the gentleman certainly knows that this has been extended from August until earlier this month. And then we agreed to a 14-day extension, until this evening. We believe, as I know you know well, our side believes that this needs to be adopted. Bipartisan action in the Senate proceeded along those lines and agrees that it ought to be adopted. We believe that letting the time lapse further only brings significant potential detriment to our Nation. So we strongly believe that it needs to be adopted. 
   You know that we're not in the majority. We're in the minority. Thirty-four of your Members voted not to extend for 21 days. Not to extend. Your  side, the majority, could have adopted an extension had you been able to muster the votes, but we don't have the majority. We're at your disposal, if you will. But we strongly believe that here we are in a Chamber that is virtually empty, and in fact I would suggest, Mr. Leader, respectfully, that we're abrogating our duties as representatives of the people.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I would just point out once again that this has been delayed from August until earlier this month, and then 14 days, or until this evening. I respect the leader greatly, but frankly many, the vast majority if not all Members on our side, never believed that the majority party would, in fact, allow this to lapse. And so to unilaterally disarm us, as many folks have described this action on the part of the majority, is something that was, we felt, unconscionable.

We look at the world and we see al Qaeda threatening to assassinate the Filipino President. We look at the world in, I believe, realistic eyes, and we cannot believe that this House will leave this Nation exposed to threats in this time in our history. It just is astounding to us. 
   And so I rise, Mr. Speaker, to reserve the right to object, because I believe strongly that the majority of Members of this House, if given the opportunity, would support the bill that came from the Senate. 
   I am pleased to yield under the reservation to my friend from California.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (GAS PRICES AND ENERGY SUPPLY IN THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, here it is, Monday, at 12:38 p.m. We find the House back in order for another week. What will we be doing this week? 
   Well, Madam Speaker, we're going to pass a bill that recognizes the achievements of America's high school valedictorians of the class of 2008. We're going to pass a bill honoring the life and musical accomplishments and contributions of Louis Jordan on the 100th anniversary of his birth. We're going to pass a bill that recognizes Pittsfield, Massachusetts as being the home of the earliest known reference to the word ``baseball'' in the United States. We're going to pass a bill supporting the goals and ideals of Black Music Month and to honor the outstanding contributions of African American singers. We're going to pass a bill expressing the sense of Congress that schools in the United States should honor the contributions of individuals from the territories of the United States. We're going to pass a bill naming a veterans' outpatient clinic in Wenatchee, Washington. We're going to pass a bill naming a veterans' center in Tampa, Florida. We're going to pass a bill recognizing National Homeownership Month and the importance of homeownership in the United States. We're going to pass a bill expressing support for the designation of September 2008 as the Gospel Music Heritage Month. We're going to pass a bill naming a post office in Indianola, Mississippi. We're going to pass a bill honoring the life of Robert Mondavi. 
   Madam Speaker, all of those are important things, and they would be fine for us to do if we were dealing with the number one issue of Americans across this Nation, and that is the issue of gas prices and energy supply in the United States. 
   Last week, the Speaker told us that we would be dealing with the issue this week, possibly, although it's not on the list--but possibly--and there may be four bills that they'll bring forward, that the majority party will bring forward. One is to increase regulation. That ought to do a lot to increase supply. One is to require that oil companies holding Federal leases use them or lose them. That will not do much to increase supply because it's already the law of the land. We're going to pass a bill to pay transit fares--bus tickets--for folks. It's not a bad idea, maybe, but what will that do for supply? We're going to pass an antiprice-gouging measure that the House has already passed on a number of occasions. That's not doing a thing for supply. 
   Facts are troubling things, and the fact right now is that this House of Representatives is doing nothing, nothing to increase the supply of gasoline for the United States, nothing to increase American energy for Americans. Consequently, what we see are record gas prices continuing--$4.08 over the weekend, $4.10, I understand, today. There are a couple of other interesting facts, Madam Speaker. 
   The United States has expanded its dependence on foreign members of OPEC by a full 7 percent in 2007 alone. 
   Another fact, Madam Speaker, is that the United States is the only developed nation in the world that forbids safe energy production on its Outer Continental Shelf, deep sea exploration. The only nation in the world. 
   Another fact, Madam Speaker, is that the U.S. Minerals Management Service estimates that America's Outer Continental Shelf contains nearly 86 billion barrels of oil, enough oil to replace OPEC imports for 50 years. 
   Another fact, Madam Speaker, is that, when bills to increase the supply of gas for Americans and American energy for Americans have come to the floor of this House, 81 percent of the time, Republicans have supported those bills; 83 percent of the time, Democrats have opposed those bills. 
   So the law of supply and demand is clear. If you increase supply, you decrease the cost, and you decrease the price at the pump. So, yes, we need to conserve. Yes, we need to make certain that we find alternative fuel sources for the future, but right now, in the short term, in the near term, it's incumbent upon this House to make certain that we increase supply. 
   American energy for Americans. 
   There are easy ways to do that. What we demand is that the House be allowed to vote.

   Mr. Chairman, I have just received a copy of this amendment, but I am somewhat bemused by the amendment. I guess that what the author means is that he is saying that he doesn't believe that the assistant administrator of the Office of Research and Development of the EPA would even consider these institutions. 
   It would be my belief and understanding that this individual would consider all institutions where there is appropriate research being done that could be helpful. I am somewhat bemused by it. I am tempted to offer an amendment that would have the individual look at institutions in my fair State that are doing wonderful work. In fact, each one of us could offer amendments that would identify particular institutions in our jurisdiction.

I think this amendment, however, points out kind of the folly of what is going on here with this bill. 
   As you know, Mr. Chairman, this legislation came through last year under suspension, passed by, as I understand it, unanimous vote. I think that we will all support this because it is motherhood and apple pie. But it doesn't add to the appropriate discussion of the real issue here, which is trying to make certain that we have an energy-independent policy for our Nation.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the comments from the gentleman from Texas. And I guess one of his comments that this bill would save $30 billion on a $10 million investment means that he would support dynamic scoring through CBO, which is something that we have been begging for for a long time. 
   So I know that you will endeavor to work with us as we move toward dynamic scoring for CBO. 
   But I find it amusing, distressing actually, that the other side continues to break promise after promise. I read now from ``A New Direction for America,'' which is what the majority party put out prior to the last election, and they said: ``Our new direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting, no more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' 
   Well, fiscal discipline clearly is not the order of the day today nor is pay-as-you-go. The other side will tell you they have pay-as-you-go; but, in fact, it does not apply to this sort of bill. So it doesn't apply to authorization. So when rules are rules only when you want them to be rules, then they really aren't rules at all. So it really is not pay-as-you-go. It is go and spend, which is the program that the majority party has in place. 
   This is a great bill. This is a great bill. And I think probably $10 million is an appropriate amount of resources of the American people's hard-earned taxpayer money to spend on this kind of endeavor. However, we are charged with developing the priorities of the Federal Government, and, in fact, I believe this to be a priority. But the majority party is charged, when they bring a bill like this to the floor, to say, well, this is indeed a priority but something else has to go to the bottom of the list, in fact, fall off the list to the tune of $10 million. That is what PAYGO is. You say we are going to spend $10 million on this, but we are not going to spend it on this. Well, in fact, the majority party hasn't done that. What they have said is that we are just going to continue to spend and spend and spend and spend. 
   Mr. Chairman, that is not responsible. That is not responsible spending. That is not responsible use of the hard-earned taxpayer money. So I would hope that the new majority would, in fact, embrace the policy that they talk about, which is making certain that PAYGO rules are in effect. In fact, the promise was to have PAYGO rules be in effect for everything, for everything that came to the floor. Well, we haven't seen that, and I look forward to that because I think it is the appropriate way for us to budget and for us to spend.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, taxpayer funded luxury travel is not accorded to our brave men and women serving the cause of liberty. However, the new Democrat leadership believes they deserve just that. 
   While the previous Speaker of the House was afforded the use of a military aircraft as a security precaution following 9/11, it didn't include the amenities being sought by the current Democrat Speaker, room for 42 passengers, a crew of 16, state-of-the-art entertainment and communications and a private bedroom. Nonetheless, that which was good enough for prior leadership is apparently just not good enough for the new leadership. 
   Just a few months ago, Speaker Pelosi told the American people that Democrats were committed to a new direction in the way our government does business. At a cost of $15,000 an hour it should go without saying that this is certainly a new direction, one which frankly disgusts all Americans.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I want to thank you for your leadership and your organization of this hour, and day in and day out of working here in the Congress to represent your constituents in Tennessee, but working so diligently on behalf of the hardworking American taxpayer out there, making certain that their interests are upheld here in the House of Representatives. 
   I appreciate you bringing up the issue of health care. There are a couple of things that I would be interested in talking about today. But the issue of health care is near and dear to my heart. As you mentioned, I am a physician, or was in my former life before coming to Congress, spent over 20 years in the private practice of orthopedic surgery outside Atlanta. 
   One thing that I knew for certain and that my patients knew for certain was that when doctors and patients are able to make health care decisions, then good decisions get made. When insurance companies or government inserts themselves into those decisions, then most often, most often those decisions do not resemble the kind of decisions that individual persons would make in very personal health care decisions that they have. 
   I appreciate the comments that you made. I would like to commend the President for putting on the table what I believe will be discussed tonight in his State of the Union; that is, the individual tax deductibility of health insurance. I have been a longtime supporter of the right of individuals to have the same kind of benefit that employers do in the purchase of health insurance. 
   So I am pleased that we have heard that that is indeed going to be a possibility brought forward by the President this evening. It would give so many people an opportunity to purchase health insurance that right now are not able to do so financially. So I look forward to that proposal coming forward tonight. And I would be happy to yield back to the gentlewoman and talk about some other issues if you so desire.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Sometimes it is hard to get your arms around what do you mean the government being involved in the process. 
   I would suggest to my colleagues here and others who are listening that we already see the inroads of some government decisions. One of them is what sounded wonderful at the time, the HIPAA legislation, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which was supposed to make every individual citizen in this Nation make their health records more secure and private. In fact, what that bill has done is make that information less private and more available to more individuals than ever before. That is because, as you well know when you go in to see your doctor, the first thing you have to do is sign a ream of documents. You feel like you are in a lawyer's office. You sign a ream of documents. 
   What you are doing when you sign those documents is providing so that the physician, when he or she shares your medical information with anybody, isn't liable for violating HIPAA. Medicine is a collegial activity. It requires that Dr. A communicate with Dr. B who communicates with Dr. C, and they get together and come up with the best solution for anybody's health problem. 
   When you are not able to share that information, the quality of health care goes down. What has happened because the government had this brilliant idea to get involved in the process is to say we will make it so that your information cannot be shared with anybody unless you give your permission. So because Dr. Smith doesn't know when he or she is going to run into Dr. Jones to discuss that case, it is imperative that every single patient sign away their right to any privacy so the doctor can communicate when that time arises. 
   What the government has done by putting these rules in place, which sounded wonderful, but what the government has done is made it so every single patient in this Nation, their medical information is less private and less secure than it was before governmental intervention.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. If the gentlewoman would yield, I appreciate that description of a free market private system health care. I call it patient centered when I am talking about private because it means that patients are empowered to do what they feel is appropriate in their instance. 
   When you have a medical problem or when somebody else has a medical problem, their decision about what they want to do to treat that may not be what mine would be or my family's would be. It is only when individuals get to make those personal decisions that we are able to make certain that patient-centered health care exists. 
   When we try to describe what the future may be if our friends on the other side of the aisle had their way and put in place a government system that they tried to do in the early 1990s, all you have to do is think about the last time you were at your doctor's and you needed a test or an X-ray or some type of procedure done. Well, it is very likely that discussion and education that you got as a patient with your physician didn't last terribly long and you came to an understanding and agreement about what would happen next. 
   What you may not have known what happens next is one of those employees in that office then gets on the phone and talks to the insurance company to make certain that it is okay. Most often we have gotten that process down to be relatively streamlined. But can you imagine if we put the government in charge of health care and you had to get on the phone and get the government's permission, Washington's permission, so you could have an MRI or biopsy or some other procedure? That is what is looming. 
   The problem is now just time and inconvenience. The problem is that if you, in order to have that happen and to be effective from the government, from Washington's viewpoint, if you were not to follow those rules, there would be significant punishment. In fact, you would violate the law. 
   So what we saw in the early 1990s in the proposal that was put on the table, if you as a patient or a physician were to do something that wasn't allowed by the government, that would be a crime. It wouldn't just be a bad decision; it would be a crime. 
   So what our friends on the other side of the aisle are in fact proposing in the small print, and I know they like bumper-sticker politics, I know they like to give these glorious titles to things, and they sound wonderful, but when you get down to the fine print, what you see, especially in the area of health care that I feel so passionately about, when you get down to the fine print, what it means is that patients and doctors will be exposed to criminal violations if they don't follow what Washington says they ought to do. That concerns me very, very greatly; and I know it does you. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and her leadership on this issue. 
   The issue we are talking about is House Resolution 78, H. Res. 78. As the gentlewoman mentioned, it was just brought up as a possibility that we would be voting on it this week this past Friday. I would venture to say, Mr. Speaker, that in your race and I know in my race and I doubt in anybody's race around this Nation, save possibly the elections in the territories, did anyone ever address the issue of Delegates voting on the floor of the House of Representatives. I can honestly say I don't know of anybody who used that as an issue that they ran on in November. 
   We all appreciate that the American people were interested in change when they voted in November, but I'm with you: I don't think that the American people were interested in this kind of change, this kind of change that I believe to be unconstitutional. 
   When I go to schools, middle schools and high schools, around my district and I talk to students and we talk about the process of government, oftentimes I will ask them a question: Can we make any law we want in the House of Representatives? Can we make any law in Congress we want? 
   Sometimes you will get some folks that say yeah; but most often the young men and women and boys and girls in my district and I know across this Nation know and understand and appreciate that the guiding principles that we follow here are defined in the Constitution. I know that it is challenging sometimes for people to be held to make certain that they follow the Constitution, because there are some really stiff rules in this Constitution. 
   But one of the ones at the very beginning, article I, is about the legislative branches, as you well know, Mr. Speaker, and I believe article I was about the legislative branch because the Founders knew the incredible importance of the representative branch of government, the legislative branch of government. And section 1 is about all powers being vested in the House and Senate. Article I, section 2 states: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' 
   It didn't mention anything about territories, Delegates from territories. I am so pleased, and we are really aided by the representation in the committees by the Delegates from the territories, by the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, by the Delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands and American Samoa, and by the Delegate from the District of Columbia, but clearly they do not represent States. 
   In this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, when we gather as a Committee of the Whole or as the House of Representatives, it is clear that the Founders and that our Constitution states that an individual to vote in that instance must be a Member of the House and a representative of the State.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank you so much for yielding. And I appreciate your bringing up that point because it is so important and really so basic to our Nation. 
   Our Nation began for a variety of reasons, but not the least of which is that our Founding Fathers believed that they were being taxed without any ability to have representation in the body that was deciding whether or not to tax them. They had taxation without representation. 
   Well, this is really turning it on its head because, as you mentioned, the individuals, the people in American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, wonderful people that they are, but they are not obligated to pay any Federal income tax. None. So what we would be doing would be allowing Members, individuals in this House of Representatives who would be described as Members, to vote on whether or not to raise income taxes, but not be affected personally and not have the people that they represent be affected. So that would be representation without taxation. And I simply believe and I think that our constituents believe across this Nation that that is fundamentally wrong. Fundamentally wrong. 
   And I want to get back for just a moment to the issue of one person/one vote, because when people say, well, it does not make a whole lot of difference if the districts are a little bit different size. What difference does that make? But, again, our Founders knew and understood wisely that every Member of this House of Representatives ought to represent essentially the same number of people so that when individuals at home, citizens at home, vote for their representative, their vote counts basically the same as every other citizen of this Nation. And when you have districts that are one-tenth the size of other districts, which, as you mentioned, American Samoa has a population of about 57,000, 58,000, and most of our districts are around 650,000; so that means that every person in American Samoa who votes, their vote counts 10 times, 10 times the amount that your vote and my vote and every other American citizen's vote counts. And that, Mr. Speaker, and ladies and gentlemen, and colleagues of the House of Representatives, one, is not fair; and, two, it is not the way our Founders envisioned anybody voting in this House of Representatives.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. And it is so important. And I appreciate your bringing up Congressman Johnson's resolution. I spoke for a brief moment on the floor earlier about that as well. 
   And I know that in this Chamber we can disagree about a lot of things, and we should. Our system works best when ideas are exchanged and the best solutions rise to the top, because it really  is a battle of ideas. But in this instance we can disagree, as I mentioned, about many things, but we ought not disagree about whether or not our men and women in harm's way, our troops who are defending liberty truly around the globe, ought to receive every single resource that they need in order to defend themselves and to defend us. 
   I know that many folks go to Walter Reed and visit some of those brave men and women who have been injured in battle. I have had the opportunity to do that, and I was struck always by every conversation that I had with some of those men and women who have come back, some with devastating injuries, truly. And I am just so humbled by those conversations that I have with those brave soldiers and warriors because I would try to close every conversation and ask them what it was that we could do to help. What can I do to help? And virtually every single one of them said without fail, Congressman, if you can do one thing, if you can do just one thing, please, please let me get back to my unit. And that kind of enthusiasm, that kind of commitment, that kind of sense of duty and honor and patriotism is chilling. It really is. 
   There are incredible stories that each of them tell, but also I believe those men and women serve as a guidepost for us. And, in fact, we ought to look to them and look to their courage to have the courage that we need in order to support our men and women who are in harm's way. 
   And I am very hopeful that this House of Representatives will support Congressman Johnson's resolution because it truly speaks for, I believe, the vast majority of the American people who want to make certain that, regardless of how you feel about this conflict, we as a Congress state clearly that we will make certain that we provide all of the resources necessary for our men and women in harm's way.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (DELEGATE VOTING -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, what if I were to tell you that non-Members of the House of Representatives were about to be given a vote right here in the House? You would say no, can't happen, right? Well, hold on, because it's about to happen and it's about to happen this week. 
   This week is a remarkable week; it should be a time of great anticipation, the State of the Union, we've got incredible and remarkable challenges that face our Nation. But at home, when I go home, people are kind of wondering out loud, what's going on up there in Washington? There is skepticism about the Six for '06, you know, the things that the Democrat majority adopted in their vaunted first 100 hours, albeit under an unfair process and with no input from either their new Members or the minority. Really a clear abuse of power. But the explanation was, well, we ran on these issues, everyone knew they were coming, they endorsed them in the election. 
   Now, regardless of the truthfulness of that statement, most folks just kind of shake their head, and most in the press have given the Democrats the benefit of the doubt, and that's all right. There is a basic sense of, you know, it's tough to believe that they would violate so many principles coming right out of the chute. 
   And then yesterday we had a suspension bill; that is a bill that is brought to the floor of the House that requires a supermajority, two-thirds, in order to pass. And by tradition, it is brought to the floor because it has got an overwhelming amount of support, with the full knowledge of both the majority and the minority. And yesterday, a bill that virtually everyone here supports, removing Federal pensions from Members of Congress who are convicted of a felony, was brought to the floor and amended or changed twice within a few minutes before even reaching the floor. Now this is fairly esoteric stuff; however, it is important because it demonstrates the unfair process, the abuse of the rules and the abuse of power. 
   And now we have another in what seems to be this daily event of power-hungry Democrat majorities to give non-Members of the House a vote on this floor. It is a move that they tried the last time they were in control, a move that generated some interesting headlines--``Have the Democrats No Shame?'' ``The Democrats' Greedy Power Grab,'' ``Power Grab in the House.'' And these are from the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and the Washington Post, not this year, but in 1992. 
   Now the issue is whether or not to allow non-Members of the House of Representatives, specifically the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico, and the Delegates from Guam, the Virgin Islands, the District of Columbia and American Samoa the privilege to vote during the Committee of the Whole on this floor of the House. Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous; it is an incredible, phenomenal move in both process and in substance. 
   Once again, now becoming the routine, this bill, scheduled to come to the floor of the House tomorrow, has had no committee hearing, no debate, no opportunity to amend, no democracy. I assure you, this is not the kind of change that the American people voted for last November. 
   The Constitution states that the House shall be composed of, quote, ``Members chosen by the people of the several States,'' not Delegates representing non-State territories. It is an unconstitutional power grab, a plan that runs roughshod over the constitutional principle of one person, one vote. One of these territories has 57,000 residents, compared to the 650,000 in my district. These individuals could vote to raise your taxes, Mr. Speaker, without paying taxes themselves. 
   Clearly the plot by the Democrats is to slip this through during the week of the State of the Union when they think no one is paying attention. This is an unconscionable action, it is a violation of trust and a clear abuse of power. 
   Under the Democrat plot and logic, they could seat and allow anyone that the majority desires in the House. Who's next, Mr. Speaker? Howard Dean? Does he get a vote in the House? 
   The American people are disgusted with this level of arrogance and abuse of power.  
   The oath that all of us took just a few weeks ago, we all pledged to uphold the Constitution of the United States; this proposal belies that oath. 
   I urge my Democrat colleagues to regain some sense of propriety, some sense of history, some sense of rectitude. When you trample on the Constitution, when you use the Constitution as a doormat and not the foundational document of our wonderful representative democracy, you do great harm to our Nation.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of H.R. 511 introduced by Mr. Sam Johnson of Texas, which says that we ought to pledge the faithful support of Congress to members of the United States Armed Forces serving in harm's way. 
   Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things we can disagree on on this floor of the House, but cutting funding for our troops ought not be one of them. As many others have done, I have also visited Walter Reed and talked to the brave men and women who have served there, not just from my district, from my State and around the Nation. And when I ask them, is there anything that we can do for you, the vast majority of them say, Congressman, just let me get back to my unit. 
   Madam Speaker, that sense of duty, that sense of honor, that sense of commitment and that sense of patriotism is something we in Congress would do well to emulate. This resolution says that members of the United States Armed Forces have served honorably in their mission to fight terrorism and protect the greater security of the United States, that these members of the Armed Forces and their families have made many sacrifices. This resolution, Madam Speaker, deserves our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, there is a fundamental disagreement in this House of Representatives over how to protect our Nation and our approach to national security. And these differences are no more blatant than in the Department of Homeland Security authorization bill that passed this House just yesterday. 
   While law enforcement officials were arresting six potential terrorists who planned to attack a military base in New Jersey, this Democrat majority was already working hard to strip commonsense immigration reforms from the authorization bill. Never mind that three of the would-be terrorists were in the country illegally, never mind that stronger enforcement and better resources for our Customs and Border agents could have very well kept these men from getting across the border. 
   It is outrageous that this majority would proactively undermine an opportunity to strengthen our Nation's defenses, support our first responders, and track who is coming into our country. 
   American common sense appears not to have extended to the majority party. There are fundamental differences in how we plan to protect America. Our enemies are watching and so are the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, article I, section 2 of the Constitution states that ``the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' It goes on to say: ``No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, in spite of the Constitution and what it says today, this new majority will pass a bill to provide a vote, by law, not constitutional amendment, a vote in this House for the delegate from the District of Columbia. 
   Now, I support, strongly, voting rights for residents of D.C. The proper way to do that, the constitutional way, is to return residential area in the District of Columbia to Maryland. It respects the supreme law of the land of the Constitution. Even the Democrat chairman, Peter Rodino of the Judiciary Committee in the 95th Congress, said: ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting representation in Congress, a constitutional amendment is essential. Statutory action alone will not suffice.'' 
   So why would this new majority pass a law so clearly violative of the Constitution? Because they can. It's an arrogance and hypocrisy that the American people recognize, and they are watching.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I am opposed to this rule for specific reasons about the process and about the unique and unheard of change that would state that if a recommital motion passes, that that is laid upon the table. That strips completely the authority of the minority to have input into the process. And I would think, Mr. Speaker, that Members of the majority party would be ashamed. I would think that that would be the appropriate course of action, and that they ought to rethink what they are doing. 
   But I came down to the floor to talk about the substance of the bill, because I believe passionately in representation. I believe passionately in the importance of members, of citizens, residents of the District of Columbia to have representation, voting representation in this House. I believe passionately in the Constitution. And I believe that those two beliefs are not mutually exclusive. 
   There is a particularly appropriate way to proceed, and that is through the issue of retrocession, which as you know, Mr. Speaker, provides that that portion of the District of Columbia that has residents in it, citizens in it, could be moved back into the State of Maryland and thereby obtain appropriate representation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that facts are troubling things, and the supreme law of our land, the Constitution, requires us to do certain things and one of them is to follow the Constitution. 
   Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states: ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' It doesn't say, and the District of Columbia. It says: the people of the several States.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that that, along with the next paragraph which states: ``No person shall be a representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' It is clear that this action will be unconstitutional if it moves forward. 
   Even Peter Rodino, former Democratic Chair of the Judiciary Committee in the 95th Congress, when confronted with this issue said: ``If the citizens of a district are to have a voting representation in Congress, a constitutional amendment is essential. Statutory action alone will not suffice.'' 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that this action that is being proposed by the majority party is indeed unconstitutional, and I would agree with the delegate from the District of Columbia that there is a body in our system of government that will determine that. That is the judiciary branch. I am hopeful that it will occur rapidly. 
   And I would be happy to yield to the delegate from the District of Columbia to see whether or not she would support, along with this, a demand for an expedited review of this legislation and would it move forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Virginia for his leadership on this and for yielding. 
   I want to stipulate at the beginning of this statement that I support enfranchisement, strongly support enfranchisement for the citizens of the District of Columbia. However, the oath that I take on the first day of our session stipulates that I uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, and I believe firmly that the Constitution will not allow this. There is a process that we will go through for that, and I appreciate it.  
   This has been a good debate. It has been an interesting debate. I want to point out a section of the Constitution that isn't cited as often as the ones that we have heard, and that is article I, section 2, the second paragraph, which states, ``No person shall be a Representative who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.'' 
   If there was ever a more clear statement in the Constitution, I don't know what that is. 
   But I also want to talk about this sense of one person-one vote. I am very troubled by what we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle that this upholds one person-one vote, because I would suggest to you, reading the bill and understanding what it does in both the Utah situation and in the District of Columbia, that it provides for more than one person and one vote. 
   In the Utah instance, for example, it provides that the State of Utah gets one extra Representative, which means that the individuals in Utah vote for two people, which means they have more authority than citizens in my district and other districts who aren't in Utah. And in the District of Columbia, this bill would provide for a Representative in the House of Representatives, but also a Delegate. Also a Delegate. So citizens in the District of Columbia would have representation from two different individuals in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. 
   So I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Rodino, the Democrat Chair of the Judiciary Committee stated in the 95th Congress, ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is necessary, is essential. Statutory action alone will not suffice.'' 
   So I would ask my friends on the other side of the aisle, what changed? What changed? Was Mr. Rodino wrong? I think not. I think not. I think there is a statutory way to do it, and that is through retrocession. I think there is a constitutional way to do it, by amending the Constitution. 
   I would suggest to my friends on both sides that H.R. 1905 does neither of those and violates sincerely the principle of one-person, one-vote.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I, too, want to add my congratulations and my commendation to the Delegate from the District of Columbia. As I mentioned early during the day, I think this has been a good debate and an interesting and a productive debate, and I commend her for the work that she has done on behalf of her constituents. 
   I also want to state for the record once again that I strongly support the enfranchisement of the citizens of the District of Columbia. However, I believe that it ought to be done in a legal and a constitutional way. I think there is a way to do that, and we have talked about that. I do not believe that the bill that has just passed the House, 1905, in fact is a constitutional bill, and I think that that will play out over a period of time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to comment about where we are right now in terms of the activity and the rules of the House of Representatives. We are further delving into Orwellian democracy. I say that because the majority party has been champions of saying one thing and then doing completely the opposite. We have been told that this would be the most open, honest and fair Congress. In fact, we weren't told it, the leadership of the other party has promised the American people that this would be the most open and honest Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to you that this has, in many ways, been the most oppressive Congress because of the majority party's actions, most oppressive Congress ever. You say, well, how can I arrive at that conclusion? Well, the way that the rules have been used and the ways that the rules have been changed draw one, I think objectively, to that conclusion because the rules that have been changed especially on this bill, on this issue, have disenfranchised completely anybody in the minority. And you say, well, how is that? Well, the rule that was adopted and the rule under which we are acting and the rule upon which I asked the Speaker multiple parliamentary inquiries states that if either H.R. 1905 or H.R. 1906 fails, then the other bill is tabled, failed based upon recommital vote. 
   Now, what that means is this House has passed H.R. 1905. And normally what would occur is that that bill would be on its way to the Senate. But what we are doing now is waiting to see whether 1906 passes, and if it fails, then 1905 is tabled. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to you that it is impossible to construct a rule that passes the smell test or passes the principles of democracy in this House that allows this House to table a bill after it has already passed. It is unconscionable. 
   Many of us have served in State legislatures. We understand the process of parliamentary procedure. We understand how minorities are able to affect policy. But when a majority wants to, by the very rule, squelch the input of the minority completely, it certainly can, based upon the ruling from the chair. But it is circular logic at best. When I asked the Speaker how on Earth could that occur, the Speaker replied, Because of the rule. When I  asked, how can the rule be consistent with the rules of the House, the response from the speaker was, Because of the rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a remarkably oppressive action on the part of this majority. I urge my colleagues on the majority side to rethink the processes that they are using to make it such that the minority party in this Chamber is no longer able to affect policy, which means that 48 to 49 percent of the citizens of this Nation are no longer allowed to have Representatives that are able to affect policy because of the rules adopted by this majority party. 
   It makes me very sad to draw that conclusion based upon the rule that this House has adopted today. I urge my colleagues to reconsider.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is certainly a very serious time and a remarkably challenging issue. The good news is that there are positive solutions that are available. 
   We've been told that the bill before us tonight is a limited bill. I would ask my colleagues, compared to what? 
   There are many reasons that one might oppose this bill and support some positive, tried-and-true solutions, but I would suggest that the most important issue upon which to oppose this bill is on Page 15, under the authority of the car czar, which says that the President's designee, or the car czar, may prohibit the eligible automobile manufacturer which received the loan, from consummating any such proposed sale, investment, contract, commitment or other transaction. That means, Mr. Speaker, that one individual will have complete authority and power over three private American automobile manufacturers. That's a level of power in one individual, one bureaucrat, that is inconsistent, I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, with both American values and with American solutions. 
   Now, what's the solution? Well, it's a tried-and-true process that thousands of companies, large and small, are able to go through, a legal, a court-ordered, a court-approved reorganization and restructuring. It allows all stakeholders to come to the table and make concessions. It requires all stakeholders to come to the table and make concessions, and that's what's going to be necessary to allow our automobile manufacturers to get through this and come out on the other end vibrant and vital entities in the American marketplace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this and to support a positive, tried-and-true solution.

   Democrats have unveiled their tax-and-spend budget proposal which will bring upon the American people the largest tax increase in our Nation's history. 
   Rather than allow Americans to make choices about how best to spend their own money, it is clear that Democrats feel they and Washington bureaucrats better understand what is good for American families. 
   Our Democrat colleagues repeatedly claim that the Republican tax cuts only benefit the wealthy. Well, Madam Speaker, the lowest-income Americans are about to find out just how untrue that tired rhetoric is. 
   The tax hikes will hit all Americans in every tax bracket, the middle class, low-income families and small businesses. 
   But there is an alternative. House Republicans have vowed to not just extend but make permanent the pro-growth low-tax policies that have brought recovery to our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, we can move away from this tired trend of big and bigger government. We can return money back to the rightful owner, the American taxpayer; and we should start right now.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   As a physician for over 25 years, we've got a diagnosis for what's going on here today. It's called ``a crying shame.'' Crying shame. 
   You hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle that there are multiple improvements that are made in this bill. Well, they didn't improve the portion of the bill that said we ought to take care of poor kids first. What they did was weaken the requirements for making certain that you were providing benefits to legal residents in both SCHIP and in Medicaid, and they did all that with a massive tax increase. It doesn't sound like improvements to me, Mr. Speaker. 
   But there is an alternative. It's H.R. 3888. It provides insurance for the same number of kids that this bill does. It does so in a way that didn't move kids from personal private insurance to government-run bureaucratic health care; and it does all of that without a tax increase, all of it without a tax increase. 
   So why proceed today? Because, as the majority party knows, this is about all politics, all the time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to say to my friend from Michigan, the chairman of the committee, that he says that this bill is coming to the floor today because all of the concerns in a letter that were about this bill have been addressed. 
   Well, as a physician and a coauthor of that letter, I respectfully disagree. The letter said that SCHIP ought to be reserved for low-income kids first. In fact, what this bill does is provide incentives to ensure higher-income kids before poor kids. 
   The letter said that SCHIP ought to be for children only. In fact, CBO estimates that over 700,000 adults will be on the program in 2012, not in 1 year, in 2012. 
   The letter said that SCHIP ought to cover low-income American children. In fact, the bill weakens both Medicaid and SCHIP citizenship verification, and all with a huge tax increase. 
   Madam Speaker, Members ought to know that there's an alternative. There are multiple alternatives. One of them is H.R. 3888. It would provide insurance for the same number of kids. It would not move any kids from private personal insurance to government-run insurance. It would make certain that personal choices were respected, and it would not increase taxes. 
   So why proceed today? Why is the majority party proceeding today? Because it's all about politics. In fact, they've already had their cronies purchase TV and radio ads in the districts of folks that they believe aren't going to support this for political gain. It's all about politics. Not about policy and it certainly isn't about the kids. 
   As a physician, there's a specific diagnosis for that. It's called ``a crying shame.''

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. I thank my good friend from Florida for his leadership on this issue and so many others. 
   Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor today. I wanted to talk about the amendments that I had offered to this bill that would have provided some accountability to the spending that's incorporated in this bill, but as we have heard, those amendments weren't made in order. 
   So, in addition to the majority not wanting to have accountability for the bill that we're talking about on school construction, the first time Federal moneys have been used for school construction, no accountability, what I thought I would do then is address the issue that we ought to be talking about today. That's the issue that we all heard about last week when we went home. 
   When I went home, what did I hear from my constituents? I didn't hear about school construction. I heard about gas prices. And I heard that people are tired, sick and tired, and fed up with inaction in Washington. They want solutions. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are three ways to address this issue. One is conservation, and we all can do more. 
   The second is to make certain that we put appropriate incentives in place for alternative fuels so that we can bridge to the next generation and American genius can be unleashed. This majority isn't doing anything about that. 
   But the way that we bridge to the next generation is to increase supply, and so I asked some folks on our side of the aisle to get the information that said what has the majority party, what have the Democrats, done in order to increase supply of American energy. 
   It won't surprise you, Mr. Speaker, to know that 91 percent of the folks on our side of the aisle, 91 percent, supported exploration in Alaska over the last 15 years; 86 percent on the other side opposed it to increase supply. 
   Coal-to-liquid technology, 97 percent on our side of the aisle supported increasing supply in coal-to-liquid technology; 78 percent on the other side opposed it. 
   How about oil shale exploration? Ninety percent on our side of the aisle support oil shale exploration increasing supply; 86 oppose it on the other side. 
   Deep sea exploration, Mr. Speaker, 81 percent on our side support it; 83 percent on the other side oppose it.  
   How about increasing refining capacity? There hasn't been a new refinery built in this Nation in over 30 years. Ninety-seven percent on this side of the aisle support it; 96 percent on the majority side oppose increasing refining capacity in vote after vote after vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, my constituents and I know Americans across this Nation are sick and tired, sick and tired of a majority that's keeping us dependent on Middle Eastern oil. So I call on this majority and I call on the Speaker to bring forward a positive bill that will increase conservation, increase incentives for alternative fuel, and make certain that we can use American resources, American energy for Americans.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, Americans are demanding action as they're being battered by sky-high gas prices. 
   The relentless unwillingness to act by this majority has left my constituents fuming and looking for action, not more of the same rhetoric and politics. 
   We sit at the precipice of four dollar gasoline. How much higher do these costs have to go before the majority will act? Five dollars? Six dollars? Ten dollars? Is the Democrat majority so out of touch with the American people? 
   On this side of the aisle, we have produced an action plan to increase access to new sources of energy, increase American production, encourage alternative fuels, and incentivize conservation. We are ready to act. 
   Madam Speaker, gas prices have increased 70 percent since you took control of Congress, and it's your duty to act. I call on you to allow the responsible Republican energy plan to come to this floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1873, SMALL BUSINESS FAIRNESS IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate him for providing leadership on this issue. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Speaker, that small business is indeed important and vital, but what is before us is not H.R. 1873, the Small Business Fairness in Contracting Act. What is before us is how this House will deal with that bill when it comes to the floor. What is before us is the rule that will allow or not allow open and active debate on this bill. 
   Now, the new majority has promised us an open and fair process. They promised the American people an open and fair process. But once again, this new majority has put forward a closed and restrictive rule which will not allow an up-or-down vote on many amendments, including one that I offered that would have applied pay-as-you-go spending principles to this legislation. 
   As my good friend from Florida mentioned, there are eight amendments that have been allowed, all of them, Mr. Speaker, with primary authors being from the majority party. Is that open? Is that fair? 
   Last term, Speaker Pelosi said, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voices silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' Well, I agree, Mr. Speaker. What changed? 
   Last term, Mr. Speaker, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, ``Mr. Speaker, once again this House majority is resorting to heavy-handed tactics that are designed to do one thing only, to achieve a preordained result by shutting down a full and fair debate in this House.'' I agree, Mr. Speaker. What changed? 
   Last term, Mr. Speaker, the current Chair of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, said, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under open rule, not just appropriations bills ..... An open process should be the norm and not the exception.'' Well, I agree, Mr. Speaker. What changed?  
   In fact, what has changed is that less than 3 percent of the bills that have been brought to this floor under this majority under a rule have been under an open rule, less than 3 percent. What changed, Mr. Speaker? 
   Last term, a member of the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern, said, ``I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if you want to show some bipartisanship, if you want to promote a process that has some integrity, this should be an open rule. All Members should have an opportunity to come here and offer amendments to this bill to improve the quality of deliberations on this House floor. They should be able to come and offer amendments to clean this place up.'' And I agree, Mr. Speaker. So what changed? What changed? 
   Mr. Speaker, last term, current Democrat Caucus Chair, Mr. Emanuel said, ``Let us have and up-or-down vote. Do not be scared. Do not hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it out on the table, and let us have a vote. So do not hide behind the rule. If this is what you want to do, let us have an up-or-down vote.'' I agree, Mr. Speaker. What changed? 
   H.R. 1873, the bill today that we will talk about, seeks to increase the opportunity for small businesses to earn Federal contracts by addressing current barriers that face small businesses, and this is important. That is extremely important, but we should do so in a fiscally responsible way. 
   My amendment would have allowed or would have applied the principles of pay-as-you-go to any new spending authorized by this legislation by requiring that any new spending have a specific offset, be paid for, common sense. It is what we all have to do at home. It is what all of our constituents have to do at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, this majority, when it was running to take the majority last year, said, ``Our new direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting, no more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' Mr. Speaker, what happened? What happened? 
   Last month, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was quoted and said, ``We want to get the budget deficit under control. We have said fiscal responsibility was necessary, but we are not going to be hoisted on the torrent of fiscal responsibility.'' Mr. Speaker, heaven forbid that we should be hoisted on the torrent of fiscal responsibility. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, rules are not rules if you only follow them when you want to, and the Democrats, the majority party, promised to use PAYGO rules for everything. Instead, they are picking and choosing when to do so. At home, we call that breaking a rule and breaking a promise. 
   So I urge the new majority to rededicate itself to its campaign promises, its promises of pay-as-you-go spending and of an open and fair process. Fiscal responsibility and an open process should not be something that you just talk about solely before elections. We should be good stewards of the hard-earned money that Americans send to Washington in the form of their taxes all the time, not just during political campaigns. 
   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this closed and restrictive rule.

   This new majority has once again promised us an open and fair process, but again they have failed to live up to the promises now that they're out from under the spotlight of their election year. This is extremely disappointing considering the remarkable importance of the legislation before us today, the Homeland Security Authorization Act. 
   Among some of the provisions that were stripped out of the bill completely, a pilot program for mobile biometric identification of illegal aliens apprehended at sea, denying alien smugglers use of maritime routes and enhanced penalties for alien smuggling, and requiring immigration checks for employees at high-risk critical infrastructures. 
   What's so scary about those being in the bill, I would ask? What idea or what one amendment was so scary that inspired this restrictive rule? I urge my colleagues not to be scared, not to hide behind this rule. Vote ``no'' on this rule so that we can have a complete and fair debate. The American people deserve no less, and they're watching.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is a solution truly in search of a problem. We have heard of the success of the current program. We have heard a lot about special interests. Well, I rise to tell you that the patients of this Nation are my special interests. As a physician, I have seen and know that increased governmental involvement will decrease the drugs available and will harm patients. Some say, well, the VA system works just fine, and the government negotiates prices there; why not use that same system? 
   Well, there is no way to compare those two systems, Mr. Speaker. They are absolutely apples and oranges. VA is a closed system. Medicare is an open system that offers choice that patients want. VA has no retail pharmacy benefits, none. Medicare provides access to community pharmacists, where many seniors receive great information and support. 
   I have worked in the VA. I know what it means when they offer you, when they give the physicians a list of drugs that they are able to provide the recipients in a VA system. It doesn't work. It is a decreased formulary. There are those who think that they are going to get the pharmaceutical companies by adopting this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, all they will do is hurt patients. We will ultimately see higher costs, fewer drugs available, less quality health care and patients harmed. Those supporting H.R. 4 think that they know what is best for patients. We simply believe that as a matter of principle it is patients and doctors who should be making personal health care decisions, including the medications used.

   So what problems are the Democrats trying to solve? Theirs is really a solution in search of a problem. The Democrats think that Washington can make better decisions than the American people about very personal medical matters. And what happens when the government gets more involved? Things become more bureaucratic and more expensive. 
   As a physician, I know how difficult it is to take care of patients, oftentimes because so many non-medical people are making medical decisions. 
   If H.R. 4 is adopted and becomes law, Washington bureaucrats will decide which drugs will be available for patients, not from a scientific or safety standpoint but purely based upon money. 
   That is not the way we ought to be making health care decisions. Those decisions ought to be made by patients and doctors.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I want to commend my friend from Wisconsin for his willingness to continue to work on this. We've got some disagreements about it, although we are basically saying the same thing, that we want both of the programs to be treated equally, and I certainly concur with that. I also want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this as we went through committee, but at this time I rise to oppose this amendment. 
   H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, really has been a product of significant and extensive thoughtful deliberation over many Congresses. One example, I believe, of that thoughtfulness is section 454, which is included in the manager's amendment, which is a provision asking for an independent audit of the direct loan program and greater disclosure of the program's impact on the national debt. In fact, that provision was unanimously adopted in our committee during markup. 
   Now, why is this important? Well, it's important because the direct loan program amazingly is not currently subject to the routine audits that examine all of these issues. Further, the government finances the direct loan program by borrowing, and so it contributes in some way that we believe ought to be determined, and that was the purpose of the amendment. It contributes in some way directly to that national debt. 
   Now, we all talk about transparency, and I'm all for transparency. Transparency is critical if we are going to, here in Congress, get a handle on evaluating the student lending program and make the best decisions for college access and affordability. Unfortunately, I believe that this amendment being offered undermines that congressional oversight and paralyzes section 454. 
   I also believe that it weakens the independent audit portion of the direct loan program. Private lenders under the FFEL, the Federal Family Education Loan program, are subject to full and regular audits, and this section in the bill is intended to subject the direct loan program to similar full and regular audits. That's the common ground that we talk about and hopefully will be able to find as we move forward. 
   As an example, the amendment also eliminates a requirement to the direct loan audit that includes an examination of the unreconciled balances of loans by year of origination. This is a key piece of information for the FFEL program, the loans must be reconciled every year, while the direct loan program is not held to the same standards. So by weakening the independent audit of the direct loan program, the amendment would eliminate the portion requiring disclosure of the program's impact on the national debt. 
   And just as a matter of information, we all here in Congress should know about that. 
   In closing, Members, I believe, need to remember that all of this that is being done, in essence, would add a duplicate audit ability for the FFEL programs and not the same for the direct loan programs. I look forward to working with my colleague from Wisconsin and the chairman and ranking member as we move forward. Both the direct loan and FFEL program should be held up to the light of day so the taxpayers know what they're getting from their tax dollars. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Chairman, I want to once again say we are happy to have the same review in the audit of both the lending programs. You have heard that some individuals believe that the direct loans are cheaper than the FFEL programs, the loans, and, in fact, official government reports all agree that the budget scoring rules do not, I repeat, do not capture the real economic cost of both of these student loan programs. They agree all of the costs should be accounted for when comparing the two programs. Madam Chairwoman, I think we are, in fact, saying a lot of the same thing. 
   I look forward to working with my friend from Wisconsin, with the ranking member, and with the chairman as we move forward to the conference committee. In the meantime, however, I'm obliged to urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend from Illinois for yielding, and I want to thank also the Chair of the committee and Chair of the subcommittee for the work that they have done on this, and the ranking member. 
   I rise to express a few sincere and serious concerns with section 9 of the bill. This is the section that allows the public housing authorities, or the PHAs, to report the rental payments of its tenants to credit reporting agencies. 
   Reporting alternative data, like rental payments, to the credit reporting agencies may indeed be a very good thing. The hope obviously is that increased alternative data will help improve the credit reports for consumers and, in the long run, provide them with better and less expensive access to credit. In this increasingly credit-drive society, that's truly an important thing. 
   However, I've got four specific concerns with the way that the language in section 9 of this bill is written. 
   First is the format that this data will take. The language of the underlying bill requires the PHAs and credit reporting agencies to establish a system and format for reporting the new data. This is obviously new territory for PHAs, and they haven't done it before and aren't financial institutions and have no history of providing reporting data in the proper format. 
   Second concern is that this section may be incorrectly read to constitute a new requirement on the credit reporting agencies, and I would submit that this would be a drastic and significant change to our current system. Currently, credit reporting agencies must consider the timeliness of the data supplied to them. They must verify that it is accurate data, ensure that there hasn't been any case of identity fraud so that false data is not included in an unsuspecting consumer's credit file. Rental payment, clearly that information is different than other forms of commerce, and it may need to be treated differently. 
   A third concern is that the section, as it reads, would apply to ``families receiving tenant-based housing choice vouchers.'' Credit files historically are unique to individuals. Credit reporting agencies have no way to adjust their credit files for an entire family. So I wonder again sincerely what the real consequences of this ambiguity and potentially harmful aspect are to spreading potential financial responsibility to some without regard to accountability. 
   My fourth concern may be the most important, and that is, that the underlying legislation requires that the PHA, or the public housing agency, gain the permission of the family in writing before submitting the data to credit reporting agencies. This provision potentially would turn our credit reporting system on its head. It's a 100-year-old system based on the voluntary reporting of data to credit reporting agencies. If consumers are able to turn on or off when the data is reported, then it, in its essence, undermines completely the accuracy of the credit reports. 
   Both those who furnish the data to the credit reporting agencies and those who use that data to offer credit to consumers rely on the accuracy of these reports so that they can appropriately and responsibly price the cost of credit to a specific consumer. If someone can decide not to submit certain data to a credit reporting agency, then the accuracy of that data will be greatly compromised. 
   I sincerely believe that a few minor changes to the underlying legislation would indeed perfect the language in a way that would allow for new alternative data to help consumers and also to have that new data submitted in a way that does not undermine a credit reporting system that truly has become the envy of the world. 
   It's my hope that we can work on these concerns as this legislation moves forward, and once again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for her time and thank the Chair of the committee and subcommittee for their work on this issue.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a sad and disappointing day for this House and for America. Once again, the majority is placing politics over national security, politics over reasoned policy, politics and partisanship over citizens and sanity. 
   Clearly this bill was not written in response to what our generals think, whose interim report was released just hours ago. Instead, it was written in reaction to polls and to political pressure from MoveOn.org and others. This isn't a thoughtful piece of legislation to achieve success in Iraq or success for America. 
   The lack of definition for a limited presence included in the bill reveals that this is just another cynical attempt by the majority to politically pander. How terribly disappointing. 
   In effect, this legislation is a vote of no confidence in our military commanders, and it's a shot of encouragement to al Qaeda. It's pure political opportunism, and it's devoid of military strategy. 
   As Members of Congress, we have a greater responsibility than just to politics. We have a responsibility to do what is in the best interest of long-term American security. We must be thoughtful. We must be deliberate in our actions. 
   We have a capable leader, General David Petraeus, unanimously approved by the Senate, the expert in counterinsurgency strategy. He was given by this Congress, just a few weeks ago, until September, to make positive progress in Iraq and report. 
   But this majority isn't interested in what our military commanders are capable of, or the situation on the ground. Their only interest is politics, in raising the white flag and in coming home without any thought or definition as to when or where they are willing to defend our security. 
   But because the political climate is ripe, the majority wants to undercut our troops. It's upsetting, it's sad, and it's very disconcerting that politics would trump national security. 
   This bill signals to our enemies that it doesn't matter what the commanders say. It says that thoughtful military strategy takes a back seat to good politics. 
   This isn't an exit strategy, it's a political strategy. How terribly disappointing. 
   I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill and to commit to positively working together on behalf of the American people and American security.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida for his leadership on this issue and so many others. 
   I rise opposed to this rule for process and policy reasons. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, the new majority promised us and they promised the American people a fair and open process. But again, the majority has failed to live up to its promises, and now that it is out from under the spotlight of election-year promises, we see that they are few and far between. 
   Before last year's election, Speaker Pelosi said, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voices silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I agree. So what's changed? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   In December following last year's election, the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, told the media that ``We intend to have a Rules Committee ..... that gives opposition voices and alternative proposals the ability to be heard and considered on the floor of the House.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, where is the commitment to that promise, with only six of 23 amendments made in order? What has changed, Mr. Speaker? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   Mr. Speaker, the Rules chairman, Ms. Slaughter, has said, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and the thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under an open rule, not just appropriations bills ..... an open process should be the norm, not the exception.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what's changed? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   Rules Committee member Mr. McGovern has said, ``I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, if you want to show some bipartisanship, if you want to promote a process that has some integrity, then this should be an open rule. All Members should have an opportunity to come here and offer amendments to this bill to improve the quality of the deliberations on this House floor. They should be able to come and offer amendments to clean up this place.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, what's changed? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   Democratic Caucus Chair RAHM EMANUEL has said, ``Let's have an up-and-down vote. Don't be scared. Do not hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it out on the table and let's have a vote ..... So don't hide behind the rule. If this is what you want to do, let's have an up-and-down vote. You can put your votes right up there ..... and then the American people can see what it is all about.'' 
   So what has changed, Mr. Speaker? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   Mr. Speaker, I am also very curious as to what has happened with the distinguished chairman and my friend on the Financial Services Committee. In the past, not only has he been a vocal advocate for open rules to the legislation that he has brought to the floor, but the new majority has spared him no effort to applaud him for doing so. In fact, Chairman Frank was such a firm believer in allowing debate, allowing consideration of amendments, that Representative Welch of Vermont felt so moved to say, ``All of us applaud the work of Chairman Frank for recommending an open rule to this bill ..... '' 
   But, Mr. Speaker, that was on a previous bill. So I would ask what's changed. What is the chairman afraid of? Because it certainly appears that he has lost his passion for an open and a fair process. 
   In a letter dated July 9, 2007, to the Chair of the House Committee on Rules, Ms. Slaughter, Chairman Frank urged that the Rules Committee ``provide a structured amendment process.'' So what's changed, Mr. Speaker? What's changed?     
   The Rules Committee Web site lists 23 amendments submitted for consideration, yet only six were made in order. So what's so scary about the other 17? What's so scary? 
   Mr. Speaker, I submitted three amendments not made in order by this draconian and restrictive rule. My first amendment would have applied pay-as-you-go spending rules to this bill that CBO has said will have a net cost of $2.4 billion over the next 5 years. Remember Democrats' promise to use PAYGO rules for everything; instead, they're picking and choosing when to do so. At home we call that breaking a rule and breaking a promise. 
   The second amendment, Mr. Speaker, is clearly a substantive one. It would have prevented, as the gentlelady from Florida said, prevented illegal immigrants from receiving assistance under the section 8 program by providing all adults to provide secure identification before receiving assistance. It's the kind of commonsense amendment that the Financial Services Committee has applied before. It has also been accepted by the full House on other legislation. 
   The third amendment would have helped clarify a new requirement for public housing authorities. This bill provides that the public housing authorities have to report rental payments as alternative data to the credit bureaus. Rental payment information is clearly different than other forms of commerce and may need to be treated differently in order to ensure accuracy of credit reporting. 
   These were three thoughtful and substantive amendments which deserved the consideration of all 435 Members of the House, but they were denied that opportunity, Mr. Speaker, by this restrictive and draconian rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, back home in my district, rules aren't rules if you only follow them when you want to. Democrats promised to use a fair and open process for everything. Instead, they're picking and choosing. And when you pick and choose to do so, it's called breaking a rule and breaking a promise. 
   So I urge the new majority to rededicate itself to its campaign promises of a fair and open process. We should allow this Chamber to work its will on all legislation. An open process shouldn't just be something that's just talked about solely on the campaign trail. What amendment was so scary that it ought not be included in this discussion? 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule so that we may have a complete, open and fair debate. The American people deserve and expect no less.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much the opportunity to once again come before the House and address issues of concern, to bring another version of the Official Truth Squad. 
   The Official Truth Squad started a couple of years ago and was an attempt to, actually grew out of a frustration by many of my colleagues and I who watched what occurred on the floor of the House here and felt that there just wasn't a lot of sunshine going on, bringing light to many of the discussions. And so we launched the Official Truth Squad. The attempt was to try to hopefully bring some commonsense discussion, real-sense discussion to the conversations that go on here in the House on a number of different topics. 
   One of our favorite quotes is that of the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan who said, ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but they're not entitled to their own facts.'' 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, what I'd like to do today for a little bit is just to talk about some facts. And one fact that I'd like to present as I begin is that, about a week ago, exactly a week ago, Thursday of last week, a little earlier in the day I took this same well, and I made the comment that at that time it was a specific hour on the clock. Today, as a matter of fact, it's 3:34 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. 
   Many individuals are just getting completed with a full day's work or about to complete a full day's work. A lot of folks are getting ready for the second shift, getting ready to start their shift from 3 to 11 across this Nation. Some who will be working the midnight shift, the late shift, are probably just putting their head on the pillow so that they can get some sleep before they get back up later this evening to get to work tonight. 
   And where's the House? Well, Mr. Speaker, if you look around you can tell that the House has gone home. The House has gone home. In fact, we went home today without even passing a bill, without even voting on a bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people have great concern about the lack of productivity here in the House, and they have specific concern about the  inability, apparent inability of this House and this leadership to address the issues that are of utmost concern to the American people. 
   We take an oath, Mr. Speaker, as you know, that says that we will work to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. One of the ways that we do that is to make certain that the individuals who are gaining information on our behalf from folks across the world who wish to do us harm, that we get that information, that we're working with as much information as possible, that we, as a Nation, know what the bad guys are going to do before they do it. When we don't, what happens is days like 9/11. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, shortly after 9/11 there were some laws that were passed that updated our intelligence capability, that made it so that our intelligence officers across the world would be able to track and listen to and discover electronic communication, verbal and otherwise, when terrorists outside of the United States were talking to other terrorists outside of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I represent the Sixth District of Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. When I ask folks at home does anybody think that's not a good idea, should we be able to listen to terrorists outside of our country when they talk to other terrorists outside of our country, and they might be talking about plans to bring many of us great harm, should we be able to listen if we had the technological capability to do so, I haven't met anybody yet, not one person yet who thought that was a bad idea. 
   This is not the Federal Government wiretapping, surveilling, listening in on conversations between you and me. This is not the issue. The issue is not whether or not the laws ought to be changed to determine whether or not our intelligence officers can listen to American citizens talking to American citizens on American soil. 
   No, Mr. Speaker, this issue is the ability of our intelligence officers to listen to terrorists or suspected terrorists outside the United States who are talking or communicating with others of like mind outside the United States. Should we be able to do that? 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate thinks we ought to be able to do that, by a bipartisan majority, 68-29. Up until this leadership, the House thought we ought to be able to do that. The American people think we ought to be able to do that. 
   But the problem now, Mr. Speaker, is this leadership in the House of Representatives who has allowed this law to expire. This leadership has made it so that the American people are suffering from an American Government that has brought about a unilateral, unilateral disarmament when it comes to determining what terrorists are doing, plotting to do us great harm. That's not my opinion. That's a fact. That's a fact. 
   I'll give you some other facts here, Mr. Speaker. What has happened in the past week, since I last took this well and spoke about this issue is that a letter was sent out from a bipartisan group of 25 State Attorneys General talking about this FISA bill. I will submit this letter for insertion into the Record.  
   March 4, 2008.  Re FISA Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 2248)  
 Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, Washington, DC. Hon. Steny Hoyer, Majority Leader, Washington, DC.  Hon. John Boehner, Minority Leader, Washington, DC.  Hon. Roy Blunt, Minority Whip, Washington, DC.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for her comments and for her perspective and for bringing more light and truth to this issue. And it is not just our opinion. It's the opinion of so many individuals. 
   As you mentioned, the bipartisan bill in the United States Senate, 68-29. These aren't the most harmonious of times in Washington, Mr. Speaker; but the gentlelady from Tennessee and I certainly understand and appreciate that one of our primary responsibilities is the protection of our Nation. And the Senate understood that, and that's why they worked together in a bipartisan way. 
   So many individuals have given their opinion about why this was important. Mike McConnell, who is the Director of National Intelligence, said before the House Intelligence Committee, We are significantly burdened in capturing overseas communications of foreign terrorists planning to conduct attacks inside the United States. That's what the Director of National Intelligence said. 
   And Senator Jay Rockefeller, a Democrat from West Virginia who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate, said just last month, What people have to understand around here is that the quality of the intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded. He said that, if we allow the Protect America Act to expire. Well, Mr. Speaker, we didn't allow it to expire, but the leadership in the House has allowed it to expire. And that's what concerns us so greatly. 
   I know that my friend from Tennessee appreciates what Senator Rockefeller has said as it relates to this issue, and I am pleased to yield back.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend once again for her comments and perspective on this most important issue. 
   I don't know, Mr. Speaker, if there's anything that we do here that is more important than making certain that America is safe and secure. And the American people, although they know that there are partisan battles and political games that are played here, they understand and appreciate that. But what they don't understand is a leadership that abrogates the duty and responsibility that they have to make certain that this Nation is safe. 
   Person after person, individuals who have great knowledge and experience in this area, much greater than those of us in the House of Representatives in terms of actual hands-on experience in determining what the terrorists are trying to do to do us harm, to a person, to a person say that this is a bill that must be passed. 
   We are now 19 or 20 days into not having the ability to gain this intelligence, and it is harming our Nation. It is putting us at greater risk. 
   We've been joined by another good friend from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland), and I look forward to your comments on the issue of the importance and imperative of passing the Protect America Act, and I will yield to him.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate that. Mr. Speaker, it's kind of appropriate that we are interrupted by a unanimous consent request, a motion that says we ought not do anything in this House until next week, let's just go home. 
   My friend from Georgia points out that we haven't been doing a lot this year, haven't been doing a whole lot this 110th Congress. And the American people can tolerate a lot in their political leaders, but what they can't tolerate is inaction on important issues and matters of national concern, national security. So, it frustrates them, it frustrates us that this leadership won't bring this bill to the floor. Twenty-one Members of the majority party have signed a letter that said they would vote for this; 21 Members. This bill would pass if it were just brought to the floor. 
   I am pleased to yield to my good friend from Tennessee.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Without a doubt. And our constituents understand and appreciate that. 
   The folks that we're up against in this battle, the individuals who wish to do us harm, are very smart people, very smart people. And we have an open society. When we provide them an opening in that open society, they will take advantage of it. And as you say, it's unconscionable. It's unconscionable for this House to 
   not allow a vote on it. 
   Some of my constituents at home say, well, why can't you just bring it up? And as you've mentioned, we have tried to bring it up, but the House is a very majoritarian body, it is run by strict rules. And if the leadership of the majority party doesn't want it to happen, it won't happen. If the majority party doesn't want it to happen, it won't happen. And the reason for that is they control absolutely everything that comes to the floor. And consequently, our constituents, our friends at home get frustrated by the fact that we, in this House of Representatives, seem to be unable to get this done. And we've called on, I've called on, everybody here has called on the Democrat leadership, on the Speaker, on the leader on the other side to bring this to a vote. 
   We're comfortable and confident that this House will do the right thing, will do the responsible thing, and will pass this bill.

That was one of them today, as you saw the chuckles go across on the other side of the aisle when the companies, the patriotic companies, are trying to assist this administration, assist this government, assist our intelligence community in being able to protect all of us; and all they do is denigrate them. It's just so distressing because it's such disinformation and misinformation that it confuses our constituents. But what our constituents understand and appreciate is that it is the majority party in this House that won't allow this House to vote on a bill to protect America.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. It's affecting the information that they're able to get. But it's communication from a foreign individual on foreign soil to another foreign individual on foreign soil. This is not between an American individual on American soil to another American individual on American soil. 
   Mr. Speaker, when it's confused and brought into kind of a perplexing dilemma for people and talking about the violation of Americans' civil rights, that's not what this is about. This is about protecting Americans from terrorists overseas. And what we have seen in the last 19 or 20 days is exactly what Senator Rockefeller knew when we see, when he said on February 14 of this year: ``What people have to understand around here is that the quality of intelligence we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded.'' He said, stating before the Senate, that if this bill is not passed, the ability to gather intelligence will be degraded. Mr. Speaker, that means that we are not able to get the intelligence we need. 
   We are now 19, 20 days into not having this bill in place, not having this law in place. And why? I have difficulty when I get asked at home that question. My constituents, many of them, will say, why won't they pass the bill? A majority of the House wants it. Right? And that's correct. Twenty-one Members on the Democrat side have said they would vote for the bill. The vast majority, if not everybody, on the Republican side would vote for the bill. Mr. Speaker, you know, that's a majority of this House of Representatives. So let the House work its will. 
   Why won't they bring it up? The only rationale, the only reason that has made any sense to anybody, is purely political. Purely political, either to continue the issue for their left, liberal wing because they believe they could gain political points with it or the political nature of not making it so the communications companies have immunity from the information that they provide on foreign individuals, terrorists overseas communicating with other terrorists overseas, providing those individuals the same protections that we have under the United States Constitution. 
   Never before has that been done. Never before have we provided individuals in a foreign land, non-American citizens in a foreign land, the rights, privileges, and protections of the United States Constitution. Because of the trial lawyer lobby and because of the trial lawyer support for the majority party, the Democratic Party, that's apparently the only reasonable answer to the question, Why won't they allow this to come forward? 
   But, Mr. Speaker, the leadership has recognized, at least they say they have recognized, the importance of this issue. Just 6 days ago, the majority leader said: ``This is a very serious, important bill. It's critical to the defense of our country.'' Just last week he said this. Why, then, Mr. Speaker, are we not voting on it today? It's 4:25. There's no reason that we ought not have brought this bill up today or yesterday or the day before or tomorrow. But, Mr. Speaker, no, the House has gone home. 
   Individual after individual has appreciated and recognized the importance of this bill, that the terrorists, those who want to do us harm, are very nimble. They're very flexible. They're very bright. Members of the House of Representatives oftentimes have the opportunity to go to Iraq and to Afghanistan. I was talking to a colleague who was there just 11 days ago. That's just a week into when we didn't have this capability. And 11 days ago, this Member of this body, this House of Representatives, was told by a general on the ground in Iraq that the information they were receiving was not as of high quality as it had been the week before. Changes occur that rapidly in the ability to gain information. 
   Mr. Speaker, some say that the individuals representing them across this Nation are incapable of leading this Nation anymore. Some say that the actions of this House of Representatives border upon treasonous activity. Mr. Speaker, this isn't leadership that's going on in this House right now; it's an abrogation of duty. It's an abrogation of responsibility. It's a violation of the people's trust. It's a violation of the oath of office. Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding that this be voted on and that it be voted on at the first opportunity, which now becomes next week. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate Republicans have voted ``yes.'' The Senate Democrats have voted ``yes.'' The House Republicans will vote ``yes'' when given the opportunity. The House Democrat leadership is the only thing standing in the way of passing the Protect America Act and securing and defending this Nation in only the way that we can now, with appropriate intelligence capability. We must do that and we must do that as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding. 
   There are so many remarkable aspects of this bill that deserve debate and discussion, but it's not going to happen. So the question that I would ask is, what on Earth are the Democrats afraid of? What on Earth is the new majority afraid of? This majority, the Democrat majority, promised the Nation a fair and open process, and again, they've failed to live up to their promises. 
   This bill, we received the final language of almost 700 pages in this bill at 6:30 p.m. last night, 6:30 p.m., Mr. Speaker, and we were told that the Rules Committee was meeting at 7:30 p.m., 1 hour later. The bill itself increases the debt limit by $800 billion. Mr. Speaker, by my calculation, that is $1.3 billion a minute to allow Members an opportunity to look at the bill and determine whether or not amendments ought be in order. But the Rules Committee didn't accept any amendments. 
   The bill has the potential to increase the national debt by 50 percent, by $5 trillion. Don't you think the taxpayers of this Nation deserve an open and an honest debate about that? 
   The bill gives unprecedented and unchecked authority to the Treasury Department to put taxpayers on the hook for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And we've been given 2 hours to debate it, with no amendments, no opportunity for change? What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? 
   The most sweeping changes to housing law in a generation were circulated to our offices just 16 hours prior to floor consideration. Now, this is in contrast to what the leadership, the Democrat leadership, said just 2 short years ago before they became leaders. 
   Speaker Pelosi said in June of 2006, ``Because the debate has been limited and Americans' voices silenced by this restrictive rule, I urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.'' 
   Well, I agree with the Speaker. But what's changed? What's changed for her? Is it political expediency or is it a broken promise? 
   In December of 2006, following the election, now-Majority Leader Steny Hoyer bragged to the media. He said, ``We intend to have a Rules Committee ..... that gives opposition voices and alternative proposals the ability to be heard and considered on the floor of the House.'' 
   What happened, Mr. Speaker? What are they afraid of? What are they afraid of? Here we are considering a rule in which the majority didn't even bother to post a process by which Members could submit amendments. What's changed, Mr. Speaker? What are they afraid of? What debate would be so scary that they wouldn't even allow an amendment or an alternative on the floor? 
   The chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, said, ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under an open rule, not just appropriations bills, which are already restricted. An open process should be the norm and not the exception.'' 
   What changed, Mr. Speaker? What changed? What are they so afraid of? 
   The Democratic Caucus Chair Rahm Emanuel said, ``Let us have an up-or-down vote. Do not be scared. Do not hide behind some little rule. Come on out here. Put it on the table, and let us have a vote. So do not hide behind the rule. If this is what you want to do, let us have an up-or-down vote. You can put your vote's right up there ..... and then the American people can see what it is all about.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, what's so scary about an open rule? Such heavy-handed tactics effectively silence half of the American people. How can that be consistent with the campaign promises that we heard from this new majority? 
   A number of Republicans, including myself, submitted amendments to the bill. I submitted two thoughtful and substantive amendments.

It may not have been what the majority party wanted to talk about today, but it's what the American people want to talk about and that's energy. 
   I don't know if anybody had an opportunity to walk outside the United States Capitol today, but you heard trucks with their horns blaring outside the Capitol, and they were doing so because they were objecting to the leadership in this Congress and the lack of action on energy prices and gas prices. That noise resonates across this land, Madam Chairman. Resonates across the land. 
   I had a group of high school students in my office today, and they wanted to know what we were doing about energy. They'd heard that this Congress had passed the Energy Efficiency Act. They wanted to know about the particulars of that act. And so we reviewed the particulars of that act, and I said, how much more gas do you think will get to the pumps in communities across this Nation if we increase the taxes on American oil companies? Well, these are bright high school kids. They said, well, not much more. And they're absolutely right, Madam Chairman, because the Energy Efficiency Act that this Congress passed in this session, in this term, will produce no energy. No new energy.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate your comments. 
   And if you think about what has changed in the last 15 months in terms of leadership here in Washington, it's not the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. The only thing that's changed during the period of time when crude oil has gone from $56 a barrel to $112 a barrel, the only thing that's changed in terms of the leadership in Washington is the leadership in Congress. That's the only thing that's changed. There must be a cause and effect here somewhere, Madam Chairman, because gas prices are increasing, and the leadership has been woeful in not attempting to deal with this issue. 
   And so I would ask my colleagues to bring to the floor issues that are of paramount importance to the American people. The issue that's of paramount importance in my district is energy and gas prices. And this Congress is doing nothing about it, in spite of the proclamations and promises made during the previous election. 
   So, Madam Chairman, there are wonderful solutions out there, there are positive solutions. Conservation: We can do a whole lot more to incentivize individuals to conserve. Utilizing American resources for Americans, there's a novel thought, Madam Chairman. There are incredible resources that we have. And we've got the technology and the American ingenuity to do it in an environmentally sensitive way, and we ought to. We ought to. This leadership ought to allow that kind of issue to come to the floor. 
   And finally, alternative fuel. It's imperative that we have the kind of research and development and incentivizing alternative fuel formation in this Nation in ways that we've never done before, not pick winners and losers, which is what Washington tends to want to do, but to incentivize a system that would provide for wonderful, entrepreneurial, visionary, enthusiastic individuals all across this Nation who have the intelligence and the foresight and the desire to help America prevail in our energy independence. 
   So, Madam Chairman, I come to the floor today with a level of frustration by the inability of this leadership, apparently, to address the concerns of the American people, to address the concerns of those high school students that were in my office this morning, to address the concerns of those truckers, who continue out there outside the Capitol blaring their horns and saying, wake up. Wake up, Madam Speaker, wake up leadership in this Congress, wake up and address the issues that are of paramount importance to the American people. The paramount issue today is energy and gasoline prices, and we must, as a Congress, address that issue in a positive way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it is now 5:10 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon. And for most individuals across this Nation, this is about the end of the fourth working day of the week. For the House, we've just completed less than two full days of work, but if you stretch it, it's really a little over two. Where's the House now? They've gone home. Where was the House on Monday? Home. Now, that's important because there are important things to do at home. But Madam Speaker, it's important to appreciate that there are major issues that the American people are demanding that Congress address. 
   We heard about one of them this afternoon: Gas prices. Gas prices significantly increased over the last 12 to 15 months, and this Congress has done nothing except raise taxes on American oil producers. 
   But the reason I want to bring focus to the issue of Congress going home is that we are now 55 days into a unilateral disarmament for our Nation. That is right, Madam Speaker. Fifty-five days ago, this House, the leadership in the House, chose to allow some amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to expire. Now, what did those amendments do? Those amendments which were adopted shortly after 9/11 allowed, e-d, past tense, allowed our intelligence community to listen or surveil or intercept phone or electronic communication between, Madam Speaker, between a foreign individual in a foreign land talking or communicating to a foreign individual in a foreign land. That is right, Madam Speaker. If an individual who wishes to do our Nation harm is speaking to another individual who wishes to do us harm, up until 55 days ago, we had an opportunity in this Nation to determine to listen to, to know what kind of communication that was. But 55 days ago, this leadership in this House chose to let that expire. 
   Now why did they choose to let that expire? Well, what they believe is that American trial lawyers ought to have the ability to sue communications companies who share that information with the United States government, with our intelligence community, the folks trying to keep us safe. 
   Madam Speaker, back in my district, the Sixth District of Georgia, the people don't understand the kind of leadership that would have the mentality to not allow our intelligence community to listen to a potential terrorist talking to another potential terrorist outside the United States. Not to an American, but to somebody who is not an American citizen. Consequently, Madam Speaker, we are now utilizing the same rules that we had in effect on September 10, 2001. 
   Madam Speaker, you hear a lot of talk about crises across this Nation, and our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about the crisis in this and the crisis in that. I'll tell you what we've got a crisis of in this Congress, Madam Speaker, and that is a Congress of irresponsibility, a crisis of irresponsibility and a leadership that refuses to allow this Congress to do its number one job, which is to protect our citizens and our constituents.     
   Madam Speaker, I call on the Speaker and I call on the majority leader and I call on the majority party in the House of Representatives to bring the Protect America Act to the floor. It's a bill that has bipartisan support. A majority of individuals in the House have said they will support it. It would pass if it were brought up today. But what were we talking about today? Bills that didn't have to do with the security of the United States. 
   I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to bring that bill to the floor, allow it to pass as it has in the Senate, in a bipartisan way, so that we can return home and tell our constituents that we acted positively to assist in protecting them and their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (MOTION TO GO TO CONFERENCE ON H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's leadership on this. 
   My good friend from the other side said he didn't come prepared to talk about his side's strategy on energy. Well, let me share with you what an aide from the Democrat side said just this week. He said, ``Right now, our strategy on gas prices is to drive small cars and wait for the wind.'' 
   That is the problem, Madam Speaker. Because when we want home last week, all of us went home last week for the Fourth of July break, we met with our constituents; and we heard what I suspect my friend from Massachusetts  would hear if he asks, and that is, that they understand, the American people understand that supply is important. And this is a dynamic situation. 
   He talks about a vote a number of years ago on whether or not there ought to be offshore exploration. Well, Madam Speaker, the situation has changed. The American's people opinion has changed. What has done that? $4 a gallon gasoline that the other side has done nothing about. 
   On our side we have attempted for years, literally for years to increase supply. In fact, as has been recited by my good friend from California earlier, we have passed all sorts of legislation out of the House of Representatives. What has happened is that they have died in the Senate. They have not gotten the 60 votes that they needed. But, Madam Speaker, I have great confidence in the responsiveness of the United States Senators, who have also been home and appreciate that this situation has changed. 
   The American people are demanding American energy for Americans, and there are solutions that are on the table. H.R. 3089, No More Excuses Energy Act, would reduce the price of gasoline by opening new American oil refineries. Investing in clean energy sources such as wind, nuclear, and captured carbon dioxide, and making available more homegrown energy through environmentally sensitive exploration of the Arctic Energy Slope and America's Deep-Sea Energy Reserves. 
   H.R. 3089, Madam Speaker. It is there for the taking. All we ask for is a vote. We are not guaranteeing passage, but we do believe that it is appropriate for the most deliberative body in the world to have an opportunity to vote on increasing the supply of American energy for Americans. And the problem is, is that our friends on the other side don't want to have that vote. Why? I am not quite certain, because I know that their constituents are telling them what our constituents are telling us, and that is, increase American energy for Americans. Instead, what is their policy? Drive small cars and wait for the wind. 
   Madam Speaker, we demand a vote on H.R. 3089 and the other bills that will increase American supply, American energy for Americans. Let's vote now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey, Congressman Garrett, for organizing this hour, and for your leadership on what truly is one of the most important issues, and that is the education of our children. It is a great privilege to be able to join you tonight and to commend you for the work that you have done in this area. 
   What could truly be more important, Mr. Speaker, other than the education of our children? I don't know that anything could be more important than the education of our children. What it gets to, when you get right down to the rub though, is who is going to make decisions? Who is going to decide where we are going in the area of education? 
   I was pleased to hear my friend from North Carolina earlier, Congresswoman Foxx, point out that No Child Left Behind is oftentimes thought of as a new endeavor. In fact, it was the reauthorization of the ESEA, or the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that began back in 1965. You have pointed out so well about the issue of the amount of money and the amount of performance or the quality of performance of children. But the No Child Left Behind Act, which was passed originally in 2002, is up for reauthorization. 
   I represent a district on the north side of Atlanta, the Sixth District of Georgia. I served on the Education Committee in the State legislature, in the State Senate, and also serve on the Education Committee here in the United States Congress. One of the concerns that I have heard about for the last decade or more that I have been involved in public service is from teachers, and their main concern is that they have remarkable constraints placed upon them in trying to get their children to whatever level it is in whatever subject. 
   When I was running for Congress initially, I used to tell folks that as a physician, one of the reasons that spurred me into public service, to get involved in elective office, was there were all sorts of folks at the local, State and Federal level that were making decisions about what I could do for and with my patients. 
   When I would share those stories with my local teachers, they would say, well, you haven't seen anything. You wouldn't believe what the State government is doing to encumber what we are trying to do for our children in our classroom. Then after 2002 with No Child Left Behind, they would say, you wouldn't believe the changes that have occurred that have made my job as a teacher more difficult in trying to educate the children that are entrusted to me.     
   So I think it is important as we look at the reauthorization as we move forward on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, now known as No Child Left Behind, what has happened over the last 5 years. The original bill provided for increasing money from the  Federal Government, a 26 percent increase in spending and new programs as it relates to No Child Left Behind. 
   The problem, as you know, is most folks across this Nation know what the Golden Rule is: Do onto others as you would have them do onto you. But in Washington the Golden Rule is different. In Washington the Golden Rule is: He who has the gold makes the rules. Consequently, what we have seen in our education establishment is that money from the Federal Government, that 26 percent increase in spending from the Federal Government, with it comes strings and those strings are rules and regulations that require more of local folks in the area of education. 
   And now all of that might be wonderful if we were to have seen over the last 5 years, if not the last 40 years, an increase in the level of achievement of children in our local schools.

<DOCNO>Mr. PRICE of Georgia. (EDUCATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. You can look at that and realize that the hard-earned taxpayer dollars that we are entrusted with to spend responsibly, and it was the collective wisdom of Congress over that period of time, to spend significantly greater money. You have an increase of nearly 90 percent in spending over that period of time on that chart; and, in fact, little to no change in the achievement of the students in both the areas of math and reading. 
   That is not to say that kids can't improve. But I think it is to say that the amount of money, it is clearly documented, that the amount of money in and of itself as being a predictor of student achievement just doesn't exist. That is study after study after study. 
   But I want to spend just a few more moments, because when you think back to your school days, you always were a little anxious about getting your report card. You weren't quite certain whether or not that teacher was going to recognize the wonderful work you had done that would boost you into that next level. But I thought it would be helpful to give a report card on No Child Left Behind, the last 5 years of the authorization. 
   So I searched around to find an objective report card, and I found the Heritage Foundation, which is a wonderful group of independent thinkers, objective thinkers, not necessarily Republican thinkers by any means, but objective thinkers; and they came up with kind of tracking in four or five different areas. I thought it might be helpful to share with my colleagues tonight a couple areas that they graded as it related to No Child Left Behind, or the reauthorization of the ESEA from 2002 to 2007. 
   One of the things that they looked at was one of the goals that was cited was to constrain this remarkable Federal spending. As we have discussed, of course, spending increased by $23.5 billion over 2001 to 2007, a significant increase, an increase that is well documented on the graphs here. So they gave the constraint of Federal spending an F. That is failing on constraining Federal spending. 
   What about streamlining bureaucracy and decreasing red tape, one of the things that we always tout as the latest and the greatest for every Federal program; it is going to streamline the bureaucracy and decrease the red tape. Certainly that is one of the areas that teachers that I talk to back home have the greatest objection to, that it has increased their paperwork and increased their red tape. 
   In fact, another objective organization, the Office of Management and Budget, has determined that the annual paperwork burden on State and local communities has been 7 million hours, a cost of at least $140 million to the local and State communities in the area of education. So streamlining bureaucracy and red tape, what is the grade? It is another F, a failure. 
   What about maintaining meaningful State testing? It is not that States haven't tried for decades to increase the performance of the children entrusted to them in the public education system. Many of the States have adopted all sorts of testing; and, in fact, what No Child Left Behind has done is either duplicated or usurped the ability of States to maintain their meaningful testing. So Heritage was relatively kind and gave us, the Federal Government, a C as it related to that. 
   Finally, the area that I hear the most about, restoring State and local control. All of us know that local teachers and local communities and local administrators and certainly parents know best the kinds of activities that will allow one child and another, all children, the opportunity to achieve and reach their greatest potential. And restoring State and local control, what happened with No Child Left Behind, that is another F. So we can all agree that we ought to increase student achievement. We all believe that ought to occur. 
   I would just implore my colleagues and respectfully request that we look at the history. Look at the charts. Look at the demonstration. Look at the history that has gone on in terms of Federal spending and student achievement. 
   I would ask my colleagues to look at the history over the last 5 years of what the increase in regulation and requirements from the Federal Government has been to the local communities. Have they increased student  achievement? I think an objective assessment of the situation would say that in fact they have not. I would ask my colleagues to look at whether or not removing State and local control over the issue of education has assisted in increasing student achievement, and I would suggest candidly it has not. 
   That is why I am so proud to stand with my colleague from New Jersey tonight who has penned the LEARN Act, the bill that would allow States to opt out of this insanity, opt out of this merry-go-round that apparently by evidence tonight demonstrates that the Federal Government and its role in elementary and secondary education has not been necessarily productive in increasing student achievement, and to allow the States and local communities to recognize and appreciate that they know best how to get our young people to a level of accountability. 
   All of us want them to achieve. I so strongly support my colleague from New Jersey in his efforts to make it so his State and my State and other States across this Nation, if they so desire, can opt out of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act so that those moneys can go back home to be utilized in the most efficient and effective manner to make it so our children can achieve.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to offer this amendment. This amendment is what is affectionately referred to as the Hefley amendment. Former Congressman Hefley, who served in this body, offered an across-the-board decrease in spending in appropriations bills by 1 percent in an effort to try to bring about some fiscal responsibilities. I commend him at this time. 
   I also want to recognize Congresswoman Blackburn, Congressman Hensarling, Congressman Feeney and Congressman Campbell for also offering similar amendments and commend them for their fiscal responsibility. 
   There has been a lot of talk about money, and properly so, during this appropriation season. It is important, Mr. Chairman, however, to remember where that money comes from. That money comes from hardworking American taxpayers. It is their money. It is not the government's money. It is their money. It is easy here in Washington to lose sight of that fact.     
   But it is imperative that we remember with great responsibility and act with great reason as we move and spend the hard working American taxpayers' money. 
   The big picture in this bill is that last year in this area of the Federal budget we spent as a Nation $31.2 billion. That is with a B, Mr. Chairman, $31.2 billion. The proposal today is to spend $34.2 billion. That is an increase of 9.5 percent. This amendment would decrease that by 1 percent. By 1 percent. One penny out of every dollar savings for the American people. A savings of $342 million. 
   I would suggest, Mr. Chairman, that this is a small step, a symbolic step but is an important step, to let the American people know that, yes, we do believe that we respect the hard work that they do, and we also believe that it is important for Washington to get its fiscal house in order. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I am pleased to have the support of so many of my colleagues in this House on this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise with a very simple amendment, an amendment of responsibility. 
   As you and the House know, H.R. 700 grants $125 million for alternative water source projects. It is a program that Congress has never funded, may be a very appropriate program. For some in this Chamber, $125 million may not be very much money, but for folks in my district, and I suspect for folks around this Nation, $125 million is a lot of money.     
   And, again, while what this bill does may be very important, it is important that we also make a statement for financial responsibility. This amendment would apply the principle of pay-as-you-go, pay-as-you-go to any new spending that would be authorized in this legislation. 
   Very simple: If you are going to spend money for this project, you ought to make it a priority and identify an area where you desire to take that money from in order to pay for this project. It is a concept that has been embraced by many in this Chamber. In fact, many Members on the majority side embraced the pay-as-you-go project in their campaigns this past year. In fact, the New Direction for America, which was proposed by the majority party in the 109th Congress, says, ``Our new direction is committed to pay-as-you-go budgeting. No more deficit spending. We are committed to auditing the books and subjecting every facet of Federal spending to tough budget discipline and accountability, forcing the Congress to choose a new direction and the right priorities for all Americans.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I agree with that. It is a wise idea. We ought to follow that. We ought to follow that in this new Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I would respectfully suggest that, unless adopted, then the new direction in which we are heading is one that will take us in a direction of greater red ink and not that of financial responsibility. So I offer this simple amendment, this PAYGO amendment to H.R. 700, and I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding. I will be very brief. 
   I rise to point a couple points of clarification. And I appreciate the gentlewoman from Texas and her comments, but she did say that this amendment would require finding $120 million of offsets somewhere else, regardless of whether there was any money that was ever authorized for this particular grant project. In fact, that is not the case. 
   On line 4 of the amendment, it says that, ``any other provision that results in costs to the Federal Government.'' So it would require that the Congress had determined that, yes, there should be money spent for these grant projects, and then the equal amount of offset money would need to be found.

   But I would suggest to my colleagues that this is a matter of principle. It is a matter of principle, and it is a matter of making the statement now that we believe that, if we are going to spend money for this project and we believe that it is a priority, that we ought to find the money elsewhere in order to cover that so that we do not increase the deficit. 
   I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.

   Mr. PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer this motion to recommit. And I am more pleased to commend my Democratic colleagues for yesterday's recognition of the motion to recommit. They will recognize today's because it is exactly the same motion. 
   I think with that recognition came the realization and appreciation that motions to recommit are, indeed, substantive moves and they are substantive proposals of policy by this House of Representatives. 
   This motion to recommit is one about honesty; it is about honesty in the provision of the funds in the bill that is about to be adopted. 
   Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit would reinforce existing Federal law by making it clear that none of the funds authorized under this act may be used to lobby or retain a lobbyist to attempt to influence Federal, State or local governmental officials. It would also expand upon existing law by specifically prohibiting Federal funds from being used to pay for membership in any association or organization. And, Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned yesterday, many of those dues rise to the sum of $48,000 to $50,000 or more. The funds should only be used for the purposes intended by Congress, namely, identifying alternative water source projects. 
   And while associations and organizations provide meaningful opportunities for collaboration and knowledge dissemination, it would not be appropriate to use hard-earned scarce Federal tax dollars for such a purpose. Such a diversion of these funds would not only limit the amount of funds available for the actual use and construction of alternative water source projects, it could indeed constitute an end run around the lobbying restrictions since many of these associations engage in lobbying activities.  
   In recent years, Mr. Speaker, growth in population and increasing environmental awareness is causing many communities to explore alternative water supplies through reclamation, reuse and conservation. And while the Clean Water Act construction grants prior to 1991 and State revolving loan funds since 1989 have been available for such activities, most expenditures to date have been for more traditional wastewater projects and not for enhancing water supplies through wastewater reuse and water recycling. For these compelling reasons, we need to ensure that all available resources provided through this reauthorization are used specifically for the purpose of building and improving alternative water source projects for municipal, industrial or agricultural uses in areas that are experiencing critical water supply needs. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize what they recognized yesterday, and that is that motions to recommit are substantive policy motions. I urge the adoption of this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
