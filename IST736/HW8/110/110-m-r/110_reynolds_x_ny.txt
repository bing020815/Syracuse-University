<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, the gentleman from Connecticut, has outlined a number of provisions in this bill, we come together today not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We are united in our respect for those who wear the uniform of the United States Armed Forces, and we are united in our desire to ensure that Federal programs within the Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction from the Tax Code to the SSI program work effectively for members of the military, veterans, first responders and their families. 
   Let me begin by also thanking Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery, as well as Chairman Neal, Chairman McDermott, and Ranking Members ENGLISH and WELLER, for their outstanding leadership in crafting this legislation. This bill is a great example of what we can accomplish when we put our differences aside and work together. I am hopeful that the revisions we are making to this legislation today will be taken up in short order by the other body. 
   I would also like to highlight two specific provisions in the bill that have been of particular interest to me during my time in Congress. The first provision, section 202, is modeled on legislation, the Blind Veterans Fairness Act, that I first introduced in the year 2000. My legislation would correct a problem in the Federal SSI rules and affects blind veterans in four States, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, that provide these veterans modest annuities in recognition of the substantial sacrifice they have made to serving our country.     
   Regrettably, under current Federal law, these State annuities actually reduce any SSI payments for which blind veterans would otherwise be eligible. As we heard from Michelle LaRock of our New York City's Division of Veterans Affairs at our Ways and Means hearing in October, this quirk in the Federal SSI rules creates a hardship not only for the affected veterans themselves, but for the States that administer these annuity programs as well. As in years past, the bill I introduced in the 110th Congress, H.R. 649, has enjoyed bipartisan support. 
   Let me turn briefly to a separate provision, section 107 of the bill, which will permanently allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs, 401(k)s, and other retirement funds for Reservists and National Guardsmen called to active duty. As we all know, when Guardsmen and Reservists are called up from our States, they often face significant reductions in pay compared to their civilian salaries, put an economic strain on their families. To lessen this economic hardship, many of them  choose to draw down on their retirement funds. 
   Unfortunately, under prior law, they faced a 10 percent ``early withdrawal tax'' when they did so, and they faced restrictions on making repayments to their retirement funds upon returning from active duty. Last year's Pension Protection Act provided relief from this 10 percent penalty tax and permitted unlimited repayments within 2 years after leaving active duty, but only for Guardsmen and Reservists called to active duty before December 31, 2007. 
   To ensure that this important relief remains available on a permanent basis going forward, I introduced H.R. 867, the Guardsmen and Reservists' Tax Fairness Act on February 7 of this year. This legislation has also attracted a bipartisan group of cosponsors, as well as endorsements from several leading veterans service organizations. 
   Mr. Speaker, we recently got a great reminder of the time-sensitivity of this particular provision from the area I represent in Western New York. Just days ago, it was announced that 100 members of the 107th Air Refueling Wing, stationed at Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station, will be deployed to the Middle East in January as part of the global war on terror. Unless this tax benefit is made permanent, these brave men and women, and countless more just like them across the country, will lose their eligibility simply because the calendar has flipped to 2008 before their date of deployment. 
   I sincerely hope that our colleagues on the other side of the Capitol will recognize the urgency of this issue and ensure that the provision is sent to the President's desk before adjourning for the year. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the gentleman from New Jersey, our distinguished member from Ways and Means. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. As both the manager of the bill, Mr. Larson of Connecticut, has outlined and as I have outlined, as we share strong support and we put Democrat and Republican views aside, and represented clearly what is best for America as we deal with our veterans and as we deal with our firefighters. And so both sides of the aisle today join strongly in a clear message of support of this legislation as it comes again before the House and goes to the other body, in hopes that the other body will see fit to support the type of legislation that is coming with such bipartisan support of not only the Ways and Means Committee but through what I believe will be the entire House.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to close debate on our side. 
   Let me first take a moment again to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for their ongoing  work on this important bill and for including two specific provisions I described earlier regarding SSI benefits for blind veterans and penalty-free withdrawals by National Guardsmen and Reservists. 
   Even more importantly, I want to thank my chairman and ranking member for working so hard to cultivate a true spirit of bipartisanship when we deal with issues where we can find common ground.     
   Today on this legislation, which is very important for both Guardsmen and Reservists and veterans who are serving our country and have served our country, and for our first responders and our firefighters, today is one where we have worked hard to take a number of bills and put them together and make it an opportunity to get results in 2007 that will be the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1275 honoring the life of Timothy John Russert, Jr. 
   It has been just days since one of Buffalo's favorite sons was taken from us tragically, and suddenly. We have been touched by the makeshift memorial outside the NBC News bureau in Washington, DC, the flags flying at half-staff outside City Hall in Buffalo and Rockefeller Center in New York City, and the thousands who have come from all walks of life to visit the park right outside South Buffalo that bears the name of this giant of broadcast journalism. 
   Tim and I walked similar beats, cutting our teeth in New York politics--the tricks of the trade Tim picked up working for the late great Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former Gov. Mario Cuomo, he took with him to NBC, where he ended up the sparring partner of many a public official, including me. Every time we got together, Tim was tough, but fair--and at the end of the day, we were still two Buffalo guys who could talk shop about the Bills and the Sabres. 
   Though we cannot begin to comprehend the reach of Tim Russert's legacy--we are still a community in mourning--we can say with great certainty that he has left an indelible mark on all of us. 
   Thank you, Tim. Go Bills!

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, May 14 marks the 60th anniversary of Israel's independence. On behalf of the House Republican Israel Caucus, I rise today to honor the Jewish state for its significant achievements over the past six decades. 
   Israel has shared an important strategic relationship with our Nation. And today, our countries are working more closely than ever before to defeat the common threat of terrorism. 
   Research and development collaborations between our countries have produced security technologies that are now used to protect the lives of Americans, Israelis, and of people all over the world. In fact, Israeli equipment has saved the lives of hundreds of U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. And because of Israel's desert location, farmers and agricultural experts there have been forced to adapt their irrigation methods. This research now benefits dry weather areas around the world, all because Israel discovered a way to make the desert bloom. 
   Over the years, I have had the great fortune to travel to Israel four times, and each trip has been marked by emotional and spiritual moments. Anyone who has traveled to Israel feels a connection to the people and places there. This is because America shares a special bond with Israel. This bond will only become stronger in the next 60 years, and I am very humbled to begin this celebration.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYNOLDS. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me 2 minutes. 
   Today's debate is really about missed opportunities. We all know that small businesses are the engines of our Nation's economic growth and that they provide the vast majority of jobs in so many of our local communities across the country. 
   But today, the new Democratic majority misses an opportunity, an opportunity not only to raise the minimum wage but to provide urgently needed help to those small businesses and to address health care needs of their employees. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Republican alternative, the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act, addresses these needs. In addition to providing an increase to minimum wage, our approach would be: extending small business expensing through 2010; it would shorten the depreciation period for new restaurant construction through 2007; and it would end an unnecessary surtax that is an extra burden on low-income workers. 
   Our approach also would be to expand workers' access to affordable health care through small business health plans, an important priority that has long enjoyed broad, bipartisan support. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, particularly the newly elected Members of the new majority, should be asking themselves a question this morning: Why is their Democratic leadership forcing them to vote against a commonsense, bipartisan approach that the Democratic leader in the other body has already embraced? In addition to being a missed opportunity to address the real needs of small business, this is just bad politics by this untested majority. 
   Mr. Speaker, this could have been a much better bill if Democrats had fulfilled their promises to go through the regular committee process. If the new majority had allowed the Ways and Means Committee an opportunity to fully debate the issue, I am confident we could have put together a balanced and bipartisan package and met the needs of workers in small businesses. 
   I voted for the minimum wage increase some 5 months ago when 158 of my Democratic colleagues voted against it. They missed an opportunity then. They are missing one now. I urge support of the Republican alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the Democrats' supplemental appropriations measure currently before this House. 
   I am extremely disappointed before at the dramatically different tack this Democratic leadership has taken with regard to the emergency war supplemental. 
   Congress, instead of acting on a supplemental request that would support our troops, has introduced legislation to withdraw our troops. This bill, by attempting to micromanage the war on terror and implement a congressional war strategy, will tie the hands of the generals in the field. 
   Frankly, this bill crosses into dangerous territory for Congress. For if this bill passes, its supporters will have decided to take over war strategy, and we will have 535 Commanders in Chief. This is wrong for America's national security, and it is wrong for the troops serving bravely overseas. 
   Our troops deserve better than this, Mr. Speaker. And under a Republican leadership in the House, our troops got  the funding they needed without the gimmicks found in this bill. They deserve for this House and this Congress to stand ready to assist them by providing the resources needed for victory. 
   And let me be perfectly clear, I will not support legislating the micromanagement of this war from Capitol Hill. Members of Congress cannot and should not legislate defeat by passing this ill-conceived measure. And the Democrat leadership has decided to play politics by tying more than $31.5 billion in domestic spending provisions into a bill to secure votes. 
   Sure there are many domestic provisions in the underlying bill that I wholeheartedly agree with. For example, I fought side by side in bipartisan fashion for extension of the MILC program. And our cold winters in western New York make LIHEAP essential for our communities. But the House deserves the opportunity to make these domestic programs through regular order, not by discussing them as emergency spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we have a choice to make, a choice to support our troops by giving them the resources they need, or a choice to pay lip service to our soldiers and make generals and Commanders in Chief out of the 535 Members of Congress. 
   The right choice is obvious; and hopefully the Members of this body have the courage and the integrity to make that choice, support our troops. Vote ``no.''

   Mr. REYNOLDS. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   I want to thank both Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery, as well as Chairman Neal and Chairman McDermott and Ranking Members English and Weller, for their outstanding leadership in crafting this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, we come together today not as Democrats and Republicans but as Americans. We are united in our respect for those who wear the uniform of the United States armed services. We are united in our desire to ensure that Federal programs within the Ways and Means Committee's jurisdiction, from the Tax Code to the SSI program, work effectively for members of the military, veterans, first responders and their families.

   As in years past, the bill I have introduced in the 110th Congress, H.R. 649, has enjoyed bipartisan support. It has been strongly endorsed by the Blinded Veterans Association. I would also like to publicly thank Chairman Rangel, not just the Chair of our committee but the dean of my State's congressional delegation, for his cosponsorship of prior versions of this bill, and I look forward to working closely with him to see the proposal finally enacted into law. 
   Let me turn briefly to a separate provision, section 107 of the bill, which will permanently allow penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs, 401(k)'s and other retirement funds for Reservists and National Guardsmen called to active duty.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the debate continues from the Ways and Means portion of the housing bill, I believe the ranking member has set very clear remarks on where many of us find ourselves with this debate today. 
   Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery have a superb working relationship, and they have set the tenor of what has been hard work on both sides of the aisle and bipartisan compromise and consensus to craft some good legislation that has passed this body and has become law. And as I manage this portion for the minority and look across to my colleague from Massachusetts, he and I also share in commonsense solutions to strengthen America and to resolve some of the problems and challenges that are there. And this bill is not an exception to that. We worked at the spirit of request of both the Chair and ranking member to reach compromise and consensus to improve the Ways and Means jurisdiction on housing. 
   And I look at it with sadness in two parts. One, as a realtor who looks at the industry, knowing across the country that we face challenges, and the statistics that Ranking Member McCrery outlined, 680,000 fewer starts, a reduction in high percentages of what the industry is about, seeing what the drag has been on our country's growth. And we need to work through good, solid solutions that need a hearing process that involve the Congress, particularly this body, in a debate of solution. 
   And when we look at the entire complexity of this bill, not only as a Ways and Means member, not only as someone who understands the housing world, but also as a former member of the Rules Committee, I know that the Members of this body were trampled on based on the decision of taking an energy bill and making the housing provisions, one of the challenges of the country today, short-circuited as an amendment to circumvent debate, amendments, recommittals, and substitutes that would be afforded the minority in any other instance. 
   And as I look at this and the frustration I heard in the ranking member's message of what is being trampled on on rights of the minority to make presentations, quite frankly, maybe some majority Members on amendments, recommittal, and substitute, I find it disturbing that this is the beginning of strong trends of kind of a less than reasonable approach to advance legislation through this body. 
   And in the final thoughts, as we look at the predicament we're in on procedural processes here and maybe the fact that we could have made this bill even better, I must share with my colleagues that there is a clear veto message on this legislation as it leaves the House and it will unlikely be the solution of the land. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, first, I guess I will ask the gentleman if he has any other speakers. I am prepared to close and yield back the balance of my time. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I think, again, for our colleagues it is important to understand some of what has happened that the minority feels that their rights have been trampled in what has been a very unusual decision on a major piece of legislation, housing. It is certainly a significant piece of legislation because the Rules Committee granted 3 hours of debate by various jurisdictions. So it certainly sends a signal to all observers that this is serious. It warrants debate. And it is now before the House. 
   But I want to remind my colleagues that this is not a bill that has gone regular order. There is a Senate bill that is energy that has come over to the House. And we have now amended it entirely with a housing amendment. And so this is an amendment to an existing Senate bill to circumvent all of the regular order process that the House enjoys and has had speakers of both parties affirm this should be the action of how we debate great issues of the day. 
   This body is really infamous for acronyms. So today I call this the SSAD Amendment, or the Sorry Sick Amendment Decision. It is sad because the bipartisan work that was done in the Ways and Means Committee outlined by many from the Ways and Means Committee is not being worked through a process so that bipartisanship and the ability to have the entire body debate its work that came from committee. 
   It is sad that the bipartisan work was trampled in the Rules Committee by this decision to slickly move around the mechanism of regular order in our House. It is sad that there is no substitute. It is sad that there is no recommittal. It is sad that what makes it a procedure so unusual and so frustrating is the House never had a chance to work its will on housing legislation. In fact, as I said, the housing bill sent back to the House by the Senate was an energy bill. When it first passed the House, it had nothing to do with housing. And it is sad that a procedural straitjacket has been used in order to garner the type of votes that the majority wants to put before the House today. 
   Finally, it is just plain sad that the bipartisan work of the Ways and Means Committee is joined up by the Rules Committee with the Frank housing bill, because it has been clear that senior advisers to the White House will recommend the President veto the work of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   So as we debate one of the significant issues that many feel should be debated in the House, it is a sad day how we have approached to do it. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYNOLDS. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill before us today. I thank the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee for his ongoing efforts to defeat this misguided proposal and other members of the Ways and Means Committee who have also carried a strong voice, such as the gentleman from Texas. 
   For some Members of this body and both sides of the debate, this issue is simply about policy. We understand that. For them, it is an abstract question about whether private collection agencies or so-called PCAs should be able to play a limited, supplementary role in the IRS's efforts to collect delinquent tax debt. But for me and the area I represent in western New York, it is about both policy and much more than that. It is about jobs. 
   As a Member of Congress who represents rural Wyoming County in western New York, I am actually more familiar than most with the work that PCAs do. After all, the largest single private employer in Wyoming County is Pioneer Credit Recovery. It is one of only two companies nationwide that the IRS has selected to help get its important program underway. 
   Mr. Speaker, Pioneer Credit is a highly respected, local business that has created more than 1,400 high-paying jobs for families living in either my district or neighboring districts around Buffalo and Rochester. As my fellow members of the western New York's congressional delegation know, these jobs have been created in a region that has faced serious economic challenges. As I have listened today to this debate, sometimes you wonder just exactly who might be on that phone. These are highly trained rural folks coming from communities much like the gentleman from North Dakota has in North Dakota. It just happens to be a rural area of a large State of New York. For some people, that is their only income to the household. For some it is a supplement to farm income or manufacturing income. And I have looked at some of these people I have known for years. I have seen some of these people where I have just met them the day they went to work to have a meaningful job, after maybe a manufacturing shop closed down in Wyoming County. Or they weren't able to stay on the family farm. 
   But they are hardworking, decent people who subscribe to Federal and State laws that this honorable body actually has set forth in the past that deliberated and said, you will function as collectors. I know one thing about the people's House: We have had a lot of people from a lot of different backgrounds, but you know, as a small businessman myself, I promise you the only time I send out, in the days I was in business, to a private collection agency was when I couldn't collect that money for an insurance premium or commissions owed and I had no other recourse but to look in private collection. They professionally got the job done to bring back money that was owed. 
   As my colleague, Mr. Brady, has pointed out, the IRS sometimes had four chances to kind of get this money and still didn't come back with it. We looked at an opportunity, could we gain over 10 years over $1 billion in order to increase the revenues or address the tax gap that my colleague from Florida talked about. 
   So when the IRS contract was allowed to Pioneer Credit to turn an empty warehouse in Perry, New York, into a thriving job center for newly hired employees, it has been a great economic success story for part of western New York that desperately needed it, and it began to produce the results that the Congress and the IRS expected. So as someone who has fought to give the IRS the authority to partner with these private companies in the first place, I am deeply troubled that the new majority is now threatening to deauthorize this important program just as it gets underway. If this program is allowed to continue, Pioneer Credit will be given the opportunity to compete for future IRS contracts that could create many additional jobs in the area I represent. Killing this program, on the other hand, would cost my constituents real jobs at a time when Congress should be working to expand employment opportunities, particularly in hard-hit areas that are struggling economically. 
   I would also note, Mr. Speaker, that under the Democrats' PAYGO rules, proposals that reduce anticipated Federal revenues must be offset by other provisions that raise revenue. Thus their proposal to eliminate the PCA tax collection program, which is expected to net at least that billion dollars over the next decade, also requires them to raise $1 billion in new taxes somewhere else.  
   This bill is wrong on policy. It is wrong on job creation. It is wrong on tax hikes. I urge a ``no'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, this won't be the first or last time that debate on the floor comes on disagreements of policy or well-crafted rhetoric that goes to the extreme of bringing forth one's position. But I think that my colleague, Mr. Brady, and others who have spoken in the aspect that private collection has worked in the portion that has been assigned in their mission as they get underway, that the complexity of collecting taxes of the tax gap, which, if you recognize the tax gap as a challenge of revenue, one that this Congress very quickly and gladly put forth, that $1 billion of collections through private collection agencies would be achieved, and as we now embark on that, we have listened to tough language and rhetoric, and I sat through most of those public hearings, crafting today the reflection of what they thought they heard in those hearings. I think that if we look at results as we move towards the opportunity of seeing private collection, because one thing that has been omitted, if I am not mistaken, regardless of what this body does, the other body will have a serious challenge in seeing legislation passed, and there is a Presidential veto that says that it will not occur. 
   So as we measure in the future the work that has been done that has been assigned to the PCAs, and we look at the aspect of a goal that all of us would have, that the IRS has tools to do their job so that collection continues, I think we will also see in short time that private collection agencies have done the mission they were asked to do in the pilot out in Iowa and in western New York, and I think as we give that a chance, not only will this legislation not be needed, but it will not see the light of day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Today is Tax Day, Madam Speaker, and all across the country, millions of Americans will wait patiently, or not so patiently, in line at the local post office, making sure that their taxes are postmarked by the midnight deadline. 
   Having recently struggled through the process of filling out my own tax forms, I share the frustrations of millions of American taxpayers, not just with the amount of taxes that we have to pay, but with the dizzying maze of forms, worksheets and calculations required by the IRS as well. 
   But instead of working together in a bipartisan way to simplify the process and enhance taxpayers rights, the majority has chosen to bring forward a partisan, political bill that has already drawn a veto threat from the administration, and is almost certainly ``dead on arrival'' in the other body. 
   To be sure, this legislation does contain a number of positive, pro-taxpayer provisions, most of which have already passed the House last year in an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis as part of H.R. 1677. Unfortunately for this House, and for taxpayers across the country, the majority has now abandoned that commonsense bipartisan approach that we brought to last year's bill. 
   Instead the majority has included a pair of highly controversial proposals that kill any hope of bipartisan cooperation, one imposing a new substantiation requirements on withdrawals from health savings accounts, and another cutting off the ability of carefully selected private businesses to assist the IRS in collecting delinquent tax debt. 
   Over the course of today's debate, we'll hear much more about the concerns that many Members have about the HSA provision, a provision that was not subject to a single hearing in the Ways and Means Committee, and was inserted into the bill just prior to mark-up without any real understanding of the potential consequences. 
   So let me take a moment to focus on the other provision of concern, the proposal to repeal the IRS's authority to work with private collection agencies to ensure that acknowledged tax debt is actually paid. 
   For some Members of this body on both sides of the debate, this particular issue is simple and is simply about policy. For them, it's an abstract question about whether these private collection agencies, so called PCAs, should be able to play a limited supplementary role in ensuring that undisputed tax debts are, in fact, paid. 
   As we debate this particular issue yet again this afternoon, we'll hear again persuasive evidence making clear just how successful the PCA program has already been in narrowing the tax gap, and while carefully protecting taxpayers rights. And we will also hear how much additional promise this program holds for the future if it's allowed to continue. 
   But for me and the area I represent, Western New York, the issue is much more than an abstract policy debate. It's also about jobs. As the Member of Congress who represents rural Wyoming County in Western New York, I'm actually more familiar than most Members with the work that PCAs do. After all, the largest single private employer in Wyoming County, Pioneer Credit Recovery, is one of the only two companies nationwide that the IRS has selected to help get this important program underway. 
   Madam Speaker, Pioneer Credit is a highly respected local business that has created more than 1,400 high-paying jobs for families living in either my district or neighboring districts around Buffalo and Rochester. And as my fellow Members of Western New York's Congressional Delegation know, these jobs have been created in a region that has faced serious economic challenges. 
   This IRS contract has allowed Pioneer Credit to turn an empty warehouse in Perry, New York into a thriving job center for newly hired employees. In short, it's been a great economic success story in part of Western New York that has desperately needed it. 
   As someone who fought to give the IRS the authority to partner with these private companies in the first place, I am deeply troubled that the new majority is once again threatening to deauthorize this important program just as it's getting underway. 
   If this program is allowed to continue, Pioneer Credit will have the opportunity to compete for future IRS contracts that could create many additional jobs in the area of Western New York that I represent. Killing this program, on the other hand, would cost my constituents real jobs at a time when Congress should be working to expand employment opportunities, particularly in hard-hit areas that are struggling economically. 
   I would also like to note, Madam Speaker, that under the Democrats convoluted PAYGO rules, proposals that reduce anticipated Federal revenues must be offset by other provisions that raise revenue. As a result, today's  proposal to eliminate the PCA program, a program that is currently expected to bring in more than a half billion dollars to the Federal Treasury, over the next decade, also requires them to raise Federal revenue or taxes by the same amount somewhere else. That's right. The majority is raising taxes by a half a billion dollars today in order to eliminate the very program that's helping us to collect undisputed tax debts, more effectively. Only in Washington, Madam Speaker, only in Washington. 
   This bill is wrong on policy, it's wrong on job creation and it's on the way to mark April 15 for America's hard-working taxpayers. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I've been listening to some of my colleagues, and I'm sure we'll have more on the Democratic side of the aisle that have been such proponents of doing away with the collection. I just want to remind some of them of a couple of things that we should look at. 
   First, this is money that the IRS will not go after. It is part of the goal that Congress said we will pursue to get this money, and it was going to show a $1 billion over 10-year revenue. 
   Now, we have seen the start-up of PCAs, one in Iowa and one in New York, after a very clear scrutiny by the IRS and by strong oversight of the Congress. And there are start-up costs of the $50 million, as we're beginning to see the program come under way, to pursue money that the IRS either hasn't collected, can't collect, will not collect as the PCAs are pursuing it. 
   And I have listened to a lot of people describe what they think they understand of a PCA, but they have never really been in tune with it. It kind of reminds me of somebody debating ATM legislation and never actually used an ATM. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished senior member of the Ways and Means Committee from California (Mr. Herger).

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Well, I just want to make sure at least the taxpayers from the countryside I come from realize that H.R. 5719, which we're considering, the Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008, really sounds good. It sounds real good on Tax Day, as I open my remarks by saying that taxpayers are in line now or will be until midnight tonight to have a postmarked April 15 date. But we know that this legislation will face a steep consideration of some saying ``dead on arrival'' in the other body. We've seen the administration have its advisers threaten veto. And yet, while there were so many things that we agreed upon in the Ways and Means Committee, Republicans and Democrats, we have a bill that brings controversy, that brings another one-House bill. It gets tough, as we move towards November of an election year, to explain that we didn't get much done, but boy did we have a lot of action on one-House bills. 
   I want to just share for the record here on this body what I did in the Ways and Means hearing. Because I think there's two important documents that my colleagues, as this debate goes today, and some of the consideration of what will be difficult on seeing PCAs, as the legislation may come to pass from this body, we will see difficult sledding in the other body, as well as the administration, are two reports. 
   The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration wrote one on March 26, only weeks ago, that had inadequate security controls over routers and switches that jeopardize sensitive taxpayer information. It was done by the Inspector General. And I want to just report, because we had it confirmed by representatives of the administration under our examination that this, in fact, has occurred and it's in the report which was submitted to the Ways and Means Committee. And it says, ``Impact to the Taxpayer: Because the IRS sends sensitive taxpayer and administrative information across its networks, routers on the networks must have sufficient security controls to deter and detect unauthorized use. Access controls for IRS routers were not adequate, and reviews to monitor security configuration changes were not conducted to identify inappropriate use. A disgruntled employee, contractor or a hacker could reconfigure routers and switches to disrupt computer operations and steal taxpayer information in a number of ways, including diverting information to unauthorized systems.'' 
   Madam Speaker, that same very day, on March 26, the same Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued a second report called, ``The Private Collection Agencies Adequately Protected Taxpayer Data.'' And this information also was confirmed under examination as we made inquiries to the administration that confirmed that the reports exist, and they were well aware of these findings as well. And on page 2 of the Inspector General's report it said, ``We reviewed the computer security controls over taxpayer data provided to the two current PCAs,'' or private collection agencies for those maybe not following the debate, ``and determined that the controls were adequate. In particular, files were securely transmitted from the IRS to the contractors and adequately secured on the contractor systems. In addition work stations used by contractor collection personnel were adequately controlled to prevent unauthorized copying of taxpayer information to removable media or transfer via e-mail. The contractors also maintained adequate audit trails and performed periodic reviews, including reviews to identify unauthorized access to taxpayer data.'' 
   Now, the response from the IRS, contained also on page two of the Treasury Inspector General said, ``The key IRS management officials reviewed the report prior to issuance and agreed to the results of the review.'' 
   We know that in the operation of PCAs, we are going to see the collection pursuit of $500 million over that over the next 10 years. And we know that if this legislation prevails, there is going to be a tax increase of $500 million to pay for this under the majority's PAYGO rules. And so as we continue the debate, make it clearly understood that the pursuit of these PCAs was on proceeds that were not collected, could not be collected, needed to be collected in order to put into the Treasury this money owed by taxpayers to the government. And that as  we look at this legislation, what has brought the controversy to uncontroversial legislation, legislation that both parties could agree to, was the adding of HSA changes and dealing with the PCAs. My colleagues need to consider the type of consequences we're seeing in what will be a misguided change on PCA legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I have listened very carefully to my friend and colleague from New York as he sees his views. 
   I thought maybe I might for the record just outline that I have a copy of a letter that numerous groups sent in opposition to this legislation, primarily due to HSAs, to both Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery. And it leads off with the NFIB and goes down to the National Taxpayers Union, and it has the U.S. Chamber and it has the Retail Industry  Leaders Association, the National Retail Federation, the National Restaurant Association, the National Association of Manufacturers, and so many others. And I will make it available in case some of my colleagues haven't seen it. 
   This isn't something Republicans on this side of the aisle just kind of dreamed up that there are problems that make this legislation controversial with HSA legislation or with the PCAs. It's well documented by the experts that are using the program. 
   I also think, rather than some of my colleagues interpreting what the administration may have for support or rejection of the legislation, maybe I should read into the Record exactly what the Statement of Administration Policy is on H.R. 5719 so that we all know what the administration's concerns are. 
   And for the record: ``The administration strongly opposes H.R. 5719, the so-called `Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act of 2008.' The bill includes provisions that would impose new administrative burdens on the trustees of health savings accounts. These new burdens on HSA administrators are unnecessary for efficient tax administration, inconsistent with the flexibility purposely afforded HSAs at their inception, and could undermine efforts by employers, individuals, and insurers to reduce health care costs and improve health outcomes by empowering consumers to take greater control of health care decision making. If H.R. 5719 were presented to the President with these provisions, his senior advisers would recommend he veto the bill. 
   ``Also, the administration strongly opposes provisions of the bill that would repeal the current statutory authorization for the Internal Revenue Service private debt collection program. As of February 2008, over 98,000 cases have been referred to contractors, representing over $910 million in delinquent accounts. Terminating this program would result in a loss of $578 million in revenue over the next 10 years, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. These are tax dollars that are legally owed to the government and are otherwise very unlikely to be collected by the IRS due to workload demands. As noted in previous Statements of Administration Policy, the administration strongly opposes elimination of this program, which is not consistent with the administration's commitment to a balanced approach toward improving taxpayer compliance and collecting outstanding tax liabilities. If H.R. 5719 were presented to the President with these provisions, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.'' 
   That is a Statement of Administration Policy on the record relative to this.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Reclaiming my time, Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   I just think it's important we look at this. First, I heard the debate coming from the majority, from the gentleman, that outlined his interpretation of why the administration was opposed to the bill. I listened carefully. I made a decision to read into the Record exactly what the administration's policy position was on this so that it was no longer an interpretation from a Member of Congress but exactly in written word what the administration said relative to this bill. 
   And I think while we're looking at other aspects of this legislation, we do know the following: That the administration is going to veto this legislation, that we also know it has difficult sledding in the other body. And it has in the past because there's a track record, that it appears just with PCA alone, let alone some of the concerns that have been put forth in the letter that I read from earlier on HSAs, that we now have another one-House bill being trumped up and laid out on Tax Day. 
   And I will say the majority is superb in showmanship. We seem to be able to move legislation to the floor on significant days. Today is tax legislation on Tax Day, April 15. 
   But I also know that the public is not going to be confused by the fact that while we trump up an extravaganza of legislation on special days, today tax legislation on April 15, that the voters are going to take a real hard look at what really got done, what has gotten through, what was made better for America. And, again, we have another one-House bill that just, sadly, had too much partisanship in it and fell away. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I think I heard my colleague when he said that Democrats are in the majority in this body, Democrats are in the majority in the other body, but it's the Republicans' fault that this legislation isn't going to happen. 
   Now, I have explained a lot of tough, challenging things to my constituents, but I don't think they're going to buy that. It's just another one-House bill that is going to the other body and going to see death. 
   It isn't going to see the light of day.     
   Now, moving to my colleague from New York who asked me the question. I didn't think I could provide the answer to his question quite as soon as I could, and saving him looking it up, because I assume as he went off the floor, he might be looking up this. I want to go back again to the statement of administration policy. The bill includes provisions that would impose new administrative burdens on the trustees of health savings accounts. That is what the administration said in their veto threat. 
   Now on the bill as reported out of committee by the majority, page 22, line 7, 8 and 9 to my colleagues, says the trustee of the health savings account shall make a report regarding such account to the Secretary and account beneficiary setting forth. So I want everyone to know, including my colleague who asked the question, it is clear in your bill that you set forth that the HSA trustees would have new administrative burdens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia. 
   Madam Speaker, as one of the chief sponsors of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, I rise today in strong support of Senate 1858 and urge its passage. I would like to extend my thanks to Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton for working together to get this bill to the floor today. 
   This bill is a tribute to children and their parents who have had to face the pain of experiencing a disease that wasn't caught by newborn screening. Each year, over 4 million children are routinely tested at birth for genetic disorders. But what so many parents don't realize is that the actual number of conditions that their child is screened for depends on the State they live in. A child's life in one State should never mean more or less than a child's life in another. 
   Every child born with a disease, whether it is common or rare, should receive early diagnosis and treatment. That is why we need the Newborn Screening Laws Saves Lives Act signed into law and adequately funded. Through this legislation, we cannot only educate parents about lifesaving tests available for their newborn child, but greatly expand the screening programs at the State level. 
   Left untreated, many disorders are life-threatening or can cause serious mental and physical disabilities. Early detection through screening can lessen effects or even completely prevent progression of many disorders by providing for immediate medical intervention. 
   My State of New York has long been a national leader in newborn screening, starting in 1960 when Dr. Robert Guthrie developed the first newborn screening tests in Buffalo, New York. New York now tests each child for 44 different conditions. 
   In 2004, the American College of Medical Genetics completed a report commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which recommended at a minimum every baby born in the United States be screened for a core set of 29 treatable disorders. Currently, only 19 States and the District of Columbia require infants to be screened for all 29 of the recommended disorders. It is my sincere hope through grants and research funding provided for in the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, every State will be able to coordinate their newborn screening tests in order to bring consistency across the country. 
   Finally, I would like to acknowledge the strong bipartisan efforts of my colleagues LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD, MIKE SIMPSON, and HENRY WAXMAN. They have long fought for life saving changes to newborn screening it, and it has been a pleasure working with them to achieve its consideration today. 
   I would like to thank Jill and Jim Kelly and Jacque Waggoner from Western New York for their tireless advocacy on behalf of enhanced newborn screening and for the tremendous efforts to raise public awareness about this vital issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the bill.

I greatly appreciate the remarks of the ranking member of this side, Dave Camp, as he outlined the legislation and our support for it and the need for it, and the amendments that were brought forth by Chairman Rangel and by Ranking Member McCrery. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been that type of cooperation in working on legislation such as this that we were able to take a bill that is vitally needed in the Katrina zone for low-income housing tax credits to work and do their job, but to also make it work for the taxpayers as we consider the PAYGO requirements set forth by the rules of the House. I believe that we have worked diligently, through the efforts of staff on both the majority and the minority and Joint Tax as well as IRS, as has been outlined by previous speakers, to bring forth legislation that will work to get the job done for Katrina victims, for the States and, importantly, to see a recovery come about under the intent of this legislation. So I am going to support it. 
   I greatly appreciate the cooperation of Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery in working forward to have legislation language that meets some of the outlines of concerns that Mr. Johnson and I had and have been fully met by their hard work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, we're talking about the young age of my colleague and fellow seat mate in Ways and Means. I'm a little older, so I heard the President when he said, There they go again. Ronald Reagan. I heard him, and it kind of reminded me today as the liberals of this great body and the Blue Dogs of this great body come down and rant and rave over the fact, while they run the House, we're going to have the will of the House, and the will of the House is to fix the AMT for a 1-year patch, just like we've done in the past. Not an unusual fix. 
   The last time I introduced this legislation, in 2005, 414-4 voted to support that bill. As a matter of fact, I looked and there were 33 Blue Dogs, some of which will speak today, that voted for my bill. And I promise you it didn't raise taxes. It just simply provided a 1-year patch for 2006 to give relief to the middle-class taxpayers that never were supposed to be caught up with this thing since it was created in 1969. 
   And so when we look at this today, we've got a blame game from everybody saying, hey, it's the Republicans in the Senate, it's the Republicans here, the Republican President. 
   The Democrats run the House. We're here right before the holiday, and this is the best bill you've got and we're going to pass it. We're going to pass it just like I knew when I put it in in February, that all of the talk, all of the hope, all of the desire to change comes down to the fact we couldn't do it. 
   And it gets me down to three words, deny, deceive and delay. Deny that you would raise taxes. You've already outlined how you're going to raise taxes. Deceive, you promised the American people you'd fix this permanently. And we're here today, at this late hour, doing a patch. 
   And then we look at delay. For 11 months, we have delayed this to where we could have fixed it so that the American taxpayer would at least have the forms when the 2007 tax bill comes home. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, as he opened up, on what we agreed on and maybe what we disagreed on, and I have listened to a number of speakers. First of all, on the Ways and Means Committee members before me, I want to be associated with the observations and comments that they've brought to the floor today. 
   We opened this year, as the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. English, mentioned, with hope and optimism that we were going to repeal AMT; not reform it, not push it around, not raise taxes on it, but repeal it. As time ticked on, we had hearings, and hope faded. Hope then got cloudy, then hope wasn't real. 
   As we're sitting here in November, the Secretary of Treasury has responded to my letter and letters written by Mr. McCrery and Mr. Grassley, and in that, answering the fact  that we have missed some dates, missing one right now on November 6, that the IRS is going to print the 1040 forms, and next week, on November 16, they're going to print all the other forms. Now, I take that a little personal because last year, the 1-year patch, without a tax increase, was passed on an initiative that I introduced and was put into a bill in May, May of last year, without a tax increase. And you know what? This body passed it 414-4; didn't have tax increases, didn't have a lot of gimmicks, just got the job done. 
   I want to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you're not just touching 23 million Americans by this delay in the failure and the shortcoming of getting an agreement between the two bodies and the White House; you're making it about 49 million, because the letter also said, from the Secretary, that others are impacted by this needless delay. 
   Now, I don't mind having a constitutional message about our prerogative in the House to initiate anything we want in Ways and Means relative to taxes, but there comes a time, even for a new majority of the other side, to understand when pragmatism sets in, that we didn't get a permanent fix, we didn't even get a repeal, we didn't even get a 1-year patch, however you wanted it. What we got is, today, a failed approach. 
   And to the new Members who have never served in this body before on either side of the aisle, you're going to hear ``tax gap,'' ``tax fairness,'' ``tax equity.'' I promise you that results right here in this bill as a tax increase. 
   Vote ``no'' on this bill, and let's get the work done before we go home for Thanksgiving.

<DOCNO>Mr. REYNOLDS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico. 
   Madam Speaker, we have heard many speeches this week talking about the honorable men and women of our Armed Forces. We all have constituents who have served bravely in Iraq and some have paid the ultimate price for this service, and we are forever grateful for that. We are grateful because these men and women put our freedoms and our country before themselves. It is this freedom that affords us the ability to undertake the debate on this shallow, shortsighted resolution. 
   If the purpose of this resolution is scoring political points and playing political games, then bravo to the Democratic majority, they have succeeded. But if the purpose of this resolution is for a new direction in Iraq that will secure victory and secure the second democracy in the Middle East, then this resolution comes up woefully short. 
   I am not prepared to look our soldiers and their families in their eyes and say I voted for this resolution, because while I support you, I do not support your mission. 
   We debate a resolution this week that represents a cavalier attitude about the mission our troops are carrying out, day in and day out, without fear, and without knowing whether some in the halls of this Congress still support them in this war on terror. 
   While we debate this resolution, let me be clear that, like my constituents, my patience is limited in Iraq. We must see more progress sooner rather than later. We must see the Iraqis play a larger role and take control of their country. The Iraqis need to recognize their failure to take control has consequences, the consequences of fulfilling bin Laden's wish to see Iraq become a new central base for terrorists, the consequences of destabilizing the Middle East and endangering Israel, our strongest democratic ally in the Middle East. 
   The consequence is of involving our enemies like Iran and other rogue states to develop weapons of mass destruction without the fear of repercussions. Ultimately in Iraq, it is Iraqis who will decide if democracy or tyranny rule the day, and whether they avoid the consequences of their failure. 
   But while my patience is limited, and I want to see progress, I will not play politics with our troops, which is what this resolution does. 
   Like Majority Leader Hoyer said yesterday, no one should hide behind the troops. I agree, but equally important, Members of this body should not be hiding behind this resolution if their true aim is to cut off funding for our troops. Because while this resolution will indeed score a few political points for some debating in this Chamber today, this resolution also sends a message far beyond this Chamber. 
   Indeed, Madam Speaker, this nonbinding resolution, while lacking any bite in terms of strategy, and not changing anything on the ground in Baghdad, will send a message loud and clear to our troops: We are consigning your mission to failure before you even have a chance to execute it. 
   As I listened to SAM JOHNSON today, as he recounted the unspeakable damage antiwar efforts back home did to our soldiers in Vietnam, I wondered whether our brave men and women are listening to the taunts of America's enemies at this very moment as we debate not just this resolution but their mission. SAM JOHNSON is not alone in questioning the damage to the morale we may be doing to those fighting forces. 
   One of my constituents, a highly decorated Iraq war veteran, David Bellavia wrote, ``Each day ..... move(s) us closer to losing a winnable war and abandoning a worthy ally.'' 
   Madam Speaker, for Congress to support this resolution gives encouragement to the jihadists and cuts the morale of our troops. In our global war on terror, we cannot show a lack of resolve because, as we know, after decades of attacks by these jihadists on our citizens, the World Trade Center in 1993, our embassies and the USS Cole, we know what a lack of resolve has meant. That lack of resolve hit us all when the jihadists attacked us again on the morning of September 11, 2001. That fateful Tuesday brought devastation to this country not seen since Pearl Harbor and, God willing, that we will never experience again. 
   The skies were thick with smoke, debris piled so high it brought to a standstill the city that never sleeps. Just days after the attacks, I stood at Ground Zero amidst the rubble, in anguish. I knew this was bigger than any political party, bigger than any one country. It is a global war on Islamic jihadism, and that war, as the jihadists have said, is now set in Iraq. 
   The question raised by this resolution is, will we yield? As Winston Churchill said, reflecting on the darkest days of the global war of his time, one that pitted the hopes of freedom against the ideology of hatred, ``Never give in--never, never, never, never, in nothing great or small, large or petty; 
   ``Never yield to force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.'' 
   Madam Speaker, in the daunting challenge of our time, we must not waver, and we must not yield.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Select Revenue Measures Subcommittee of Ways and Means. Mr. Neal has been a true leader in the goal of trying to get permanent repeal of AMT, and while it is something that we share, we have not yet reached a solution. 
   So I find myself rising today on behalf of middle class families all across America in strong support of this bill. As my colleagues well know, I have fought year in and year out for the AMT patch, and I am disappointed that Congress has not addressed a permanent solution. Absent a long-term proposal, I think we have no choice but to once again pass a temporary 1-year fix. 
   Without patch legislation, more than 25 million families will be hit by this stealth tax. This includes more than 21 million taxpayers who didn't owe AMT in 2007. If Congress does not act, each American affected by AMT will, on average, face a tax increase of almost $2,500. We delayed action for so long last year that 13.5 million taxpayers were forced to delay filing their returns. Because we did not act earlier this year, millions more have been hanging in the balance. 
   We have an opportunity to end the uncertainty of the middle class that they have been facing all year long. Each Member of this House has the opportunity to live up to their responsibility and truly help the middle class trapped in this stealth tax that was so unintended for the middle class. 
   Yesterday the other body passed their bipartisan tax extenders package. The Senate majority leader was as candid as I have ever heard him when he bluntly told the House, ``Don't send us back something else. We can't get it passed.'' He went on to make it clear that if we do, the important extenders we have all been working so hard to accomplish will die and we will have ``snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.'' 
   In these difficult and uncertain economic times, we have an obligation to pass a bill that can be signed into law as quickly as possible to protect middle class Americans. While I believe our time today would be better spent moving a comprehensive tax extenders package, I am nonetheless pleased to see the majority put up a clean AMT bill before this House. 
   I thank Chairman Rangel for his leadership on this legislation and Chairman Neal for his additional leadership as the Chair of the Subcommittee of Select Revenues. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, today is solution day. There have been times where I have come to the floor and indicated I was sad over the circumstances we were in. Today I am not sad. We are moving the result of legislation I have introduced since probably 2005, a 1-year patch that protects anyone else from getting trapped in the middle class of AMT and make sure that we do this patch. 
   I don't believe, and most of the Members on my side of the aisle don't believe you need to raise taxes in order to pay for a tax cut on middle class Americans here. 
   But I am bringing concern, not sadness, but concern, because Chairman Rangel and Chairman Neal have moved this legislation to the floor and that we, I hope, will pass this legislation, as we have in the past, with very strong bipartisan measure. But I don't take lightly a message from the leader of the other body on the closing days of this session that we make sure that we don't fall through the cracks, our  version versus the Senate--the other body--version that could cause this to fall through the cracks and 25 million middle class Americans are trapped. 
   So while we are looking to move this in the spirit of strong bipartisan support, it's indicative that the leadership of this body make sure that they full well know how we can get the mechanics with the other body to make this law as the President gets it to his desk. 
   So the caution is we are not quite there yet because we have taken action today. While I like the version of the bill, we have taken our legislative prerogative and advanced it to have just this free-standing AMT bill. 
   I support however we get the law signed, but I bring the caution that leadership in this House will have to work very closely with the Senate leadership of the other body to match a solution that's law so we don't put our 25 million Americans in the same harm's way of inaction that we have seen in other years past. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. REYNOLDS. Madam Speaker, it's interesting in the debate, and many of us who spoke today and so many others that have come forward in years past have presented the history or the finger pointing or the direction of how we got to where we are. 
   The important thing is that we know that we must produce a result, even if it's a 1-year patch. It has been admirable, as Chairman Rangel took over Ways and Means, a goal he had was to rid the AMT tax from the books. We need to work in a bipartisan fashion, I suspect, to reach that permanent goal. 
   But as we banter some on PAYGO or pay not, or whether they are in or they are not, it reminds me to think as a Member who will not be going home to campaign, maybe I should spend a little time to see how many times we have waived PAYGO on this bill after we beat up the fact that we should do it, it's the right thing, it must happen. And then at the end of the day, we take the Republican version of not raising taxes. Quite frankly, I don't think we are borrowing money for the bill, we are just not raising taxes in order to prevent a tax increase, particularly one to the middle class which both parties so dearly want to preserve.     
   So as we look to the reality of this year, I remind my colleagues, we have caution to get this bill matched with the other body so that we make law in order to send it to the President's desk to protect our middle class taxpayers. 
   Last year 352 bipartisan Members of the House voted for the AMT extension that was not offset by devastating tax increases, just like this bill coming before us today. 
   I urge my colleagues to do the same today by supporting this bill so it may be included in a comprehensive tax extenders package equal to the Senate version, or that the other body relinquishes their very clear, strong warning from their leader. Ignoring the other body's warning will not get this across the finish line. So I urge adoption of the resolution, and I thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Neal for their efforts and work to get this before us today as we are in the final days of this legislative session. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
