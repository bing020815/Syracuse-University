<DOCNO>Mr. ALEXANDER. (HIGH FUEL COST CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam Speaker, I rise today, just as many of my colleagues have done, to address the urgent high fuel cost crisis. Yes, Madam Speaker, it is a crisis that is facing all Americans. From the trucker who can no longer afford to operate his rig, to the farmer who must keep the tractors  in the barn, or to the small business owner who is being forced to close their doors, the daily commuter, or the general consumer. It is a crisis. 
   You know, we are being told that we buy petroleum from other countries, oftentimes countries that don't even like us, because many in this country see our resources as a liability, an economic or an environmental hazard. We have got to change that mind set. We must allow ourselves the opportunity to drill on our own land, in ANWR, off our own coastlines. We must increase refining capacity instead of continuing to shut down more factories.
