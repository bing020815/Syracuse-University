<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (EMMETT TILL UNSOLVED CIVIL RIGHTS CRIME ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me the time this morning. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 1963, while confined in the Birmingham city jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote a letter to eight Alabama clergymen regarding his recent demonstrations. In that letter, Dr. King eloquently wrote: ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' Dr. King's words ring true today in this debate on H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. We can no longer stand by and allow those civil rights cold cases to collect dust on our shelves. As a Nation, we owe it to the victims and their families and the country generally to provide them with long overdue justice. 
   Before I begin, I see waiting in the wings my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis). His diligence and perseverance on this legislation has been instrumental in getting us here today. 
   Mr. Chairman, thank you for considering this bill. 
   It is truly an honor to stand in league with my friend from Georgia as we began this bill, actually, this trek in the last session of Congress, and certainly he is a giant in the civil rights legislation and it is a privilege for me, Mr. Lewis, to stand with you on this bill. 
   I also want to thank Alvin Sykes, who is the president of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign, and also former Senator Jim Talent from Missouri. Had it not been for them, I don't think we would be standing here today. Mr. Sykes was inspirational in opening the Emmett Till case, for whom this legislation is named. He came to Senator Talent two years ago with the idea that ultimately spawned this legislation. 
   I think in the short time of this calendar year, a couple of months ago we commemorated as a Nation the 150-year anniversary of the Dred Scott decision. As the gentleman from Michigan eloquently stated a moment ago, there have been chapters in our country's history that are not proud chapters, and yet we cannot turn past those chapters in the book of history, but instead must focus and right wrongs. 
   For those of you who don't know the story of Emmett Till, Emmett was a 14-year-old African American boy from Chicago who spent his summer vacation with relatives in Mississippi. One afternoon, young Emmett spotted a Caucasian woman and allegedly whistled. For this indiscretion he was kidnapped from his house, brutally beaten, and thrown into a river with weights around his neck. And although Emmett's murderers were quickly arrested and placed on trial, the jury acquitted them and they walked out of the courtroom as free men. What makes this story even more tragic is that about a year later, one of the murderers confessed to his guilty conduct, without remorse no less, in an interview in Look magazine. 
   As an original cosponsor of this bill, I rise today to express my strong support for this legislation as I hope it will help bring closure to countless families who continue to suffer from injustices perpetrated so long ago. As has been noted, this legislation will establish an Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Investigative Office within the FBI to investigate these pre-1970 cases in conjunction with, that is, in conjunction with, State and local authorities. H.R. 923 will also create an Unsolved Crime Section to prosecute these cold cases. 
   In my previous life as a prosecutor, I tried some three dozen or so murder cases. And with any trial, particularly murder trials, time is of the essence. And that is especially true with cold cases that this legislation addresses. Over the past nearly 20 years, we have had 29 unsolved civil rights murder cases that have been reopened, reexamined. Thankfully, 22 convictions have resulted. We have seen justice brought to the families of Henry Dee and Charlie Moore, who were only 19 when they were murdered. What were their infractions that caused this horrific end to their lives? Henry and Charlie were believed to have knowledge about African Americans importing firearms into the country. And for this James Ford Seale and a group of fellow Klansmen kidnapped Henry and Charlie, took them into the woods, brutally beat them, and drove them into Parker's Landing in Mississippi. Henry was tied to an engine block and thrown into the Mississippi River, still alive. Charlie had to sit there and watch his friend drown,  knowing that his fate would be no different. Their bodies were found several months later, Henry still tied to the engine block, Charlie to a pile of iron weights. 
   After more than 40 years, James Ford Seale was finally held accountable for his actions, convicted just last week for his role in the murders. A fellow Klansman was given immunity in exchange for testifying about Seale's role in the murders. 
   The Nation has witnessed the conviction of Edgar Ray Killen for his part in the murders of civil rights activists Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, and James Cheney. Ironically, tomorrow, June 21, actually marks the anniversary of those murders. 
   We have recently seen authorities reexamine the murders of Johnnie Mae Chappell in Florida and Jimmie Lee Jackson in Alabama and hopefully, hopefully, with the enactment of H.R. 923, many more. 
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once said: ``Justice too long delayed is justice denied.'' I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation so we can continue to help heal the Nation, rectify the inequities of the past, and provide justice to those who have been seemingly forgotten.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIRMAN -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Chairman, this past Friday, the great State of Missouri and the country lost a truly distinguished man, Congressman Bill Hungate, a man who previously represented the very seat that I am now privileged to currently occupy passed away. 
   Bill Hungate was a devoted husband and father. He was a decorated soldier. He was a talented and thoughtful jurist, and a gifted author and musician. But above all else, he was a man dedicated to public service. 
   After earning his bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in 1943, Bill answered the country's call at the onset of World War II and enlisted in the Army. He fought bravely in the European theater over the course of the  next 3 years, and received numerous decorations and awards. 
   After the war was over, he returned home and earned his law degree from Harvard and after a short time in the private sector, he embarked upon a long and distinguished career in public service. He started first as a county prosecutor, then was a special assistant for the Missouri attorney general, and in 1964, he was elected as a Member of the 89th Congress, representing the 9th Congressional District of Missouri, and I see some of my colleagues nodding along who served with this great man. 
   As a Member of this body, he carried himself and conducted our business in a manner that befits this historic Chamber. Many of you may acknowledge or remember that as a member of the Judiciary Committee, his tenure in Congress will always be defined by the Watergate investigation of which he played an integral part. He not only authored one of the articles of impeachment brought against President Nixon, but he also chaired the hearings that investigated and ultimately upheld President Ford's ensuing pardon. 
   After serving the people of Missouri for 12 distinguished years, he left this Chamber with the same values and integrity that he walked in with. A few years later, he was called again to serve, this time by President Carter as a United States District Court judge, and the indelible marks he left on that institution are still felt today. And my colleague will probably remember the landmark decision of his which eventually led to the voluntary desegregation of the St. Louis county and city school districts. 
   Judge Hungate was a man on his worse day who was better than most people on their best. He never wavered in his principles, and was a firm believer in the promise of our country. He was a servant in the truest sense of the word. 
   I hope it is of some solace to his wife, Dorothy, his daughter Katie, his son William and his four grandchildren to know that so many people were affected by his life and are mourning his passing, and our thoughts and prayers are with them. 
   I yield to my very good friend and the dean of the Missouri delegation, the gentleman from Lexington, Mr. Skelton.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (THE MISSOURI MIRACLE -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Madam Speaker, they are calling it the Missouri miracle, but it didn't start out that way. In fact, it was a parent's worst nightmare. A 13-year-old gets off a school bus near his home in rural Missouri but never makes it home. The local sheriff's office works frantically to locate the missing boy but has few leads. That was the real life saga for Ben Ownby's family last week near Beaufort, Missouri, in my congressional district. 
   Last Monday, January 8, after a normal day at school William Ben Ownby rode the bus to school. He got off and disappeared. The wrenching news energized the local community. Volunteers turned out in droves to assist law enforcement and to search the nearby woods. Friends and neighbors began prayer chains and offered moral support to Ben's family. Police officers and sheriffs' deputies from surrounding counties lent their assistance. 
   Fortunately the single lead provided by 14-year-old Mitchell Hults was a good one. Mitchell had gotten off the school bus with Ben and described having seen a beat-up white Nissan pickup truck with a camper shell, even describing the trailer hitch to a T. Two police officers who had gone to a Kirkwood, Missouri, apartment complex to serve an unrelated warrant saw a truck matching the description, sought additional legal authority and, lo and behold, last Friday, January 12, when officers approached the apartment, not only did they find Ben Ownby unharmed, but a second youth, Shawn Hornbeck, a boy from Washington County, Missouri who had been missing since 2002. 
   More than 4 years ago, October 6, 2002, when he was 11, Shawn Hornbeck disappeared while riding his bike. In a similar fashion, the community and law enforcement worked hard on that case to no avail. Yet Craig and Pam Akers, Shawn's parents, never gave up. Their ability to persevere 4 1/2 years is a testament to their strength and faith. 
   During that time, the Akers family established the Shawn Hornbeck Foundation, whose mission it is to help families and law enforcement search for missing children. Craig Akers' commitment to finding Shawn and helping families has come at great personal expense and took a physical and emotional toll, and yet he remains devoted to helping others deal with cases of missing children. 
   What a miracle that both youths were rescued. 
   I would be remiss if I did not recognize the hard work of area law enforcement, especially singling out Franklin County Sheriff Gary Toelke and the Franklin County Sheriff's Department. Gary is a friend of mine. This happens to be the second time in 4 months that Sheriff Toelke has reported a happy ending in a missing child case. 
   You may remember last September, his department recovered an 8-day-old baby girl when a woman attacked the baby's mother. That case became a national news story, as has this one. The outcome of both of these cases is a testament to that department's professionalism and commitment to the community. 
   I also applaud the great detective work of young Mitchell Hults by remembering the details of that suspicious white pickup truck right down to the dents, rust spots and trailer hitch. Mitchell not only saved the life of his friend Ben, but also rescued Shawn from 4 1/2 years of captivity. All are true heroes, and their diligence saved the lives of two young boys and brought solace to the Akers and Ownby families. 
   On behalf of all Americans and parents nationwide, this House appreciates their good work. To the Akers and Ownby families, I am sure my colleagues will join me in expressing your shared beliefs that your prayers have been answered. Truly, a Missouri miracle.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Before my friend from North Dakota leaves the floor, the bill to which he referenced, he, in fact, along with 72 of his colleagues, voted for. The FSC/ETI bill that actually we are now pulling back that tax reduction. We are repealing that. 
   It has been an interesting 2 weeks, Mr. Speaker. We have now forced small businesses to take on additional labor costs, yet we have done nothing to cushion the blow for the mom and pop stores across the country. Last week, the majority wanted to stick it to those drug companies that develop life-saving miracle drugs, while we all have family members who actually live longer and healthier lives because of those miracle drug therapies. Today, we are considering a tax increase on the domestic energy companies. 
   Now, how many Members have come to the floor and made speeches and beat their breasts and lamented the loss of the manufacturing base in this country? And it is something we agree with, except that the majority's response then is to tax those very domestic energy producing companies? 
   Let me make a prediction, not a bold one, but as we are wrapping up this 6 in 2006, I suspect that the newly elected Speaker will actually be in the Chair as the vote is called, and as the votes are there to pass this measure there will be thunderous applause from one side of the Chamber, with handshakes and back claps all around. 
   You know who else is going to be applauding today's measure? The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies, upon whom we are already so dependent. You know who else is going to applaud today's efforts? Another big fan. The dictator from Venezuela. 
   And, of course, there are some on the majority side who have actually called upon Mr. Chavez in Venezuela, visited him during the last Congress, and came back to this country speaking of his benevolence? 
   The fact is, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Research Service has reported that the net impact of the 2005 energy bill was to actually raise revenue from the domestic oil and gas industry by $300 million. But let not the facts get in the way of good bumper sticker politics. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 6.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the majority for making it a whole 2 weeks before deciding to raise taxes--34 hours if you are keeping track by the clock on the Speaker's website. It must have been tough to wait this long. 
   I've been around here long enough to follow the twists and turns of the FSC/ETI case, and I'm somewhat puzzled by what we are doing today. 
   It is true that oil and gas companies were not able to claim the previous FSC benefit. It is also true that Chairman RANGEL championed an approach to replace FSC  with a broad benefit targeted at domestic manufacturing. The JOBS bill ultimately provided a broad definition of manufacturing activity to avoid arbitrarily creating winners and losers. Yet today, we find ourselves here picking and choosing among domestic activities, without concern for the broader policy implications, based solely on the need for the majority's Leadership to put out a splashy press release about getting tough on big oil. 
   The bill before us provides an insight into the governing philosophy of the new majority. The concern of people in my district--and across the country for that matter--is that we need to maintain an affordable supply of energy by breaking our dependence on foreign oil. By any common-sense measure, domestic exploration must be part of a multi-faceted solution to this problem. So in that regard, it is counter-intuitive to think that tax hikes on U.S. exploration activities will help provide an affordable, steady supply of gasoline to consumers. 
   Put another way--most of us took Econ 101 in college. I must admit, it was a few years ago when I took this class, but the way I remember it, if an added cost is put on an industry--in this case a tax--those costs will eventually get passed on to the consumer. And in that regard, I guess the majority's desired policy aim is to make gasoline more expensive. 
   Everyone agrees that we must break our dependence on foreign oil, and I take a backseat to no one when it comes to promoting homegrown renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel as a way to reduce our consumption of petroleum. In fact, had the Rules Committee made my amendments in order, the House could have voted to extend these important incentives. 
   But the majority's answer to this problem--tax hikes--is simply misguided, and I urge Ðmy colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on ÐH.R. 6.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I am very glad that we are taking up mental health parity today. I support mental health and substance abuse parity, as does most of this body. But there are a few details of this bill I would like to change to ensure that true parity be the final result of the legislation before us. 
   But because this is brought up under a closed rule, these vital changes cannot be made, thus I will oppose this bill. 
   Let me add at the outset that I have only the utmost respect for my friend and fellow Health Subcommittee member Jim Ramstad. He is a champion on this issue, and the tenants of mental health parity that most here support are in no-small-part thanks to his intelligent, passionate advocacy. I thank the gentleman for that example and his service to this institution. 
   September 18, the Senate voice voted S. 558, legislation that was the product of input and agreement between mental health advocates, policy experts, health providers, employers, and authoring legislators. 
   I am concerned that in passing the language in this bill, this House will be marginalizing itself--that in passing a bill with no real hopes of adoption by the other body this body will be seen as out-of-touch, a secondary player, and at worst could hold up much needed mental health legislation. 
   I would like to highlight two key differences between the House and Senate bills, using the  language from the Senate compromise bill--the codification of the DSM-IV, Diagnostic Statistical Manual, and protection of Medical Management. 
   DSM 
   I proposed two amendments at the Ways and Means Committee that would have won my vote there and here on the floor and would move this bill more quickly through a House-Senate conference and to the President's desk for signing. 
   The first issue, this legislation creates a broad new mandate by codifying usage of the DSM-4 (DSM-IV). 
   H.R. 1424 imposes a broad mandate to cover all mental illnesses listed in the DSM-IV Manual. DSM is the Diagnostic Statistical Manual that provides diagnostic criteria and codes for billing health plans. 
   Health Plans will be required to provide coverage for all the conditions listed in DSM-IV--conditions such as caffeine withdrawal and jet lag are included, as other speakers have and will discuss. This is simply a benefits mandate. 
   The bill exceeds the stated objective of achieving ``parity'' by requiring coverage of all conditions in the diagnostic manual for mental health and substance abuse disorders if a plan decides to cover any mental health or substance abuse conditions at all. No similar Federal requirement applies to any other category of benefits. 
   Currently, there is no Federal definition of the scope of medical/surgical benefits that plans must offer. Therefore, this is NOT true parity.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague from the Show Me State for yielding, and I rise in support of the Berry-Ross-Hare-Emerson-Hulshof-Costello amendment. 
   We have tasked the Federal Emergency Management Agency with educating the public of the flood risks to their homes and businesses. I think we agree and support their continued efforts in the education campaign so long as it is done based upon the best modeling and sound science available. 
   But I do not support FEMA pushing homeowners into purchasing flood insurance when they don't need it. This is exactly what FEMA seems to be doing with the zone X shaded floodplain note. Zone X shaded is the area behind a certified 100-year or 500-year levee but still within the 100-year floodplain. Within these zones, FEMA attaches a note, the purpose of which I believe seems to intimidate homeowners into purchasing flood insurance through a very strongly worded suggestion. 
   Now, if you talk to FEMA, they will tell you those notes don't require individuals to purchase flood insurance; and I guess I can say my beautiful wife, Renee, doesn't require me to buy an anniversary present, but there are some things that just seem to be understood. 
   Of particular concern, as has been expressed, is that when you have certain lenders or others who see this warning, this stark warning, that they may in fact require homeowners when in fact the law does not. 
   Again, I acknowledge what my colleague and friend from Cape Giradeau has said. I am for floor insurance. It should be, for instance, mandatory in special flood hazard areas. But we have areas in this country where tremendous resources have been used to create a very adequate flood protection system. Mrs. Emerson's district is one of those, systems that are constructed and maintained and certified by the Federal Government. 
   So individuals that live behind these certified levees, whether they have been constructed by the Federal Government or constructed under the supervision of the Federal Government, they pay their due, they pay Federal taxes, and often they have participated in the levee districts themselves. I think this is a commonsense amendment, and I am proud to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I haven't had the privilege of meeting the newest Member of this body who took the oath of office yesterday, Mr. Foster, but I, as everyone did, rose to my feet and applauded as he swore to protect this country. And I'm mindful of what was said last night on the floor of the House, that I wonder what's passing through his mind as the first vote he cast as we all became caught up in this maelstrom of ethics discussion. And I would say to him, I know he's not in the Chamber, but perhaps as he reviews the Record, as an incoming freshman in January of 1997, as we commenced the 105th Congress, and I see some of my classmates here on the floor, I remember the first vote I cast was for the Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, who was then under a cloud of ethics. And I remember the last vote I cast as a freshman Member was whether or not to impeach a sitting President of the United States.     
   So my freshman term began and ended with this issue of ethics. 
   Ironically, as my days in this Chamber wind down, we are embroiled once again in a partisan struggle about the integrity of this institution. I was on the floor last night during the debate, and many who spoke don't even know where the Ethics Committee is located in the Capitol. That's a good thing. That means, then, that you've never had the occasion to be called in front of the committee or to render testimony or to provide some information. And yet it is so vitally important to the integrity of this institution. 
   My bona fides, again, I listened with some interest to incoming freshmen Members who debated this last night, that the Ethics Committee has been broken, hasn't worked for however many years, and yet I beg to differ in the sense that I was tapped as a noncommittee member to sit on an investigative subcommittee, and we sat and we resolved, appropriately, I think, the matter with a former Member from Alabama. I don't need to name his party. It's irrelevant. The House rules apply to everyone equally. Whether you're a backbencher or whether you're one of the most powerful members of leadership, it doesn't matter. But I participated in that investigative subcommittee and then was actually appointed to the committee itself. 
   I remember standing right here in this very spot as this body voted to expel a Member from Ohio, that extraordinary remedy of substituting the will of this House for the will of the voters of then the 17th District of Ohio. And we did that. And the process worked. 
   The Ethics Committee continued to handle many sensitive matters, many of those never seeing the light of day, appropriately, because when a baseless or meritless claim is brought against one of the number of this House, it shouldn't be debated or discussed on the front pages of the newspaper but should be dealt with down in the basement and, as appropriate, then brought to the attention of the American public. So those confidentiality rules are important and necessary. 
   I objected to the rules changes that were made, my friend from Tennessee mentioned that as well last night, that unilaterally forced upon then the minority, and I objected to those. And let me point out again, as my friend from Tennessee did, that we changed those rules because it was a unilateral action, and that was appropriate for our majority at the time then to say we should redo this in a bipartisan fashion. 
   And then, of course, may I claim, the ``infamous'' vote on Medicare part D and allegations that were made. And then suddenly in my time on the committee, I was the chairman of the investigative subcommittee to investigate allegations. We didn't know where the allegations were going to lead us. I issued the report and admonished publicly the then-majority leader on our side of the aisle. I was removed from the committee because of that. More disturbing was the fact that there were professional staff that were fired as a result of that, good, decent, honorable professionals who were fired as a result of that report. Certainly not our finest hour. And there are still some relationships on our side of the aisle that have been strained personally to this day because of those actions. 
   But the wisest man I ever knew, my father, he never finished college. May he rest in peace. He had a single mantra that I remember from a kid growing up on the farm to those hallowed Halls, and that mantra was simply: The only thing worth keeping in life is keeping your good name, and you keep your good name by standing up and doing what's right. And I will leave this body with that name intact. 
   I used to believe that an outside entity had no place in the ethics process. But after this renewed partisanship on a committee that should not be partisan, I came to a different conclusion, and I voted with the majority last night as one of the handful on our side that believed that perhaps this might be the way out. And as I leave this august body, I hope and pray that I have not damaged the institution by my vote, but that will be for a future Congress and future Congresses to determine. 
   The former chairman of the committee, my friend from Washington's predecessor, Mr. Hefley of Colorado, he and I used to believe that if we simply provided the resources for the committee to reward staff, not punish them for doing their jobs, to provide some subpoena power, that the committee itself could continue to hold up the integrity of this institution. But again, seemingly, that is not the way forward as far as it relates to ethics, and so last night I crossed the aisle and voted for this. 
   But we are here today for a further purpose. A good and decent, honorable man who has the integrity of this institution at stake has been impugned, in my view; so, unfortunately, we then come to this point of personal privilege. 
   I have reviewed the letter from my friend, and she is my friend, the March 11 letter that suggests that rules have been violated by the disclosure of a professional opinion about the merits or lack of merits of the proposal we voted on last night. And I will say again for the purpose of the Record that, in my view, rule 7, subparagraph d, and the subparagraphs beneath that rule, that there has been no violation of those matters as it relates to the disclosure. This was not the disclosure of any fact or nature of a complaint. This was not the disclosure of any executive session proceedings. It was not the disclosure of any report, study, or document that expresses views, findings, or recommendations in connection with activities of ethics investigation. So as I go through those subparagraphs, those words are important, as we know, not just legally but ethically to determine whether or not this disclosure by Mr. Kellner, who I know personally, having worked with him on the committee, is a very professional, capable individual. I do not find as a sitting Member that anything of the disclosure of Mr. Kellner's letter has violated House rules. 
   Having said that, I am mindful again of what the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster) had to remind us of, and it, hopefully, was a reminder, that we have a privilege to serve here. This is a privilege granted to us. Each of us has taken the same oath of office that Mr. Foster took in the well yesterday. And inherent in that oath of office is the belief that the integrity of this institution is more important than any single Member serving here. To think that these same feet that used to walk barefoot down our cotton rows have had the privilege of walking the marble Halls of Congress for the last, now, 12 years, this is something that the integrity of the institution is more important than a single Member. And I can only wonder about those who are here witnessing today, as they excitedly have come to Washington, DC, maybe for their first-ever visit, and they come to the House Gallery, and there must be thrust upon them this discussion about whether Members of Congress are ethical or not, and it saddens me. 
   So I implore simply all that are here and those that aren't here and for those that are going to come to this body, in order to bring about and reinforce the trust that the 300 million people across the country from sea to shining sea have in this institution, we must have a functioning ethics process.  We don't. And when there are charges and countercharges that, unfortunately, necessitate bringing a point of personal privilege, we do not serve this institution well. 
   And so I tell the gentleman, with whom I have occasionally disagreed as it relates to ethics, that I think you are an honorable, decent man who has the integrity of this institution deeply in your heart, and I support you and urge all colleagues to consider the institution and the damage that we perhaps are doing by this partisan warfare.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. 
   Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a lot of self-congratulations, at least on one side of this Chamber. Let me congratulate some who have spoken here for what appears to this Member to be a pretty breath-taking lack of consistency. My good friend from Fremont Hills has pointed the finger to this side and said we Republicans, we don't care about children. 
   I would remind my chairman, Mr. Speaker, that the children's health program was created by a Republican majority. The gentleman points out that this bill today is funded, as the gentleman is nodding, as that bill was funded. And I would say, Mr. Speaker, 10 years ago and 2 days on July 30, rollcall vote no. 345, on this floor, on the conference report creating the Children's Health Insurance Program, I was proud to be one of 346 ``aye'' votes. There were 85 ``no'' votes. The gentleman from California was a ``no'' vote. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee was a ``no'' vote. I find that a bit interesting. Because, today, the gentleman from California talks about this being the identical bill. This is not the identical bill. 
   As my friend from Louisiana has said, we would love to reauthorize the  program for needy children. But should we allow a family in New York making $80,000 a year free health care, free to them, but paid for by 15,000 constituents I am privileged to represent who would have their vision care or dental benefits or oxygen services cut, and the savings then given to that couple making $80,000 in New York City? 
   One-half of the new enrollees under the majority's bill, those new enrollees would be people who already have health insurance coverage. There is, as the gentleman pointed out, a brand new, per capita tax on every health plan in America that raises $2 billion. There are rifle-shot reimbursements for hospitals in order, presumably, to sway undecided Members from Michigan and New York and Tennessee. 
   And can anyone really defend the children's health program for childless adults, childless adults now being able to qualify for the children's health insurance program? 
   Needy children, absolutely. Well-to-do adults, I suggest no, certainly not at the expense of cuts to senior citizens. We can do better. I urge a ``no'' vote.

To the chairman of the full committee, I would say as difficult and partisan as this day has begun, I think we are going to end on a very bipartisan high note, and certainly thank the gentleman, the gentlelady from Texas, certainly Mr. Mica and the gentleman from Louisiana who just spoke. Congratulations to all in finally passing this WRDA bill. 
   I would like to spend just a moment to talk about the legislation, the modernization of the five locks on the Mississippi River and the two on the Illinois River; the gentleman from Minnesota mentioned that earlier as far as the modernization of locks and dams. And I want to do this in a little different way. 
   Last week, we considered and passed the farm bill. Perhaps I took a little bit of heat for actually supporting that bill. In part, I supported it because it provides an important safety net for our farmers. And, interestingly, the bill we are considering tonight will go a long way to ensuring that farmers don't need to rely upon subsidies to survive. 
   How is that, you ask? Well, the ability to transport crops to export markets via the Mississippi River provides our Midwestern farmers a better price for crops than if that river was not available. Witness Hurricane Katrina as an unfortunate real world example of that specific example. A recent study conducted on behalf of a river stakeholder calculated that, if we fail to increase the size of our locks and if we were to allow river congestion to increase, farmers would lose $562 million a year. That income would need to be replaced by subsidy payments on the farms or the farms would fail. As such, the $1 billion in taxpayer dollars that this bill includes to modernize our locks is a hedge against the multiple billions of dollars of future farm subsidies and allows our farmers to continue to farm for the markets and not for a government check. 
   This bill, as has been noticed, is long overdue. The modernization of our outdated locks is also long overdue. These locks are standing out of habit. They were built in the 1930s to accommodate steamboats. Since 1975, the Corps has spent $900 million under fix-it-as-it-fails scenarios, hoping to push major problems a little way down the river. But despite the Corps' best efforts, and I would have to say an amazing job of maintenance on a shoestring budget, the River continues to lose about 10 percent of its capacity every year due to unplanned maintenance closures. 
   Now, as a last point, a gentle point, I would say to my friend from Oregon, who spoke earlier on the rule, he and I have discussed on several occasions the modernization of locks and dams on the Upper Mississippi, and I want to be kind to him as I say he is not as ardent of a supporter of those modernization efforts as I, and he spoke of the independent review process. I concur with him, but I would remind the gentleman that the independent review that examined the locks and dams modernization woefully underestimated the demand variable for corn and ethanol. 
   This year alone in my district, tens of millions of additional bushels of corn will be harvested this fall and will need a viable navigable waterway. The study by the National Academy of Sciences did not adequately anticipate this increased demand. So while independent review, I agree, is important, it is not infallible. But I thank the diligent work of the committee to include this modernization. I urge every Member to support the conference report.

   Mr. HULSHOF. I appreciate my friend from Minnesota. 
   I would tell the gentleman that I grew up in the shadows of the levees of the Mississippi River, and I am the son of a Missouri farm family. We are about 8 miles from the Mississippi River as the crow flies, and the ability to have that navigable waterway means the difference between being in the black or being in the red for our family farm. So that lesson has imprinted itself upon me. And I am pleased to support the gentleman in this conference report, and I thank the gentleman for the additional courtesies.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, looking back over this week's legislative accomplishments, I am sure democracy has somehow been furthered by our vote on Monday to congratulate the winners of the Orange Bowl, or our debate yesterday commending the two coaches of the Super Bowl. 
   But today's vote has some significant consequences in that we are about to do great harm to our Nation's land grant colleges by erasing, zeroing out $186 million in agricultural research grants. Today's vote has real consequences. There are 24 of you on that side of the political aisle that represent colleges that get this money, and I specifically urge five of you that are first-term Members here, Mrs. Boyda, Ms. Shea-Porter, Mr. Ellison, Mr. Courtney, and Mr. Welch, to consider the following: Your vote on this continuing resolution zeros out critical research grants in your home districts. 
   At the University of Missouri-Columbia, my alma mater, this resolution forces 20 faculty reductions, the dismissal of 93 staff and 49 graduate students. You can argue that you open college doors by increasing Pell Grants, and yet those students are going to find the doors of plant and animal science laboratories locked tight. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this CR.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (TAX COLLECTION RESPONSIBILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer this motion to recommit to the underlying bill, the Tax Collection Responsibility Act. 
   The motion to recommit would actually incorporate H.R. 2380, which is a bill for which I am the original sponsor. It is a bipartisan bill, and I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, especially those who have cosponsored the bill, would see fit to support this motion to recommit. 
   Since I have these few moments, and I see the distinguished chairman of the committee who may be responding, let me anticipate some points or questions perhaps and try to respond to them. 
   We may hear the question: Why are we doing the death tax repeal now? 
   Well, three times in the last session of Congress did we have the opportunity to debate this issue and vote on it. Again, this House in a bipartisan fashion voted to completely, permanently repeal the death tax. 
   I am not certain under the new majority that we will have that opportunity or not. There is a policy rationale for considering this measure now. One is the certainty. 
   As the Speaker knows, right now there is a $2 million exemption, a 45 percent rate, a very punitive rate. That exemption in 2010 goes up to a complete repeal, and there is lack of certainty, especially those family businesses that are looking to plan on how to dispose of those assets. So I think now is an appropriate time. 
   We may hear from my good friend, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is this bill paid for. And I would suggest first of all that there is no budgetary impact in fiscal year 2009. We are looking beyond January 1, 2011, before any budgetary impact. And I would quote the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee who at least has been quoted in the paper as saying he is ready to tackle some big, tough issues, like the alternative minimum tax. The permanent death tax repeal is significantly less loss of revenue to the government than repealing the AMT. 
   He has talked about fairness and equity. I can think of nothing fairer than to get rid of this very punitive tax. 
   We may hear from the other side, as traditionally we do, this is something that only a handful of individuals face, or that this is for millionaires only. My rejoinder to that is then why is every small business group in America, whether it be the National Federation of Independent Business, whether it be every business group that represents minority interests, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the African American Chamber of Commerce in the past, all have supported complete repeal, final repeal of this very punitive tax. 
   Let me talk a little bit about the values of this. 
   This is the land of opportunity, is it not? The old adage is, if you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door. The only thing guaranteed, of course, in America is the guarantee of freedom and liberty and the opportunity to achieve whatever it is you dream about. 
   Let me tell you a very personal story of a dream of a young couple. A young, strapping man left home in 1956 with his new bride in tow. They had $1,000 to their name. That is what his father had given him to go make his way into the world. And so they settled in Mrs. Emerson's district in southeast Missouri, and they worked very hard to build a farm. 
   Over the course of those many years, this couple had a son, an only son. That individual is the one the Chair has recognized here today. 
   They built this family business, a family-owned farm, 500 acres, three tractors, a used combine, the farmhouse where I grew up. And so it was, of course, the unfortunate reality of life, and that is we meet our heavenly reward. My dad passed on the anniversary of John F. Kennedy's death on November 22, 5 years ago this November. Mom survived another 17 months after that. 
   I am sitting there across the mahogany desk from our old, long-time family accountant who had an old adding machine with a tape in it, and he is plugging in a value for all of these assets that my parents had already been taxed on, whose assets were to help put food on the table. Suddenly I broke out in a cold sweat because I knew when he hit the total button, that figure was going to be above or below an arbitrary line, a line set by this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, death of a family member should not be a taxable event, and the fact is if Congress fails to do anything with the current regime, virtually every small business in America in 2011 is going to be facing this very punitive tax. I urge an ``aye'' vote on the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (MEMBERS DEFEATED BY LOBBYISTS IN ``HOOPS FOR HOPE'' -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. I have to admit, Mr. Speaker, that it is with conflicting emotion that I rise, as is my custom, to report on the annual Hoops for Hope basketball game, an intense athletic contest between Members of Congress and representatives of the lobbying community. 
   Normally, I'm accompanied with a handsome trophy indicating the success of our athletic endeavors. In fact, seven times out of the last 9 years said hardware has joined me here at the table. Alas, I will admit the absence of said hardware suggests the outcome of last Monday night's game. The lobbyists defeated the Members team 45-36. 
   Now, some point out that the enhanced lobbying disclosure rules that have been passed are to blame in that we were unable to utilize secret plays. I often point out that the universe from which the teams are drawn, the universe of lobbyists, of course numbers in the thousands, indeed the tens of thousands from which they can draw their athletic team whereas we, on the other hand, are limited by a finite number of 535. 
   One observer of the game wryly noted that he hoped the Members of Congress team were current on their dues to the local bricklayers union in that, shall we say, our shooting percentage was not that good. 
   The bright spot, however, as is the case every year, is that significant funds were raised for local charities. Indeed, last Monday night's event at the Smith Center, on the campus of George Washington University, raised over $60,000, bringing the cumulative total of funds for local charities to over $300,000 over the life of this very spirited but worthwhile contest. 
   Specifically, the local charities this year included Horton's Kids and the Luke Tiahrt Foundation, as well as Saint Anthony's. Before the game, many of the children actually served by those funds were in attendance. So it was great to see the recipients of those charitable efforts being there and participating in that contest. 
   A couple of quick thanks: As always, George Washington University was extraordinary in their hospitality in providing the gymnasium of the Smith Center. We had celebrity coaches. Coach John Thompson, III, Georgetown University's basketball coach, was the Members of Congress' coach. He didn't have a lot to work with, unfortunately, last Monday night. We are checking with the NCAA to make sure that that blemish is not going to be included in this year's Georgetown record. On the other side of the court was Coach Karl Hobbs from George Washington University. Again, we appreciate the unselfishness of both Coach Thompson and Coach Hobbs. 
   I also want to acknowledge, I am not sure they want their names mentioned necessarily, but my colleagues, Mr. Tiahrt of Kansas, Mr. Larsen of the State of Washington, Mr. Kind of Wisconsin, Mr. Flake of Arizona, Mr. Thune from the other side of the Capitol from South Dakota, Mr. Meek of Florida, and Mr. Crowley of New York, again, gave it our best. But we fell  short. But as they always say, there is next year. 
   So, finally, with apologies to Mr. Longfellow, I would conclude by saying: 
 Somewhere in this favored land The sun is shining bright. The band is playing somewhere And somewhere hearts are light. Somewhere men are laughing, Somewhere children play. But there is no joy in Washington, The lobbyists won the day.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-115) -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, the President has, for the second time, vetoed a bill that would help Midwestern farmers. Once again, I rise to vote for Missouri's family farmers and to override President's veto. 
   I think it's interesting that for over a year, opponents have said prices are high, farmers don't need a safety net, as if we can predict with certainty the market price of commodities 5 years down the road. 
   Today those opponents claim prices may drop, causing the safety net to be too expensive. Well, with all respect, which is it? 
   Sixteen percent of this bill provides a responsible safety net for farmers when the market turns south. And let's make no mistake. Farmers don't want to farm for a government check. Farmers want to farm for the market. 
   And what is the cost to the American taxpayer? Six cents a day. In my mind, six cents a day is not too much to pay to ensure that we continue to have the safest, most abundant food supply at the lowest cost. 
   Now, we have seen what happens when we offshore or energy production. What will happen when we offshore our food production? Thank the Lord above, literally, thank the Lord above that we can put three square meals a day on our tables from the bounty of our country's own farmers. 
   This bill is not perfect. It doesn't contain all the reforms that the other side would want. But under their plan, which failed 117-309, most of the farms and ranches would not be able to survive the erosion in farm income. That's according to the Agriculture and Food Policy Center at Texas A&M. 
   Some people just can't take yes for an answer. 1,054 organizations, from MoveOn.Org to the USA Rice Federation, support this bill. 
   I know it's tough to do, but I urge my colleagues to vote to override the President's veto and provide this safety net. And I appreciate the gentleman for the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. I thank the tag team here for allowing me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this conference report, and I commend my friend for his patience and his persistence in bringing to this body this consensus product. 
   I realize that fewer and fewer Americans have a direct connection to the land. One reason is because it's becoming quite tough to make a living in production agriculture. And certainly that disconnect to rural America is evident here on the floor of the House. Dwight Eisenhower once said, ``Farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles away from the cornfield.'' 
   Or to put it another way, Mr. Chairman, I quote from the saying on the plaque in your office that says, ``If farming were easy, Congressmen would do it.'' 
   Well, I am a farmer. I'm the son of a farmer. I'm the grandson of a farmer.  
   Agriculture runs in cycles, and sometimes those cycles are pretty volatile. In September of 2005 during our corn harvest after Hurricane Katrina, the price of corn at a river terminal in Southeast Missouri was $1.40, and I don't recall anybody other than yours truly coming to the floor to extol that fact.     
   Yesterday, that same bushel of corn would have brought $5.97 at least on the Chicago Board of Trade, and even that isn't a windfall. And because we know that it is 47 percent more this year to plant one acre of corn in Missouri than it was last year, fertilizer is up 112 percent. Grain contracts and loans are getting harder to come by. Debt has increased by 30 percent in the last 5 years. We know farming looks a lot today like it did before the crash of the 1980s. 
   And we also know with all respect to those who talk about profligate spending, that about three-quarters of the farm bill dollar in this bill will not go to farmers but to the equally noble goal of ensuring that Americans have enough to eat. And quite frankly I expect that most of the farm payments to production agriculture in this bill will never have to be paid because the market price is going to be above the trigger level.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the farm bill. In doing so, I thank my good friend Chairman Peterson for bringing a bill we can all support to the floor. I must say that without his leadership, we would have never reached this point. 
   This, Mr. Speaker, is the last farm bill I will vote on as a Member of this great House. And as I do so, I think of my dad, the founder of my family's farm. He built our farm using not Government handouts but hard work, business savvy and penny-pinching. 
   By creating this successful small business he was able to save just enough to plant the next year's crop and send his only son to college. Many who oppose this bill would probably point to my dad as one of those rich farmers who doesn't need a safety net. In response, I quote Dwight Eisenhower, ``farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you're a thousand miles from the corn field.'' 
   Those of us who actually farm, know farming isn't easy. We know that it now costs $534, or 47 percent more than last year, to plant 1 acre of corn in Missouri and we know fertilizer is up 112 percent from last year. We know that farming looks a lot like it did in the 1970s. 
   For those who don't remember, during the 1970s we had conditions much like today; healthy world demand took prices to all-time highs. Many farmers cashed in their land's equity and bought new land to chase these high prices. Then Government policies changed, including the grain embargo to the Soviet Union after their invasion of Afghanistan, and the market crashed. 
   I remember that policy well; it was the first time I realized that factors beyond our farm gate could determine the fate of our farm. I later learned that it nearly cost us our farm. 
   Ultimately, the crash of the 1980s caused thousands of farms to go under and when they did they took with them 300 agricultural banks, countless business that depended on farmers, and even some entire rural communities. 
   The similarities to today are striking. Today farm debt sets a new record every year, increasing 30 percent, or $52.8 billion, in the last 5 years. The price of land has once again risen to 1970s-esque highs, climbing 67 percent since 2003. 
   Now I am not saying that we can expect a crash, I don't know what the market will do over the next few years--no one does. What I am saying is that now is not the time to support irresponsible cuts to the safety net. 
   Now I know, the opponents of the farm bill will say they don't support irresponsible cuts, they only want ``reform.'' There is reform in this bill, there is a lower income cap, there are reforms to the loan programs and the bill does away with the three-entity rule. 
   I know, the reformers will counter by saying these reforms don't go far enough. But if their reform plan--the Kind-Flake Amendment--would have passed and prices would have declined during the life of the farm bill, then ``most of the farms and ranches would not be able to survive the erosion in farm income,'' according to the independent Agriculture and Food Policy Center at Texas A&M University. 
   The bottom line is that Chairman Peterson has engineered an excellent compromise. It provides $209 billion for food stamps and school lunches. The bill also provides $25 billion for conservation programs, including enough funding to enroll nearly 13 million acres, or an area the size of West Virginia, into the Conservation Security Program. And the bill provides $35 billion to help farmers stay afloat. 
   The good news is if prices stay at their current level, most of those authorized dollars will never have to be paid. The safety net in the 2002 Farm Bill cost $20 billion less than what it was projected to cost, because commodity prices stayed high. 
   This bill is not a windfall; it is a basic safety net for our farmers. This safety net costs each taxpayer 6 cents a day. In return, farmers provide the safest, most abundant food supply at the lowest cost--just 11 percent of our income goes toward food, the lowest total in the world. 
   So I ask all of my colleagues to support this compromise. I am sure every Member can find things to oppose in this bill, there are certainly parts I oppose and I know there are even parts of the bill that Chairman Peterson opposes. But at the end of the day, we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the farmer. Support the farm bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I look at the time, it is about 13 years ago exactly at this moment that I was standing at the altar saying, ``I do'' to the love of my life. So I must begin by wishing a happy 13th anniversary to the most beautiful woman in the world, with all respect to those ladies that are here present. I guess every marriage has obviously some high points and some disappointments. 
   And the other reason for me coming to floor is to actually speak about the disappointment that I have with the White House, particularly with its veto of H.R. 1495, the Water Resources Development Act, often referred to as WRDA. This veto, if I must say so, was ill advised and I expect will be overridden by this House tomorrow and the Senate in the coming days. 
   I acknowledge that the President, during the veto message, mentioned that when the WRDA bill left the House, it was about $15 billion. The Senate's version was at 14 billion. And the final version of the water resources bill was somewhere around 23 billion. Yet certainly the White House understands that the bill that left the House had different priorities emphasized, different projects were being considered by the Senate and as such when the conference was convened, those bills had to be combined. The President, in his veto message, said, in essence, I fully support funding for water resources projects. 
   Respectfully, I must point out that the President's budget each year woefully underfunds the Army Corps of Engineers budget in my view, the operations and maintenance budget. And the White House went on with its veto message to say, My administration has repeatedly urged Congress to authorize only those projects that provide a high return on investment. 
   Well, I share the White House's belief that taxpayers deserve a dollar's worth of services for every dollar they remit in taxes. But just looking at water resources projects in terms of dollars and cents is what caused us to only have category 3 levees in New Orleans. We have seen how short-sighted that decision was. In fact, I would suggest that over the last 25 years, every dollar that the Corps has invested in flood control has been returned six-fold in potential damages that had been averted.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1495. I grew up in the shadow of levees along the Mississippi River in southeast Missouri. And while the river, at times destructive, the river has been a provider for me and my family, delivering the grain from our farm to international markets. 
   And I will tell you, as the gentleman from Minnesota has stated, the nickels and dimes that we saved by shipping via barge were often the difference between our farm ending up in the red or ending up in the black. Those few cents have helped keep food on our table; clothes on our back; and, over the years, kept our farm even within our own family. 
   Title VIII of the legislation, lock modernization, will insure that farmers in northeast Missouri and farmers in Iowa and Illinois, Minnesota, Wisconsin and elsewhere will continue to have the same benefit that my family had, the ability to ship crops to international markets via the most cost-effective method. 
   I will tell you that a recent study by the Food and Ag Policy Research Institute, FAPRI, found that if the Mississippi River and Illinois waterways were forced to close, possibly because of a massive lock failure, that farmers, our own U.S. farmers, would lose between $645 million and $806 million a year, a year in increased transportation costs. We experienced a glimpse of that in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when the river was shut down, navigation was shut down for a short time during the fall of 2005. Farmers endured a 60-cent-per-bushel penalty on a bushel of corn during that critical time in September of 2005. And a massive failure, unfortunately, is a distinct possibility. 
   These locks are standing just out of habit, or as my constituent, Senator KIT BOND, is fond of saying, ``These locks belong in the National Register of Historic Locations.'' They were built in the 1930s to accommodate steamboats for the next 50 years. As the gentleman pointed out, these locks are no longer navigation aids, but hindrances. They are 600 feet long. The modern barge is close to 1,200 feet, often three across and five long. 
   What I want to emphasize again to my friend from Oregon who spoke, and others, these locks benefit the American public in other ways. The typical tow removes 870 18-wheel tractor trailer trucks from our already congested roads, bridges, and interstate highways. A gallon of diesel fuel will push one ton of freight 2 1/2 times further by barge than by locomotive; nine times farther than by truck. Moreover, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, towboats emit 35 to 60 percent fewer pollutants than locomotives or trucks. All in all, all worthy. 
   I urge its support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   It's Friday. We're about to go home. What have we done this week? Well, we've seen earmarks for golf courses air-dropped into the Defense appropriations conference report. The Woodstock Hippie Museum is now back in play for Federal dollars. Is there any dispute that Congress has earned its 11 percent approval rating. 
   Today's bridge to nowhere take us to Albany, New York where lawmakers of that State's legislature will enjoy a per diem write-off for days that they are not working in their State capital. 
   I say to my friend from Washington, imagine if you were an IRS tax compliance officer, probably with an approval rating higher than Congress, and this was the scenario presented to you. A hypothetical State, we'll call it State Y, begins its legislative session in early January and adjourns its legislative calendar at the end of June. Nothing unusual about that. But this particular State legislature extends its session, declares itself to be in session for the remainder of the year, even though no legislative business is conducted. The question before the IRS is, should those lawmakers be entitled to a $150 a day per diem for days that they are not in their State capital? 
   The IRS ruled, correctly in my view, that they should not be entitled to this special tax break. 
   Well, notwithstanding that, in this bill, tucked away, is a provision that basically says that this per diem is allowed for all 365 days. And for those of you that are quickly doing the math on the back of your envelope, $150 plus a day equals $55,000 a year. Now, who foots that bill? Taxpayers from Missouri, taxpayers from the State of Washington, taxpayers from Massachusetts. 
   Now, I will give credit, I see my friend from Oregon is here, who, in committee, voted with us, as well as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett) that this was an inappropriate provision. I applaud the gentlemen for that. 
   The IRS in its tax policy and priority guidance, in other words, the red flags that the IRS really wanted to take a look at was, in fact, this specific provision. The IRS had raised a red flag. But because of the powerful chairman, I see him on the floor, my good friend from New York, the powerful chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and the powerful chairman of the Rules Committee, who coincidentally happen to hail from the State in question, instead of a red flag by the IRS, they now have to wave a white flag. And again, taxpayers across the country are on the hook. 
   I would just say this, and I say this somewhat tongue in cheek.     
   When we get to the larger debate about the alternative minimum tax, I think one thing that all of us agree upon, of course, is that with the intent of that tax we have gone far afield. Unfortunately, I suspect we are going to have a lot of finger-pointing and partisanship and Republicans didn't do this and didn't pay attention or whatever. I would simply point out that facts are stubborn things in the fact that in 1969 I think the party in control during that session of Congress creating the tax was then the Democratic majority, and I seem to recall that the Republican Congress sent to a Democratic President a bill that would have completely, finally, permanently repealed the alternative minimum tax; and, unfortunately, the Democratic President vetoed that bill. So I think there is enough blame to go around if that's why you're coming to the floor to assign blame. 
   But the AMT, as has been pointed out, was originally created by the then-majority to hit about 150-plus wealthy families. This particular provision inserted not an extended, expiring provision, but a brand-new provision, but this brand new provision helps 150 legislators. Of this rifle shot, former chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Rostenkowski would most certainly be proud. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that on a day in August of 1997 that a Democratic President would sign a bill presented by a Republican Congress, and that that would be a high-water mark as far as consensus between a divided government, 10 years ago, the high-water mark of a divided government coming together to create a solution. I was here to help create the bill. In that instance, a Republican Congress worked with, negotiated with, compromised with the President of the other party to create a solution to the problem of children who had no health insurance.     
   Now, I would say, Madam Speaker, that the 2007 version of the Children's Health Insurance Program is almost unrecognizable from the original bill, and certainly beyond the original intent of that bill. 
   For instance, New Jersey currently has a planned amendment that would use income disregards which would allow it to raise its SCHIP eligibility levels to 350 percent of poverty. That's about $71,000 for a family of four. And don't just take my word for it. Look at section 114, subparagraph A under the bill. And that would continue under this bill. 
   Many adults without children would be eligible under this bill. Don't take my word for it. Read subparagraph A of section 112 of the bill. You know, the bill allows States to move them to Medicaid, but allows it to pay. 
   The Federal Government should not be, in my humble opinion, in the business of paying for States who want to cover childless adults that are grandfathered in this bill. And on behalf of my constituents in Missouri, should I ask them to reach in their pockets then and to pay for health care for a family of four in New Jersey making $70,000 or a family of four in New York making $80,000? 
   So it comes down to this. In fact, there are still 79,000 kids in Missouri, Madam Speaker, that are still at or below 200 percent of poverty. Those are the kids we need to reach out to to provide health insurance. 
   So the question at the end of this vote is this, to my friends on the other side, Do you want the politics or do you want the policy?

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Before yielding to my friend from Texas, I yield myself such time as I may consume to respond to a previous speaker, the gentlelady from New Hampshire, who said that she would have voted against the original bill had she known or had she believed that, in fact, a family of four making $80,000 would qualify their children. Well, in fact, I would point the gentlelady to section 114, subparagraph A of the bill that allows income disregards. 
   And I would say to the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, who pointed out that, yes, it was the administration that granted the waiver, there are some on this side who would suggest the administration has approved unwise waivers in the past. But even this administration has indicated to a particular Governor that before we allow this waiver to occur, in the instance of New Jersey, so many additional enrollees would have to meet the intent of the SCHIP program, to which the Governor said, ``I don't have to abide by that.'' And I find that a bit difficult to swallow as we then discuss whether this should be the law of the land. 
   I am now pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. HULSHOF. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   With all respect, Madam Speaker, I don't need to be lectured to by a Member who did not even support the original Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   The fact is that we reached compromise 10 years ago. And I recognize that the chairman of the Health Subcommittee can ram through a bill when you've got the votes, as the original bill was done, without any input from anybody else, that it's my way or the highway. And I recognize that when you have the votes, that's one way you can try to enact legislation. 
   So my question still stands, after this veto is sustained, Do you want the politics or do you want the policy? I hope the latter. Because I guarantee you we can have a meeting of the minds. 
   Mr. Camp and I, Mr. Boustany, in fact, introduced the Kids First Act that would reauthorize this program. It's similar to the alternative in the Senate that would increase State allotments by $14 billion over the next 5 years, that would allow 1.3 million new low-income children to be covered, that reimburses States at their Medicaid matching rate, fully offsets the bill without raising taxes, bolsters current provisions to provide premium assistance to kids who have access to private coverage so that we can better coordinate public and private programs to prevent the crowding-out effect. 
   So once this political effort is done, I hope we can have a meeting of the minds.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the State of Washington mentioned medical school. Let me recount an old axiom that with learned in law school. We were told: If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. If the facts and the law are against you, pound the podium. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, there has been a lot of podium pounding on the other side of the aisle today. The question is this, shall the government interfere with or intervene in a prescription drug plan that is working? 
   Now, the majority seeks through H.R. 4 to strike this nonintervention clause. First of all, is anyone having a flashback to 1993 and 1994 talking about government taking over health care? 
   But, more importantly, my colleague from the State of California, the incoming chairman of the Health Subcommittee, and 203 of his colleagues are about to do an abrupt, en masse, about face. Because in the Congressional Record of June 28 of 2000, you had this nonintervention clause, and 204 Democrats said, we don't want to give the Secretary the ability to negotiate in roll call 356. 
   Now, what could possibly explain this inconsistency? Could politics be at play? 
   The gentleman from Washington talked about some history. Let us go back over the committee history, because my colleagues from Ways and Means are here. 
   First of all, during committee action we were chided there would be no plans available under the Republican plan. 
   Then, of course, when we saw the plethora of plans, we heard the complaints from your side, there are too many confusing choices that seniors have across the country. Then you wagged your finger at us and said, well, we need to legislate the premium at $35, and then the total cost of the program is going to explode the deficit. Remember hearing that? 
   Yet, on the other hand, as has been discussed, the average premium is $22. In the State of Missouri, you could even have a premium for under $15 if you choose it. Of course, we have seen how those program costs have come down. 
   We heard from your side that the drug companies were going to do a bait-and-switch, that we were going to have low ball that first year and then we would see those prices being jacked up. Lord help us, what's happened? Drug prices have gone down. Imagine premiums and prices coming down in health care. 
   Then my colleague from the State of California said to his colleagues, it is okay, once the seniors hit the donut hole, they will be angry, and they will be outraged. Then we have seen, of course, that every senior at least has had the opportunity to have full coverage, including coverage for the donut hole. You just can't find it within yourself to say we got one right. 
   Just like welfare reform, surely, Mr. Leader, once every 10 years, you can say the Republicans got it right. We are witnessing cost containment and competition by incorporating private sector market principles within the public sector programs provision of drug coverage. Let us lighten up on the podium pounding, say no to government interference and no to H.R. 4.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4, and I would like to divide my remarks into two main thoughts: first, ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' and second, the laws of intended and unintended consequences. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Medicare Part D Benefit ain't broke. 
   But Medicare was broken before there was a drug benefit. When I came to Congress, one of the issues I heard about most often from my constituents was the need for prescription drug coverage for seniors. In 1965, when Medicare was created to ensure that seniors had some access to health care, prescription drugs were not a primary mode of treatment, and thus not covered. 
   But as medical science advanced, and miraculous treatments became available via prescription drugs, Medicare still languished without a drug benefit, and many seniors were faced with the brutal decision between buying their medicine or paying for food, clothes, housing, and other necessities. 
   Seniors do not have to make that brutal decision anymore. 
   Under the law, millions of seniors who previously could not afford prescription drugs are now receiving the medicines they need. 
   More than 40,000 volunteers in communities across the country worked during the enrollment period, counseling beneficiaries and sponsoring events to help people with Medicare. I would like to commend these volunteers, volunteers like Debbie Catlett from the Hannibal Nutrition Center, who lovingly helped her friends and neighbors sign up for drug coverage. 
   The system the Republican Congress set-up has been remarkably successful: The average premium in 2006, originally projected to be $37 per month, was only $23; and rather than increasing to the projected $40 per month in 2007 it lowered to $22 for this year. In Missouri, we have even less expensive options available, the lowest costing only $14.90 per month. Imagine that, health care premiums going down! 
   Seniors are saving, on average, $1,200 a year on prescription drugs. At the same time, Part D recipients saw a 13 percent increase in the number of medications available. According to polls, about 80 percent of America's seniors are satisfied with their prescription drug plans. 
   All that is on the micro level, what individual seniors are enjoying and saving; but let's look at the macro level. Over 90 percent of seniors now have drug coverage--if these seniors are paying less, the government must be paying more to pick up the slack, right? 
   Wrong. 
   The Medicare drug benefit cost nearly $13 billion less than expected in its first year, 30 percent below the $43 billion that had been budgeted. 
   Long-term savings are even greater. HHS Secretary Leavitt just announced that the independent CMS actuaries are lowering their estimate of the cost of the benefit over the next decade by another 10 percent, with almost all of the new savings resulting from competition. The actuaries' new estimates show that total net Medicare costs are 30 percent lower, or $189 billion less, for the same budget window (2004-2013) than the actuaries originally anticipated before the Medicare drug benefit was implemented. 
   The long and the short of it is, Medicare Part D is a big, fat success. 
   Look, the majority is upset that the Republican Congress enacted a successful, popular program, and the ``let Medicare negotiate low prices like the VA'' polled well for them (I've seen the polling numbers). But a bumper sticker phrase aimed at coopting that success isn't good policy. 
   I've discussed how the program isn't broken and doesn't need fixing, now onto the intended and unintended consequences of this bumper sticker bill. 
   Best case scenario if this Democrat attention grabber of a bill becomes law is that  Medicare proves unable to negotiate lower prices than the marketplace currently does--and two non-partisan entities, the Congressional Budget Office and the CMS Office of the Actuary have said the Democrat plan 
   yields no savings for this reason--and no harm is done. But worst case scenario is overactive bureaucrats or the next President take this negotiating authority and use it to force price controls, ration drugs, and deny doctor and patient choice of what medicines are allowed for seniors. 
   So friends, pick your poison: On the one hand an impotent outcome as CBO and the CMS Actuary have foretold, on the other, Medicare setting prices and rationing seniors their medicine. I will remain agnostic as to which is the intended and which the unintended consequence. 
   The reason the two economic models I've mentioned concluded no savings via H.R. 4 is that, fundamentally, the government cannot negotiate any better than the thousands of prescription drug plan managers in the private market. Under current law the millions of Medicare beneficiaries, via their prescription drug plans, are coupled with the 200 million other health insured Americans. Caremark negotiates for 70 million lives, Medco for 54 million, and Express-Scripts for 51 million. Medicare Part D allows our Medicare beneficiaries to piggyback on that huge buying power with professional negotiators. And the other side would rather untrained government bureaucrats negotiate for my constituents? No thank you. 
   So let's look at the worst case scenario under this bill, where Medicare commands and controls seniors' medicine. 
   Yes, H.R. 4 seems to disallow formularies, but in law school they taught me to look closely at the law. Page 3, line 20: ``nothing ..... shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to establish or require a particular formulary.'' 
   But banning a national formulary does not protect beneficiaries from other government access controls to prescription drugs. For instance, the Medicaid program has no national formulary, however, it employs various strategies such as a ``preferred drugs list'' to limit access of medications. If beneficiaries want to receive a medication that is not on the preferred drug list, they must go through a lengthy and confusing authorization. 
   If the authors of H.R. 4 didn't have this in mind, why did they strike the underlying MMA language that would seem to protect against this, that said ``The Secretary may not require a particular formulary or institute a price structure for the reimbursement of covered part D drugs''? 
   The Ways and Means Chairman was thoughtful enough to hold a forum on this matter yesterday for our committee members, and both his and Mr. McCrery's invited witnesses agreed that to get VA prices, you have to set a formulary, and a strict one at that. 
   Again, the Democrats' bumper sticker slogan is fraught with bad consequences--intended or unintended. 
   Most importantly, the plan offered by Democrats would limit choice. Veterans have access to less than one third the drugs Medicare beneficiaries do--the VA formulary covers 1,300 drugs while the Medicare drug benefit covers 4,300 drugs. Drugs like Lipitor, Celebrex, Flomax, and Prevacid are unavailable in the VA plan. In fact, 20 of the top 33 most commonly prescribed drugs for seniors are excluded in the VA plan. 
   Pharmacy access is another pitfall of the Democrats' slogan. In reality, the VA distributes 80 percent of its medications by mail. Medicare uses mail for less than 2 percent of its medications. Seniors appreciate the opportunity to talk to their local pharmacist and ask questions about their prescriptions, and we have 1,077 pharmacies in Missouri where they can do just that. The VA has 6 pharmacies in the entire state of Missouri (and only 332 nationwide); the Democrat bumper sticker slogan loses a lot of its luster when looked at through that lens. 
   Simply put--seniors would find many of their favorite drugs unavailable and that's unacceptable. 
   The price control plan offered by the Democrat majority does not guarantee that seniors have access to ``all or substantially all'' drugs to treat cancer, mental illness, HIV/AIDS, and Lou Gehrig's disease. These important protections are in place in the current drug benefit and our motion to commit will offer the majority a chance to continue to protect drugs for these vulnerable populations. 
   While the plan being debated may be labeled ``price negotiation,'' it is more accurate to call it ``price fixing.'' Every time price fixing has been tried in other countries, it has failed. It has resulted in limited therapies and reduced innovation. And if the government saves the money from price fixing, the economic models show the cost will be shifted to the higher prices for the over 250 million non-Medicare Americans. In fact, the Democrat witness at yesterday's forum stated ``if Medicare gets a better price, some people will have to pay more.'' 
   It's an easy campaign slogan to say ``let Medicare negotiate low prices like the VA.'' But, to get there, you have to make that deal with the devil and allow Medicare to set prices and force strict formularies. 
   In conclusion, in attempting to fix an unbroken system, H.R. 4 faces the unintended consequence of either being lamely impotent at negotiating lower prices, or dangerously controlling by price fixing and restricting seniors access to drugs. Bad outcomes, whether intended or not; therefore, I urge a ``no'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. HULSHOF. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Madam Speaker, on November 19 of 1863, President Abraham Lincoln rose on the platform at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, following a 2-hour oration by Edward Everett, and gave a brief but very eloquent discourse that has become a prominent  part of our country's heritage. At the dedication of the Gettysburg National Cemetery he acknowledged, ``The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is, for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.'' 
   Can we find some poignancy today in those simple words uttered 7 score and 4 years ago? What is the unfinished work that confronts this body politic, and more to the point, does this resolution promulgated unilaterally by the majority advance the cause for freedom for which 3,000 of our countrymen have given the last full measure of devotion? 
   For all of these rhetorical meanderings that have occurred lo these many hours, the responsibility for the current state of affairs in Iraq rests squarely with the majority of Members who serve in this Congress of the United States. Back on December 17, 1998, do you recall House Resolution 612 which declared in pertinent part, ``Resolved, by the House of Representatives that ..... the Congress reaffirms that it should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power' and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.''' 
   I note that the gentleman who just spoke, along with 400 other Members of the Congress, supported that resolution as the policy of the United States, and thereafter in October of 2002, Congress, both the House and the Senate, approved the resolution approving the use of force and military action necessary to effectuate that policy of regime change. 
   Now, deposing the former dictator, in relative terms, was the easy part, yanking him from his hiding place, a hole in the ground. He eventually stood trial in the dock as a common accused, was judged by his countrymen according to the rule of law, and held to account for the brutality of his many crimes. 
   A second policy objective, promoting a democratic government has been the harder path, but though difficult, is it no less important? As my friend and colleague, my classmate from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) so passionately and persuasively annunciated yesterday, America has vital national interests in Iraq. 
   Does anyone argue the contrary? Can we not all agree that we must deny al Qaeda sanctuary in Iraq? Do we not further agree that Iraq must not be the source of instability in the Middle Eastern region? 
   Well, if we can agree on these points, can the majority make a legitimate case that this resolution accomplishes either of those important interests? President Bush recently nominated General David Petraeus as the new Commander of Multinational Forces in Iraq. Widely known as a brilliant tactician in the area of counterinsurgency, General Petraeus was unanimously confirmed by the other body. 
   Today, however, the majority desires to deny this extremely capable commander the means to accomplish his objective. Isn't it incumbent upon us, as Lincoln urged, to remain dedicated to the task remaining before us? Haven't many in this body expressed frustration that the Iraqi Government has put limitations on the rules of engagement of our troops in our field, not allowing our military to hunt down the enemy because insurgents had escaped to a safe haven in a region deemed off-limits by the Iraqi Government? 
   Well, isn't the majority party doing exactly the same thing half a world away with this resolution? Isn't denying military additional reinforcements deemed necessary by our generals in the field hampering our last best chance for success? 
   Two nights ago I was moved by the quiet eloquence of the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. McHugh) when he made the simple yet ironic observation: At no time in our Nation's history has this House considered a public rebuke of a sitting Commander in Chief for the manner in which a war has been conducted that Congress itself has authorized. 
   On that score alone, I find this resolution breathtaking in its audacity. If I may be allowed to paraphrase the Great Emancipator, it is true, the world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but the world will never forget what we do here. 
   I urge rejection of this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HULSHOF. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3540, the Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2007. As the gentleman, my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee, indicated, this bill is a 3-month extension of the excise taxes that currently fund the Airport and Airway trust fund. 
   Time is of the essence, as the Speaker knows, as these taxes are due to expire at the end of the month, and it is imperative that we do not cut off this source of funding that benefits our Nation's airports and the aviation community, as well as the tens of thousands of airline passengers. I see my colleague from Illinois nodding, and we shared a plane ride here moments ago. 
   In addition, there has been a lot of discussion about a way to reformulate the way we fund the trust fund. There have been some interesting ideas bandied about by different points of view. This temporary extension allows us that additional time to consider some fundamental reforms to the tax structure that finances the Airport and Airway trust fund and to spend some more time studying the NextGen air traffic control modernization proposal before we move towards conference with the Senate to consider FAA reauthorization. 
   As the gentleman from Michigan pointed out, this bill was reported out of our committee by voice vote. Since it extends to the end of the calendar year the existing taxes dedicated to the trust fund, there is no effect on revenues as we extend the current baseline. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
