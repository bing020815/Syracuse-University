   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you for your leadership on this subject and so many others. It's good to be with you tonight and many of my colleagues from around the country. 
   The American people are hurting. Young families are hurting, senior adults are hurting, small businesses are hurting. Energy prices are hurting us all. A family that rents cabins for a living in my district back in northeast Tennessee recently told me they have seen a 50 to 60 percent decrease in rentals during the past spring and summer. They told me that this decrease in rentals may force the family business to go into bankruptcy because they rely on tourists who travel to the beautiful mountains of northeast Tennessee. 
   Oil prices also affect the cost of many of our daily essentials. Here is just a small list of everyday items that rely on oil for their production. See if you use any of these products. We need oil. We need American oil. 
   Hearing aids, tennis rackets, eyeglasses, soft contact lenses, trash bags, glue, ballpoint pens, carpets, tires, artificial limbs, bandages, and dentures, to name just a few.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Very good points. And I represent a rural east Tennessee district that has a lot of farming as well. You make some good points. 
   You actually start, when you start to till the ground, you have to have diesel. The cost has gone up to the point where it's almost put some farmers out of business. Then you have to put fertilizer on the ground, if you can afford it. If you don't have the fertilizer, you don't make the product. So it really is hurting people from all backgrounds. 
   Families are canceling vacations. Police departments are cutting patrols. Small businesses are closing across America. Moms and dads are sitting around their kitchen tables trying to put a budget together to decide if they're going to be able to send their kids to school and buy the products that they need, all while the leadership here in Washington refuses an up-or-down vote on increasing American energy.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. If they will allow us to vote, I will vote ``yes.'' They may decide to vote ``no.'' But we need to be able to vote and vote the will of the American people. 
   We have 435 distinct, separate districts across America. Out of those 435, I'm sure some will vote ``no,'' some will vote ``yes,'' but it's really up to Speaker Pelosi to allow it to come to the floor for a vote. The American people sent us here to do a job.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. We're here tonight to ask the Democrat majority to let us take a vote on all-the-above, no more excuses. 
   You know, the interesting thing is we actually took a vote on the floor today. You know, we're here taking votes, 435 Members. We took a vote today to go home. So leadership's letting us take votes but just not on energy bills. I think that's a point that ought to be taken to the American people. They need to understand that we're taking votes. We're just not taking votes to increase the supply of energy. All of the above, wind, solar, coal, oil, drilling, natural gas, we're taking votes but not to increase energy. We're taking votes to go home for 5 weeks. That means for 5 weeks gasoline prices are going to be high back in northeast Tennessee. That's not what the American people look for.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I think I have an answer to that because I do believe there are some commonsense Democrats on this floor. This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democrat issue. This is an American issue. The only thing standing between us and the vote is Nancy Pelosi's Democrat leadership. I would call on the Democrat leadership to let us vote. Let Republicans vote. Let Democrats vote. Let them vote their conscience. Let them vote their district. 
   And I would, without a doubt, believe that we could go home on August 1, 48 hours from now, with an energy plan that would bring down prices at the pump because there's going to be some commonsense Democrats that will vote to make sure that moms and dads have some relief at the pump; young families have some relief at the pump; senior adults have some relief at the pump; small businesses have some relief at the pump. We need some relief at the pump.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I thank my friend from California. Thank you for your leadership tonight. Thank you for pointing out some of our spending and taxing waste. I would like to thank my colleagues that have spoken before me tonight. 
   I have been absolutely pleased with the group of freshmen Republicans that I came in with, a group of men and women that are very honorable, willing to work hard and do the right things. Thank you so much for serving with me in Washington. 
   I look back at one of my favorite Presidents, a President that was enjoyed by Republicans, conservative Democrats, independents, and that President was Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan once said, ``We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much.'' It goes right back to what we have been saying, spending then taxing. 
   There are many people sitting around their kitchen tables around America tonight trying to decide just how they are going to put their budget together, how they are going to make their car payment, how they are going to send Junior to school, Sissy to school, how they are going to pay for their health insurance. Those families are having to make hard decisions. The Government, this Congress could learn from those Americans sitting around kitchen tables. 
   I did come from the mountains of east Tennessee. Those people back in the mountains of east Tennessee have a lot of common sense. They have enough common sense to know that you can't spend more than you take in, and you can't tax people to death and expect success. That is exactly what this Congress is doing. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, the President's program of comprehensive tax reforms, President Bush's tax reforms and the congressional Republicans when they were in charge, those tax reliefs were well-timed to respond to a weak economy. My colleagues have spoken about it. We had terrorist attacks. We have had natural disasters. 
   That tax relief enacted in 2001 granted immediate tax rebates, reduced marginal tax rates, and lowered the marriage tax penalty. It actually allowed Americans to keep more of their money in their pocket so moms and dads can take care of their families. 
   My wife and I have two children. We fundamentally believe that we can take care of our children better than some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C. I think it's just common sense. I think there are many people across America, it doesn't matter what party you're part of, it doesn't matter if you're Republican, Democrat or independent, I have just got to feel that you believe you can spend your money better than Washington can as well. 
   Then, to go on, the tax relief of 2003 accelerated the much-anticipated and successful tax cuts of 2001. Those tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 actually strengthened our economy. The Republican tax relief has seen nearly 4 straight years of economic growth, while adding 7.5 million new jobs into our economy. That is the success that Michele Bachmann spoke about. 
   Things are going very well, and I am glad to see that. The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the tax cuts of 2003 helped boost Federal revenues by 68 percent. Again, it's not partisan. It works every time. When Democrat John F. Kennedy cut taxes, the tax increase into the Federal Government increased. The economy got  stronger. It happened when Reagan did it, and it happened when Bush did it. It is not partisan, it is just fact. 
   We must make the successful tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 permanent. If they are not made permanent, which I am convinced that this new hold-on-to-your-wallet Congress is not interested in doing, here's what will happen: 84 million women will see their taxes increase by $1,970. If you're female and you're listening to me, this Congress is going to raise your taxes by $1,970. Forty-eight million married couples will see their taxes increase by $2,726. Forty-two million families with children would see their tax bill go up $2,084. Twenty-six million small business owners would see a devastating $3,637 tax increase, the very small businesses that are creating the jobs in the economy. Five million low-income individuals and couples will no longer be exempt from individual income taxes. 
   We must make the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. Unfortunately, I am convinced that we will not see those tax cuts made permanent under the spending I see going on on the floor of this House. When we see those tax cuts start to be repealed, we are going to start to see the economic growth actually come to an end. 
   Washington Democrats have passed a fiscal blueprint that raises taxes by almost $400 billion on millions of Americans in one fell swoop. As part of their ill-gotten budget, taxpayers in Tennessee will not be allowed to deduct their sales tax from their Federal income tax. Taxes on small businesses, as I said earlier, will go up. The child tax credit will decrease from $1,000 to $500. The marriage penalty is coming back. 
   Residents of the First Congressional District in Tennessee's average tax expense is going up over $2,000. The definition of a small business will decrease from $400,000 to $200,000. Dividends will no longer be taxed at the personal gains rate, thereby increasing the double taxation on dividends by as much as 62 percent. 
   People all across America voted for change, but they are not getting the change that they wanted in the last election. Over the last quarter there were a couple of bills we have talked about and passed on this floor without my vote, and one of them was the energy bill. The energy bill that we passed had plenty of taxes, very little energy. 
   The Democrat majority in the energy bill actually decided to tax American oil producers at the level of 16 billion extra dollars. American oil producers. If we take the ability for American oil producers to produce oil, it makes us more dependent on foreign oil, on countries that hate us and hate our freedoms. I think that is the wrong direction for America. I don't think that is the change that the American people voted for. 
   Then we had the SCHIP bill. It sounds good, giving poor children health care. We all certainly want to do that. I am for continuing the program at its current level. But at the level that passed on this floor, the Heritage Institute said it will take 22 million new smokers to pay for the bill. Now, is there anyone in America that wants to see 22 million new children have to take up the habit of smoking to pay for a health care bill? 
   In addition to that, they decided that wouldn't be enough to pay for it so they actually added a tax on your health insurance premiums. So if you buy your own health insurance, your taxes will go up. 
   We have a choice between a bigger economy or bigger government. The majority party has made a choice. They are for bigger government. Congress has an approval rating down now to 11 percent, and I can certainly understand why we have such a low rating. We need to hold the line on spending, reduce earmarks, pass a line-item veto and crack down on worthless pork-barrel projects and be good stewards of the taxpayer. 
   Remember, Ronald Reagan once said: ``We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much.'' I think we need to start running Congress like the American family has to run their household budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT OF THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL CARRIAGE DRIVING MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House to join me in supporting House Resolution 1128, legislation that supports the goals and ideals of National Carriage Driving Month. 
   The origin of carriages can be traced to the Middle Ages when roads were extremely crude, and wooden carts offered an uncomfortable way to be transported. From the 16th century,  various types of vehicles were built with some rudimentary form of springs to create some comfort for passengers. The luxury of springs spurred the popularity and comfort of this mode of travel and mass production of carriages would begin in earnest. 
   As travel distances increased, the hooded carts were replaced with carriages with a roof and later with a closed cabin with doors and windows. Carriages were built for royalty, businessmen and merchants and commoners, often named after their function or shape. 
   When the technique of forging iron was developed in the 1800s, steel parts would replace leather springs. Industrially produced springs, axles and other metal parts improved the quality of the carriages leading into the 19th century, which was the golden age of the carriage. 
   The Industrial Revolution stimulated economic changes that added prosperity to the middle class, and they would ultimately become the driving force behind the purchase of carriages and the creation of carriage factories founded in cities throughout America and the rest of the world. Certainly, before the advent of the automobile, Americans enjoyed the horse-drawn carriage as a mode of transportation. Today, many people, including constituents of mine in east Tennessee, collect and restore the great vehicles as an avocation. Tens of thousands of Americans now enjoy this pursuit and millions more Americans enjoy their work in parades, shows and museums. 
   The month of May is often celebrated by the carriage community as carriage riding month, and this legislation supports the idea of a National Carriage Driving Month. These vehicles helped settle and build our Nation in its infancy, and this noncontroversial legislation celebrates the elegance and charm of a bygone era. 
   In closing, I am pleased that the House is considering this noncontroversial legislation celebrating a mode of transportation prior to the era of the automobile. I regret the House is not considering meaningful legislation to deal with our current energy crisis. With gas prices continuing to escalate, my friends in the carriage restoration and driving community may find themselves in demand once again. 
   I ask my colleagues to please support House Resolution 1128 and please support bringing meaningful energy legislation to the floor on which so many of my constituents of the First Congressional District of Tennessee are asking for action.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Thank you for your leadership and bringing this important debate. 
   And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to rise. One of my favorite people in Washington all through history was President Ronald Reagan. Most of us know that the anniversary of his birth was just this week; 96 years ago President Reagan was born. And he once said, we don't have a $1 trillion debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a $1 trillion debt because we spend too much. And I think that is important for this Congress to understand. I think that is a commonsense approach that the people of America can understand. It is about spending. It is not about taxing. We overspend, we don't overtax. I think that is very important. 
   As a matter of fact, if we continue on the pace that we have today, our revenues are outpacing us, and we continue to do that, we have our revenues outpace our spending over the next 5 years, President Bush's budget will be balanced by the year 2012, and we can do that without raising taxes. Now, to me, that is an exciting prospect to be able to balance the budget without raising taxes. And we do that at the same time maintaining the successful pro-business economic policies that we put in place. I think that is very important. And it is not just Republicans saying that. It is the Congressional Budget Office. It has actually given us data to support the data that we have in front of us. Just last week, the CBO supported the fact that tax cuts of 2003 helped boost the Federal revenues by 68 percent. Cut taxes, bring in more revenue, allow people across America and from the First District of Tennessee to keep more money in their pockets. As they do that, they spend it back in their districts. It circulates through the economy. It helps the Federal Government. You do it by keeping taxes low, not overtaxing. And we need to do that at the same time we keep fiscal restraint in place. Our economy has actually grown through 21 straight quarters. That is a good thing. We don't want to go back on that. We want to make sure that we stand strong, keep our tax cuts in place, keep our economy humming along and see that we could go from 21 straight quarters to 22 to 23 to 24. 
   In the period between 2004 and 2006, Federal tax revenues rose by the largest margin in 40 years. You do it by keeping taxes low, not by raising them. 
   Another exciting fact about our economy, the deficit has been cut in half 2 years ahead of schedule. And we did it by keeping taxes low. I think that is what the people of northeast Tennessee, good commonsense, hardworking people, want to have happen. Keep our taxes low. Let us keep the money in our district. Let us provide for our families. And as we do that, the economy will grow. As the economy grows, we take care of the Federal Government. 
   I think we need to look at government much like we look at a family sitting around a family table back in east Tennessee. People do have tight budgets. Unlike the Federal Government, though, people back in east Tennessee have to make tough decisions. When they have a tough budget, they can't say, well, I will just go out and raise my taxes and have somebody send me some more money so I can spend more. What they do in east Tennessee and across America is they have to make decisions about, well, I can't spend as much as I used to. And if we continue to do the right things, they will have that money back home. 
   The President, once again, in his budget is calling for making the 2001 and the 2003 tax relief provisions permanent. The administration projects total revenue growth to grow 5.4 percent per year if we keep those tax cuts in place. 
   Tax cuts are critical to maintaining our present healthy economy. We simply have a choice. We have a choice of a bigger economy or bigger government. That is the choice we have. And I certainly hope that my colleagues here on the House floor will understand how important it is to allow people back home to keep more of their money and keep government small and allow families to take care of themselves. 
   To reach the goal of a balanced budget, we need to hold the line on spending. We need to reduce earmarks. And I think we need to pass line item vetoes to crack down on worthless pork barrel spending. I don't think the Congress has done a good enough job on that. 
   I know there was a bill passed just last week and said there was no earmarks. Well, reading through the data, I am from east Tennessee, and I didn't realize we had a rainforest in Iowa. That is interesting for me to know. I didn't study that back in school in east Tennessee. Maybe someone else can explain that to me when they get up to speak. But that is an earmark that was in the resolution that passed last week. 
   We are being disingenuous with the American people. And the American people are smart. They will catch on to  what is going on. They will not be fooled. 
   Another thing that I heard before I came over, I was sitting in my office, and I heard the other side speaking. And they talked about the Medicare cuts and what we are doing to health care. The reality is, under President Bush's budget, Medicare will grow 5.6 percent. Now, back in east Tennessee, that is not a cut. That is a growth of 5.6 percent in Medicare. So please, do not be fooled. Do not be fooled. There is not a rainforest in Iowa, and Medicare is not being cut. 
   I think if people continue to use common sense, they will support the Congress. They want the Congress to do the right thing. It goes right back to what Ronald Reagan said. We don't have a $1 trillion debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a $1 trillion debt because we spend too much. And I ask my colleagues to make sure we don't spend too much in this Congress. Thank you for allowing me to take part.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, here we are again. Another week has gone by, and we are still discussing the Iraq emergency supplemental. The Democrats were successful in forwarding a strategy of cut and run, knowing the entire time their strategy would be vetoed by the President. 
   It is an ill-conceived idea to state you support the troops on the one hand while on the other hand you push forward with legislation that you know has no chance of gaining the President's support. I believe the Democrat leadership owes the American people an explanation of why they would do this. 
   Time is up and the Democrats need to come back to the realization that our troops don't deserve to be caught in the political mess between the radical left and the rest of the Democrat Party. It is time for a clean supplemental to come to the floor so that we can send the President a bill that supports our troops without handcuffing our generals and withdrawing our troops before this critical mission is complete.

   Tennessee is known as the Volunteer State because we have consistently been willing to go and to serve. There are approximately 70,000 veterans in the First District of Tennessee. My district is also the home of the James H. Quillen VA Medical Center, a 500-bed teaching medical facility located in northeast Tennessee. 
   Veterans possess special qualities and skills such as a strong work ethic, training, discipline, and dedication to make the ideal candidates for employment. Our dedicated men and women have sacrificed so much for us. Now it is our turn to support them.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, KEVIN. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your friendship. 
   You know, we have been here almost a year now, and as I look at my fellow freshmen, I feel blessed to represent the American people with some of the best people that I know, good people that are willing to come here and work hard and try to get things done for the American people. 
   I grew up in the mountains of east Tennessee. My dad has got a sixth grade education. I was able to start a business. I was able to succeed. I was able to serve in the Tennessee legislature. It just goes to show that in America, you can do whatever you want to do. 
   Henry Ford once said, ``If you think you can or if you think you can't, you are right.'' That is common sense. If you go out there and you make things happen and you are willing to work hard, good things will happen for you. Henry Ford knew it. Teachers know it all across America, moms and dads and all across America. 
   We live in a blessed Nation. As a matter of fact, it even talks about that in the Bible. In Psalms 33:12, it says ``Blessed is the nation whose god is the Lord.'' We are a blessed people, and I feel very blessed to represent the people of northeast Tennessee back in my beloved mountains where common sense reigns, American values reign. 
   You know, we are in America today and we are in an America where we spend too much money. Ronald Reagan understood this. When Ronald Reagan was President, he once said, ``We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we don't tax enough. We have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.'' And I can tell you, Ronald Reagan would not have been pleased with this Congress this year because we have certainly, under the majority rule, they tried their best at every turn to find a way, a new way, to tax the American people.     
   There are moms and dads sitting around the kitchen table all over this great country trying to put a budget together. They are trying to put a budget together to decide how they are going to take care of their kids, how they are going to buy gas for their automobile, how they are going to pay their heating oil bill, how they are going to pay for college for the next generation, how they are going to save for retirement, how they are going to provide for their health care costs that keep increasing day in and day out. 
   The American people are looking for leadership. And when this new majority took over last year, they promised open, accountable, transparent government that was going to get results for the American people. Well, the results that this Congress has brought about, actually, over the last week or two have started to come back to some common sense. It took them about 50 weeks to get there, the longest in history; but finally they are starting to come back and going to pass some bills that cut their spending by about $20 billion. Thank goodness we had a President that said, I am going to veto if you spend too much. Thank goodness we had a minority party who stood up and said you are not going to spend too much money. 
   Moms and dads across America can spend their money better than a Congress. Moms and dads know the answer of how to raise their kids better than a  bureaucrat in Washington that has never met those kids. 
   This majority has failed the American people right up to the last week or so. The majority failed to pass 11 out of 12 appropriation bills. 
   Funding for this Congress and for this government actually ended back in October, and here we are on the eve of Christmas and we are still waiting to put the final touches on a budget that should have been done back in October. You couldn't do that back home in east Tennessee. You can't do that in any city in America. You have got to use common sense and you have got to pay your bills on time. 
   MICHELLE talked a moment ago about the majority has failed to protect the taxpayer with the AMT fix. You see, no leadership, no results. And that is basically where we are at. If the AMT is not fixed this week, it will leave 23 million taxpayers owing more money and not bringing their refunds home the way they expect. It will be a tax increase on the middle class. No leadership, no results. 
   Then, you look at the energy bill that has been talked about all year. Finally passed one this week. It is amazing, you get to the 11th hour of the 11th month and you finally start to pass some of these bills. But an energy bill that basically had everything in it except energy. We had an energy bill that had regulations, we had an energy bill that had taxes, and we had an energy bill that had no energy. No leadership, no results. And we are certainly seeing that today. 
   Then we had a majority party that has tried their best to do everything they can to make sure that the troops didn't receive the funding that they deserve. I went over to Iraq and spent time with the men and women in uniform, and there are young men and women over there that the American people would be very proud of. They want to be there; they volunteered to be there. They want to come home, but they want to come home in success, not in failure. 
   We have a majority party that actually had a leadership back in the spring that said: we failed. I can tell you, I can tell my colleagues, we have not failed. America has not failed. Ronald Reagan also used to say when he said tear down that wall, he said they lose, we win. I would hate to be in a situation in this war where we have to look back and say, we lost, they won. And we won't do that if we protect our men and women in uniform. And we can do that. As a matter of fact, there is a bill on the Senate floor tonight to make sure that funding is available for our men and women in uniform across the globe, not just part of the globe, but across the globe. See, if you have no leadership, you have no results. 
   And then the majority party has talked about health care, probably one of the most pressing issues facing the American family today. We talk about a need to fix health care, but we have not seen it in this Congress. The American people demand the ability to be able to go out and afford and feel reasonably comfortable that their children, themselves, and their moms and dads are going to receive the health care that they need. And there are solutions to those problems, but you have to have leadership to get results. No leadership, no results. 
   Then the cost of energy. When this majority party took over, it was interesting. if you look back, they said: the Republicans have left us in a lurch. Our cost of energy is skyrocketing. If you will give us the opportunity to lead, we are going to lower the cost of energy. When the Republicans gave up the majority in January, oil was $56 a barrel. Now it is $90 a barrel or thereabouts. $56 to about $90 a barrel. That is going in the wrong direction. Again, no leadership, no results. 
   The American people want us to come together, work as a team, and work on these issues, health care, energy, funding our troops so we can win, taking care of immigration, building the fence, making sure we have a secure Nation, making sure that we have an education system where our children can feel reasonably sure that they can go out and get the education they need. That is the type of leadership we need. That is the type of leadership that was promised for the most honest and ethical and open Congress ever. I am still waiting. 
   Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be with you.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. If you look at the 9,000 earmarks that are in there, special projects, the one that leaps out to me and leaps out to the people of northeast Tennessee is over a million-dollar hippie museum in New York. That is not the way the people of east Tennessee want to spend their hard-earned money. There are better ways to spend money in Tennessee and across this great land. 
   As I said earlier, moms and dads are really trying to figure out how they are going to take care of their kids. They don't need Members of Congress or bureaucrats in Washington trying to spend their money on hippie museums in New York. They need to know they can fill up their tank with gas and be able to afford it. Or be able to take the kids out for a meal and be able to afford it. Or be able to afford a month's worth of energy to keep their kids warm. Or be able to buy health care and be able to afford it. Or know that they have a Congress that is going to take care of illegal immigration because they are worried that a country that is not secure is not long to be a country. 
   Those are the things that the American people are concerned about. They are not concerned about trying to have special pork barrel projects to help a Member of Congress get reelected. They are concerned about making sure that their family is taken care of. That is what we ought to be concerned about. That is what I think the freshmen Republicans came here to do. 
   I started off tonight by saying I am blessed to be able to stand on the House floor of the United States Congress.     
   Come from humble beginnings back in the mountains of east Tennessee and be able to come here and represent just some commonsense American values, and that's what the American people want.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you for yielding time. 
   It's interesting that we stand here and talk about public transportation. I represent northeast Tennessee, a rural area, and I tell you the people who live in northeast Tennessee don't have access to public transportation. 
   People in rural America are hurting. Young families are hurting. Senior adults are hurting. Small businesses are hurting. Sheriffs' departments and police departments are hurting. 
   Let me tell you about two groups. The first is Vern Long. Vern lives in Jefferson County, Tennessee. I met with him last Saturday when I was back home in the district. Vern is an Iraqi war veteran. He has a wife and a child. He lives in Jefferson County and drives to Knoxville, Tennessee to work every day. He makes $8 an hour. He's an apprentice electrician. He wants to go on to be an electrician. He has to drive into Knoxville, and it costs him $90 a week, $90 a week to fill up his tank. He told me, ``Congressman, if the Congress doesn't pass an energy bill to bring these gas prices down, I may have to go on welfare and quit my job. And I want to protect my family. I want to be there to protect my future.'' 
   Let me tell you about Sheriff Steve Burns. Sheriff Burns is from Greene County, Tennessee. I met with him last Saturday. He told me he put his budget together for Greene County this past February and March. He said, if it passes in the county commission as he presented it, he will be $50,000 in the hole because of high gas prices. 
   Public transportation bills to send bureaucrats to work in Washington will not help rural America. America is hurting. We need an energy policy. We don't need more excuses, and we don't need more bills that make it sound good and look like we're trying to do something here. We need an energy that actually uses American oil, natural gas, coal-to-liquid technology,  clean coal technology. We need to use nuclear power. Yes, we need green energy. We need all of the above. The American people are demanding action, real action, not excuses from Washington. 
   Please, I beg the majority. Let's take this burden of high gas prices off of people like Vern Long and off of sheriffs' departments like Sheriff Steve Burns'. Let's pass some real energy legislation. No more excuses.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (EDUCATION: THE QUALITY OF OUR NATION'S SCHOOLS -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. McKeon. Thank you for your leadership in the committee. 
   No Child Left Behind was signed into law before I was elected to Congress. It was signed into law in 2002 with the intent of increasing the overall achievement of students in elementary and secondary schools. 
   As written, the law requires the following: Annual assessments in math and reading in grades 3 through 8 and once in high school; reports on overall achievement and progress made by different groups of students; school accountability; high quality teachers in every classroom; increased parent information and choice; and State achievement standards and testing. 
   This law has far-reaching implications. I wanted to hear from the people both directly and indirectly involved with No Child Left Behind, also known as NCLB, so last year I held a roundtable discussion on NCLB in my district. Participants included parents, teachers, school superintendents, school board members, members of the business community and Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the House Education and Labor Committee and the State and Federal departments of education. Most people agreed that No Child Left Behind 
   is working, but reforms are necessary. 
   As I came to Washington, I found Washington is the only place where when something is supposed to expire, it doesn't expire. It just continues to move on. No Child Left Behind should have been reauthorized last year. It has not come up for reauthorization yet, and I think that should happen. 
   Many important issues were raised during my town hall meetings. A few of the main concerns were schools and school districts making adequate yearly progress, or AYP; meeting the teacher qualifications as set forth by No Child Left Behind; and the impact that special education students and Limited English Proficient students are having on local schools and school districts. 
   There are a lot of people with a lot of common sense back in the mountains of East Tennessee. Most teachers in my district believe they should be held accountable. That is just common sense. But it is like a three-legged stool. You can't only hold a teacher accountable and expect to get good results. It is like a three-legged stool. Teachers need to be held accountable, but also you need moms and dads to be involved in the education of their students, and also you need the students to become involved and work hard to make a difference. It really doesn't matter how good the teacher is. If you don't have moms and dads and the student involved, you will still get poor results. Teachers need to teach, not parent. 
   Ideally you will have a good teacher, you will have parents that are involved, and a student who is willing to work hard. While this isn't always the case, we must do everything we can in our power to see that it is there for most children. We need to continue to move every child forward, and bring those in the lower end of the percentile forward, but without holding those at the higher end back. 
   Students must be challenged and encouraged to learn. Students should not be counted in several subgroups. For instance, one child may be in both the English as a second language and children with special needs categories. Every student should be moving forward, but not every child can get to the same point. Most students can get from point A to point Z, but there are some students, special needs students come to mind, that may only go from A to B to C. They all should be moving forward, but you have to use some common sense when you pass legislation. 
   Also the way graduation rates are calculated need to be reviewed. People who decide to make the effort to go back to school and get their GED should be included in the graduation rates. 
   Let me give you an example. I have a school in my district in Hawkins County, Tennessee, that only had eight graduating students, eight students in their 12th grade. Four of those students received college scholarships. Doesn't that sound amazing? You have 50 percent of your students receiving college scholarships. However, one student dropped out, so now you have seven students and four students out of seven receiving college scholarships. So fully half of that class received scholarships. But one student didn't graduate, and because of that and the small number of students in Clinch School back in Hawkins County, Tennessee, that school is considered a failing school. 
   We need to reauthorize No Child Left Behind, and we need to fix some of these problems that I have mentioned tonight. Graduation rates, GED, English as a second language, those are some of the things that I hear that need to be fixed as we move forward into reauthorizing No Child Left Behind. These problems are fixable, and  we need to fix them soon. We need to address these problems and reauthorize No Child Left Behind quickly. 
   Thank you for yielding your time, and I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I would like to thank my friend from Texas for recognizing me. 
   I would like to thank my colleague down on the floor, who is just taking the chart down now. His chart actually makes a very good point, the price of oil has doubled in the last year. I hope they use that chart often. 
   The issue that's facing the American people right now is our dependence on foreign oil and our gas prices. Energy is the foundation and the lifeblood of the American economy, creating the conditions that help us support good-paying jobs here in the United States and allowing our industrial base to compete with the rest of the world. 
   We all know that middle class families, such as those that I represent in northeast Tennessee, are feeling significant pain at the pump. But the American family isn't the only place where the strains of spiking fuel prices can be felt. According to the recent news reports, local schools, law enforcement agencies and other community services are paying the price of these record-high oil prices. 
   Unfortunately, Democrats in the House have been consistent in offering so-called energy legislation that weakens our ability to compete with emerging titans such as China, India and Russia. In the United States today, we're 63 percent dependent on foreign sources of oil, and that percentage is growing ever year. Gasoline prices have increased more than $1 per gallon since the majority took control of the House last year, as the last chart indicated, increasing from a nationwide average of $2.33 per gallon on the first day of the 110th Congress to now well over $3.50 per gallon. 
   Not only has the majority party failed to end our reliance on Middle Eastern oil for essential energy, they have actually helped grow our independence to historic and dangerous new levels all because of their refusal to allow for responsible energy production here at home. We need to use American energy. 
   What we need is no more excuses. We need an energy policy that allows for the use of American energy now. We need to drill for oil in ANWR and off the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to use our abundant coal supplies through clean coal technology. We  need to create safe nuclear power plants. We need to build new refineries. And we need to expand green energy, yes, green energy initiatives, like switch grass, wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power. 
   We cannot tax and regulate ourselves into prosperity, and that's exactly the energy policies that have come out of this Congress. You cannot tax and regulate yourself into prosperity. We have to have an energy policy that actually has energy. 
   The American middle class deserves better. They deserve an energy policy that is dependent on American energy, not foreign energy. Therefore, I recommend a ``no'' vote on the rule on the floor today so we can continue to talk about what is important to the American people, lowering the cost of energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my  friend from Ohio for yielding and for his leadership. 
   I come from the mountains of east Tennessee. We have a lot of common sense in those mountains. We understand when you spend $3.2 billion, that's a lot of money. We have men and women all around America right now sitting around their kitchen tables trying to decide just exactly how they are going to feed their children, how they are going to take care of their families, how they are going to pay the tuition and buy that next tank of gas. 
   We talked about in the last election that we are going to be providing a change here in Washington. I believe the freshmen Republicans that came into Congress with me this year are here to offer that change. The way we offer that change is quit spending as much as has been spent in the past. We can do that. 
   When we have an economy growing about 3 percent and this bill is going to grow by 6 or 7 percent, people understand you can't grow government at twice the rate of the American family's income. It just can't be done. We need to make sure that we use some commonsense when we put these budgets together. We can't spend more money than the American people can earn. 
   I think the American people did send us here to Washington to rein in that spending, get a handle on our fiscal House. I think this amendment by my friend from Ohio will go a long way towards doing that. This is not about a cut. This is simply about holding the line on spending. 
   The American people can understand if they have $100 this year and somebody wants to grow it to $200 next year but you can't afford it, and you say, ``I can't give you $200, but I will let you keep your $100,'' if you kept that at $100, that is not a cut. That is staying the same. That is what this amendment does. This simply says we are not going to grow that $3.2 billion. 
   I thank the gentleman for his amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I'm here tonight to speak a little bit about energy process. 
   Unfortunately, some folks here in the Congress seem to think that we can tax our pick-up trucks and our cars from empty to full. Just recently, a congressman proposed a 50-cent tax increase on gasoline. You heard me correct, an extra 50 cents added to each gallon. Someone actually proposed that here in the House of Representatives. 
   I would say that 99 percent of my constituents don't want another 50 cents in taxes added to their gasoline prices. That 50-cent tax increase would put gas at around $4.12 cents per gallon. 
   If you would like to effectively cripple the families and small businesses across the United States and back in my First District of Tennessee, a 50-cent tax increase would do just that. Madam Speaker, that just doesn't make any sense to me. 
   What we need is some east Tennessee commonsense, along with another lesson from the 8th grade civics class and economic classes. When demand is high, supply is low, then energy prices will be outrageous. That's exactly what we see today. How do you bring down energy prices? 
   Eighth grade economics: create a bigger supply. How do you create a bigger supply of energy? No more excuses. First, we need to stop making excuses. We need an energy policy that allows us to use American energy. We need to drill for oil in ANWR and off the Outer Continental Shelf. We need to use fuel sources in Colorado and North Dakota, just to name a few. We need to use our abundant coal supply through the use of clean coal technology. We need to create safe nuclear power plants and we need to build new refineries. No more excuses. And we need to expand our green energy initiatives like switchgrass, wind power, solar power and hydroelectric power. 
   We don't need an energy piece; we need an energy policy. You can't take one part of an energy policy and call it a policy. I'm all for green energy, but green energy will only get you to about 6 percent of our energy needs in America. That only leaves 94 percent. We need an energy policy. 
   Right now, there is a limited supply of oil being imported into the United States by countries who hate us and hate our freedoms. We're at the mercy of these countries. My family, your family, small businesses across America and the families in the First District of Tennessee are all at the mercy of countries who hate us and hate our freedoms. 
   A sound energy policy that explores new green initiatives, while investing in American energy sources, is what we need and we need it now. Not another tax increase, not another regulation, not another restriction that some people believe would help fill up our pick-up trucks and our automobiles. We need a common-sense energy policy. No more excuses.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN EAGLE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1247, a bill I introduced, to support the goals and ideals of June 20 as American Eagle Day. The bill also highlights the successful recovery story of the American bald eagle, the official national emblem of the United States. 
   The American bald eagle has been a part of American culture for hundreds of years. In 1782, the Second Continental Congress established that the bald eagle was the official emblem of the United States because of its uniqueness to North America. It can be seen on the United States seals in public buildings, schools, and even here in the House Chamber. Over the years, the bald eagle has become a living symbol of the United States spirit, freedoms, and continual pursuit of excellence. 
   Mr. Speaker, just 45 years ago the United States had only about 400 nesting pairs of the American bald eagle. Through conservation, education and careful planning, today we have seen a significant rise to about 7,000 nesting pairs of the American bald eagle. 
   Because of the successful recovery exhibited by the American bald eagle, the Department of the Interior has taken the bald eagle off both the endangered and threatened species list. The bald eagle has been a national symbol, and its recovery has been a national success story. 
   H.R. 1247 will not only honor the now thriving American bald eagle, it will also encourage support of the United States Mint bald eagle commemorative coin program which has been a success for the past few years. Currently, this coin program has raised over $5 million for the American Eagle Foundation, which is located in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which is located in my district. 
   The American Eagle Foundation is a successful not-for-profit organization seeking to protect and fully restore the bald eagle population across North America. They also care for the injured and orphaned birds that have a strong environmental presence through educating thousands of families who visit Pigeon Forge, Tennessee each year. 
   Furthermore, this bill encourages school systems, businesses, governmental agencies and conservation groups to share information on the American bald eagle that will benefit children and schools across our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 1247, a bill I introduced to support the goals and ideals of June 20 as American  Eagle Day, and celebrate the recovery and restoration of this great bird, the bald eagle, the national symbol of the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Forbes. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to be with you. 
   I rise tonight in support of H.R. 888. 
   Psalm 33:12 says, ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.'' It doesn't say, ``Blessed is the nation whose God was the Lord,'' and there's a difference. Our Founding Fathers understood the difference. As has been stated before, you can see it all through these hallowed Chambers. Above the Speaker's dais you will see the words, ``In God we trust.'' Unfortunately, on TV at times you don't see the words ``In God We Trust,'' they cut just a little bit below that. You will see Moses in full array in the back of the Chamber. 
   This building, the Capitol of the United States, was actually used for church services in its early history. Out in the Rotunda, you will see many beautiful paintings. The first one you come to in the Rotunda you will actually see Pocahontas, that you will remember from Thanksgiving. Well, Pocahontas, in the painting, is actually depicted right after she changed her name to Rebecca when she became a Christian and was baptized. Our Founding Fathers understood our Christian Nation and our Christian heritage. 
   And President James Buchanan understood this completely when he issued a proclamation in 1860 entitled ``Humiliation, Fasting and Prayer.'' And he's quoted, ``In this, the hour of our calamity and peril, to whom shall we resort for relief but to the God of our Fathers? His omnipotent arm only can save us from the awful effects of our own crimes and follies, of our own ingratitude and guilt towards our Heavenly Father.'' It certainly sounds to me like President James Buchanan understood ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord.'' 
   We understand today that America isn't great because we have a large government. We're great because down through history, if we had a problem, we turned to God first and then we turned to our neighbors, not to a big government. And if we want to continue to be that great Nation, we need to look to II Chronicles 7:14, which says, ``If my people, who are called by My name, shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from 
   their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.'' 
   We need healing in our land.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for offering this amendment. Any time we can save $1.2 million, I think we ought to do it. 
   We have Americans sitting across our great fruited plain tonight listening to this debate. They've just gotten up from their dinner tables, trying to make decisions on how they can balance their own budgets. 
   When we first came to Congress, I'm a new Member of Congress. I came out of the Tennessee Legislature. When we came here, we talked about open government and transparency, and we're going to be the most honest government in Congress ever; also talked about gas prices are going to be brought down rather than go up. Those are just some of the things that were promised. 
   Well, American families are sitting around their dinner tables tonight trying to decide how they're going to balance their own budget, and they're looking to us here in the Congress to make sure that we don't put an extra burden on them by raising their taxes and raising these appropriation requests. 
   I came to the Congress out of the Tennessee Legislature, as I said, and I was known for open government and transparency. That's one of the ways I was able to win my election. And that's exactly what people want in this Congress. They want a Congress that they can feel good about, that we're going to be honest with them and we're going to spend their tax dollars wisely. 
   Ronald Reagan once said, we don't have a $1 trillion debt because we don't tax enough. We have a $1 trillion debt because we spend too much. And anything we can do to help control those tax dollars and that spending is exactly what we need to do. 
   We need that transparency and that accountability as we move forward, and we don't need secret slush funds. We don't need to come in after we pass bills, later on, and then drop in pieces of legislation called earmarks. That was another promise that was made during the last elections, that those would be open and transparent. We don't need to drop those in later, where the American people don't have an understanding. 
   They understand they've got to make their house payments. They understand they've got to fill up their vehicles and their cars with this gas that was going to have lower gasoline prices. They understand that. But they certainly need to understand, as well, what we're voting on. We need to be open and accountable. 
   It's interesting to me, just looking back at some of the things that were said by the Democrat leadership. Back on September 14 of 2006, the Speaker of this House said, this is a place where we really need to throw up the shades and pull back the curtains. We have to have the fullest possible disclosure. It has to be on earmarks and appropriations and authorizations and on taxation, and it has to be across the board with no escape hatches. 
   Well, I stand in support of this amendment, so we can make sure that we throw up the shades and make sure that we're held accountable. 
   I'd like, again, to thank the gentlelady from North Carolina for her leadership on this amendment. 
   And with that, I'd like to yield my time to the gentlelady from North Carolina.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2637, the Child Labor Protection Act of 2007, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. I appreciate the work of Chairman Miller and Chairwoman WOOLSEY, as well as the gentleman from California (Mr. McKeon) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson) in crafting this legislation. 
   There is no one more vulnerable in our workforce than its youngest members. While the employment of young workers is essential to instilling in them the work ethic and the value of a dollar, their collective safety must be the highest priority of our Nation's employers and, indeed, the Nation as a whole. 
   With this in mind, the measure before us would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act by increasing to $50,000 the civil penalty for any type of child labor violation that causes a death or serious injury of an employee under the age of 18. The current maximum civil penalty is $11,000, and it is low by any reasonable estimation. So this update is both prudent and necessary. 
   Moreover, the legislation would allow the $50,000 penalty to be doubled up to a maximum of $100,000 for the willful and repeat violations that cause the death or serious injury of any child employed in violation of the Federal child labor standards. Once again, such an increase is both prudent and necessary. 
   The measure before us is essential for the continuation of the Department of Labor's ongoing focus on workplace safety for youth, and I commend President Bush for his work in this issue. 
   Earlier this year, the Department submitted draft legislation similar to H.R. 2637, and before that, the Department proposed new labor standards rules to cover nonagricultural occupations for employment of 14- and 15-year-olds, as well as occupations that place the well-being of employees under 18 years of age at risk. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are making undeniable, bipartisan progress on updating our child labor laws. As the Bush administration continues its work, the Child Labor Protection Act would provide it with additional tools to address serious child labor violations, decrease repeat occurrences and strengthen the overall enforcement of critical child labor laws. 
   Again, I thank my colleagues for their work on this measure and urge passage of this bill in the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   MR. HARE. Mr. Speaker at this time I am honored to yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), the sponsor of this very important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS IN THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, as a proud father of two, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 474, recognizing the immeasurable contribution of fathers in the healthy development of  children, supporting responsible fatherhood, and encouraging greater involvement of fathers in the lives of their children, especially on Father's Day. 
   William Shakespeare wrote, ``It is a wise father that knows his own child.'' The truism of these words is exceedingly relevant today. The presence of two committed, involved parents contributes directly to better academic performance, reduced substance abuse, less crime and delinquency, fewer emotional and other behavioral problems, less risk of abuse and neglect and lower risk of teen suicide. 
   The research is clear: Fathers factor significantly in the lives of their children. There is simply no substitute for the love, involvement and commitment of a responsible father. 
   The fathers of yesteryear thought that merely being a good provider meant that they were good fathers. Fathers today have the responsibility to set aside quality time for their children in ways that may contribute to happy memories that last a lifetime. Fathers realize that their time with children is really an investment in them. 
   Being an involved father is good for children and good for fathers. And while each father is a unique person who parents in his own way and style, there are some characteristics that good fathers have in common. Good fathers are involved in the lives of their children. They attend their children's school events, games and activities. They also involve their children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to see the workplace, taking them along when the car needs to be repaired or involving them in decisions that affect the family.     
   Good fathers set limits and are firm. They let their children know their beliefs and expectations but rely on explanations and reasoning rather than force. Indeed, today's lifestyles are changing. More and more fathers are effectively balancing their personal, work, and family times. Both children and fathers are realizing the importance of the father's role, and there are ever-increasing amounts of research being conducted on the father's role in today's families. These findings document the importance of the father's role, the profound influence of fathers in children's growth and development, and the characteristics that good fathers have in common. 
   Fathers play a significant role in shaping the character of their children. By spending time with their sons and daughters, being stern yet fair disciplinarians, and listening to their experiences, fathers mold and shape their children into the men and women they will become. As advisers and role models, fathers help their children to understand the difference between right and wrong and to recognize how the decisions they make today can affect the rest of their lives. Fathers instill important values that prepare their children for the challenges and opportunities ahead by demonstrating true leadership. Their love and devotion inspire the future generation of Americans to achieve their dreams and demonstrate the true spirit of our country. 
   A father is one of the most important influences in a child's life. On Father's Day and every day, we honor our fathers and celebrate the special bond between a father and a child. I am honored to rise today in support of this resolution and in honoring all of our fathers for the roles that they play and for the love they give. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 266. This resolution would recognize the important work of our Nation's social workers and support the goals and ideals of Professional Social Worker Month and World Social Worker Day. 
   Social work is a profession for those with a strong desire to help improve people's lives and play a valuable role in the Nation's health care system. Social workers help people function the best way they can in their environment, deal with their relationships, and solve personal and family problems. 
   Social workers often see clients who face life-threatening disease or social problems such as inadequate housing, unemployment, a serious illness, a disability, or substance abuse. Social workers also assist families that have serious domestic conflicts, sometimes involving a child or spousal abuse. 
   For example, child, family and school social workers provide social services and assistance to improve the social and psychological functioning of children and their families and to maximize the family well-being and academic functioning of children. They assist single parents, arrange adoption, or help find foster homes for neglected, abandoned or abused children. 
   In schools, they address problems such as teenage misbehavior and truancy and advise teachers on how they can cope with problem students. Social workers also specialize in services for senior citizens, running support groups for family caregivers or for the adult children of aging parents, advising elderly people or family members about choices in areas such as housing, transportation, and long-term care and coordination and monitoring of these services. 
   Through employee assistance programs, they may help workers cope with job-related pressures or with personal problems that affect the quality of their work. 
   Medical and public health social workers provide persons, families, and vulnerable populations with psychosocial support needed to cope with chronic, acute and terminal illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer. They also assess and treat individuals with mental illness or substance abuse, including abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. They also may help plan for supportive services to ease patients' return into the community. 
   In my State of Tennessee, we have a long tradition of recognizing the vital role of social workers. In 2005, the Tennessee legislature, of which I was honored to serve as a member for many years, passed important legislation which required social workers to have received a B.S. or master's degree in social work from an accredited school, received a doctorate or Ph.D. in social work, or have a specialized certificate or license from the State. 
   As a society, we have come to trust that the people using a certain title have completed specific training to prepare them for their work in assisting the public. Thanks to this legislation, Tennessee now ensures that positions requiring the skills and training of professional social workers are filled with fully qualified professionals. 
   In addition, the East Tennessee State University Department of Social Work has a long and proud history of preparing the majority of social workers in the region that I represent. In addition to providing high-quality education to future social workers, the Department hosts a Social Work Career Day where students, community agencies and practitioners come together and share educational experience and information on a career in social work. Students and faculty are also involved in a number of community based interdisciplinary learning and service activities. 
   According to the United States Department of Labor, the need for additional social workers is expected to increase faster than the average of all other occupations through the year 2014 due to the rapidly growing elderly population which is expected to create greater demand for health and social careers. The growth in social work is expected to occur most rapidly in home health care services, assisted living and senior living communities and the school setting. In addition, there is expected to be a significant need for those social workers specializing in substance abuse. 
   Nearly 50 percent of the United States population, age 15 to 54, report having at least one psychiatric disorder. Both severe and persistent mental disorders, including addictions, have profound consequences for individuals, their families and society, affecting their ability to learn, to grow into healthy adults and to nurture children, to work and secure housing and to engage in other routines of living. Recognizing the prevalence of mental disorders and the cost they exact on our society, social workers provide more than 40 percent of all mental health services available to Americans, making them an integral part of our Nation's health care delivery system. 
   So we stand here to recognize the importance of our Nation's social workers and support the Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day. We also stand to encourage more young adults to seek out educational and professional opportunities as social workers where they can play a positive impact on changing people's lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in highlighting the contributions of social workers and to support House Resolution 266. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   Congressman Price, you do such a great job. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your willingness to spread the truth. 
   I welcome the opportunity to speak to Americans on tax day. I know some of us, as we draw near to midnight here, a lot of people still working on those forms, trying to get them down to the post office. It reminds me of what Ronald Reagan said back in the early 1980s. Ronald Reagan said, ``We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much.'' That seems like commonsense to me, and I think the people that are listening to us tonight understand that. They understand they have to sit around the kitchen table and decide how much money is coming in and how much money goes out. 
   Small business owners have to do the same thing. They sit around sometimes at a little break room table and decide, am I going to hire that next person or am I going to have to lay somebody off? Am I going to be able to afford another machine to be more productive so I can grow the business and be good for the economy? We understand that as Americans. 
   Today, tax day, families across America are feeling the cost of the Federal Government. I know we feel it. I know the American people are feeling it. It is one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress. I did own a small business, and I have actually owned a couple. I grew up in a small community in a little county called Unicoi County in East Tennessee, up in the mountains near North Carolina. And I worked my way through college. I actually worked two jobs, went to school full time, and was fortunate enough from that to start some businesses. And I sold one of those businesses. 
   And one of the reasons I decided to run for Congress was because the government took too much of my money. And I really looked at it as being my money because I earned it. My wife and I started the business. We took the risk. We put our home up. If that business hadn't succeeded, the bank could have come and taken our home. And when I sold the business, I should have been able to keep the proceeds and take care of my two children. It shouldn't have gone to the government. And I decided that I needed to get involved. 
   According to the Congressional Research Service, President Bush's program of comprehensive tax relief was well timed to respond to a weak economy. Do you remember back in the early 2000s we had just been hit by terrorist extremists, and we had natural disasters. So those tax relief packages that he put in place have actually worked. Tax relief enacted in 2001 granted immediate tax rebates, reduced marginal tax rates, and lowered the marriage tax penalty. The tax relief of 2003 accelerated much of the 2001 growth which would ultimately strengthen our economy. 
   We are residing and living in a strong economy. The Republican tax cut relief has seen nearly 4 straight years, 21 straight quarters, of economic growth, while adding 7.5 million new jobs. Seven point five million new jobs, that excites me. And we were able to do that because people are allowed to keep their money at home. 
   You see, government really doesn't create jobs. Government takes money. But if you leave that money back in local communities, that money is put to work and it does good things. 
   The Congressional Budget Office confirmed that the tax cuts of 2003 have helped boost the Federal revenues by 68 percent. Commonsense again. If you allow people to keep their tax dollars at home, the economy grows. And this should be understood by both sides of the aisle. This actually works for Democrats and Republicans. It worked for President Kennedy, it worked for President Reagan, and it has worked for President Bush. This is bipartisan. We all ought to understand that keeping taxes low, keeping spending low, the economy will grow and the coffers of government will grow. I think that is a good thing. 
   We should all work to make the successful tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 permanent. If they are not made permanent, which I am convinced that this new ``hold on to your wallet Congress'' has in mind, we are going to have a problem in our economy. For example, 84 million women will see their taxes increased by $1,970. Now, we all say here for the low and middle income, but if you are a woman, with this new tax increase of $400 billion, your average tax is going to go up $1,970. 
   We are going to see 48 million married couples' taxes increased by $2,726. It seems inherently unfair to me. Forty-two million families will see their taxes go up by $2,084. And I thought we were here for the low and middle income. These are the people that are paying taxes. 
   Twenty-six million small business owners will see a devastating tax increase of $3,637. The small business owner that runs the little store down the street or creates five jobs on the corner, who probably employs some of your friends in your local community, they are going to see their taxes go up over $3,600. And where are they going to get that $3,600 to send up to Washington? They are going to get it from you, the American people. They are going to either increase the cost of goods and we are going to see inflation, or they are going to decide they can't hire that last employee or maybe they have to let that last employee go. 
   Five million low-income individuals and couples will no longer be exempt from Federal income taxes.     
   This is going to hurt the very people that we say we are trying to help. 
   Again, we should work in a bipartisan manner, Republicans and Democrats, to make sure that the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 are made permanent. I am very concerned if we don't do that, that we are going to see our economic growth go into a slide, and we are going to have a problem that we are going to have to deal with. 
   Just two weeks ago, Washington Democrats passed a fiscal blueprint that raises taxes on Americans in one fell swoop. As part of this ill-gotten budget, taxpayers in Tennessee, my home State, will not be allowed to deduct their sales tax from their Federal income tax, which is only fair because we don't have an income tax. It makes us equal with all the other States. Taxes on small businesses in east Tennessee will go up. The child tax credit will decrease from $1,000 to $500. The marriage penalty is coming back. Residents of the First District of Tennessee's average expense in taxes is going up over $2,000. The definition of a  small business will decrease from $400,000 to $200,000. Dividends will no longer be taxed at the personal gains rate, thereby increasing double taxation of dividends by as much as 62 percent. People all across America voted for change, but they are not getting the change they voted for. 
   We have a choice between bigger economy or bigger government, and the majority party has made it their choice to have a bigger government. And if anyone tells you that Americans aren't paying their fair share for a civilized society, they must remember that Americans pay more in their taxes than they do for housing, clothing and heating combined. And also remember that Americans this year will have to work until the last week of April in order to pay their taxes. That is over 114 days just to cover their tax bills. So on tax day, today, when we feel it the most, everyone needs to remember, we need to hold the line on spending, reduce earmarks, and pass line item veto, and crack down on worthless pork barrel spending and be good stewards of the taxpayers' money. And again I remind you, Ronald Reagan said, ``We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; we have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much.'' 
   And with that, I yield back.

   It's interesting, looking at your charts tonight, I notice some of your charts actually have numbers that have to change. If you look at those, that's almost like I see when I go back home to east Tennessee every weekend, I see on the pumps at the gas stations, they have to change, also. And it's changing because we see the gas prices continuing day after day----

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. And you're exactly right. I think when Speaker Pelosi took over, oil, I think, was $58 a barrel according to your chart. Now it's $115 a barrel. And I can bet by tomorrow if we use that same chart, that $115 will be gone and you'll have to change that chart again. 
   I do thank you for your leadership in this issue. You know, we've been busy in this Congress. So far in the 110th Congress we've named 78 post offices, Federal buildings or roads. We've also passed legislation honoring LSU for their NCAA Football Championship, and the Red Sox for their World Series sweep over Colorado, and even commemorated the Detroit Tigers for winning the American League pennant. 
   Granted, post offices need names and championship teams need to be honored, but when I go back to the First District of Tennessee, people don't ask if I'm working on these types of things. They ask, DAVID, how am I going to fill up my pick-up truck if the gas prices don't come down? 
   What we haven't done is pass a sensible energy policy that will break our dependence on foreign oil. And I don't know about you, and I think you will agree with me, it scares me that we're dependent on foreign nations for our energy needs, dependent on people that hate us and hate our freedoms and, quite frankly, hate our religion. It is a dangerous precedent that we set when we become more and more and more dependent every day. It's time to get our priorities straight and help the citizens, families and small businesses in each of our districts across America. There is no excuse for this when families in my district are struggling to fill up their vehicles just to go to work. 
   I can remember a time 10 or 12 years ago, before I came to Washington, when there was a lot of talk about one party would steal milk from babies, or have senior adults eating dog food. Well, I can tell you, this worries me when I have families in east Tennessee that are to the point that they have to decide, do they buy food that's going up, or do they buy energy to go to work? This worries me. 
   There is no excuse for small businesses in my district to be forced into bankruptcy because they can't operate under high energy prices that they're facing. There is no excuse when families in my district have to choose between driving to work each day or putting food on their table or sending their kids off to college. There is no excuse. 
   Energy is the foundation and lifeblood of the American economy, creating the conditions that help us support good-paying jobs in the United States and allowing our industrial base to compete with the rest of the world. 
   Gasoline prices have increased more than $1.23 per gallon since the majority party took control of this House last year, increasing from a nationwide average of $2.33 per gallon on the very first day of the 110th Congress to now $3.55 per gallon. And again, that will probably change by tomorrow, and it's changing every day. 
   What we need is no more excuses. We need an energy policy that allows us to use American energy. We need to drill for oil in ANWR and off the Intercontinental Shelf. We need to use our abundant coal supplies through the use of clean coal technology.  
   One of the first things I did when I was elected to Congress is went to the Pentagon and spoke with the Secretary of the Air Force. And one of their top priorities is to use American coal, American energy, and take that coal and turn it into a fuel that we can actually fly our jets with. That's not too much to ask. And we think, boy that sounds a little out there, a little futuristic. Well, let me tell you how futuristic it is. The Germans ran their war machines in World War II by changing lumps of coal into gas. In World War II. This is not futuristic, some pie-in-the-sky issue, this is something that was done in World War II, it can be done now.     
   And we need to create safe nuclear power plants and we need to build refineries. And we need to expand our green energy initiatives like switchgrass. The University of Tennessee has a wonderful program looking at that possibility. Wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power. I think we have to look at green energy, but I think we've got our heads in the sand if we feel like we can run the American economy off green energy. 
   I think we have to have an energy plan. And an energy plan, an energy policy, combines all of these things together. It's a supply-and-demand issue. It's that simple. If you have a lot of something and a few people want it, the price will come down. This is basic economics that you learn in high school. If you have a small amount of a product and a lot of people want it, the price will go up. We have a limited supply. And it's not just Americans now that want the supply. China wants the supply. India wants the supply. We live in a global marketplace. 
   There are people in this Congress that believe you can tax and regulate yourself into prosperity. It never has happened. It won't happen today, and it will not happen in the future. If there's anybody that serves in this House that believes that you can put a tax on a business and that tax won't be passed on to the consumer, they haven't taken economics. They will pass that cost directly on to the pump. 
   Now we see that gas prices have gone from $2.33 a gallon, when the majority party took over, to $3.65, according to your chart today. Can you imagine if we put more taxes on top of that, what that's going to do? That's going to put a higher burden on the American consumer, on the American family. 
   There are families back in East Tennessee that sit around their kitchen table trying to decide how they're going to put a budget together, and it's putting a real dampening spirit on them when they have to try to spend $50 or $60 to fill up their vehicle. 
   Mr. Speaker, some people here in Washington believe the best way to reduce our gasoline price is just to tax the oil companies that are providing our energy supply. You can't tax and regulate yourself out of an energy crisis. You can't tax Joe's or John's or Chris's pickup truck full of gasoline. It just doesn't make any sense. 
   The American middle class deserves better. They deserve an energy policy that is dependent on American energy, not foreign energy. That's why 2 weeks ago, I signed onto a piece of legislation that's carried from my good friend from Texas, MAC THORNBERRY, called the ``No More Excuses Energy Act.'' ``No More Excuses.'' 
   We've talked about energy for years, before I ever came here. As I was running for office in the last election, I heard the majority party say if you'll just let us take power, we're going to lower your energy costs. Well, I certainly don't see it in your charts today, Mr. Shimkus. I can tell you we need no more excuses. We need to use American energy. It's the only way to lower the cost at the pump and to give some relief to the American taxpaying citizen. 
   Thank you for your leadership.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and here we are in our third week of 100 hours, and that is not east Tennessee math. I represent the beautiful area of northeast Tennessee and the 1st Congressional District and am very honored to do so. 
   One thing I recall when we went through the elections last year, being a freshman legislator here in Washington, I remember the talk about we need change, and I think the American people actually voted for change, Mr. Speaker. But I am not so sure the American people are going to be happy with the change that is taking place here on the Hill. 
   One of the things that has happened as we have moved forward in this first 100 hours, one of the very first things that we did under the new Democrat majority is, we took a vote to not require recorded votes in the Rules Committee. Now, remember, back in the elections during the talk of change, this was going to be the most open Congress that had ever been known on Capitol Hill. Well, when you go into a committee and you take a vote and that vote is not open and recorded for the people back home, you are not opening up sunshine, you are actually pulling the blinds down on government. 
   I don't think that is exactly what the American people wanted to do. I don't think that is the change the American people wanted. 
   I was known as a Tennessee legislator that actually worked to open up government in Tennessee. When I went there, I found out in Nashville, Tennessee, that they were doing the very same thing. They were going into committees and subcommittees and people were taking votes, and you could go to the speaker of the house and say, Mr. Speaker, I am with you; don't worry about that, I will vote with you on that issue. And then you could go back home and say, don't worry about me, I am with you on that issue, and you would be telling two completely different stories. 
   Well, after 8 years of working in Tennessee, we finally changed that. And so I was looking forward to coming to Washington where we were going to have the most open Congress that had ever been known on Capitol Hill. Well, here I come, and the first week of the 100 hours, 3 weeks ago, I find one of the first things the majority party did was to actually stop recording votes. That is not the change the American people wanted, Mr. Speaker. 
   On another issue, Mr. Speaker, when the Republicans had the majority, if they wanted to raise taxes, if there was a need to balance the budget with taxes, it took a super majority to raise those taxes. It took three-fifths of the Members of this august body to raise those taxes. 
   Well, the American people voted for change. Not sure they got the change they wanted, though, because one of the very first things that took place here on Capitol Hill was, they lowered that super majority to raise your taxes down to a simple majority. So now taxes can be raised without one Republican vote. 
   I don't think they would have done that if that was not something they are looking at as a possibility in the future. I am not sure that is the change the American people voted for. I think they ought to be concerned. I think it can lead to bigger government, and it is going to lead to a bigger bureaucracy. We are seeing that in some of the votes. 
   Not sure that is the change the American people voted for. 
   One of the votes we voted for the second week of the 100 hours was to threaten life.     
   What a tragedy when you don't protect the life of the unborn. We were talking about stem cells. And I am a big supporter of actually using adult stem cells. There is new research that has come out that says you can use amniotic fluid. And if you look at the science, the science tells you that there are about 72 diseases that have been treated with adult stem cells. There is zero diseases that have been treated with the embryonic. And that debate was not really about can you do it or can't you do it. It has already been legal. And I can tell you, being a businessperson, if there had been a lot of scientific possibilities for that there would be some business somewhere that would have invested capital, risked that capital because there is a potential for success in the future. 
   Well, under the Democrat control, under the majority control, unfortunately, they decided to pass the piece of legislation to allow embryos to be destroyed; in other words, allow life to be destroyed. I am not sure that is the change the American people wanted, Mr. Speaker. 
   Then, again, in the second week of the first 100 hours, a bill actually passed here on the floor to allow our national security to be controlled by the United Nations. 
   Now, living in the mountains of East Tennessee, I don't know many east Tennesseeans that would want the U.N. to be in charge of our security. We are a sovereign Nation, and I honestly believe Americans across the Nation are just like most east Tennesseeans, we don't feel like we have to go ask the U.N. if we can protect ourselves. I can't think of anything that is more important than a government that is willing to protect its citizens. That is our number one responsibility is the security of our citizens. So putting us under the auspices of the U.N. is, I don't think, the change the American people wanted. 
   Then there is going to be a bill coming up tomorrow on energy taxes, and there is a lot of talk about big oil and what are we going to do with this issue. And we are giving special interest. Well, the reality is the special interest that I want to protect is the person that turns on his light switch back in east Tennessee tonight, or has to turn their heat on because it has gotten colder outside, or the family back in east Tennessee that is having to stop and fill up their automobile with gas tonight. That is the special interest that I want to protect. And raising taxes during this 100 hours is not the change that the American people wanted, Mr. Speaker. That is not what I hear from east Tennessee, and that is not what I hear from Americans. 
   Big government simply isn't the answer all the time. Oftentimes, I find, as I talk to the good commonsense folks back in east Tennessee, is sometimes the government is the problem. And bigger government leads to bigger bureaucracy. I think the way we solve these problems is not look to big government, but look back to our families, back across America. Families can make good decisions for their children and for their grandchildren. Then look to the States. States have a good handle on what is going on back across the United States and look to local governments. Look to businesses. Big government's not always the answer. I don't think that is a change that the American people wanted, Mr. Speaker.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. With gas prices soaring to all-time high records, families in east Tennessee and all across America are struggling to make their ends meet. The Democratic budget resolution fails to meet the test of fiscal responsibility miserably. Instead of exercising fiscal restraint and lowering taxes, the Democrat budget raises taxes by over $683 billion over the course of 5 years. You heard me correctly, $683 billion over the next 5 years. This is the largest tax increase in American history, and it blows away the previous tax increase record in 1993 by $443 billion. Families in east Tennessee will be forced to pay over $2,611 in new taxes because of the Democrat budget. 
   I am supporting the Republican budget which addresses the bloated government in Washington, lowers taxes on struggling citizens and families, addresses the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare, and reins in the out-of-control spending here in Washington. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the fiscally responsible Republican budget.

   On June 15, the House passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations and did not appoint conferees. The Senate passed the same in September, on September 6, over 60 days ago; and they immediately appointed conferees.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN EAGLE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on the House Resources Committee for bringing this legislation that I've introduced, along with my fellow Tennessee Members, Jimmy Duncan and John Tanner, to the floor of the House today supporting the goals and ideals of American Eagle Day. 
   Almost 225 years ago, on June 20, 1782, the Second Continental Congress designated the bald eagle as the national symbol of the United States. Since that time, the bald eagle has become a fixture on the seals and marks of the Federal Government and on our stamps, currency and coinage. 
   And while the bald eagle has always been such a popular fixture in the hearts and minds of so many Americans, it is difficult to believe that we were very close to forever losing the symbol of our great country. 
   In 1963, the number of nesting pairs of eagles in the 48 contiguous States had dwindled to a figure of just over 400. As the habitat for the bald eagle solely exists in North America, these figures were extremely alarming and led to the bald eagle being listed as an endangered species for the first time in 1967. 
   Today, I'm pleased to note that, as a result of the Federal protection laws and through the diligent efforts of so many private conservationists, the bald eagle has made an incredible recovery.     
   In 1995, the bald eagle was removed from the endangered list to the threatened list, and it could very soon be moved permanently off of these lists as soon as Federal guidelines can be finalized that will forever protect the birds and their habitats. 
   I have been extremely interested in this issue, not only because of the importance of this as a matter of national concern but also because of my firsthand experience in dealing with a group located in the heart of the First Congressional District of Tennessee that has been working for the last 22 years to save the bald eagle. 
   The American Eagle Foundation is located in Pigeon Ford, Tennessee, at the base of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. This nonprofit group has worked to establish recovery programs to protect the eagle and actively cares for many nonreleasable birds to ensure they live healthy lives. 
   In addition, they operate the largest bald eagle breeding facility in the world, and they have released hundreds of eaglets into the wild with the support of local, State and Federal officials. 
   Through the efforts of the American Eagle Foundation and the grassroots efforts of children nationwide, I am pleased to offer this legislation for this consideration. Spaced conveniently between Flag Day on June 14 and Independence Day on July 4, July 20 will give Americans another day in which they can celebrate their patriotism by honoring the unique symbol of our heritage and folklore. 
   I again thank my colleagues for bringing this legislation to the floor of the House and encourage all of my colleagues on the House to join me in supporting this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in recognizing American Eagle Day to honor the birds that have symbolized our country's freedom and democracy for centuries. H. Res. 341 encourages all Americans to acknowledge American Eagle Day on June 20, 2007, which marks the 225th anniversary of the bald eagle's designation as our national symbol. 
   The bald eagle habitats in Tennessee have been important in the recovery and restoration of this majestic species. I want to particularly thank the American Eagle Foundation and its president Al Cecere for their hard work to protect our American bald eagles. I have had the honor of visiting in my office with Al and Challenger, the world-famous American bald eagle that appears at high-profile events like the Super Bowl to represent the freedoms we enjoy in this great country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope you and our colleagues will join me in supporting H. Res. 341 to celebrate June 20 as American Eagle Day.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the resolution but in support of our troops. 
   According to former Congressman, Senator, and Secretary of State Daniel Webster, ``God grants liberty only to those who love it and are always ready to guard and defend it.'' That was true in the mid 1800s and it is still true today. 
   I represent the First District of Tennessee. Tennessee is known as the Volunteer State because of our heavy involvement in the Mexican War and the willingness of our men and women down through history to volunteer for service to our country. 
   Right now, there are brave men and women in our armed services who are sacrificing for our freedom. The people of the First District of Tennessee and I are indeed indebted for their service and we thank these brave soldiers and we pray for them and their families. 
   There are some who would want to limit their discussion to Iraq, while in fact we are involved in a global war on terror. We must be committed to win this war on terror that was started by radical Islamic extremists. This war did not start on September 11. We have been in a war for many years. 
   Many of you will recall the Iranian hostage crisis, 1979, 52 Americans held hostage, 444 days. 
   As we move forward in history, the Beirut bombings, 1983. Two hundred forty-one of our brave marine soldiers were killed. 
   Then we had the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. 
   Then we had the USS Cole in 2000. Seventeen Americans killed. 
   Then finally, September 11, 2001, 3,000 Americans killed. 
   This war didn't start on September 11 and this war is not with Iraq. This is a war with radical Islam. We are involved to win a battle with terrorists who hate us, who hate our freedoms and who quite frankly hate our religion. The extremists have engaged us in battle. We owe it to our fellow citizens to see that we have nothing less than total victory. 
   Congress should not micromanage this war. We have one Commander in Chief. It is fine to disagree and to point out mistakes, but this resolution is a step to weaken the morale of our troops and it will embolden our enemies. We cannot allow this to become another Vietnam situation, a situation where politicians tried to manage the war. 
   My emotions run high as I remember that era. My first cousin, Fred Gouge, was laid to rest just 1 week ago. Fred was wounded in that war in Vietnam, a war that was micromanaged by politicians. Because of that conflict, he spent the better part of the last 40 years in a wheelchair. He received a Purple Heart for his service. He was a war hero, just like the men and women of our military are right now. 
   We cannot afford to ignore the advice of General Petraeus, who was recently unanimously approved by the Senate, and the advice of his commanders. I would ask, Madam Speaker, what message does a nonbinding resolution really send? This resolution says that this Congress will support our troops who have defended our freedoms, or who are currently serving in harm's way, but that is little comfort for those brave men and women who would be called upon to protect us and our families in the future. This nonbinding resolution is only playing politics with our brave soldiers, their lives and our future as a nation. To suggest that we can support the troops but not be in the battle to win is ridiculous and shortsighted. 
   I can remember as a child watching many different western television shows. Growing up, I don't know of many my age that didn't want to be the cowboy in the Wild West. After seeing many of these stories, you realize that when the hero is in trouble, they sound the alarm, or blow the trumpet, and in races the cavalry to join their brothers in arms to win the fight. 
   Madam Speaker, the trumpet has been sounded. It is time for the cavalry to join our brothers and sisters in arms to gain victory in this global war on terror. As the trumpet has been sounded, we have politicians in Washington who want to sit on their hands and not send in the troops. 
   Looking at the latest news, as additional forces are moving in, radical Islamic leaders like al-Sadr are fleeing for their strongholds. It has been reported that he has left Iraq for his own protection. The additional troops are already having a positive impact on the region. We have the ability to win this war on terrorism, and we must win this war to protect America today and for our future generations. 
   Madam Speaker, that is why I will join many of my colleagues in voting ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (HOPE AND CHANGE -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I rise today to tell you something about my district. I go home every single weekend because I take the word ``representative'' very seriously. I go home and speak with people living and working in my district because they are the ones who sent me to Washington to express their ideas and their concerns. Two common themes come up from the people in northeast Tennessee: hope and change. We hear a lot about those words today. 
   They hope that sometime in the future they won't have to spend over $50 to fill up their pick-up truck. They want change, a change that will take them from dependence on foreign oil to clean, safe, and available American energy. Energy is the foundation and lifeblood of the American economy creating the conditions to help us support good-paying jobs here in the United States and allow our industrial base to compete with the rest of the world. 
   We all know that the middle-class families are feeling significant pain at the pump. But the American family isn't the only place where the strain of spiking fuel prices can be felt. According to recent news reports, local schools, law enforcement agencies, and other community services are paying the price for a record high-fuel cost. Unfortunately, Democrats in the House, who are now in charge, have been consistent in offering so-called energy legislation that weakens our ability to compete with emerging titans such as China, India, and Russia. 
   In the United States today, we are 63 percent dependent on foreign sources of energy. 63 percent. And that percentage is growing every year. Gasoline  prices have increased more than $1 per gallon since the majority party, under Speaker Pelosi, took control of the House last year, increasing from a nationwide average of $2.33 per gallon on the first day of the 110th Congress to now $3.34 a gallon. When Speaker Pelosi took office and had a plan to fix the energy cost, oil was selling for $56 a barrel. Now, it's selling for $113 a barrel. People are looking for hope and change. 
   Figures from the Energy Information Administration indicate the U.S. reliance on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC, grew from 50.9 percent of our total crude imports in 2006 to 57.6 percent in 2007. Not only has the majority party failed to end our reliance on Middle Eastern oil for our essential energy needs, they've actually helped grow our dependence to historic and dangerous levels. 
   We need to make sure that we're not dependent on our energy needs from people that hate us and hate our freedoms all because of their refusal to allow responsible energy production here at home. We cannot tax and regulate our way out of an energy crisis. The American people want an energy policy that's comprehensive and addresses our needs for wind, water, solar, safe nuclear, clean coal technology and, most importantly, the use of American oil. 
   The American middle class deserves better. They deserve an energy policy that is dependent on American energy, not foreign energy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support House Resolution 320, congratulating the University of Tennessee women's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division I women's basketball championship. 
   The Lady Vols are an institution statewide with an unmatched record of success. With their 59-46 victory over Rutgers on April 3, the Lady Vols won their unprecedented seventh NCAA national championship. 
   A quick review of the program's records in the past quarter of a century shows features unmatched in women's basketball history. They have seven national titles, 12 championship game appearances, 17 Final Four appearances, 25 sweet 16 appearances. 
   Tennessee is the only team that has appeared at all 26 NCAA women's basketball tournaments, and their Hall of Fame coach, Pat Summitt, has been a leader in this program for 33 years. And a record of 947 wins and 180 losses gives her more wins than any coach, men or women, in the history of college basketball. She has been a leader in advancing women's athletics to more of a prominent role, and her winning record is even more impressive when you become aware of the fact that every Lady Vol who has completed her eligibility at Tennessee has received her degree or is in the process of completing her degree. 
   Her players and staff have always displayed the highest levels of sportsmanship and have been tremendous ambassadors for our university. The national and statewide following enjoyed by the Lady Vols include numerous fans throughout the First Congressional District of Tennessee. Therefore, I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting this worthy resolution honoring the coaches and players of the Lady Vols.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Congressman Price, for giving me an opportunity to join you today. And, Mr. Kline, thank you for your leadership in the Congress and in the military. I appreciate it so very much. 
   Congressman Price, as you well know, none of us want to be in war; I certainly don't want to be in a war. But the fact is, we are in a war on terror. As a matter of fact, I think back right after September 11, 2001, the first casualty in Afghanistan was Sergeant Davis from my district. A distant family member, the first casualty in the war on terror after we decided that we were going to join the battle. As you well know, that battle didn't start on September 11. This is not a war just limited to Iraq. This war has been going on a long time. It is a global war on terror. This war has been going on for a long time, and it was started by radical Islamic extremists. 
   This war didn't start on September 11. It has been going on for a long time. Many of you can remember the Iranian hostage crisis. In 1979, 52 Americans were held for 444 days until we had a President that finally came to office and said we are going to have a backbone and we are going to take on the terrorists, and those 52 Americans were set free. 
   Then we had the bombing of the Beirut barracks in 1983 where 241 Americans were killed. 
   Then we had the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. So you are starting to see a trend here. This war really didn't start on September 11, and it is really not a war that is limited to Iraq. 
   Then we step forward in time to the year 2000, the bombing of the USS Cole. Seventeen sailors were killed. 
   Finally, September 11, 2001, almost 3,000 Americans were killed. How soon we forget. 
   I certainly haven't forgotten. I am sure that the family members of those 3,000 haven't forgotten, and I hope the American people and the Congress and the majority in the Congress never forget those 3,000 people that were killed. 
   We are going to be fighting this battle somewhere. We are in a war with a people that hate us; terrorists that hate us. They hate our freedoms; and, quite frankly, I think they hate our religion. 
   The extremists engaged us in battle. We owe it to our fellow citizens to see that we have nothing less than total victory. We can and we must win this war on terror. We simply cannot allow this Congress to move forward with a slow-bleed strategy. We must not cut off funding for our troops. 
   I spent several hours last week at Walter Reed Medical Center, and I had the opportunity to see men and women in uniform. Many of them had lost limbs. Many of them had internal injuries. We owe them nothing less than total victory. We asked them to go protect us. I can't imagine a Congress and a government of the United States not standing behind them to make sure that they also have victory. 
   America cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by withdrawing from a direct confrontation of the radical Islamic extremists. They will stop at nothing to destroy America. They have proved that. 
   You know, I can remember when people said they have fought over there, they have been fighting over there for thousands of years, why are we over there? The reason we are over there is because they came over here. They brought the war to us, and they have been bringing the war to us for well over 30 years. This is not something we can turn our backs on. 
   I have spoken to the men and women in uniform as they have returned, and I can tell you to a person, every one of them said we are doing the right things. We need to stay there. We need to finish this job. 
   Can you imagine being a soldier over there and knowing that the Congress has the potential to pass a law that we could pull out in 18 months. Can you imagine being a soldier over there at 17 months, 3 weeks, 4 days, and you are on patrol and knowing you can lose your life or your limb, but in 3 days you are going to be pulled out and we are going to lose the war anyway. I can't imagine being a soldier that is being asked to do that. We need to have soldiers that understand that we are going to be there for them because they are there for us. 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq would be tragic for America and for the entire world. If we retreat, the enemy will follow. Our decisions now regarding how we handle this global war on terror will affect future generations. We have the duty to pursue nothing less than victory. 
   The good news is the surge is working. It is already taking place. For instance, Brian Williams, anchor of NBC News, hardly a news group that typically sides with Republicans, recently reported a dramatic change in Ramadi. The city is now safer, according to Mr. Williams. 
   It is already working. How can we be talking about cutting and running and failing on this critical issue? 
   We need to stop campaigning on the floor of the House, and we need to get about allowing the generals to be the military leaders. 
   As you pointed out just moments ago, there is one Commander in Chief, not 535. Congress should not micromanage this war, and we need to let our military leaders do just that, lead. That is what they are called to do. 
   General Petraeus just weeks ago received unanimous approval in the Senate, and a week later you have Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen saying we don't want to listen to what he says. Actually what he is telling us to do is send in the troops. 
   It is almost like the cavalry. If you can remember growing up, the trumpet would sound, the bugle would alert, and you would bring in the troops to win the battle. We need to do that same thing. 
   What we have been doing over the last few years has actually worked again. The United States has been able to prevent further terrorist attacks on our homeland since 2001. We did it by taking the fight to them. They have proven they are going to fight us somewhere, it is either over there or over here. I would much rather keep them busy over there if they want to continue the fight. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may have the votes to defund the war, bring the troops home, and not use the word ``retreat.'' But if we leave before the job is finished, we have retreated. It is simple. We either win this war or we lose this war. 
   The good people of the First District of Tennessee and I support the efforts of our troops and we support winning this global war on terror. We can do no less.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (TAXPAYER FREEDOM DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Walberg. Thank you for your friendship, thank you for leadership. You're doing a great job. Thank you for your foresight and understanding that you can't tax and regulate yourself into prosperity. Never could, can't now, and never will. It's that simple. 
   I do come from the Volunteer State of Tennessee, and thankfully our Tax Freedom Day is not tomorrow. It was actually about 3 weeks ago. The reason it was 3 weeks ago in the Volunteer State is because we keep our taxes low, and people in Tennessee are actually spending their money on their families now and not sending it to the government. I am happy for that. I'd like to see that move even back up in the year a little more. 
   There are mothers and fathers all across east Tennessee. I have the opportunity to represent the beautiful mountains of northeast Tennessee and there are mothers and fathers sitting back home in east Tennessee and all across America. They sit around their kitchen table and they have to work out a budget. It's that simple. 
   I can remember my wife and I when we first started our family, having to do that, knowing how much money came in and how much money went out. We had to make some decisions. You can't spend more than you bring in. If you do, you get in a credit crunch. It's amazing that we have a Congress that sometimes don't sit around that kitchen table. That is exactly what we need to be doing. 
   Those families back in east Tennessee, they are having to choose between buying gasoline, and it costs over $50 to fill up their pickup truck, and buying their food. They're seeing the price of milk and bread go up. They are having to worry about paying their house payments or making sure they provide health care for their children. Those are the things that moms and dads across America are having to deal with and we have got people right here in Washington that think if we can just tax them a little bit more and spend a little bit more, we can take care of them. 
   Now where I grew up, I never came to the conclusion if government could just take care of us, things will be okay. Actually, the way we believe back in the mountains in east Tennessee, if government will just get out of our way and keep taxes and regulations low, we have actually been able to take care of ourselves pretty well. We have done it well in America for over 200 years, and why we think we need to change now, I just don't understand it. 
   Especially when you look at gas prices. My goodness, we passed an energy bill, so-called energy bill back in December on this House floor. It had new taxes, new regulations. You know what it didn't have? New energy. Now how you can call a bill an energy bill with no energy, I don't get it. Sometimes we just need some common sense. The American people get it. They understand that common sense. 
   And then you look at the budget. The two things that are facing Americans today are their family budget, their small business budget, and then that cost of energy. Those are the two things that are on peoples' minds across America. And you look at the Democrats' budget resolution, it fails the test of fiscal 
   responsibility miserably. Instead of exercising fiscal restraint in lowering our taxes, the Democrat budget raises taxes by $683 billion over the course of the next 5 years. You heard me correctly: $683 billion. 
   Now I go home to my district every weekend, talk to a lot of people about a lot of issues, and I can tell you not once do I hear somebody say, If you could just raise the budget by $683 billion and take a little bit more of my tax dollars, my family is going to be better off. I don't hear, If you can just pass an energy bill with no energy and just put a little more tax on top of the energy and regulate them just a little bit more, then my family is going to be better off. That is not what the American people are looking for. 
   If you look at $683 billion, that is the largest tax increase in American history. It blows away the previous largest tax increase in history, which was passed in 1993, and that was over $443 billion. These are real tax hikes on real people. 
   Here are some staggering statistics for families living in northeast Tennessee. According to the Heritage Foundation, because of the Democrat budget, the average taxpayer in my district will be forced to pay an increase in $1,596. This will result in almost 2,000 jobs lost and a loss of $188 million in the First District's economy. 
   When I go home every weekend, I don't hear people say, Please raise my taxes so we can lose 2,000 jobs. We are actually seeing jobs move to Tennessee because we keep taxes low and keep regulations low. We are a good work State. We have a good work ethic. We certainly don't need the Federal Government to come in and help us to move us in the wrong direction. 
   By reimposing the marriage penalty tax, roughly 23 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase by $466 a year simply because they are married. Now in east Tennessee I don't go home every weekend and hear people say, I want you to raise my taxes just because I did what is biblically correct and I did the right thing. 
   We have choices. We have choices between a bigger economy or a bigger government. Taxing spending is not the road we need to head down. Ronald Reagan once said we don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough, we have a trillion-dollar  debt because we spend too much. That is common sense. That is the type of logic I hear when I go home to east Tennessee every weekend. 
   I think we as Members of Congress need to be more concerned about the budgets of mothers and fathers that they have to put together sitting around kitchen tables every month rather than growing the Federal budget and taking money from those very mothers and fathers that have to sit around the kitchen table every month.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I hear a lot about hope and change. Really, the hope that people are looking for is just the hope that they can fill up their gas tank, the hope they can buy a gallon of milk, the hope they can buy a loaf of bread, the hope they don't have to spend all their money to take care of government, the hope that the government will let them go out and have that life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness that you were talking about earlier with our good friend, Mr. Sali from Idaho. That is the hope that the Americans are looking for, and the change they are looking for is just to get back to some common sense principles that worked over 200 years very well. 
   The Founding Fathers knew exactly what America needs. I look around this beautiful room and I look behind you and it actually says: In God We Trust. That is the type of change we need in America. We need to get back to some of those bedrock principles where we allow people to go out and pursue happiness. 
   You know, one of my favorite quotes is from Henry Ford. Henry Ford once said: If you think you can or you think you can't, you're right. The American people think they can. But they think they can't if they see government continue to get bigger and go bigger and bigger. We talk about taxing and spending. The reality is you spend, then you tax. So it should really say spending and taxing. 
   So we have got to keep the spending low, regulations low, taxes low, and the American people will go out and succeed. There's no better people anywhere in the world than right here in America. We have a great work ethic, we have great values, we have great morals, and we can take care of our families if we will just allow families to take care of families. 
   I would like to see if you have any comments.

   I really appreciate your leadership in this and understanding that you can't tax and spend and regulate yourself into prosperity. The American people understand it. It is a simple principle. We need to start thinking outside the Beltway, not inside the Beltway. And if we do those things with lower taxes, lower spending, we will actually start to produce energy in America again, start to use American oil and American coal, safe nuclear, those things to bring down the energy costs. If we bring those taxes, those regulations down, then the American people will go out there and have those jobs. The best economic stimulus package in America is a good paycheck. And thank you for your leadership.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Thank you, Ms. Foxx. I appreciate your leadership and your friendship just across the mountain in North Carolina from Tennessee. And thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to speak today. 
   It is an interesting time in America; things are going well in the economy. It is going well because Americans are working hard. I grew up in an era of politics looking back at Ronald Reagan, who was a great President. And as we all know, his birthday is today. If you go back 96 years ago was the date of his birth. And one of his quotes was, We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough, we have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much. And I think that is a good starting point as we look towards our economy and how we run this Congress and how we work for the people across America. 
   Revenues are coming in at a record pace. If we continue the pace that we are at now, we will actually be able to balance our budget by the year 2012 without raising taxes; and I think that is exactly what the American people would like to see. I think they want us to hold the line on spending, I think they want a pro-growth economy, and they want a good, sound financial policy. 
   If you look at the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, which is nonpartisan, it confirmed just last week that tax cuts of 2003 have helped boost our Federal revenues by 68 percent. That is good news. There are other signals that keeping taxes low, coupled with fiscal restraint and economic growth, help move us forward and help us balance our budget; and we can do that and take care of that deficit that we have. 
   If you look at some other statistics that are vitally important, our economy has grown for 21 straight quarters. That is rather impressive. And in the period between 2004 and 2006, Federal tax revenues rose the largest margin in nearly 40 years, not because we had raised taxes, but because we had lowered taxes. In addition to that, the deficit has been cut in half 2 years early, or ahead of schedule. That is good news for Americans. I think that is the type of leadership that America is looking for. 
   If you look at the way you balance a budget, like a small business does back in east Tennessee, or a family sitting around the kitchen table, and they have a small budget, their budget is tight, they are trying to decide what they need to do, they have to decide, do you cut what you spend or do you bring in additional revenue. And most people understand, as they sit around their kitchen table, you have to hold the line on spending; you can't spend more than you make, unlike government. 
   I am excited about a good starting point that we see from the President in his budget. It calls for making the 2001-2003 tax relief provisions permanent. I think that is exactly what the American people want. And if we do that, the administration projects total revenue to grow an average of 5.4 percent per year. The way we maintain this healthy economy that we have today is keep tax cuts permanent; that is what the American people want us to do. 
   We really have a simple choice, Mr. Speaker: we have the choice between a bigger economy or bigger government. And I really believe that if we look forward, what the American people want is us to hold the line on spending, hold the line on increasing the taxes and allow the economy to work the way it has worked in the past and the way it is working today. 
   We also need to work very hard to make sure that we hold the line not only on spending, but we need to take a good strong look in a bipartisan way at reducing earmarks. I think we need to pass the line item veto. And if we do that, it will allow the President to have better control of how tax dollars are spent. 
   I would also like to see a biennial budget process where we can actually sit back and let this House and this Congress take a breathing period from every other year and to find out if what we are doing works. And back in Tennessee, as State legislature, I was a State representative for 8 years, we had a balanced budget amendment in our constitution. We couldn't spend more than we brought in. And I signed on as a cosponsor to House Joint Resolution 1, which calls for a balanced budget amendment right here at the Federal level. I think that is exactly what the American people are looking for. 
   And, again, going back to what Ronald Reagan had to say, just to reiterate, President Reagan said: ``We don't have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough, we have a trillion dollar debt because we  spend too much.'' And if we can remember that in this body and over in the Senate and we pass a good balanced budget that would take care of the deficit without raising taxes, I think the American people would be very pleased.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Shuster for giving me this opportunity. I too am a father of two and a small business owner, and I am truly honored to have this occasion to discuss my ideas. This open discussion is part of what makes us so great as a Nation. 
   I am from the First District of Tennessee. It is a place of beautiful, majestic mountains, thriving communities, and a growing economy. Northeast Tennessee has unrivaled beauty and unsurpassed potential. However, the beautiful First Tennessee District and our country could be headed toward economic danger. For instance, in the last week, the three-fifths majority required to raise our taxes has been removed by the Democrat Party. 
   Tax cuts are not permanent. Seemingly, it is only a matter of time before these massive tax increases are put in place. It is our responsibility to protect the American people from these unnecessary tax burdens. If the tax cuts that are in place are allowed to expire, some families could see an increase in taxes up to 39 percent. Married couples and families will once again be subject to the tax penalty. 
   As I speak tonight, time and time again history has proven that tax reductions have spurred economic resurgence. Our current economic figures once again prove this fact. With the tax cuts in place, real after-tax income has risen 9.6 percent since the year 2000. The United States has grown faster than any other G-7 industrialized nation over the past four quarters. The time to control spending and to make tax cuts permanent is now. 
   I will be joining many of my colleagues in signing a letter to President Bush encouraging him to veto any legislation implementing tax increases on working people and on the businesses of America. It is not the time to place greater financial burden on the families of the First District of Tennessee nor the many other people of this great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I think it is vitally important that it is individuals and small business owners and businesses across this country that pay these taxes. And I want to put a personal face on this. 
   If the majority party allows taxes to be increased, it will cost us nearly $2.4 trillion in new taxes to American taxpayers. What does that mean to people across America tonight and the people in the First Congressional District of Tennessee? It means that there will be 115 million taxpayers who would pay an average of $1,716 more each year. It means that 48 million married couples would pay an average of $2,726 more every year; and it means that 17 million seniors would pay an average of over $2,000 more a year. It is real people paying real dollars, and I hope the people in this body will remember that as we move forward. 
   I am disappointed that we changed the rules last week with the majority vote to decrease the amount of people that it takes to increase taxes. I think it should have been left at three-fifths, not a simple majority. I think that was a mistake last week when the majority party did that. I hope they will protect taxpayers in America over the next 2 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (PROMOTING ANTITERRORISM COOPERATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 884. I would like to thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this important piece of legislation. 
   The development and implementation of technology to combat terrorism is critical. The United States and our allies in the war on terror share a common interest in furthering research and development of homeland security-related technology. 
   As such, this legislation directs the Department of Homeland Security's research and development arm, the  Science and Technology Division, to coordinate international cooperative programs with our allies in the war on terror to advance this important homeland security research. 
   This legislation implements a 9/11 Commission recommendation that the United States should engage other Nations in developing a comprehensive coalition strategy against Islamic extremists. 
   H.R. 884 establishes the Science and Technology Homeland Security International Cooperative Programs Office within the Science and Technology Division to promote cooperation between entities of the United States and its allies to engage in cooperative endeavors focused on the research, development and commercialization of high-priority technologies directed at countering acts of terrorism and other high consequence events to address the homeland security needs of Federal, State and local governments. 
   This bill enables the Science and Technology Division within DHS to coordinate with our allies. By encouraging joint research studies, the sharing of scientific and technological information, the training and exchange of scientists and engineers, as well as the joint use of laboratory equipment and facilities, H.R. 884 further directs DHS to collaborate with their strongest allies that include Israel, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Singapore in the development of homeland security technologies. 
   This legislation is modeled after a partnership created by Congress in 1977 between the United States and Israel. That was called the Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation, also known as the BIRD Foundation. In 29 years, the BIRD Foundation has invested $225 million in 690 cooperative research and development projects mutually beneficial to the United States and to Israel. 
   H.R. 884 will facilitate collaboration with countries which have extensive experience in combating terrorism and will enable us to benefit and tailor their technology solutions to address our needs. 
   Israel is a country that has developed successful models to mitigate security threats. Most notably, Israel has pioneered efforts and behavioral pattern recognition, also known as BPR. The United States has begun adopting BPR at airports and is now training police and security officers to detect people who are behaving in a suspicious manner. 
   It is for these reasons that I support H.R. 884, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, with high gas prices soaring, moms and dads across East Tennessee and across America are struggling to put a budget together at the kitchen table. They are worried how they are going to pay for their health care, how they are going to buy enough gas to get their kids to school, how they are going to pay for their children's education. 
   Families and small businesses across America are hurting. Earl Humphreys, for example, in Bristol, Tennessee, owns Lawn Boyz Lawn Care Service. He has told me he may have to go out of business. 
   It is time for solutions, time for no more excuses. High gas prices are not only an economic security issue, they are a national security issue. We are too dependent on foreign countries, countries that hate us and hate our freedoms and, quite frankly, hate our religion. 
   We need an energy policy now. I call on the Democrat majority to offer legislation that will provide for lower gas prices, better economic security, better national security, and I ask them to do it now. We need to use American energy. We need solutions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I would like to thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'm glad we're talking about the budget, but I will tell you the budget I want to talk about right now is the budget of the American family and small businesses and the middle class across America. 
   I was just in Elizabethton, Tennessee, over the weekend back at Whitson's Barber Shop, and I can tell you the issue that is on people's minds right now is not more taxes and more spending; it's the need for a true energy policy in America. An energy policy that actually uses American energy. We need a policy that will stop taxing and spending. We need an energy policy that will break our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Right now we're buying our energy from people that hate us, hate our freedoms, and, quite frankly, hate our religion. We need to go back to the drawing board and have an energy plan that uses American energy. I'm talking about clean coal technology. I'm talking about drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf. I'm talking about drilling in ANWR. I'm talking about wind technology. I'm talking about building safe nuclear plants. Those are the things that will bring down the cost at the pumps. 
   We have moms and dads right now that are worried about how they're going to get their children to school in the mornings. They're worried about how they're going to put food on their kitchen table. That's the budget that the American people are concerned about. The American people are looking for solutions. They are not looking for big government, inside the beltway in Washington. The American people are looking for solutions to make sure that we keep government as small as possible, and they're looking to make sure that we pass an energy policy that actually uses American energy. It's time for no more excuses. It's time for us to pass an energy bill that will give some relief to the American family. 
   It's basic economics. I talk to schools all across my district when I go home, and it's basic economics. You can talk to any high school student. They will understand supply and demand. If you have a lot of a supply and a little bit of demand, the cost will go down; and, conversely, if you have a lot of demand for a limited supply, cost will go up. Right now we have a demand for a lot of energy, a lot of oil. And right now we're dependent on the Middle East, on Venezuela, on Russia, other countries; and we're actually begging the Middle East to increase their energy production. And we have policies here in Washington that won't allow us to use our own American natural resources in energy. 
   The American people want solutions. They want solutions now. And they don't want it in taxing and spending. It's time for no more excuses. We need an energy plan that uses American energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to thank my friend from Texas for yielding and thank you for giving me the opportunity to visit Iraq. 
   Being from Tennessee, the Volunteer State, I volunteered to visit the men and women in uniform in Iraq. I wasn't disappointed. Our troops are well trained, well motivated, and successful. 
   After the fall of Saddam, the Iraqi people had a choice to make. They have lived for decades under totalitarian rule. Over the past 4 years, they've been divided and, quite frankly, confused about who their friends and allies really are. Is it the radical extremists such as al Qaeda or is it us? 
   During my visit to Iraq, I visited Ramadi, which until a few months ago was a killing field. For the past 4 years, the people of Ramadi were caught in a decision-making battle of which group, us or the extremists, offered them the best chance for a normal and free future. 
   The insurgent extremist chose to win the local people over with the use of force, force against their American troops and against any local who did not support their radical agenda. Our troops, on the other hand, have reached out in friendship and support. 
   The local people, seeing the difference, have chosen to have their lives returned to normal and live in freedom. Therefore, Ramadi has gone from a city of death and destruction to one of  rebuilding and hope. I was able to see it firsthand during my visit in July. 
   As I walked throughout the busy city market, it was very uplifting to see the local people interacting with our American troops in a very positive way. Now that the surge is under way, our troops are actually living in the city as trusted friends and allies. We're working with the local mayor and his directors to rebuild and totally rejuvenate the city. The city of Ramadi is located in al Anbar, a city that Chris just mentioned moments ago as being a lost hope at the end of the year. 
   Of course, these relationships take time to develop, but the time and effort are worth it. Helping the Iraqi people secure their freedom helps us to defeat global extremists and, therefore, secure our own freedoms for generations to come. 
   We have to be successful as well. Ronald Reagan once said, ``We win, they lose.'' If we choose not to succeed, that statement will be just the opposite: we lose, they win. 
   You may ask, who are they and why does it matter to me anyway? They are not the Iraqi people. I had the opportunity to meet with some of them during my visit. The Iraqi people are really no different than any of us. They want to live in a secure and safe country, have a job to go to in the mornings, be able to clothe and feed their families, walk across the street without fear of being shot or blown up, find reasonable health care, and to worship freely. These are the same things that any American mother and father would want for their children. 
   So who are our enemy in Iraq and other parts of the world? They're radical extremists who are willing to kill innocent men, women and even children to spread their ideology of hate. 
   We, the American people, have been lulled into believing that this is the President's war on the Iraqi people. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Iraqi people and the Iraqi Government see us as liberators from an oppressive regime, but they are just now learning how to live as a free people. Our common enemy do not want them to live free and productive lives. That would go against their ideology of hate, an ideology that they want to spread around the world, perhaps to a neighborhood near you. 
   We cannot let that happen. We either win and they lose, or they win and we lose. That is too big a price to pay. This Congress owes it to everyone involved to succeed, from the Iraqi people to our brave men and women in uniform who are serving on the frontlines of battle, to the American people. We cannot afford to lose. The price is too high and the cost is too much. Freedom isn't free. It has to be earned. It has to be cherished. 
   We're in a fight for the generations that will come after us. This battle isn't about a small hot desert land somewhere in the Middle East that most Americans will never visit or even easily find on a globe. This battle is about our future and that of our children and grandchildren. 
   We want the same things for our children that Iraqi mothers and fathers do for their children. We want to live in a secure and safe country, to have a job to go to in the mornings, be able to clothe and feed our families, walk across the street without having the fear of being blown up or shot, find reasonable health care and to worship freely. But our enemy, the radical extremists, want to deny us and our future generations those freedoms. They have proved it time and time again: for instance, the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979 where 52 Americans were held for 444 days, or the bombing of the Marine Corps barracks in Beirut where 241 marines lost their lives in 1983, or the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, or the attack on the USS Cole claiming the lives of 17 sailors, or the deadly attack on September 11, where almost 3,000 Americans died. 
   We can either choose to fight and win the battle now or choose to lose the battle now and leave it for our children to fight. 
   A sentiment relayed to me by a general in Iraq was very simple, and it drove this point home. Our men and women in uniform are not fighting only for the 8-year-old Iraqi child and their security but also for the 8-year-old American child and for their current and future security and freedom. We do not want them to grow up to have to fight this battle that we chose not to finish. 
   As I mentioned, our enemy has proven they're dedicated and willing to shed American blood on American soil. Do we really want to tie our hands to the point that we encourage failure over success in Iraq in this global war on terror? Do we really want to live in an America where our future generations have to fear going to the park, going to the mall, going to school or to work? I don't think so and I sure hope not.     
   The choice is ours today. The American people, when provided with the facts, will choose freedom and security every time. I say, we win, they lose. The cost to the American family is just too great to allow any other outcome. 
   May God bless America and keep her strong and secure for generations to come.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I keep hearing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say that we need to reduce our reliance on foreign oil. I couldn't agree more. 
   The Democrats are good at making promises, but they need to follow through on those promises. There is one thing my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are very good at saying--``no.'' 
   It seems like every option we put on the table, whether it's developing the sources of the Outer Continental Shelf, expansion of nuclear power, or opening more refineries in the United States, the answer is always no. 
   The Department of Interior estimates that in the Outer Continental Shelf alone, there is almost 100 billion barrels of oil and over 450 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. How high will gas prices have to go before the Democrats  start saying ``yes''? $5 a gallon? $10 a gallon? 
   It's time for no more excuses. Families are hurting. Businesses are hurting. The American people are asking for help. It's time to say ``yes.''

Young families are hurting, senior adults are hurting, those that are on fixed incomes are hurting, small businesses are hurting, all because we don't have an energy policy that actually includes energy. Let me tell you about one such person. 
   Over the weekend I met with a young family. The gentleman's name was Vern Long from Jefferson City, Tennessee. Vern told me he makes $8 an hour. He has to drive to work to Knoxville, Tennessee. It costs him $90 a week to drive to work. Vern told me that he may not be able to continue working; he may have to go on welfare, because we don't have an energy policy that has American energy. 
   This has to stop. It is time for no more excuses. Vern doesn't want to go on welfare. Vern is a United States veteran. He spent time in Iraq. We owe people like Vern Long a better future for he and his family. We need an energy policy that uses American energy now. 
   No more excuses. It is time for us to pass a policy where we drill for American oil, natural gas, and use clean coal technology. The time is now. No more excuses.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SENIOR BORDER PATROL AGENT LUIS A. AGUILAR -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is with great sorrow and profound gratitude that I rise to support this resolution to honor the life and service of senior Border Patrol guard Luis Aguilar, who was tragically killed in the line of duty on January 19, 2008. He died after being struck by a vehicle driven by a suspected smuggler in the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area of California. 
   The work of a Border Patrol agent is inherently dangerous. In the normal course of their work, they run the risk of heat exhaustion, frostbite, and other challenges from the outdoor environment. Of even greater concern is the threat from smugglers and criminals seeking to illegally cross our borders who engage in violence against our Border Patrol agents. 
   As more agents, assets, and infrastructure are placed along the border, criminal activity is prevented from continuing with impunity. The unfortunate result of gaining operational control of our borders is an increase in violence targeted at agents. And we have seen a significant spike in the past several years, with nearly 1,000 assaults on agents last year, ranging from rock throwing to sniper attacks and to murder. 
   Agent Aguilar's death serves as a stark reminder of the risk our law enforcement agents face every day as they seek to secure our Nation's borders. These despicable criminal acts will only strengthen our resolve to secure our borders with additional agents, fencing, vehicle barriers, and technology. The Border Patrol plays a vital role in protecting America, and the sacrifices of its agents will not be forgotten. 
   I recently conducted an overnight visit on the Southwest border and saw firsthand the challenges and the dangers that these agents face. I returned with the clear resolve to support all the tools, resources, infrastructure, and policies necessary to gain operational control of our borders. 
   I would like to recognize the excellent work of U.S. law enforcement personnel and the Government of Mexico for tracking down and arresting the primary suspect in the murder of Agent Aguilar on January 22. For the sake of the Aguilar family, the Border Patrol and the justice for Agent Aguilar, I ask the Government of Mexico's continued cooperation and support to extradite this individual to the United States for trial. 
   The men and women of the Border Patrol face challenges and threats every day with vigilance, dedication to service, and integrity as they work to strengthen our national security and to protect America and its citizens. 
   I would like to once again extend my condolences to the Aguilar family and sincerely thank Agent Aguilar for his service to our Nation. 
   I would also like to extend my condolences for the recent passing of Agent Aguilar's mother, Cecilia. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 376, which will recognize annually a National Classified School Employee of the Year and the valuable contributions of classified school employees. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from California (Ms. Woolsey) for her leadership on this issue and for introducing the resolution we are considering today. 
   Like many schools across the country and in my district, the education of our Nation's children is a team effort. Often, when education is discussed, we think of teachers and administrators. However, classified school employees, school bus drivers, food service workers, clerical and administrative staff, para-educators, and facilities and maintenance workers protect and nurture children as well. 
   Classified school employees are usually the first of the school staff workers the children see when they start their day and the last ones they see when they go home. They are the caretakers of our schools and community colleges. School bus drivers carry the most precious cargo, our children. Parents want the peace of mind that comes from entrusting the person behind the wheel in their children's school bus. 
   Getting kids to and from schools safely and on schedule makes bus drivers, mechanics, and other transportation personnel an integral part of our schools and of our communities. Classified employees in the office, clerical and administrative staff, maintain attendance records, answer the phones, and interact with parents and school officials. School nurses help children with scrapes and cuts, assist with medications, and help keep accurate records of immunizations and students' medical history. All of these school employees are vital to the success of our schools. 
   Without skilled facilities and maintenance workers, our children would not have safe and comfortable places to learn. A lot of work is required to maintain a school community and keep it running smoothly. Custodians keep the schools clean. Groundskeepers keep the grounds safe for sports and other recreational activities. And facilities workers foresee and troubleshoot problems in school buildings. These classified workers provide a valuable service to our schools. 
   Many times the meal students receive at school is the best or only meal they get each day. Food service workers play a significant role in the educational process by providing nutritious meals for children. Research shows that good nutrition enables a student to meet their educational and physical potential. 
   Para-educators, librarians and other instructional assistants, support and  enhance the work of teachers in all components of the educational process. The increased use of para-professional staff in education across the United States has been well documented, as has the change in their role from largely clerical to instructional duties. These professionals play a key role in ensuring student achievement. 
   Together, with certified school employees, teachers, and administrators, classified school employees work hard to provide productive, safe and stable environments for our children that are conducive to learning. Classified school employees strive for excellence in all areas relative to the educational community. 
   For that, I ask that we annually recognize a National Classified School Employee of the Year and honor the invaluable contributions of all classified school employees for their tireless commitment to the academic success, safety and well-being of America's children, and I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 376.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (NATIONAL PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 371 to recognize National Physical Education and Sports Week, which took place this year from May 1 to May 7, 2007. 
   Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote: ``The first wealth is health.'' Today, these words could not hold more significance. In an increasingly technologically advanced society dominated by the Internet, cell phones, BlackBerrys, and, yes, electronic video game controls, the evidence is growing and is more convincing than ever. People of all ages who are generally inactive can improve their health and well-being by becoming active at a moderate intensity on a regular basis. 
   Regular physical activity substantially reduces the risk of a number of preventable diseases such as coronary heart disease, the Nation's leading cause of death; and decreases the risk of stroke, colon cancer, diabetes, and high blood pressure. It also helps to control weight, contributes to healthy bones, muscles and joints, reduces falls among elderly adults and is associated with fewer hospitalizations. Moreover, physical activity does not need to be strenuous to be beneficial. People of all ages benefit from participating in regular moderate-intensity physical activity, such as 30 minutes of brisk walking five or more times a week. 
   These are facts we should impress upon our children to ensure they lead health-conscious lives. Yet according to the Surgeon General's ``Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity,'' only half of adolescents participate in regular physical activity, and one-fourth report no physical activity at all. 
   In addition, we find that more than a third of young people in grades 9-12 do not regularly engage in physical activity. Additionally, daily participation in high school physical education classes dropped from 42 percent in 1991 to only 33 percent in 2005. Physical activity offers a broad range of benefits, including the prevention of obesity, improves self-confidence and the overall sense of well-being. 
   Physical education programs within school settings can set the stage for how children view physical fitness, activity levels, and future health. Physical education programs also include general health and safety information, as well as providing opportunities for students to learn how to cooperate with one another in a team setting. Equally important is the fact that physical education programs can teach students that physical activity can be fun. 
   With a broad range of games and activities, children are exposed to forms of exercise that incorporate teamwork, strategy, skill-building exercises, and other curricula such as math. Indeed, physical education plays an important role in the development of an individual, just as a classroom education does. 
   I join my colleague, Mr. Altmire, in calling for the communities to work with schools, along with key community stakeholders to craft and implement a local wellness plan as required in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I'd like to thank my colleague from Tennessee. Thank you for your leadership, Ms. Blackburn. You're doing a wonderful job. I had the opportunity to serve with you in the State Legislature, and we fought off a State income tax together back in our home State. And it worked well in Tennessee and it would work well here to keep our taxes low. 
   As you well know, mothers and fathers all across Tennessee, I'm more concerned about East Tennessee, to be honest with you, but mothers and fathers all across East Tennessee and across America sit around their kitchen tables putting budgets together. They have to make decisions on how am I going to fill up my pickup truck or my car and it costs over $50 a tank? How am I going to put food on my table? How am I going to pay my housing payment? How am I going to pay for my health care? Those are some of the things that real Americans, real mothers and fathers have to make decisions about. 
   And if you look at the gasoline prices and you look at the energy bill that actually came out of this House back in December, I voted against the legislation. It had new taxes. It had new regulations. The only thing it didn't have was any new energy. And I think the American people are starting to feel that today, and because of that, they're starting to see increases in things such as their food bill going up. 
   I know my wife comes home every week and says, I can't believe how much our grocery bill's gone up this month. So people all across East Tennessee are struggling to make ends meet. 
   The Democrat budget resolution fails the test of fiscal responsibility miserably. Instead of exercising fiscal restraint and lowering taxes, the Democrat budget raises taxes, as you well know, by $683 billion over the next 5 years. You heard me correctly. $683 billion over the next 5 years. 
   And as it's been pointed out, that is the largest tax increase in America's history. Not only America's history. It's the largest tax increase in America's history, but it's also the largest tax increase of any country in the world. That's pretty amazing. 
   I don't go home every weekend and hear people say, if you could just raise my taxes, my family will do better. I hear just the opposite. Keep taxes low. Keep regulations low. Lower gasoline prices, and let me succeed. 
   This budget actually blows away the previous record tax increase back in 1993. That was $443 billion. 
   These are real tax hikes being imposed on real people. Here are some of the staggering statistics for families in Tennessee's First District. According to the Heritage Institute, because of the Democrat budget, the average taxpayer in my district will be forced to pay an increase of $1,596, and it will result in almost 2,000 jobs being lost, and a loss of $188 million in the First District's economy.     
   That's not what I hear when I go home every weekend to east Tennessee: If you could just raise my taxes, increase regulations, then it's going to be good for my family. That's not what I hear. I hear, Keep taxes low, keep regulations low, lower gas prices and get government out of my way and we will be able to do better. 
   And by reimposing the marriage tax, you know, I hear comments here in Washington that, well, if we could only tax the wealthy. Well, when I go home to east Tennessee every weekend, there's a lot of married folk that are not wealthy. That's just common sense. And by bringing back the marriage tax, roughly 23 million taxpayers will see their taxes increase by $466 by the year 2011 simply because they're married. I don't know if that's the policy that we need to be bringing forth in this Congress. That's not what I hear when I go home to east Tennessee every weekend. 
   We have a choice between bigger economy or bigger government. Taxing and spending is not a road we need to head down. Ronald Reagan once said, ``We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.'' 
   I think we, as Members of Congress, need to be more concerned about the budgets of mothers and fathers who have to put a budget together around their kitchen tables back in East Tennessee and across America rather than growing a Federal budget that supports out-of-control spending that relies on taking money from the very mothers and fathers who are struggling to make ends meet back in northeast Tennessee and across America. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Blackburn, for her leadership in putting on this budget school; and if we could just get back to using some common sense, we will go forward in America. It's worked well for over 200 years; we just need to get back to that common sense. 
   Thank you for your leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (OUR CONSTITUENTS' NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. I would like to thank the gentlelady from Colorado for doing this special hour. I don't think there's anything more important facing Americans right now and facing this Congress than to deal with the high cost of energy, and I thank you for your leadership. 
   With the national average cost of gasoline at the pump today at $3.98 a gallon, moms and dads across the country are struggling to balance the family budget. It breaks my heart, and I know of a young family back in northeast Tennessee just trying to make enough money to make it to work or take their child to school. It breaks my heart when we have senior adults that are on a fixed income that don't have the opportunity to have more money, to be able to afford the gasoline to go to the doctor or go to the hospital or go to the grocery store. It breaks my heart when you have a small business that's trying to create those jobs and make life better for their fellow man. It breaks my heart. 
   This Congress must pass meaningful legislation to reduce the price of gasoline and fuel at the pump, and we need to do it soon. 
   Just recently, Shell Oil Company Chairman John Hofmeister testified before the Senate on why gas prices are so high. He said, ``As repetitive and uninteresting as it may sound, the fundamental laws of supply and demand are at work.'' 
   Over the past few weeks, I along with most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle have produced an 
   energy policy, not just a piece of an energy policy, but a true energy policy that addresses our supply of American energy. This energy policy explores all facets of our energy needs, from drilling for American oil and natural gases to using alternative fuels like switchgrass and ethanol. The policy increases American supply, which will effectively lower prices. 
   This energy policy will help people like Earl Humphreys, who owns and manages Lawn Boyz Lawn Care in Bristol, Tennessee. Earl told me that he may not be able to continue his business much longer because of high fuel prices. He is not making enough money to support his family, purchase his fuel, pay his staff, and keep the doors open on his family-run business. How sad. 
   People like Earl are relying on Congress to do something. Colleagues on this side of the aisle and I have offered nothing but solutions. On the other side of the aisle, they've offered nothing but excuses. 
   Congress' Democratic leadership is out of touch with the American people like Earl. Instead of increasing American energy supply so that prices can go down and Earl can continue to support his family, the Democrat leadership wants to tax energy producers, stifle American production, and abandon cars, SUVs and pick-up trucks that we all rely on. 
   Recently, one Congressman proposed a 50-cent tax increase on gasoline. Now, that makes absolutely no sense to me. We can't tax and regulate our way out of an energy crisis, and we can't tax your pick-up truck from empty to full. 
   Leadership's energy policies have been to conduct seven investigations into price gouging, conduct four investigations on speculators, and create $20 billion in new taxes on oil producers. Unfortunately, the leadership of Congress' policies don't save Americans any money at the pump. 
   In fact, gasoline prices have increased from $2.33 a gallon to $3.98 per gallon since Speaker Pelosi and her Democrat colleagues took control of this Congress last year. That's not a solution. 
   When China and other growing industrialized nations are moving from bicycles to cars, Americans are being made to go from cars to bicycles. That's not a solution. 
   Currently, China is drilling for oil and natural gas almost in sight off the coast of Key West, Florida. The irony here is that while China is out there drilling, America can't, under the leadership of this Congress. 
   What is it going to take to make this Congress realize that we need to increase American energy supply and decrease our dependence on foreign energy, our dependence on people that hate us and hate our freedoms? 
   The majority of the American people understand, East Tennesseans understand and I understand, Earl understands and people from Bristol, Tennessee, understand, we must take immediate action to allow for drilling in an environmentally safe way on American soil and off our coasts. In the Outer Continental Shelf alone, it's estimated that we have over 17 billion barrels of oil, oil that someone else is drilling for. On the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve alone, we have the potential to provide consumers with over 1 million barrels of oil per day. We need solutions. 
   We must take immediate action to allow for the construction of new refineries, and we can do that on old military bases. 
   We must take immediate action on production of natural gas where our supply is abundant. Eastman Chemical Company, which is located in my district in northeast Tennessee, has been using clean coal gasification to meet their ever increasing energy needs on a daily basis. 
   We must take immediate action to allow for the construction of safe nuclear power plants. For instance, France currently powers 80 percent of their energy needs from safe nuclear power plants. 
   We must take immediate action using alternative fuel sources, like switchgrass and ethanol from nonfood sources. New technologies like switchgrass and ethanol are exciting and will be part of our solution to lower high energy costs. 
   We must take immediate action by using clean coal technology, something that the Germans used in World War II. This is not futuristic. They were doing it in World War II. Coal is not some smutty leftover from the Industrial Revolution. We have approximately 250 years worth of coal right here in the United States, and you can take a lump of coal and actually turn it into gasoline and drive your car and fly jet planes. They did it in World War II. 
   We need solutions. Republican energy policies like the ones I've just listed will save every American at least $1.82 per gallon of gasoline. That's $36.40 for each 20-gallon tank full of gasoline. Tennesseans like Earl sure can use a $1.82 discount at the gas pump. 
   We need solutions. Americans like Earl are looking for solutions, not excuses. The time for solutions is now. That's why I've cosponsored the No More Excuses Energy Act. It combines all these different types of energy to bring down the price at the pump and make sure we have energy to heat our homes in the winter. We need solutions, not excuses.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (SBA VETERANS' PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2366, the SBA Veterans Programs Act of 2007. I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative, bipartisan manner to bring this bill, authored by Mr. Buchanan, a freshman member of the committee, to the House floor. 
   No one can debate the sacrifice that America's veterans have made and continue to make in defense of our country. While the repayment of that debt may never occur, we can certainly provide them with the needed assistance to prosper in civilian life. H.R. 2366 is a modest contribution to repaying the debt and helping them make a smooth transition into civilian life. 
   The bill recognizes that veterans learn a variety of critical skills. Recruitment advertisements for the armed services highlight the various technical skills that they can obtain through the military. These skills clearly are valued in civilian companies. In addition, the military inculcates its members with other important skills such as leadership, decision-  making, teamwork, and the drive to win. All of these are critical to success as a small business owner. 
   The military does not teach its members how to take these skills and transfer them to starting a business. They require additional training to understand the key components of operating their own business without first having to serve a sort of ``apprenticeship'' working with others. 
   In 1999 Congress recognized that more services should be directed to help the 25 million veterans start and grow their small businesses. Those efforts succeeded because a number of small businesses owned by veterans have grown to 14 percent of all small businesses. 
   Despite this success more must be done to assist our veterans in the startup and operation of their businesses. Outreach must improve to ensure that veterans wishing to start their own businesses will have the training and advice needed to transfer their skills to entrepreneurship. 
   The technical advice and assistance are not limited to veterans leaving the service. Reservists who operate their own small businesses have their own unique set of operational problems associated with their call-up to duty. They may not know how long their call-up will last, and they may need assistance in ensuring that they have in place a plan to operate their businesses while they are on Active Duty.     
   H.R. 2366 represents an effort to expand the focus of the SBA entrepreneurial assistance programs to our veterans. Of most significant importance is the need to create more Veteran Business Outreach Centers. These centers operate as cooperative agreements between the Small Business Administration and the non-profit entities. These centers provide entrepreneurial development services, such as business training, counseling, mentoring and referrals. They also conduct entrepreneurial business development workshops focusing on self-development and self-employment. Counseling services may range from development of business plans to identifying government procurement opportunities. 
   There are only four Veteran Business Outreach Centers. To serve our military men and women, more are obviously needed, and title III requires the establishment of two more centers in each of the next two fiscal years. 
   Another important element of the bill is the recognition of the changing nature of the military with a greater involvement of women. Title I of the bill requires the administrator to establish within the Office of Veterans Business Development a program to provide assistance to women veterans. Given the rapid expansion and success of women-owned businesses, it makes sense to ensure that the needs of women veterans are met when they seek to start and operate small businesses. 
   Our fighting men and women are the best in the world. Let us help them become the best entrepreneurs in the world by enacting H.R. 2366. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a member of the Small Business Committee.

   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, veterans have not only been critical to the defense of our Nation, but with the increasing number of service men and women engaging in entrepreneurship, they have also been invaluable in helping our economy grow. These men and women have dedicated their lives to preserving our freedom. It is crucial that we show our appreciation for their service. The SBA Veterans' Programs Act of 2007 does just that. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2366, the SBA Veterans' Program Act of 2007. I urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the request to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 2359, the SBA Entrepreneurial Development Programs Act of 2007. 
   I would like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for working in a cooperative and bipartisan manner to bring this bill to the floor. This bill makes modest yet necessary changes in the core entrepreneurial technical assistance programs of the SBA, the Small Business Development Center Program. 
   Small business development centers, on a relatively modest appropriation, provide free training sessions which last at least 1 hour and free individual one-on-one counseling. The centers met a total of 700,000 individual business owners and prospective owners in fiscal year 2007. 
   Changes are necessary to clarify the statutory mandate and ensure that small business development centers are appropriately responding to the new challenges facing America's entrepreneurs. These alterations are reflected in title I of the bill. 
   Even though the program is more than 25 years old, there is no definition of the term ``small business development center,'' which substantially adds to the confusion interpreting the statutory language. I would like to thank the chairwoman for including the definition in the term. 
   Another key change demonstrates the need to update the mission of the small business development centers as technology and business practices change. Broadband access is no longer a luxury for many, if not most, small businesses; yet the only reliable data on broadband access in America comes from providers that make the reports to the Federal Communications Commission. 
   Congressman Fortenberry, the ranking member of the Committee's Subcommittee on Rural and Urban Entrepreneurship, had the idea that rather than relying on these providers, a more accurate picture might come from actually asking individuals whether they had access to broadband services. Mr. Fortenberry thought it would make sense to have the center survey their clients when they come in the door on the availability of broadband service. The survey might prove a valuable addition to supplement the existing data from broadband providers. And without appropriate information on broadband access and penetration, it is impossible to develop policies that ensure small businesses will have affordable access to broadband. 
   Title II also includes a mechanism to increase the capacity of small business development centers to offer regulatory compliance assistance to small businesses disproportionately affected by erroneous regulatory burdens. It is an idea supported by the House in the previous four Congresses and by the National Federation of Independent Business. I would like to thank the chairwoman and Mr. Sestak for including this critical assistance to small business owners. 
   Ultimately, H.R. 2359 is designed to help small businesses get the advice and assistance they need to continue their ever-increasing importance in maintaining America's prime place in the global economy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I recognize Mr. Sestak, the sponsor of the legislation, for as much time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. It is a great opportunity. As we get ready to conclude this second week of the 110th Congress, I look back over this time, and I think of the elections. We look  back at the elections that took place, and I think the American people voted for change. I think there has been a change, as the majority changed, but I am not sure it is the change that the American people voted for. 
   I tell you what I heard back in my district about change: Government had gotten too big. I think the American people voted for change to make sure that we brought some responsibility to the government. 
   If I look back over what has taken place in the last 2 weeks, we are not going towards the change the American people voted for; we are going just the opposite. I don't think the American people are going to be happy with that type of change. 
   One of my roles in life as a Tennessee State representative was to work with the Democratic majority in Nashville to open up government. When I first went in to the Tennessee legislature, I went in and I found out that you could go on to the House floor, in the committee system, the subcommittees, and take votes, and those votes were not even counted. That is just wrong. 
   I thought it is going to be nice and refreshing to go to Washington, where we have an open process, and we have a party that has just taken over the majority, and they tell us, it is going to be even better than it was. 
   When I look back at Tennessee, you could cast a vote in committee or subcommittee, and you could tell the speaker, Mr. Speaker, don't worry about me, I am with you. Then you could go back to your home district and say, don't worry about me, I am with you, and be talking about two different things. 
   I was hoping it was going to be different as I came to Washington. It was, until last week. 
   Last week, one of our first votes on the House floor was to close the House of Representatives and the Rules Committee to the American people. That is not openness. That is not transparency. That is just wrong. That is exactly where we have come to in this House of Representatives. We have come to a situation where Rules Committee Members can go in and decide on the American people's business and not have their votes counted. That is not right. 
   Then we look at some of the other things we have voted for on the House floor. Again, as we recall, the American people voted for change, and in my district, the first district, the beautiful mountains of east Tennessee, I think they were telling me, and I think as we saw change coming across the United States, they wanted the government to be more responsible. 
   What I found the first week we are here, we actually removed the rule that took a three-fifths majority to increase taxes, and we lowered that threshold in the majority rule down to a simple majority. 
   Now, Mrs. Blackburn, I don't know about you, but I certainly believe it will be much easier to raise taxes. I don't believe that rule would have been changed had they not have foreseen a tax increase coming down the road. 
   That is not what the people of Tennessee want, I can tell you that. I think what it leads to is bigger government, bigger bureaucracies, somebody has to pay. Money comes from the people, and it comes from small business owners. It comes from people that are willing to work hard. 
   Another vote we have taken in the first two weeks, well, I don't know exactly where the first 100 hours starts or when it stops, but in the first 2 weeks, we passed a bill on this floor, without my vote, that threatens the life of the unborn. 
   I think we have done it under some deception, because if you look at embryonic stem cells, they have been researched for a number of years; it was not illegal. The bill that was passed on this House floor did not change that law. It was about taxpayer funding of destruction of human life. I don't think that is what the people of the First Congressional District wanted. I don't think that is the change the American people wanted. 
   Another bill we dealt with was a bill that would put our national security under control of the United Nations. I certainly don't believe that is what the people of the First Congressional District or the people of America wanted. We are a sovereign Nation, we should be able to protect ourselves without the approval of the U.N. 
   In my opinion, bigger government is not always the answer. At times, oftentimes, it is the problem. 
   What I find as I talk to real people back in my district and what I believe deeply in my soul is that the answers to American problems come from our families; they come from our State legislatures, our local governments, our business owners. Big government in Washington is not always the answer. Oftentimes it is the problem. 
   With that, I yield back and welcome your comments.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Franks, thank you for your leadership on this very important issue. 
   To many of us across this great land of America, life is an emotional issue. To many of us, it is a Biblical issue. The Bible actually tells us that we are knit together in our mother's womb. 
   Let's go back and just think about a day that we lost a lot of Americans. Let's go back to September 11th, 2001. If you are listening across this great land, just think back how you felt on September 11th when you learned that 3,000 Americans had been killed. Do you remember where you were? Do you remember how you felt? It was 3,000 Americans killed that day. I know exactly where I was and I know how I felt. 
   Now, where were you on September 12th, September the 13th, September the 14th, September the 15th? Those days, almost 4,000 Americans were killed, and every day subsequent. We are losing Americans to the tune of almost 4,000 Americans a day. 
   Ronald Reagan once said ``abortion is only advocated by persons who have themselves been born.'' His pro-life position was not limited to the beginning of life issues, but extended all the way to natural death. It is clear that Reagan would have stood against pro-assisted suicide and euthanasia laws. In 1988, he declared ``The right to life belongs equally to babies in the womb, babies born handicapped and the elderly and the infirm.'' 
   In the years since our Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade and declared abortion a constitutional right, the assault Mother Theresa rightly called the ``war against the child'' has claimed nearly 50 million Americans, 1.2 million every year, and, yes, almost 4,000 babies every day. 
   Pro-life policies such as parental consent and waiting periods enjoy tremendous public support, 82 percent and 74 percent respectively. Washington, this Congress, should deny hundreds of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood and abortion centers that promote and perform abortions here and abroad. The unborn child has the right to life, and that right should not be taken away. 
   Roe v. Wade was poorly conceived and morally wrong. This decision should be overturned. Life begins at conception. An unborn baby should share the birthright of all Americans, the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   I yield back to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1473, to amend the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to require child care providers to provide to parents information regarding whether such providers carry current liability insurance. 
   Working parents depend on child care so they can earn an income needed to support their families, as well as ensure that their children are well cared for in a safe environment while they are working. As such, child care is an integral part of the daily routine of millions of American families with young children. Research clearly shows us that the quality of child care has a lasting impact on a child's well-being and ability to learn. 
   Children in poor quality child care have been found to be delayed in language and reading skills and display more aggression toward other children and adults. School-age children's academic performance is enhanced by attending formal child care programs of at least adequate quality, according to several studies. 
   The bill before us today does not reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant. Rather, it amends current law to do several things. Most importantly, it requires each provider to openly post whether or not they have current liability insurance covering the operation of the child care business, and it requires each provider to supply parents with a written notice stating whether or not the provider carries liability insurance, including the amount of such coverage. 
   This legislation does not supersede any State regulations regarding facility licensure or insurance requirements. We as the Federal Government are simply asking providers to inform parents whether or not they hold liability insurance. While we have not utilized the normal process of committee consideration through hearings and markup of this legislation, we do support the purpose of this legislation in providing notification of insurance to parents. I hope to see the Child Care and Development Block Grant come before this committee for reauthorization during the 110th session of Congress. As we move forward reauthorizing this program, we must consider policy that makes way for learning environments to exist where children can obtain the cognitive skills or other skills needed for them to succeed socially and academically.     
   Federalizing child care is not the purpose of this bill, but rather properly and consistently informing parents of whether or not the child care center has liability insurance. In the future, we must ensure that Federal policy continues to provide States maximum flexibility in developing child care programs and policies as well as parental choice so the parents are able to decide the best-suited care for their children. I thank Representative Barrow for introducing this bill, and ask my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF OCTOBER 2007 AS ``COUNTRY MUSIC MONTH'' -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 58, expressing support for the designation of the month of October as ``Country Music Month'' and to honor country music for its long history of supporting America's Armed Forces and its tremendous impact on national patriotism. 
   Country music is a blend of popular musical forms originally found in the southern region of the United States. I am proud to represent the birthplace of country music, Bristol, Tennessee. Country music has roots in traditional folk music, Celtic music, blues, gospel music, and old-time music and evolved rapidly in the 1920s. 
   Its sound and style has changed dramatically over the years. In the early years, country music was more of the honky-tonk sound from the likes of Ernest Tubbs and Hank Williams. In the 1930s and 1940s, another form of country music emerged, western country. These songs romanticized the life of the lonely, but heroic cowboy on the western frontier. Some of those famous for this western style were Gene Autry, America's singing cowboy, and Roy Rogers, who later teamed with wife Dale Evans to become the famous duo of the genre. 
   Country music morphed once again in the early 1950s with a sound that became known as rockabilly, a combination of rock and roll and hillbilly music. This sound was made popular by many performers who developed staying power in the country music industry. They include the Everly Brothers, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, of course, the king himself, Elvis Presley. 
   By the 1960s, country music found its home in Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville sound was born. This was most definitely the sound of country, but the sixties saw more steel guitars and drums in the Nashville sound. This era of country music was the beginning of the age of contemporary country music which ushered in today's most popular artists, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Garth Brooks, and Reba McEntire. 
   Today, country music is at its highest peak of popularity. As of 2007, country is the most popular radio format in America, reaching 77.3 million adults, almost 40 percent of the adult population, every week. 
   Country music is a story of family, faith, freedom, pride and patriotism. It embodies the American spirit and has played an integral part in encouraging Americans to support our Armed Forces. These songs invoke feelings of determination, liberty and responsibility, all of which this great country was founded upon. 
   In 1964, October was declared Country Music Month in honor of its rich history and tremendous impact on national patriotism. Country music is America's music, and for this reason I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 58. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DAVID DAVIS of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my friend from Ohio for yielding. 
   It is interesting as I hear this debate, I am a new Member of Congress. I have been here 6 months now. I've heard speakers on the majority side talk about ``your amendment is irresponsible.'' I have a hard time understanding that. 
   Quite frankly, coming from Tennessee, holding the line on spending is not irresponsible. I heard another speaker talk about cuts. Well, actually there is no cut. What your amendment actually does is hold it at the levels of last year's spending. That is not a cut. 
   I have not gotten used to ``Washington speak'' yet, coming from the mountains in East Tennessee. In East Tennessee, a cut actually means you spend less money this year than you did last year. Your amendment says you're going to spend the same amount of money. We are talking about $34.2 billion. In East Tennessee, that is a lot of money. That goes a long way. 
   Actually, what we are looking at in this appropriation bill is a 9.5 percent increase in spending. When the rate of inflation is less than 3 percent, this is a growth in spending of almost three to four times the rate of inflation. 
   We have men and women all around America right now sitting at their kitchen tables trying to decide how they are going to balance their budgets. Why in the world are we in Congress trying to grow our budgets almost 10 percent when we have people across America that are trying to just balance their budget? Gas prices are high. They are worried about increases in taxes. 
   The least we can do, the very least we can do, is just hold the line on spending. That is not a cut. That is not how I learned about cuts back in East Tennessee.  
   I just hope that we will do everything we can to support your budget. I encourage support of your amendment. I encourage my colleagues to do so. Still, we are looking at, again, $34.2 billion. I think that is enough spending. We need to hold the line. Thank you for your amendment.
