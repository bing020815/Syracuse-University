<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (RELATING TO THE HOUSE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN SECTION 803 OF THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT, AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I won't take all of my time. 
   I just want to say that I am tremendously opposed to this resolution. When we passed Medicare Modernization and the Prescription Drug Act back in November of 2003, I was a freshman Member of the House, a physician Member of the House, and I felt very strongly that we needed to give our seniors a prescription drug benefit. They had been asking for it for years. The Democrats were in the majority most of those years. And yet in 2003, most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted ``no.'' I think it was their feeling, most of them, that the prescription drug benefit didn't go far enough. 
   On our side of the aisle, though, Mr. Speaker, there was great concern of cost, and I truly believe that the prescription drug part D and Medicare modernization would not have passed this body had not section 803 been in there, that trigger to say when we have spent so much, the President would have to come back and offer a solution to try to control the cost and no better way than the medical liability reform to cut down on all of the defensive medicine that doctors practice. It's not the premiums that they pay for malpractice, it is the defensive medicine. All of these tests that are unnecessary. 
   And then, of course, to means-test part D, just as it would have mean-tested part B for these so many years, if we were not means-testing part B, the monthly premium would still be $15 a month instead of $96. 
   Defeat this resolution. Bring fiscal responsibility to this body.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (HONORING HELEN GANNON GINGREY ON HER 90TH BIRTHDAY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take time this evening to address the House of Representatives regarding a very important person, someone who has meant so much to me throughout my life. My mother, Ms. Helen Gingrey, turns 90 years old February 8, 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know that you and Members of the House of Representatives will want to join me tonight in saying ``Happy 90th birthday, Mom.'' 
   It's important in this day and age for children to grow up in a strong family environment like the one that my parents provided for me. And I would hope that throughout my tenure here representing the 11th Congressional District of Georgia that I'll always be aware of how my actions will affect the American families who are, after all, the backbone of this Nation. 
   My mother has had a great life, and she's been a blessing to both her community and to her family. She is the daughter of Irish and Scotch immigrants, John Gannon and Ellen Heron. She was born in New York City in 1918, where she grew up with her three sisters, Peggy, Mary and Catherine, and brother, Dan. Raised in Manhattan, she met and, after a 10-month courtship, she married my dad when she was 20 years old. 
   James Franklin Gingrey was a native of Aiken County, South Carolina. He and his two brothers and a sister, struggled in childhood after their mother died in childbirth at age 25. Dad came to New York at age 16 and near poverty with little means of support. God did not bless him with material things, but allowed him, by pure chance, to meet the love of his life, Helen Cecelia Gannon, my mom. Jimmy and Helen became husband and wife in 1938, and they remained together for 44 years until his death. 
   After Dad finished high school in the New York City Night program, my parents, with a 1-year-old son, William, Bill, my brother, moved back to South Carolina and settled in Edgefield. Soon the family unit grew to five, as my brother James and I were born in nearby Augusta, Georgia. 
   My dad left this world 28 years ago having worked side by side with my mom in a number of labor-intensive small businesses. These included, Mr. Speaker, a used car lot, a curb service drive-in restaurant, a package shop, and finally a ``Mom and Pop'' motel. They never had a chance to attend college, but by the sweat of their brow, they gave that opportunity to their three sons. To my knowledge, there were no welfare checks, food stamps or Medicaid program to lighten their load. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I honor my mother today, I want to thank her for a loving parenthood and for instilling in my brothers and me the principles of hard work, good education, personal responsibility, respect for the diversity of others, love of family, love of country but, most important, love of God. These are not only excellent principles for rearing children, Mr. Speaker, but also a good recipe for the initiatives we continue to work on here in the 110th Congress. 
   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to use the examples of Helen Cecelia Gannon Gingrey and all wonderful mothers like her to set an agenda that emphasizes and supports our Nation's greatest treasure, the American family.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (WATER USE EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3957--the Water Use Efficiency and Conservation Research Act. I commend my colleague from the Science Committee--Mr. MATHESON of Utah--for crafting this thoughtful legislation that was reported to the House on a broad bipartisan basis. 
   Over the past year, my home State of Georgia--and specifically my district--has experienced significant and historic drought conditions that have brought to the forefront what the future may hold for our local water supply. 
   In addition to the drought conditions in my district, a number of other States are facing similar challenges. Over the next 5 years, more than half of the States in our country anticipate some sort of water shortage that will wreak havoc on our environment, as well as our economy. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3957 addresses ways in which the Environmental Protection Agency can use its Office of Research and Development to promote technologies that increase water efficiency and conservation via collection, treatment and reuse of rainwater and greywater, and research on water storage. 
   I am encouraged that this legislation will promote the adoption of emerging technologies to help us make better use of one of our most precious resources--water. I am also very pleased that the Science Committee adopted an amendment that I offered directing the EPA to ensure that the research and development efforts resulting from this legislation complement all other EPA research and development endeavors. Proper implementation of a strategic research plan will ultimately make this program successful. 
   Madam Speaker, at a time when water shortages are becoming more commonplace in our Nation, I applaud the bipartisan work of the Science Committee under the leadership of Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall on this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3957.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, throughout the course of our Nation's history, the prosperity of America and its citizens has invariably been linked with the success of our economy. Our country should be proud of its entrepreneurs who are the key components of that success. 
   I would like to recognize and thank the National Franchisee Association for providing the support and resources necessary to maintain its membership which consists of Burger King franchisees. 
   The NFA was founded with a mission: ``To improve, preserve and ensure the economic well-being for all of its members.'' For nearly 20 years, the National Franchisee Association has delivered this promise by expanding its services and adapting to the ever-changing economic and technological landscape. 
   Today, the NFA's membership is comprised of approximately 1,200 franchisees from across the country, representing every district in every State. 
   NFA members employ thousands of citizens and provide individuals, especially our Nation's youth, with an opportunity to learn traditional American values, including hard work, cooperation and responsibility. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to welcome the NFA's membership to our Nation's Capital, and I thank them for their continuous positive contribution to the fabric of our society.

   Mr. GINGREY. I was just going to say: rules-republicans.house.gov. That is exactly right. The ranking member is correct. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Miami on the Rules Committee, my former colleague on the Rules Committee, he is still there, LINCOLN DIAZ-BALART, brought up that point about the second-degree amendments in reference to the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Akin. 
   Mr. Speaker, I had the same situation. As a former immediate past member of the Rules Committee who enjoyed, I thought, pretty good collegiality with both sides during the two years that I was privileged to serve on the Rules Committee, I had the same situation, a second-degree amendment, and I couldn't really get it filed until a first-degree amendment was actually brought in under the deadline. 
   There was no way. Mr. Diaz-Balart pointed that out. A second-degree amendment, by its very nature, is going to be a late amendment. They absolutely shut the door; they, the new majority. I was just absolutely astounded that that happened to a former member and colleague on the Rules Committee. 
   The whole point is, as the gentleman from California points out, this whole process where they promised to bring reform and openness has absolutely been a farce, a fiasco. They have closed down the process. They have done nothing of which they promised. I am glad to be here tonight to weigh in just a little bit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to yield back because other Members want to speak. I thank the gentleman from

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia, underwent a change of command. As a member of the Armed Services Committee whose State is home to Fort Stewart, I rise today to thank Major General Rick Lynch on a job well done as he moves on to Fort Hood, Texas, and to congratulate Major General Tony Cucolo as he takes command of the 3rd ID. 
   This is a command of monumental importance in the United States Army, Mr. Speaker. The 3rd Infantry Division has one of the most successful combat records of any United States Army division. It was the first conventional U.S. unit to enter Baghdad in 2003 and the first division to actually serve three tours in Iraq. 
   Major General Lynch commanded the division on this most recent tour in Iraq, during which time we saw undeniable progress. Major General Cucolo has large boots to fill. But I have every confidence that he is the right man for the job. 
   Having served as brigade commander at Fort Stewart from 1999 to 2001, he is returning to familiar turf. He returns to Fort Stewart from the Pentagon, where he served as the Army's chief of public affairs for the past 2 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope you will join me, and all of our colleagues, in honoring these two fine soldiers for their service to our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to also commend the majority in regard to title III and the overall civility tone as it pertains, of course, to conference committees and having the opportunity for Members of the minority conference team to be present, not to have things added at the last minute after all the conferees signatories have read the report and designate it as complete and then add something at the midnight hour. All of these things are good. 
   I was in the Georgia State Senate in the minority, and I remember the Democratic president of the senate appointing me to my first conference committee. I was thrilled. It was an issue on which I had worked very hard with the majority, and I couldn't understand why I was never called to a conference committee. And then at the sine die hour, all of a sudden this conference report was stuck under my nose and asked for my signature without even reading it, and I was absolutely appalled at that. So I commend the majority for wanting to clean that up, and I support it. 
   But I agree with my former chairman, now ranking member, of the Rules Committee in regard to the argument that was proffered just a minute ago that it doesn't really go quite far enough. But let me spend a little time continuing to make the point that he just made in regard to this issue of holding votes open. 
   Now, during the last 2 years, during almost the entire 109th Congress, after we passed an historic prescription drug benefit for 38 million seniors who had been waiting for 45 years because the now majority, when they were in control, could never deliver on that promise, all we heard for 2 years were these complaints of, well, you held the vote open 3 hours and 28 minutes. You were breaking arms of a former Member from Michigan, Mr. Smith, and others, and it was inappropriate, how appalling that was. 
   And now maybe you are right. Maybe holding the vote open for that purpose is inappropriate when the concerns of our constituents might be that when a Member in good conscience is opposed or in favor of a particular controversial piece of legislation and his or her vote is not going your way and so you get him in a corner or a back room and say, hey, what can we do for you? Or maybe what can we do to you if you don't vote with us? Like removing you, a good productive Member, from a certain select committee, or maybe we promise to put you, who is not quite qualified, on a good select committee that you have been wanting and pushing for for a number of years, and all of a sudden you grant them some earmark that is absolutely egregious, maybe almost as bad as the ``bridge to nowhere.'' 
   So I would say to my friends in the majority, why the modifier ``sole'' purpose? If you really believe this, as the gentleman from California just pointed out, take out that modifier. Let us not hold votes open beyond 15 minutes for the purpose of breaking an arm and trying to change someone's mind when they in good conscience have had plenty of time to consider the bill, to think about it, indeed, maybe even pray about it. I think it is inappropriate, and I agree with you. But let's get serious about this. Let's make sure we really change it and it is not just some window dressing to kind of make your argument that you have been trying to make over the last 2 years. Let us take out the modifier, close the loophole, get serious about this, and that is real reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to Title V of H. Res. 6 and encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure. 
   Since the election we have heard promises of grandeur from the new Democrat majority. They have promised to usher in a new era of civility, bi-partisanship, and cooperation into the halls of Congress. They have repeatedly stated that the American people want a civilized tone in Washington. But it appears the Democrats are ignoring their own message. 
   In the opening hours of this Congress, with their very first piece of business, the Democrats have put forth a resolution that is the opposite of civility and transparency--indeed, a total contradiction of the way they pledged to conduct business. For the first time in the history of this body, Madam Speaker, the Democrats have included closed rules governing future debate in the House rules package, and have even gone so far as to prevent the Rules Committee from meeting to deliberate these rules or the larger rules package. 
   But they did not stop there, Madam Speaker. After promising an open and fair process, the Democrats have allowed just 10 minutes of debate--that's 5 minutes per side--on Title V of this resolution. 
   This is no small measure, Madam Speaker. Included in Title V are closed rules governing debate on stem-cell research, the recommendations of the 9/11 commission, the cost of prescription drugs, and the federal minimum wage. Certainly the American people expect a debate of ideas and the proper congressional process for some of the most important issues facing our Nation. Instead, the Democrats will deliver 10 minutes of debate. 
   Further Madam Speaker, Title V of this resolution will prevent the votes of the Rules Committee from being made public. A veil of secrecy will fall over this critical committee they now control. This is not the transparency and accountability in our political process the Democrats have promised. 
   So, Madam Speaker, it appears the new age of the Democrat majority will unfortunately not live up to its much-hyped billing. Instead of more openness, fairness, and transparency, the Democrats have revealed the hypocritical nature of their disingenuous promises with their very first piece of legislation. Reneging on their campaign promises in the opening hours of this session is no way to build the spirit of trust and cooperation across the aisle. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope for the sake of the American people that the Democrats start adhering to their pre-election rhetoric and conduct the business of this body in a civilized manner.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, I have a number of concerns with the amendment offered by my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas, my colleague on the Science Committee. 
   Unfortunately, I do not believe that this amendment does anything to alleviate the Draconian problems presented to us by section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   Even if this amendment passes, Americans will still not be able to increase the supply of fuels from alternative sources derived from resources available in the United States. Oil shale, with its estimated 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum in rock, would remain trapped there in our southwestern States, I think five States have a lot of this oil shale that's there for the taking. We, furthermore, will not be able to use clean carbon captured coal-to-liquid fuel. 
   So the amendment intends to create an exception under section 526 for generally available fuel not predominantly produced from a nonconventional petroleum source, and NASA, under the amendment, will still be able to purchase Canadian fuels that do have traces of oil sands, as the gentleman says, that may create more of a carbon footprint than completely conventional fuel. And this is what basically section 526 is. As the gentleman explained, he is trying to allow an exception so that this fuel that we purchase from Canada, a lot of people think most of our foreign sources of fuel are from OPEC or Venezuela, but actually, Madam Chairman, they are from Canada. Some of this fuel does have the tar sands footprint in it. 
   The gentleman, and I have no objection to that, is saying let us continue to purchase this fuel and not be restricted by 526. Yet my opposition is this, the agency won't be able to utilize any of the sources of fuel that may be totally derived from resources we have readily available in the good-old USA, clean domestic alternatives, coal, natural gas, biomass and, as I mentioned, oil shale that is estimated to have 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum that can be extracted from that in our own country. 
   At committee markup, Science Committee and at the Rules Committee, I offered amendments that would have removed the handcuffs placed on the NASA administrator by section 526. I would have been happy to work with my good friend from Texas to protect his amendment so that implementation of it would have, indeed, a positive effect for NASA. Unfortunately, I just don't think the amendment does much of anything. 
   I fear that the amendment does nothing to rectify, as I said, the underlying problem with 526 that prevents the Federal Government, any agency of the Federal Government, not just NASA, but also the Department of Defense, which utilizes something like 380,000 barrels of refined petroleum products every day, every day, and the increased cost to the Department of Defense is $9 billion. Just the increase in the year 2008, the increased fuel cost to NASA over the last 5 years has been 400 percent. It has gone from $4.5 million a year to $18.3 million a year. 
   Our efforts should be focused on easing the pain felt by American taxpayers, not codifying this misguided policy, 526, that prevents us from future innovation. Again, the gentleman's amendment, in my opinion, does no harm, but it does very little good. 
   I felt compelled to stand and express my opposition--not strong opposition to the amendment--but rather to make this point that we need to allow the administrator of NASA to have a waiver, at least have a waiver if, in his knowledge of innovation and what they are doing in trying to develop alternative fuels that are available in this country, he would not be bound by the crazy restrictions put on him and other agencies by section 526 of this so-called Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 passed 17 months ago. Since that time the price of a gallon of regular gasoline has gone up by $1.70, up to over $4.05 a gallon. 
   I respectfully oppose the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am proud to be with my colleagues tonight, and I know a lot of people might wonder, Members of this body, why Congressman Westmoreland continues to lead these special orders kind of in the evening, sometimes even later than this hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I think most people understand in this body, we in the minority have no other forum. We have no other opportunity. Bills are brought to this floor under suspension, no amendments can be offered. When bills are brought under regular order, we have a closed rule and amendments are blocked. 
   The gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Price, talked about Congress going on vacation for the whole month of August. So we have this week and next week to get something done. As he points out, by the time we come back after that so-called August recess, we are going to have children, we are going to have our school children in our districts across this country, in my district, the 11th Congressional District of Georgia, walking to school because our school districts are not going to be able to afford the gasoline to put in those great yellow buses that are in our neighborhoods year in and year out.     
   We are going to be putting our children at risk. We have already talked about the price of groceries, and this is killing our economy. There is no question about it. This is absolutely killing our economy. 
   My colleague, his petition, a simple petition that he just said, you know, how many are willing? How many Members of this body, Republicans and Democrats, are willing to sign this petition saying that we will support increasing domestic supply so we are not dependent on people like Hugo Chavez and other people in the Middle East, Iran, or Ahmadinejad, these people that absolutely hate us, that hate our way of life, hate our success, and want to bring us down. If we don't do something about it, they are going to bring us down. 
   So I think Mr. Westmoreland mentioned earlier the number of Members that had signed the petition; I believe he said 192. I think he said that most of those were Republicans; I think there were a number of Democrats. How many Democrats, Mr. Westmoreland?

   Mr. GINGREY. Six. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe the Democratic majority enjoys a membership of 237, something like that, 237. Out of 237, six of them have signed this petition. Now, I don't know what percentage that is, my math is not that quick, it's pretty low, and you have got 186 Republicans out of about 198. That's a pretty darn high percentage of Republicans. It doesn't really make a lot of sense. 
   I am going to close my time, and I appreciate the gentleman yielding. Tonight I did one of these tele-town hall meetings where we call into our district. Both of us have done on both sides of the aisle, very popular, a great way to communicate with our constituents. I talked to people in three of my nine counties in northwest Georgia, Carroll, Haralson and Polk, great counties. In fact, Mr. Westmoreland and I share Carroll County. 
   Most of the questions were about energy and why in the world Congress was not doing anything. So why are you all not doing anything? 
   The final question, the lady said, I don't understand, with the poll numbers across the country, and people wanting us to drill now or drill here, and bring down that price of oil to give us some relief, why is Congress refusing to act? 
   I said to her, you know, from the political perspective, if somebody on the other side is trying to commit political suicide, well, you know, we stand back and let them do it. But in this instance, we can't afford to let them commit political suicide, because the people are suffering. The people are suffering. Republicans, Democrats and independents, and we need to come together in a bipartisan way and get this done. 
   As Mr. Price said earlier, we have very limited time. I am so thankful to Mr. Westmoreland for doing this, for bringing it to the attention of our colleagues. If anybody else happens to be watching out in the country, God bless them, because you need to call your Members of Congress and let them know how you feel. 
   I yield back to my colleague.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  
   I rise today in opposition to this rule. It is the latest example of a long line of broken campaign promises made by this Democratic majority to conduct the most open, fair, and inclusive Congress in history. However, the Democrat majority has taken this opportunity yet again to shut out and alienate nearly half of the American population from the democratic process. 
   But I not only rise today in opposition to the rule but the underlying legislation as well. I do so because this massive expansion of an entitlement program is an irresponsible way to spend American taxpayers' hard-earned money. 
   Mr. Speaker, the legislation that we will be debating on the floor of the House today increases this government-run health care program far past its original intent to help low-income families purchase health care coverage for their children. The reality is this bill does not protect the most vulnerable amongst our children and citizens. Rather, it diverts these precious resources from those who most need it in order to cover adults and already privately insured children.     
   In fact, the extra $35 billion the Democrats are asking American families to pay for is aimed at a population, Mr. Speaker, where 77 percent of the children already have private health insurance coverage. These children would simply be transferred from private insurance coverage to a taxpayer-funded, government-controlled health care entitlement program. 
   So I wholeheartedly support the concept of the continuation of the SCHIP program, because as a physician for nearly 30 years, I acutely understand how quality health care is critical for our American children. And that's why I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 3584, the SCHIP Extension Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation looks to extend the current SCHIP program for 18 months, and it focuses the program and its funds on those individuals who really need it: low-income, uninsured American children. 
   I am also a cosponsor of the Barton-Deal alternative to this 140 percent massive 5-year Democratic expansion. Barton-Deal increases funding by 35 percent, and this is sufficient to cover the poor children who have fallen through the cracks; it is estimated to be 750,000 to 1 million kids. That covers it, Mr. Speaker. 
   So I, again, want to say that I am adamantly opposed to this legislation, not because I don't support SCHIP, but because this legislation irresponsibly spends American tax dollars. And I believe Congress can and should do a better job, because I believe the American taxpayers deserve better. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule and the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding and the previous gentleman that spoke, the gentleman from Illinois, talking about those airline prices. There is no question what's causing that is the cost of jet fuel. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule where the Democratic majority has once again denied the American people a full debate on the ramifications of our Federal policies on American energy independence. Unfortunately the rule for H.R. 6063, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008, made only one Republican amendment in order and has effectively shut down debate once again, breaking the promise, as my distinguished colleague from Florida said, that Speaker Pelosi made that this would be the most open and honest Congress in history. 
   I, along with several of my Republican colleagues, offered two of the amendments that were not made in order. Our amendments would have worked to correct a misguided provision of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, section 526, that prevents the Federal Government from developing and implementing alternative fuels from domestic sources that could help NASA reduce fuel costs. 
   Over the past 5 years NASA has seen an increase of almost 400 percent in spending for jet fuel from $4.5 million in fiscal year 2003 to $18.3 million in fiscal year 2007. Put simply, this growth is out of control. NASA has been actively researching alternative fuel sources to help reduce fuel costs, not only for itself, but for other Federal agencies as well. Indeed, listen to this, the Department of Defense uses 380,000 barrels of refined products per day, 380,000 barrels.     
   They estimate that its increased cost of fuel in 2008 will be approximately $10 billion. Now this is just the delta. This is just the increase because of ballooning oil prices. 
   NASA, as my colleagues have pointed out, has historically been on the cutting edge of innovation with contributions that have been mentioned here, technologies this Nation uses on a daily basis. What a lot of people don't know, currently NASA is partnering with the Air Force on aggressive research to convert domestic energy sources--domestic, that means right here in River City--on aggressive research to convert things like coal, natural gas, biomass, oil shale into cleaner, yes, cleaner, and more economic alternatives to traditional jet fuel. 
   Gas prices continue to rise, and yet the Democratic majority, and I don't blame my colleague from Florida in the majority who I enjoyed thoroughly serving with on the Rules Committee, I blame the Democratic leadership. They have effectively stymied innovation at NASA that could potentially help us reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
   We have this great opportunity, and yet the leadership of the Democratic Party has turned their back on the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. My amendments, by either repealing section 526 or by providing a full waiver to NASA, just to that one agency as my amendments would have done, we could allow the agency to continue its ongoing work to develop emerging technologies and not be held hostage to baseless policies driven by out-of-control environmental extremists. 
   Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate that the Democratic majority again chooses to deny an open debate on important energy issues. So I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and this rule so we can help the Democratic majority live up to its promise to conduct the most open and honest Congress in history.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my former colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. Sessions, for yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong opposition to the rule and the  underlying legislations, S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. 
   Once again, the Democratic majority brings to the floor a closed rule on a bill that Members of this body would love to have the opportunity to make better through the amendment process. This legislation has not been given a committee hearing or even vetted in a markup. Instead, the Democrats in the House have said that they know best, period, in the 110th Congress. 
   Over 45 percent of the bills have come up under our closed rule, and less than 2 percent have enjoyed what we call an open rule that allows for full and honest debate, whether it's debate from a Democrat or a Republican. 
   Now their legislation was sent over to the other body in January, where they changed it, they amended it. So why, I don't understand, why do the House Democrats insist on shutting their colleagues in the people's House out of the process? It's okay in the other body, but it's not okay here. 
   Well, this new majority has sent a clear message when it comes to valuing the input of their colleagues. They don't. 
   On bills that clear committees unanimously, bills where both parties rush to the floor to applaud the final legislative process, the Democrats allow amendments on those. Let them offer them and be debated. But on an issue where the American people hold deeply differing views, the Democrats shut out ideas and debate. 
   By once again debating this stem cell legislation under the same closed rule, the Democratic leadership is saying to the American people this issue is the same today as it was in January, as it was last summer in the 109th Congress, as it was, indeed, back in August of 2001. 
   However, the reality is that this issue has fundamentally changed. Science is moving faster than bureaucracy and, yes, even faster than politics. Scientific breakthrough after scientific breakthrough shows that there are other ways to achieve the hope, the hope of medical cures, the new therapeutic treatments without any collateral damage mandated by the legislation that we are debating today. 
   Science has, indeed, outrun politics, and the American people, they deserve a full and comprehensive debate on a morally contentious issue such as this. 
   That's the reason that I offered an amendment, my colleague referred to it earlier, to the Rules Committee yesterday that would have replaced this ethically divisive legislation with a bill introduced by Representative ROSCOE BARTLETT, the gentleman from Maryland, and myself. We call it the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapy Enhancement Act. 
   This amendment would authorize the use of Federal funds to research alternative and ethical ways to extract embryonic life or pluripotent stem cells. My amendment would authorize the use of Federal funds to research alternative and, yes, ethical ways to extract these embryonic-like, or we call them pluripotent, stem cells; and that's what we should be debating on the floor of this esteemed body today, legislation that sidesteps the ethical questions of embryonic stem cell research altogether. 
   We don't have to go down this road that totally divides us. Some on the Republican side, some on the Democratic side, pro-life, pro-choice, if we can avoid that division, I think we ought to embrace the opportunity to do so. 
   That's why, reluctantly, I have to come and stand and oppose a rule. I have great respect for my colleagues on the majority side of the Rules Committee that I worked with for the last 2 years, but I think it's wrong to close a rule or a question of this importance. 
   So I do, I ask my colleagues, oppose the rule and oppose the underlying legislation. That's exactly what we need to do, because we can do this better, and we don't have to divide one another.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. And I do so, not because I oppose embryonic stem cell research, but because, as an OB/GYN physician, I oppose federally funded embryonic stem cell research that destroys human life. And the truth of the matter is, I am not alone in this belief, Mr. Speaker. In fact, I'm joined by nearly half the American public. Let me say that again: Nearly half of the American public opposes using taxpayers' dollars to fund embryonic stem cell research when a human embryo is destroyed in the process. 
   Now, I know that the supporters of this bill claim an overwhelming majority of Americans wholeheartedly endorse their bill. However, when these same Americans are asked specifically whether or not they would like the Federal Government to fund research that destroys a human embryo, the survey results refute that claim. In fact, over 60 percent, Mr. Speaker, of Americans do not support their money going towards destructive embryonic stem cell research. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's not the job of Congress to force the American taxpayers to fund research that they morally oppose. Rather, this body is charged with the awesome responsibility of being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar by supporting research that upholds the values of our society. And I want to remind my colleagues and the American people, today that is the question we're debating. We are debating whether or not American taxpayers should be forced to pay for research that destroys human life. Contrary to what we're hearing today, we are not debating whether or not embryonic stem cell research is legal in this country; because not only is it completely legal, but it is also well funded in both the private and public sectors. In fact, Mr. Speaker, between State governments and private sector, nearly $4 billion has been committed to embryonic stem cell research over the next 10 years. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as a society that has always valued and protected the  fragility of human life, we must reject this misguided attempt to force the American people into paying for something with which they fundamentally disagree. And I encourage my colleagues, oppose this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, over the past 3 years, we have repeatedly stood on the floor of this House debating whether or not to expand the Federal Government's role in funding embryonic stem cell research. Today I implore my colleagues that, for once in this debate, let the facts speak louder than fiction. Let us all put aside political posturing and debate the impact of this legislation. Let us ensure that the American people hear the truth. We do not have to sacrifice human life to further stem cell research. 
   Once again, we find ourselves debating the same stem cell legislation without any input from the Members of this House. Essentially the Democratic majority and their leadership is saying to the American people: This issue has not changed since we debated it in January, since we debated it last summer; in fact, since we debated it back in August of 2001. But that assumption is fundamentally wrong. The reality is that this issue has changed. Science has moved past bureaucracy and, in fact, past politics, to which it owes no allegiance. 
   There have been multiple scientific breakthroughs which show that there are other ways to achieve medical miracles without the collateral damage mandated by S. 5. The American people deserve a full and a comprehensive debate on these very, very successful alternatives. That is the reason that I am offering this motion to commit, which would replace S. 5 with a bill that was originally introduced by the other gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Roscoe Bartlett, and myself, called the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Research Therapies Enhancement Act. 
   This act would authorize the use of Federal funds to research alternative and ethical ways to extract embryonic-like, or pluripotent, stem cells. That is what we should be debating on the floor of this esteemed body today, legislation that mitigates the gut-wrenching ethical questions of embryonic stem cell research that damages or, more likely, destroys human life. 
   Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is the hope of embryonic stem cell research is not grounded solely in the fact that these cells are embryonic; rather, researchers are interested in embryonic stem cells because they are flexible, and they can specialize into any type of human tissue. Indeed, I doubt that the scientists care where these cells come from. 
   Pluripotent stem cells can be obtained in a variety of ethical and scientifically promising ways. They do ``not'' have to come from a living embryo which some call medical waste but others embrace as ``snowflake'' babies with priceless lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, this point cannot be illustrated any more clearly than in the ground-breaking research published in several scientific journals since the beginning of this year. In fact, just yesterday, Nature Journal published a study that shows research's ability to literally reprogram an adult cell taken from skin to achieve one of these pluripotent, or embryonic-like, stem cell states. This research offers the promise of generating embryonic stem cells without the collateral damage of harming human embryos. 
   Let me read to you a fascinating quote from this article: ``The race is now on to apply the surprisingly straightforward procedure to human cells. If researchers succeed, it will make it relatively easy to produce cells that seem indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells and that are genetically matched to individual patients.'' Mr. Speaker, that equates, my colleagues, to no rejection and no tumors. Hallelujah. Science has found a  way to support human life in terms of medical cures. The way we derive those cures is so important. 
   Earlier this year, researchers at Wake Forest University and Harvard published a study that showed the capability to obtain pluripotent stem cells again from amniotic fluid, which have the necessary characteristics of being fast-growing and flexible, and can be harvested, get this, Mr. Speaker, as early as 9 weeks into a pregnancy with no damage. 
   These are just two examples of new cutting-edge research which has fundamentally changed this stem cell debate. We no longer need to engage in an issue that divides this Congress, and indeed our country, in half. We no longer need to contemplate a unilateral decision to spend taxpayer dollars on research methods that half of the public morally opposes. 
   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this motion to commit.

   And I want to take just a second to join my colleagues from Georgia and particularly the two that are on the floor tonight, Dr. PRICE and Representative Westmoreland, in saying to our colleague CHARLIE NORWOOD that we are praying for you, buddy. All of us from Georgia, but every Member of this body on both sides of the aisle are praying that the miracle of God's healing will deliver you back to us soon, and we think about you constantly. 
   Mr. Speaker, this hour is a great opportunity for us to discuss the budget. And I had an opportunity this morning to be on the C-SPAN program, and the host said to me, Congressman, are you aware of the fact that one of the Members of the other body has recommended that maybe we need something called a war tax to pay for our Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom? And I said to the host, I know that has probably been done in the history of this country. Maybe it was necessary to fund a previous war. But the thing about this President and this administration is because of these economic principles of cutting taxes and growing revenue, fortunately, Mr. Speaker, we have been able to do this without raising the people's taxes. And I certainly commend President Bush for that foresight and wisdom and the former majority party as we supported those tax cuts when it was predicted that it would cost the economy over a 10-year period something like $1.3 trillion. 
   So what I would like to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle in particular as I wrap up quickly, and I know time is limited, on the defense budget, please, please do not cut future combat systems. Don't cut our missile defense system to pay for some social programs when the defense of this Nation is so important at this time of war. 
   With that, I really appreciate my colleague giving me the opportunity to weigh in tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (HONORING THE LIFE OF RAY BECK -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of football all-star and community hero Ray Beck, who passed away recently in Cedartown, Georgia. 
   Mr. Beck is a football legend both in my home State of Georgia and across the Nation. After 4 years as a star on the Cedartown High School football team, Ray attended Georgia Tech, my alma mater, to play guard for the legendary coach Bobby Dodd. 
   In 1951, he was named an All-American by the American Football Coaches Association and the Football Writers Association. That same year, he helped lead Georgia Tech to an 11-1 record and an Orange Bowl victory over Baylor University. 
   After college, Beck was drafted by the New York Giants. He was part of the 1956 World Championship Team. And Madam Speaker, that team included the likes of Y.A. Tittle, Kyle Rote and Sam Huff. They led the Giants to a 56-7 victory over the Chicago Bears, a far more lopsided score than the Indianapolis Colts achieved this past weekend. 
   On the football field, Ray was known as a team player, someone who gave his all to the game. Because of his tremendous work ethic he was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. 
   But Ray was more than just a football player. He was an active and enthusiastic supporter of the Cedartown community. The same attitude that made him a star on the field made him a hero in his community. There is hardly an organization in Cedartown that hasn't been touched by Beck's generosity. 
   Madam Speaker, he was chairman of the Cedartown Development Authority. He was president of the Cedartown Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Polk Medical Center Advisory Board, a board member of the Georgia Motor Trucking Association. 
   But perhaps he will be best remembered for a charity golf tournament he arranged with his long time friend, Doc Ayers. This annual event raised thousands of dollars for Polk County, for charities such as children's literacy and all the way to local food banks. 
   It is a little wonder Beck was named Citizen of Excellence by the Cedartown  Civic Arts Commission for his philanthropy to this great community. 
   One of Ray's former teammates commented that he was, and I quote, ``one of the people you could always count on.'' Ray took that attitude from the football field to the community of Cedartown, and his contributions to both will live on as his legacy. I send my deepest, deepest condolences to his wife, Claire, and to his whole family. I know all of Polk County mourns your loss. 
   Madam Speaker, as a younger generation looks to sport stars as heroes and role models, I hope they come across men like Ray Beck. He was committed to his team and committed to his community. He gave his all on the field and then gave back to the town where he was raised. He was generous with his time, his wisdom and his energy, and Cedartown, Georgia, is a far, far better place because of him. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the legacy of Ray Beck.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (METHAMPHETAMINE REMEDIATION RESEARCH ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, as Congress debates measures to clean up meth labs, I believe it is important to offer a physician's perspective to help some people understand why this drug is so dangerous. Also called crank, blue acid, speed, and ice, meth is a popular drug because it is cheap, easy to manufacture, and acts as a powerful stimulant. An investment of just a few hundred dollars in over-the-counter medications and chemicals can produce thousands of dollars worth of methamphetamine, which can be cooked in something as small as a suitcase. 
   The average meth ``cook'' annually teaches an average of ten people how to make the drug. Typical ingredients include over-the-counter cold and asthma medications containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine, in addition to red phosphorous, hydrochloric acid, drain cleaner, battery acid, lye, lantern fuel, and antifreeze. 
   In fact, users of this drug are often not aware that they are potentially ingesting toxic chemicals. The toxic fumes emitted during manufacturing are highly flammable, even explosive, and can suffocate plants, animals, and even people. For my colleagues concerned about the environment, each pound of meth produced leaves behind five or six pounds of toxic waste. Meth ``cooks'' often pour leftover chemicals and byproduct sludge down drains in nearby plumbing, storm drains, or directly onto the ground, creating long-term hazards: the chemical waste can remain in our soil and groundwater for years. The average cost to clean up a methamphetamine laboratory ranges between $2,000 and $3,000. However, this does not include the ancillary costs of cleaning up a former laboratory. 
   In February 2005, the Atlanta Police, U.S. Drug Enforcement, the MCS drug taskforce, and other law enforcement agencies discovered Georgia's first ``super lab'' at a house in Smyrna, Georgia, which is in the Congressional District I represent. With 39 pounds of meth-crystal and 250 gallons of the drug in liquid form, one mistake could have destroyed an entire neighborhood due to the explosive volatility of the materials. 
   No longer just the addictive scourge of 1970's biker gangs, meth is a very real problem that affects our children and neighbors in very real ways. The drug works directly on the brain and spinal cord by interacting with neurotransmitters--chemical substances produced in nerve cells--which communicate throughout the body. The foremost neurotransmitter affected by methamphetamine is dopamine, which is involved with our natural reward system. This is known as the automatic nervous system. For example, a pat on the back for a job well done, getting enjoyment from family and social interactions, and the feeling that our lives are meaningful, all rely on dopamine transmission. 
   With properties that target the nervous system, it should be no surprise that side affects of meth include extreme paranoia, violent behavior, rapid weight loss, tooth loss, hallucinations, unexplained voices, pale complexion, speech impediments, Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, depression, insomnia, suicide contemplation, and schizophrenia. It is important to mention these various symptoms and health problems because without proper clean-up unseen chemicals can spread from one home through entire neighborhoods, creating an unknown danger to current and future owners. 
   Considering the numerous dangers caused by methamphetamines, I believe it is more important than ever to make sure our law enforcement community has the laws, equipment, and training necessary to protect our communities from this drug. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the House of Representatives for the passage of today's Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007, which includes substantive legislation that will establish voluntary guidelines to assist state and local governments in the development and implementation of policies for the clean-up of former methamphetamine laboratories. 
   Mr. Costello. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 365, the Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act to initiate standards for methamphetamine (meth) cleanup in our neighborhoods. As a cosponsor of H.R. 365, I believe this legislation is necessary in order to protect unsuspecting families from the dangers of illegal meth labs and provide the necessary tools for law enforcement to detect labs throughout our communities. 
   As a member of the Congressional Caucus to Fight and Control Methamphetamine and a former law enforcement official, I am actively working with my colleagues to decrease methamphetamine use. In my home state of Illinois, there were 1,189 methamphetamine laboratory seizures reported in 2005, many in my district in Southern Illinois. In order to combat meth, I believe we need a comprehensive plan to deal with the environmental, health, and law enforcement challenges facing our communities because of the growing use of this dangerous drug. 
   Mr. Speaker, the national guidelines this bill creates will help protect our communities by ensuring that dangerous meth labs are cleaned properly and efficiently. It is my continued hope that by raising national awareness about meth and providing increased federal resources to combat the drug problem, we can make significant progress to overcome methamphetamine use. This legislation is a critical step we can take toward this goal and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 365.

   But when we did that press conference today, Mr. Speaker, with our Communications Chair of the Republican Study Committee, our chairman, the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and John Campbell, the gentleman from California, who chairs our Subcommittee on the Budget and Spending Task Force and many other of the members of the Republican Study Committee and talked about this four point Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Everything has got an acronym. You could call that TABOR, I guess, TABOR. But the gentleman from Texas who just preceded me outlined those 4 points. I don't need to go back into that. 
   But clearly, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights is just as important, as one of the Hosses from the State of Georgia, our dear esteemed colleague, Charlie Norwood introduced a bill a number of years ago, the Patient Bill of Rights. I love that. The Patient Bill of Rights. I wasn't a Member at the time. It inspired me to become a Member, because he was concerned about the physical well-being when the excesses of the managed care industry, if you will, were really causing people a hard row to hoe to get to their doctor of choice. And Charlie Norwood, Dr. Charlie, had that Patient Bill of Rights because he was concerned about the physical well-being of America. And what we are talking about now is the fiscal well-being in this Taxpayer Bill of Rights, equally as important. 
   And again, I am proud to be supportive of my colleagues in the Republican Study Committee. I hope that we can have the Blue Dog Democrats embrace this TABOR, Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
   I will tell you this, Mr. Speaker. This is the season of Lent. It is the season when Christians reflect on their spiritual life, and they think about repentance and doing things better and being better toward their fellow man and making sacrifices. 
   And I will tell you, I have thought about that during this Lenten season; we are midway at this point, of my political life and what changes I, as a Member, can make, representing those 650,000 constituents in the 11th District, Northwest Georgia, what can I do better for them? 
   Have I lost my way a little bit? 
   I want to say this, Mr. Speaker. And these are my two good friends that are on the floor with me. They have not lost their way. And they have been an inspiration to me from day one, back in 2003, when we were sworn in, in regard to their total commitment to fiscal responsibility and taking that leadership role. 
   I have been maybe, from time to time a little bit squishy. Some of those people that come in, you know, it is easy, everybody needs a little bit more. Just what is going to make you happy? Well, just a little bit more spending from the Federal Government. 
   But I am recommitting myself during this Lenten season, both spiritually and politically, because what has really happened, Mr. Speaker, and I think my acting Legislative Director said this to me as we were chatting earlier this evening. He said, you know, Congressman, what has happened here is the Federal Government has become this giant riding lawnmower, this giant riding lawnmower, when the Founding Fathers really intended it to be a weedeater, and that is exactly what has happened. We need to go back and with this Taxpayer Bill of Rights, go back to the days when the Federal Government was a 
   weedeater, and we can do it. And I commend my colleagues, and I appreciate the opportunity to share those thoughts with my colleagues tonight. 
   And I yield back.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The gentleman from Texas, the ranking member of Energy and Commerce, who just spoke from the well, he said it exactly right. This is a political ploy, bringing this bill up under suspension, in my opinion, Mr. Speaker, to give Members on the other side of the aisle the opportunity for cover on this bill, this Castle-DeGette legislation that's coming up tomorrow. 
   When King Solomon ordered that the baby be cut in half, Mr. Speaker, who knew that someone would actually take him up on the offer. And yet regrettably, this bill before us today, H.R. 2560, it aims to figuratively and literally cut the baby in half. 
   Supporters of this legislation claim that H.R. 2650 bans human cloning. This claim could not be further from the truth. If we really want to ban human cloning, then the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Weldon) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak), in a bipartisan way, they have the right bill, and this was reintroduced by Representative Weldon last night. I'm a proud cosponsor of that. That bans human cloning for any purpose, reproductive or research. 
   I'm not impugning the motive of Representative DeGette, maybe it's inadvertent, and maybe hopefully she understands through this discussion today about the bill that, inadvertently, this promotes cloning for research purposes. 
   We believe, those of us who are part of the pro-life caucus, strongly believe that when you clone a human Dolly, that is a human being, and then you slice it and dice it to get stem cells and then it's required that you destroy it because it becomes a crime if it's implanted in a woman to become a child. Then we say that you are indeed creating life and destroying life, not maybe for the purpose of reproduction but for the purpose of research, and that is wrong. 
   And that is why we need to vote down this bill today, and I strongly oppose it.

During this 6-day trip to Washington, D.C. and New York City, the Holy Father, who serves as a wondrous example of faith and leadership, will help Catholics and all Christians renew their faith by delivering mass to tens of thousands of people.

   Despite his relatively short tenure, Pope Benedict XVI has emerged as a vocal and effective leader for Catholics throughout the world. Over the past 3 years, His Holiness has stressed the need for a return to fundamental Christian values in response to what many see as the world's sloping trend toward secularism. 
   As Pope, he has focused on the importance and sanctity of human life, especially the life of the unborn, an issue that's very important to me, both as a member of the Catholic Church and as a Member of Congress. But every American, regardless of party affiliation or religious belief can find hope in his message of freedom and justice for all people.

   Today, Speaker Pelosi will stage an elaborate and politically timed signing ceremony for the Iraq troop withdrawal bill Congress passed 5 days ago. As President Bush has already vowed to veto this irresponsible legislation, Speaker Pelosi's theatrics are simply slowing down the process of getting much needed funding and money to our troops. 
   Let me remind the American people that our warfighters have been waiting nearly 3 months for Congress to pass the President's requested supplemental funding for the war. The Democratic leader might think a few days here don't mean much, don't matter much. Every day they stall to appease left-wing activists is another day our military must wait for the funding it needs to win this war. 
   Madam Speaker, I admonish Speaker Pelosi to quit playing politics with our  national security. Let Congress vote on a clean funding bill for our troops. The Democratic leaders may be content to lose the war, but the troops are in harm's way, and they certainly will not lose this war.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, BATFE, has been in operation without substantial changes since the days of prohibition, bootlegging and gang violence in the 1920s and 1930s. 
   Last year the House Judiciary Committee considered legislation that would have introduced real reform to BATFE, updating the agency for the 21st century, although time ran out before Congress could get anything accomplished. 
   One issue of reform I remain particularly concerned about is how BATFE actually tests firearms submitted by law-abiding firearm designers and manufacturers seeking approval to put their product on the market. 
   Mr. Chairman, without written and uniform standards, gun manufacturers are left guessing about which agent will inspect the firearm this week, whether or not they will be able to ship a product out to potential customers, and whether or not BATFE agents might even prosecute someone because of a shipping mistake or a firearm malfunction. So I have introduced legislation called the Fairness in Firearms Testing Act to address this problem, and it requires BATFE, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to actually videotape firearms tests for the purpose of general oversight, and encourage the agency to adopt these testing standards. However, the amendment I'm offering today would cut right to the point by withholding funds to BATFE if they do not write and publish these testing standards. 
   More specifically, this amendment creates a level playing field for all United States firearm manufacturers who depend on getting a firearm patented and on the market as soon as possible. 
   Mr. Chairman, without written procedures, BATFE has literally a free rein to mistreat manufacturers, change their mind after the fact, and leave both manufacturers and customers at a legal and financial disadvantage. In fact, BATFE regulations are so inconsistent that some manufacturers have been threatened with prosecution after receiving written approval for their products from other BATFE personnel. 
   Since 2002, 85 percent of American firearm manufacturers have been forced to close their doors. Let me repeat that, Mr. Chairman. Since 2002, 85 percent of American firearm manufacturers have been forced to close their doors. There are only 373 licensed firearm inventors and manufacturers left in America. Moreover, with the increase in number of imported firearms purchased by civilians and law enforcement alike, our Nation is at a strategic defensive disadvantage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I realize that the chairman has reserved a point of order, and he will explain that, I'm sure, momentarily, but it's my understanding that if I do agree to withdraw this amendment, that the chairman and the committee will work with me to help bring reforms to the BATFE, including these written standards, to help United States firearm manufacturers. I would be happy to yield to the chairman and to engage in a colloquy with him regarding that. Otherwise, in the absence of an agreement, then certainly I want to go forward with my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the chairman.

   Mr. GINGREY. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I understand exactly what the chairman is saying. I'm not necessarily expecting any hard and fast promises on his behalf. 
   And I didn't mean, Mr. Chairman, for the amendment to catch the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee by surprise in any way, not to be blind-sided or coming up at the last minute. We've had the amendment, we filed the amendment. In fact, I had, Mr. Chairman, introduced legislation pertaining specifically to this effect last year in the 109th Congress, so this amendment basically is a follow-up to that legislation. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia, the distinguished chairman. I appreciate your spirit of cooperation. And I know there are some concerns about the amendment, I appreciate that. But I welcome your support on this matter, and I look forward  to working with you. Let's discuss it and make sure you understand exactly where I'm coming from in regard to the amendment.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Young Women's Christian Association, or YWCA of Northwest Georgia for their efforts to eliminate the epidemic of domestic violence that transcends all ethnic, racial, age, gender and socioeconomic boundaries. 
   The YWCA of Northwest Georgia, under the leadership of Executive Director Holly Comer, has made it their mission to bring the issue of domestic violence to the forefront and to educate Georgians on ways to prevent abuse and violence within the home. 
   Mr. Speaker, the YWCA of Northwest Georgia is not only the sole domestic violence shelter located in the heart of my 11th District in Cobb County, but has also taken a leadership role in combating domestic violence throughout the State of Georgia. 
   It was, in fact, the YWCA of Northwest Georgia that open the very first shelter for victims of domestic violence in the State of Georgia. Through the ministry of Cobb Shelter, the YWCA has worked together with victims, families, social service providers, and criminal justice officials to stop the spread of domestic violence 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing YWCA of Northwest Georgia and similar groups throughout the country for their contributions toward making our Nation's homes safer places for our children and families.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer, and certainly my colleague, the author of the bill, Congressman Kingston from Savannah. 
   I want to tell the Congressman that there are no city slickers in Augusta, Georgia. I am an Augusta native. There are probably not any in Savannah either. Maybe they are all in the Atlanta area. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise today in strong support of H.R. 1808 to designate Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, my hometown, as the Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
   I am proud to stand here today as an original cosponsor of the bill, not just because Charlie Norwood was a great American who loved his country and found any way he could to serve, but also because I had the honor and privilege to serve with him, to personally know Charlie and to count him as one of my close friends. 
   Charlie, as has already been said, I am just proud to repeat a lot of this, but Charlie was a native son of Georgia, growing up in Valdosta. He graduated from Georgia Southern University in Statesboro. After earning his doctorate in dentistry from Georgetown University, Charlie went on to serve as a captain in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969. During this time he served in Vietnam. 
   He practiced experimental military dental practice that's now standard operating military procedure for the Armed Forces. He was one of the first dentists to operate in the active combat zone in Vietnam. 
   In recognition for his service in Vietnam, Charlie was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After Vietnam, Charlie was assigned to the dental corps at Fort Gordon, the Army base just outside of Augusta, and from then on, Charlie, Gloria and his family made their home in Augusta, Georgia. 
   In 1994, Charlie became the first Republican to represent Georgia's 10th Congressional District since reconstruction. This landmark election gave us a leader who tirelessly fought for immigration reform, including the Clear Act to eliminate sanctuary cities, and the patients' bill of rights. I will never forget that. I was practicing medicine in Marietta, Georgia, when Charlie brought forth that bill about 10 years ago and did such a great job with reining in managed care. He is always for smaller, fiscally conservative government. 
   During this time, Charlie never forgot his fellow veterans. He remained an active member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the World Wars. And throughout the BRAC process, Charlie's constituents in Augusta could rest easy knowing that Charlie was there fighting for Fort Gordon and the Augusta area Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
   Charlie Norwood was a strong American who spent his life fighting for his country, both at home and abroad. For this reason I can think of no one more fitting after which to name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Augusta. 
   I urge all my colleagues to remember the selfless sacrifice of Charlie Norwood to America, his deep love for our Nation, by voting in favor of H.R. 1808.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recall the exceptional life of Reverend Raymond Moss of Marietta, Georgia. Reverend Moss passed away this month at the age of 79, leaving behind a long legacy as an advocate of social justice and civil rights. 
   Reverend Moss was a fixture in Cobb County. After a brief stint in Minor League Baseball and a job as draftsman at Lockheed Martin, Moss found his true calling, and in 1959 he started Back to the Bible Holiness Church, the first homegrown Black church in Cobb County. 
   He went on to build 14 more churches in Georgia and Alabama, and helped lead the Cobb community during the turbulent civil rights era. 
   Reverend Moss was a compassionate father not only to his own 14 children, but to any member of the Marietta community in need of a mentor. 
   In fact, I first came to know the Reverend 30 years ago while practicing medicine with one of his dear friends, Dr. Douglas Glover. Indeed, many of Reverend Moss' faithful came to my office for care, and all had been deeply touched by the Reverend's compassion. 
   I know these members of our community will carry on his dedication to compassionate service. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in honoring the life of Reverend Raymond Moss.

   Petty Officer Kirby was injured by sniper fire outside of Fallujah on Christmas Day. I had the honor of visiting him and his family at Bethesda Naval Hospital earlier this week, and I was deeply moved by his courage and dedication to the defense of our Nation. 
   From my visit, it was clear Petty Officer Kirby had touched many lives. In fact, while we visited he got a phone call from his fellow troops overseas. 
   His wife, Lauren, his parents, Jack and Gail, his brother and sister, all shared with me their praise of his bravery and resolve. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is because of soldiers like Petty Officer Dustin Kirby that I know we will achieve victory in Iraq. The dedication and determination of our Armed Forces is what protects our Nation every day and what will ultimately help deliver security and freedom in the Middle East. 
   I ask that my colleagues join me in commending Petty Officer Kirby for his service.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, my amendment strikes the Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation from this appropriation bill. I offer this amendment not because I think an interagency climate change science program necessarily is a bad idea, but because it is clearly authorizing on an appropriation bill, and I object to this procedure. 
   House rule XXI (2) prohibits changing existing law in an appropriations bill. Contrary to this rule, the language included in the EPA section of H.R. 2643 changes existing law by establishing this new Commission on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation which is tasked with ``reviewing science challenges related to adaptation and mitigation strategies necessitated by climate change.''     
   An interagency climate change science program that reviews these questions already exists under the Global Change Research Act of 1990. The Office of the Parliamentarian confirms that this provision does violate rule XXI. 
   Also, Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall of the Science and Technology Committee sent a letter to the Rules Committee outlining these concerns requesting that the Rules Committee not waive points of order against this provision. Yet last night the Rules Committee reported out a rule that waives all points of order against provisions in the bill for failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI. 
   Again, I reiterate, I am not opposed to authorizing a strong interagency climate change science program. In fact, on Wednesday, Science and Technology Committee will take up a bill, H.R. 906, that does just that. I plan to vote for it. 
   H.R. 906 reorients the U.S. Global Change Research Program to produce more policy relevant information about, among other things, adaptation and mitigation. It also emphasizes the need to develop information to help communities make themselves more resilient to climate and other environmental changes. This is nearly identical to the task given to the Commission on Climate Change in this bill, H.R. 2643.

   But to me the point is, and I want to go forward with this amendment, because it's not just this authorizing committee that I am concerned with, the Science Committee that I sit in on or the Armed Services Committee, it's all the authorizing committees. 
   This rule, I think, is very, very important. For the Rules Committee to just waive this, I know that the other side, us, in the 109th, probably did the same thing on occasion. 
   But at some point we need to draw the line on this, and how do we know that this bill, H.R. 906, that we are going to consider tomorrow, will ever get through the other body, and then we have this bill that's basically an appropriations bill and legislating on that. 
   I think we ought to, as we go back into our district and talk to middle school students, and explain how this Congress works and what's the purpose of authorizing committees and appropriations committees, so they can understand that. This is just a situation where I feel very strongly about standing for the process, not necessarily what's been worked out between Mr. Dicks and Mr. Gordon. 
   I respect both of them, I trust them. I know they will try to work this out. But the more we do this, the more confusing it gets.

   ``But shortly thereafter, Pelosi's office issued a written `clarification' stating that Pelosi was not changing her position.'' 
   And the quote now, ``She has no plans to bring to the floor a bill to allow drilling in protected areas.'''

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (OUR ONGOING MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague from Louisiana, my fellow physician, for yielding. It's great to be here with two fine Texans, my classmate Judge Carter and also Mr. Conaway, and talk about this important issue, because this is a very important week. 
   Representative Conaway and I both serve on the House Armed Services Committee, and my colleagues, Madam Speaker, as you, of course, know, you are a member of the committee as well, that we heard from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker here on the House side. The Foreign Affairs Committee did as well yesterday, the same thing on the Senate side. 
   It was also just unbelievable the negative approach and attitude that so many members of our committee, this body, the other body, the majority party, had toward them in September, saying, you know, this surge is too little too late, the war is lost, it's a hopeless cause, there's nothing that you can do militarily, and, besides, there are all these benchmarks that the Iraqi Government has not met, and it's a failed state, we need to bring the troops home. 
   Well, thank God we did not bring the troops home at that time. Here we are, 10 months later, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker returned and reported to the Congress. Almost every, indeed, every measure, every metric that you look at, they presented to us in chart form. Dr. BOUSTANY has one of those charts with him tonight in regard to the decrease in civilian deaths. He may want to talk about that later, but there is no question that in regard to security, tremendous, tremendous progress has been made. We are getting on top of this thing, and General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker both said that. 
   There were questions from Members, particularly on the Democratic side of the aisle, on the House Armed Services Committee, to suggest that while there was progress made militarily, there was none, no progress made politically. 
   These points were addressed, these questions to Ambassador Crocker, about, well, how about all these benchmarks that we asked for back in September?  
   Well, you know, the fact is the political surge, my colleagues, has been just about as successful as the military surge, and the progress that we have made, and Congressman Conaway talked about that just a little bit earlier in regard to de-Ba'athification, and he explained what is meant by that, and I know my colleagues understand that, to bring these people back in, the Sunnis that didn't have jobs, they had no way of surviving other than maybe getting paid to do bad things to our troops and to their Shia countrymen. 
   It was important that the Iraqi Government do that. The Iraqi Government scheduled provincial elections, which are now scheduled for October of this year, that the Iraqi Government do something in regard to oil sharing to actually have legislation in place that spells out that just because the oil in the country of Iraq happens to be located in maybe a Shia area or a Kurdish area, that the Sunnis still, as fellow Iraqis, should have a share in that revenue. 
   Well, de facto, they are doing that. Ambassador Crocker basically told us that of the 18 benchmarks, 12 of them have now been met, and that of the additional 6, there is significant progress on 4. 
   Anyone that suggests that there is not progress made politically just has to have a willing suspension of disbelief, as someone in the other body quoted, I think, last year and actually said that, too. I wonder what she would say today, based on these statistics, to ignore these metrics, would require the willing suspension of brain power. It is clear as the nose on your face, but yet certain people refuse to believe it. 
   What distresses me too now is those Members who want us to come home are using a different argument. They are saying not only that we've spent too much money but also making this statement, and if my colleague will bear with me for a couple of more minutes, they are making the statement that our troops are tired, they have been there too long, the equipment is wearing out and that, God forbid, there may be another conflict that's just going to break out somewhere in the world, which does occur, I guess, on average, maybe every 5 years. 
   They are saying that for that reason, totally ignoring what success we have achieved on the ground, that we really have victory almost in the palm of our hands. It's not there yet, it's fragile. We all admit that. But let's bring them home and prepare them for the next conflict. 
   Well, my colleagues, they may be, these troops that Judge Carter, Mr. Conaway and Dr. Boustany talked about, these personal anecdotes that they gave tonight, in talking about the enthusiasm, the morale and the patriotism of these troops, if you bring them back home when they are just on the cusp of victory, having left, then, 4,000 of their colleagues dead, men and women, and probably 25,000 severely wounded, they come home without a victory, like Judge Carter says, with a white flag rather than Old Glory, I don't care how much you rest them, I don't care how much you re-equip them, I don't care how much you give them, more manpower or reset them, when you send them to this next contingency, I am going to ask them how hard they are going to fight. What's their morale going to be like then? 
   I think that's what this is all about. I think that's what the American people need to understand and that's what our colleagues in this body need to understand. 
   We cannot let public opinion polls and political pressure, because of an upcoming election, drive the decisions that are so important to the safety and security and the well-being of this country. I think it's clear, it was very clear to me. I had this very question written out that I wanted to ask General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker.

John McCain, of course, was there and got such a round of applause and appreciation for his stance, his service, his patriotism, his service, his suffering during the Vietnam war. I stood on the dais with my fellow Members in a bipartisan way, there were Democrats there as well. I felt real proud. 
   I looked at these young veterans for freedom, just looking at their faces, one of them in the back had a sign, and the sign said ``General Petraeus, he is General Hooray Us,'' General Hooray Us is a take on what the New York Times did last year when General Petraeus came in anticipation of his testimony, ran that article. Of course, the New York Times didn't run the article, but it printed it. I think MoveOn.org or one of these organizations ran the article, half page, full page that said, ``General Petraeus or General Betray Us,'' a sad point in our history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this rule and the underlying legislation. 
   We are about to begin 3 days of debate over the Democrats' nonbinding resolution, 3 days of debate over a resolution that is nothing more than a political statement against our President. 
   Considering that last month Democrats rammed six bills through this House in a mere 100 hours, I would say we have ample time this week to also debate a Republican alternative to this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you well know, last week one of the Democratic Members in this body repeatedly referred to us as the ``Republic Party.'' I don't think, Mr. Speaker, that that Member was necessarily trying to pay us a compliment. But indeed he did, because this is a Republic, and we speak on behalf of 650,000 constituents. 
   But the Democrats have taken that away from us, Mr. Speaker. The Democratic leadership has shown us time and time again their pledge of an open and inclusive Congress amounts to nothing more than tired campaign rhetoric. So over and over the next 3 days, you will hear many Republican opinions and ideas, but you will see no Republican legislation. 
   Perhaps the Democratic leadership is afraid that a Republican alternative, like the bill introduced by a true American war hero, Sam Johnson of Texas, would force the Members to finally put their money where their mouths are and vote ``yes'' or ``no'' to cut funding for the troops. But instead, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats prefer to debate nonbinding resolutions that criticize the President's plan without offering any alternative or strategy for victory. 
   Mr. Speaker, we should be using the next 3 days to debate substantive legislation, not political attacks. This nonbinding resolution may have been crafted with the 2008 election in mind, but I implore my colleagues to look far beyond 2008 to the future of our Nation and this global war on terror. Don't play politics with the security of the United States of America. Don't play politics with possibly our last best chance to secure freedom for the Iraqi people on the greater stability in the Middle East. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have sometimes accused Republicans in this Congress of being ``yes men'' for the President. Well, I believe the Democrats are being ``no men'' for the President, blindly saying no to any plan he proposes, without considering the merits or what is best for the security of this Nation.  
   Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely unbelievable that the Democrats are proposing 3 days of debate on an issue as critically important as Iraq without any Republican input or alternative. The manner in which this debate will be carried out is an affront to the American people and to our troops. I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition to this shameful rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 215, legislation that will designate a National Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator Awareness Week. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and would like to thank my colleague, Mr. RANDY KUHL of New York, for advancing this legislation to help educate the American people about the critical difference cardiopulmonary resuscitation and automated external defibrillator training can make in our country. 
   This legislation has been dear to Mr. KUHL's heart after a young man in his area, Louis Acompora, died from a blunt impact to the chest while playing lacrosse. Had an automated external defibrillator been available at the time, his life might have been saved. I commend Mr. KUHL's success as a New York State Senator in working with Assemblyman Harvey Weisenberg from Long Island to advance the New York State law requiring public schools to have at least one such device on school grounds. His hard work has helped save over 35 lives in New York State in the five years since the law's enactment. 
   Mr. Speaker, heart disease kills more people in our Nation every year than any other medical condition. Sudden cardiac arrest is one of the most time sensitive cardiac conditions for which immediate attention is vital. If cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation are not applied within 5 minutes after sudden cardiac arrest, there is virtually no chance of survival. Approximately 325,000 Americans suffer sudden cardiac arrest each year and more than 95 percent die before ever reaching the hospital. 
   Mr. Speaker, these statistics are staggering. Sadly, if more Americans were trained in performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in using automated external defibrillators, many of these lives could have been saved. Communities with comprehensive automated external defibrillator programs have improved survival rates from only 5 percent to over 40 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is why it is so critical that we pass H. Con. Res. 215. Having a week dedicated to Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated External Defibrillator awareness will increase the profile of this devastating disease, and most importantly, will help save lives. I encourage all my colleagues to support this important resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF CHRISTMAS AND THE CHRISTIAN FAITH -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today in support of House Resolution 847, which recognizes the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith. 
   While there may be some who bristle at the idea of the House of Representatives considering this resolution or any similar resolution, I would note that though the first amendment states that the Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, the first amendment also states that the Congress shall make no law prohibiting the free exercise thereof. 
   Mr. Speaker, our Founders had the foresight to realize that a state-run church of America would do more harm to the perseverance of faith and the hearts of our citizenry, and it would certainly lead to irreconcilable division. However, at the same time, the Founders and writers of the Constitution also recognized that the success of this great American experiment, this historic social contract, was contingent upon a moral and a religious people and the recognition that we had inalienable rights, because those rights are given to us by our Creator. If these rights are given to us by a Creator, then no human being can take them away. And this is the foundation of our system of justice, the foundation of our American society. 
   And so today we take just a few minutes to consider this resolution which respects the faith and the beliefs of a vast majority of this country and a plurality of the world, stating that, and I quote: 
   ``Whereas Christians identify themselves as those who believe in the salvation from sin offered to them through the sacrifice of their savior, Jesus Christ, the son of God, and who, out of gratitude for the gift of salvation, commit themselves to living their lives in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Bible.'' 
   So I hope that no Member of this Congress, no individual anywhere takes offense to this debate and this resolution, because none is intended. This resolution simply offers recognition to a faith and the values of that faith which has sustained hundreds of millions of people throughout the world, not just the United States. And after more than two millennia, we once again approach the commemoration of a birth that many recognize as holy but all recognize as historic. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that just this past weekend I took my granddaughters, 9-year-old, almost 10 they would want me to say, identical twin granddaughters with my wife, and we were in Representative Meeks' great City of New York and we had an opportunity to take our grandchildren to the Radio City Music Hall to see that annual Christmas performance. That 1 1/2 hour performance, Mr. Speaker, was absolutely wonderful and a great tribute to the city, a great tribute to Representative Meeks and all of our colleagues from New York. 
   In that performance, Mr. Speaker, they had a nativity scene, the most beautiful nativity scene that I have had the opportunity to witness. And it meant so much to my granddaughters for me to explain about our Christian faith and heritage. So if it is good enough for New York City and Radio City Music Hall, it is good enough for this Congress. And, by golly, I want to encourage all my speakers to support the resolution of Representative King from Iowa. He was detained because of inclement weather; otherwise, he would be on this floor. But I commend and thank my colleague from New York, Representative Meeks, and also my colleague from Texas, Representative Poe, for allowing me time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, this looks like Georgia night in the great Chamber of the House of Representatives. My colleague, Representative Price, just talked about one of the most important debates that we have had in this body in a long time and will have in regard to the situation in Iraq and the Commander in Chief and the constitutional right for the Commander in Chief to make the decisions along with the combatant commanders. 
   These issues are hugely important. Things like the energy crisis that we faced 25 years ago, and we are facing again today, are hugely important issues. In fact, former Vice President Gore will be before the Science and Energy and Commerce Committees on Thursday talking about global warming and what we think we ought to do in regard to not only solving the energy crisis, but to keep from polluting the atmosphere. Hugely important issue. 
   Trying to solve the crisis that is looming in regard to the entitlement spending which is, that along with the interest on the debt, is probably approaching 65 percent of what we spend each year in a $2.7 trillion budget, hugely important issue. 
   Then, Mr. Speaker, every now and then along comes something that maybe does not get at first notice very much. There is not a lot of press. It is not one of the marquee issues of the day, but what I am speaking to my colleagues about tonight is also hugely important, and it, thank goodness, is beginning to get the attention that it deserves. 
   That is an issue that I, as a physician and OB/GYN specialist in particular, physician Member of this body, feel very, very strongly about. What I am referring to is the recent decision by one of the Governors of our 50 States to mandate that young girls in the public school system of that particular State would be required to receive a new vaccine, which I will describe in detail in just a minute. 
   They would be required before they could enter the sixth grade, the sixth grade, we all know sixth, seventh and eighth, and in some cases, considered the middle school years. So coming out of elementary or what I used to call grammar school, where there are many of these young girls, including my precious granddaughters, are still thinking about watching Little House on the Prairie as an example or playing with their dolls, would be required, just like they would be required to have their shots up to date in regard to measles and mumps and rubella and chickenpox, these highly contagious, infectious diseases that can be acquired just on casual contact; if you sneeze in the vicinity of a classmate, the disease is spread. This new vaccine, though, is not against one of these highly contagious communicable diseases, no, Mr. Speaker. 
   This vaccine, called Gardisil, is a vaccine against cervical cancer-causing viruses, referred to as human papilloma virus, or HPV. There are probably 100 strains of that virus in existence that have been identified, but four of them, virus number 6, number 11 and particularly number 16 and number 18, have been associated with the dreaded disease of cervical cancer about 70 percent of the time. About 70 percent of the cases that occur, the 9,000 new cases that occur in this country every year, are associated with that HPV virus. So there is certainly a suggestion, a strong suggestion, of cause and effect. 
   One of our great pharmaceutical companies in this country developed a vaccine that was approved a year ago, June of 2006, to prevent the contraction of this HPV virus, and it is a great vaccine. The studies, the phase III trials, while there, Mr. Speaker, may be some minor side effects, the safety seems to be there. The recommendation, of course, is that sexually active young women between the ages of, well, actually 9 and 16, I would hasten to add that there are not too many 9-year-olds that are sexually active, but the vaccine is approved for those in that age group. 
   It is thought that a series of three vaccines, given a month or two apart, at the cost of $360 just for the vaccine, probably up to $500 once you add the cost of going to a physician, going to a gynecologist and having these vaccines administered, the cost of an office visit, the administration of the vaccine, probably a $500 charge, but a good investment in this humble Member, physician Member, former gynecologist, in his opinion, probably a good choice for a young woman even at the age of 14 or 15, if she is sexually active or going to be sexually active, or maybe even a little bit younger if her parents are concerned about that possibility. 
   Then I think the vaccination that has been developed by this pharmaceutical company and the vaccine referred to earlier, Gardisil, I would highly recommend, and if I was still practicing medicine, Mr. Speaker, and a mom brought her daughter in and asked me about that and said that she heard about it and wondered if I would recommend it, I would absolutely recommend it. 
   But what was done in the last month or so, and this Member just happened to notice, and that is why I say this maybe seems like a small thing, but what it does is the mandate was issued that every single girl in that State at age 11, before going from elementary school, grammar school, to middle school, would have to have that vaccine, or she would not be able to continue in that public school system. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is just flat wrong, and my bill that I introduced the very next day in this body, H.R. 1153, the title of that bill is the Parental Right to Decide Protection Act, because this is all about the rights of a parent to decide what is best for their child. There is no State interest in this because, as I point out, you do not contract human papilloma virus by casual contact. No, it is by sexual activity, and to force every single 11-year-old child in this country to get that vaccination or they cannot go to the public school system, even though they have paid their property taxes, they live in that school district, they have been in that school district, they have supported that school district, and their parents teach their children, maybe they believe firmly in abstinence-based sexual education, but they have that right to decide. The State does not have that right.  
   That is why I say to my colleagues tonight that this is a hugely important issue. Cancer is a dreaded disease. We all probably would choose any other way to die than from a long, protracted case of any kind of cancer. Cervical cancer worldwide is probably the second leading cause of cancer death in women. That is not true in the United States. It may be the ninth or tenth or eleventh but it is too many. There are probably 9,700 new cases of cervical cancer in this country every year, and of those, approximately 3,700 die, and that is too many. We need to do everything that we can to prevent cervical cancer, and that is why I say the vaccine is a good thing. 
   That is why I say that I, as a compassionate physician Member of this body, would recommend that vaccine to someone who has either told their parents that their daughter and her boyfriend are sexually active or they plan to be sexually active, and that could be 
   14 years of age. I know we all would hope that it would not be, but our daughter or granddaughter, but it could, and in those cases the recommendation to voluntarily take this opportunity to get that immunization on board really before they become sexually active, certainly before they become sexually active with multiple partners, is a good thing, but it is not a good thing to mandate it and to require it. 
   We will talk about this throughout the hour, and I am very, very pleased to welcome one of my colleagues, a new Member, a very bright Member. He does not seem like a new Member because he is doing such a great job in these first 3 months of the 110th Congress. At this point I would like to yield to my good friend Mr. Jordan for his comments.

   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the comments of the gentleman from Ohio, and this point about opt in-opt out, on most of the bills that have been introduced, probably, in maybe 23 or 24 States, not a Governor issued a mandate, but where bills were actually introduced. The opt-out provision actually requires one of two things, either a doctor's excuse or the parent to sign that they want their child to not take the vaccines, but they have to have it notarized. 
   Just think about the burden that really puts on people to try to find a notary. I mean, it's just not that easy to do, and it's certainly not easy to get a doctor to write an opt-out provision.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio, for being with me tonight as long as he can stay. I appreciate his input, his comments. He is right on target. 
   Statistics suggest, and this is actually from the center of the CDC in Atlanta, my home, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 6.2 million Americans become infected with HPV each year. Over half, now listen to this, my colleagues, over half of all sexually active men and women become infected at some time in their lives, over half of all sexually active men and women become infected at some time in their lives with the HPV virus. 
   Now, if you do the math on that, and I think I am correct if my Georgia Tech math serves me well, that means that about 0.2 percent, 0.2, not 2 percent, but 0.2 percent of women who are actually infected with HPV virus, 16 or 18, the virus that this vaccine would prevent, even if they contract the virus, only 0.2 percent. 
   Well, I said at the outset of the discussion that accounts to, in this country about 9,700 new cases of cervical cancer each year and over 3,000 deaths. Even though it's a small, small number, it has significance, clearly. But you have to ask yourself if that would warrant vaccinating mandatorily every little 11-year-old girl in every public school system in all 50 States of this country. 
   I don't have the number, how many little girls that would be; but I will tell you one thing, it's far more than this number. Then there are some other things that we can discuss in regard to risk and adverse reactions, even though the FDA, and I don't disagree with the decision, the trials that show this vaccine is safe, but yet it has only been on the market for less than a year. All of a sudden, the big experimental model is going to be my granddaughters and your daughters all across this country. I think that is absolute insanity. 
   At this time, I want to yield to my good friend from New Jersey, my classmate, Representative Scott Garrett, for his comments.

   Mr. GINGREY. I really appreciate my friend from New Jersey. As we all know, every Member in this body knows, he is a strong, strong fiscal conservative. He pointed out the fact that we have very limited dollars. Every day, each one of us, Representative Jordan, his constituents come up here from Ohio, and Representative Garrett's constituents from New Jersey, mine from Georgia, and each one of them has a request. Many of them are health-care related. 
   Today I was visited by a mom who has two autistic children. Maybe my colleagues had constituents advocating on behalf of more funding for autism, and it goes on and on and on. It is our job, with limited dollars, to try to decide how to apply them for the greater good. 
   I really appreciate the gentleman's comments in regard to putting the money where it's going to be most effective and not to waste it, not to waste those precious dollars. As he pointed out, you can only spend that dollar once.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for being with us tonight. I mentioned at the outset about the statistics with regard to cervical cancer worldwide being the second leading cause of cancer death in women, but maybe 9th or 10th in this country, and the difference is attributed to the fact that in this country, since the mid-1940s with the discovery of the pap smear, the value of the pap smear to screen for cervical cancer was discovered. Annual checkups were recommended for sexually active, certainly for sexually active adult women, and, again, that could start at age 14 in many instances. In some instances, it may be when a young girl is going off to college, or maybe on occasion it is not till someone is 22 or 23 years old. 
   But at that point in her life, the most important way to prevent cervical cancer or to be able to have early detection, when it can be cured, is by having that physical examination done on a timely basis.     
   For the most part, the recommendation is a yearly exam. And I think most women in this country get that examination on an annual or maybe every 2-year basis if they have gone several years with normal Pap smears. And it is very simple, almost painless, not something that they would rush to have done, but women know the importance of this for their protection. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have some concerns that unless we do a great job of educating the public in regard to this vaccine, that women might get the idea that, first of all, the vaccine protects them against sexually transmitted diseases. And it does protect them against HPV virus, that virus that causes genital warts in the 0.2 percent of cases that can actually lead to cervical cancer, but it offers no protection against things like herpes and syphilis and HIV/AIDS. And I could go on and on and on, Mr. Speaker. I don't want to do that and get overly descriptive. But it only protects against that one sexually transmitted disease that is associated with cervical cancer. 
   I want to give my colleague from New Jersey an opportunity in the time left to weigh in a bit.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. 
   As I was pointing out in regard to this annual checkup, it is not just for the Pap smear and for screening for cervical cancer, but also for a complete wellness examination in women to detect very early breast cancer, a small lump that maybe the patient cannot detect or that is not picked up on a mammogram. But the opportunity is so invaluable to screen for not only cervical cancer, but for colon cancer and breast cancer. 
   So the bottom line, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than that periodic checkup for adult women to have every 1 or 2 years to make sure that if they do come in contact with something like HPV or any other sexually transmitted disease, you are going to be able to treat that and treat it successfully. 
   Cervical cancer is not something that a person is exposed to or the causative agent like human papilloma virus, it is not an exposure 1 month and cervical cancer the next month or 6 months later or 1 year later, or maybe in many instances not even 5 years later. It goes through, thank goodness, a very slow progression, and there is great opportunity to treat at various stages and to treat successfully. But clearly, the earliest detection when there is just a slight abnormality is the best opportunity to treat. 
   And, of course, with this introduction of this vaccine, which I highly recommend, but not on a mandatory basis and not be forced upon our 11-year-old, as I pointed out, daughters and granddaughters, not my granddaughters, this is wrong. It is the government interfering between the doctor, the parents, and the patient. And it seems to me that it is such common sense that when I introduced this bill; and I want to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and I am soliciting cosponsors, and that list is growing every day. 
   I want my colleagues to understand that what this bill does is simply state this: If you force your youngsters, your 11-year-olds in whatever State we might be talking about, maybe my own State of Georgia, hopefully they wouldn't do that, but if legislation is passed, and the Governor approves of it, then my bill says the Federal Government will not participate in the cost of those vaccines that are forced on our young children either through the Medicaid program or the SCHIP program, the childhood vaccination program, the Federal program. 
   All these are wonderful programs, these safety net programs. I am a very strong advocate of that, of continuing things like SCHIP, to even strengthen it. And, parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, my State of Georgia with their Peach Care program, that is what SCHIP is referred to in Georgia, they have done such a wonderful job of seeking out those children that don't have insurance and covering them, and I commend my colleagues in the Georgia General Assembly, I commend my Governor, Governor Sonny Perdue, for doing such a great job. But I think they would agree with me and they would agree with my friend from New Jersey and my friend from Ohio, Mr. Garrett, Mr. Jordan, that it is inappropriate expenditure of dollars to take a shotgun approach and force children who have a right to a public education, indeed they are paying for it through their property taxes in most States in this country, and then to say to them you can't enroll in the fifth or sixth grade in middle school because you haven't had this vaccine. It is totally inappropriate. And that is not just this Member's opinion, it is the opinion of all those cosponsors who have signed on to H.R. 1153. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have got a few charts that I wanted to show. This first one, the American College of Pediatricians and the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons are both opposed to any legislation which would require HPV vaccination for school attendance. We have already talked about the vaccine being approved last June and the studies that were done, and it is approved for females age 9 to 26. 
   But what they don't know yet, and I have talked to the company that manufactured Gardasil, they say that 
   they really don't know how long the vaccine will last and how much immunity will be given. They think about 5 years, but they are not sure. Maybe it will last longer. Maybe when they do blood studies 5 years later, they will find that the antibody level against this type 16 and 18 HPV virus is high enough that the person doesn't need a booster. But like tetanus shots, of course we know that very typically, the same thing with hepatitis, sometimes these vaccines, the immunity will subside, and the patient is once again at risk, and they will have to get another shot. 
   So if the vaccine gives immunity for 5 years, and you give it to every single 11-year-old, I would say 99.99 percent of whom are not sexually active, and you spend $500 either through their own insurance program or out of Mom and Dad's pocket or subsidized through the Federal Government, Medicare, Medicaid; you give them that shot and it lasts 5 years, and let's just assume it wears off by the time they are 16, just about the time that they are falling in love and become sexually active with their boyfriend, and that is the very  time that they need the protection, and the vaccine has worn off, and we have no guidance. At this point we have no guidance. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is clearly the wrong thing to do, and my bill would say that in any situation where this is a voluntary program, an opt-in program, not an opt-out, we don't make parents jump through hoops and go get a notarized signature, or take a half day off work and go to their doctor and maybe have to have paid for a doctor appointment just so they can get a letter signed so their child doesn't have to get this vaccine. That is insanity. 
   We need to do a good job. We physicians, those of my colleagues who are still practicing, especially my good OB/GYN friends across this country and primary care doctors everywhere, pediatricians need to talk to their parents, talk to their patients and explain that this great vaccine is available, and it has a potential for great good. And I am sure that many, many doses of those vaccines will be sold. 
   And I hear my colleagues in this body many times bashing the pharmaceutical companies and Big Pharma, and I heard that so much as we were passing the great Medicare prescription drug part D program for our needy seniors back in November of 2003, really beat up on the pharmaceutical industry. But this is a good company, and this should be a profitable product for them. And when they first came out with the vaccine, Mr. Speaker, it was their recommendation, and they worked with State legislators, particularly female State legislators, across the country and said maybe this would be a good idea to have it mandatory in the schools. 
   But to their credit, after this Governor made it mandatory, not by legislation, but just by rules and regulations in his decision, there was so much public outcry against that that the company now understands that that is not the right way to go, and that is to their great credit. They understand that they have got a great product, but it is not something that should be mandatory. It should be available. It should be available, though, for those who need it most. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a real strong advocate for a public education. Now, I have a background of going to a Catholic school when I was growing up, but I also have a background of being on a school board in the city of Marietta, Georgia, in Cobb County, my first venture into public service, and I love that public school system. And all my children, adults now, all four, and thank God I am soon to be the father of my seventh grandchild by those four children, went to that public school system, and we loved it. We had friends that either home-schooled their children or went to private school for various and sundry reasons, and I don't argue with that at all. In fact, given the same circumstances, I would maybe have made the same choices. But I want to see our public schools in this country, in my State of Georgia, in every State, I want to see them thrive and do well. And I firmly believe in the principles of No Child Left Behind, that each and every youngster, no matter where they started in life, that they have that equal opportunity at the brass ring in our public system schools across this country.     
   But when you start doing things like this, and that is why at the start of the hour, when I said, you know, this might not be a marquis issue like what is going on in the Middle East or global warming or the economy, this is hugely important, because if you force this, if you mandate this in the public school system, you are going to see, you talk about a flight without vouchers to home schooling and to private schooling, and we don't want to see that. I don't want to see that. I want what is best for the youngsters. And I think that we need to keep a hands-off in regard to this. 
   I have got a few letters here, Mr. Speaker, that I could share. I have got one from a Phyllis Schlafly with the Eagle Forum who is supporting us on this issue. 
   I have a letter here from the Concerned Women of America. I will just read the first paragraph. And this is what they say: ``Dear friends, CWA, Concerned Women for America, gives kudos to Representative PHIL GINGREY, Republican from Georgia, a former obstetrician gynecologist, on a bill that he plans to introduce. Congressman Gingrey's bill will prohibit Federal funds from being used to implement a mandatory, let me emphasize, a mandatory vaccine program for human papilloma virus, a sexually transmitted disease and a cause of cervical cancer. CWA urges you to call your Member of Congress and ask them not only to cosponsor this bill, but to take whatever action they can to pass it.'' 
   I appreciate that, and it is not for kudos or thanks that I am up here tonight. Mr. Speaker, as we do these Special Orders on both sides of the aisle, people do this because they have a commitment to a cause. And I have a commitment to a cause, and that is the cause of our young people that we make sure that we don't take away the parental right to decide. That is sacrosanct in my mind, and that is why I am here tonight spending this time with my colleagues to try to urge you to sign on to H.R. 1153, and let's do this right. 
   Once again, as I move to closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that everybody listening in this Chamber and anybody that can hear my voice far and near understands that this bill simply says, if you force it upon our public school children, whatever State we are referring to, then we are not going to pay for that for those children who otherwise can't afford it. But absolutely, if it is appropriately done, and it is a voluntary program, an opt-in program, and I think parents are smart enough, and certainly young girls, when they get to high school, are smart enough to know that if this is available, they are going to take advantage of it; and to understand that if they don't have insurance, and they can't afford it, that we have these programs, these Federal-State programs like Medicaid and like the SCHIP program, and the Federal childhood vaccination program, so that this opportunity will not be denied to those who need it, as Representative Garrett pointed out, but we won't be wasting money on those who don't need it and don't want it. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will close. And I want to thank my colleagues. I want to thank you for your attention. I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio, our new Member, Mr. Jordan, and I want to thank my classmate, Member SCOTT GARRETT from New Jersey, for being with us tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the Speaker for his recognition, and I thank the minority leader for yielding the time for me to speak on such an important issue this evening.  
   Of course, that is the ongoing problem with the crisis as to our price of energy, as to the price of gasoline at the pump, as to the price of heating oil, particularly as we get into the winter months approaching in the northeast, and people are continuing to struggle. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's important in any discussion about energy to let the American people know this through the Members of this great body on both sides of the aisle, at the end of this 45 minutes to 1-hour period of discussion on the issue, who hopefully will be able to go back home and in a very frank, honest way discuss with their constituents what exactly we've been doing up here in the people's House over the last couple of months. I'll tell you, from my perspective--and I think it would be hard for anybody to disagree--the answer is not very much, not very much, indeed. 
   As you know, Mr. Speaker, in the first week in August, we left Washington for that traditional August recess, which actually was more than a month. It was actually 5 weeks when you included the Labor Day weekend. So we were going to be out of here for 5 weeks. At the time, people were paying $4, more in some places, a little less in some places, but on average, it was $4 a gallon for regular gasoline; for diesel fuel, it was even higher than that. People certainly couldn't afford to take a vacation.     
   We didn't see nearly as many people here in the Nation's Capital during month of August because of this. 
   The Republican minority party had introduced a bill actually a month before that, and it was called, as you recall, Mr. Speaker, the American Energy Act, or the all-of-the-above act, which included certainly as a cornerstone drilling, and a lot of people picked up different mottos like ``drill, baby, drill,'' ``drill here, drill now,'' ``save money.'' 
   The point of all that was to try to emphasize the fact that we do, even though we have this tremendous dependency for our fossil fuel needs, particularly petroleum and natural gas from other countries, 60 percent of what we use, our daily utilization is being imported from other countries, and they don't all like us very much, unfortunately, and that gives them sort of a stranglehold on our economy. 
   So this bill does have a strong component of going after our own natural resources, be they natural gas or petroleum products, or converting other things, unconventional things like shale rock or coal-to-liquid petroleum or to natural gas. 
   We kept asking and saying to the leadership, the Democratic leadership, look, let's don't go home on August 1st. This August recess is a 5-week period of time. Members certainly want to get back in their districts, and all of us really are up for reelection. Some have tough reelects, both Democrats and Republicans, and we all understand the need to get back and be in the community. But if we are not doing their work, if we are not solving their problems, if we are not making sure that when the school doors open the day after Labor Day, or in fact mid-August in most places, that the kids are going to be able to go to school five days a week and not four, that they are going to be able to ride the school buses and they are not going to be shut down at the school barn because there is no gasoline or diesel fuel to put in them, so let's stay here another week if it takes it, three days, whatever, we are smart people, and let's get this done. Then we can go home. 
   It is kind of like you don't want to leave campus until you have passed your last exam. How can you go home for, say, Thanksgiving or Christmas and relax, knowing that when you get back you have still got your work to do? It just made no sense. But, anyway, as you know, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority made the decision and moved for adjournment basically that day, that Thursday or Friday afternoon, cut off all debate. 
   So what the Republican minority decided to do, it was kind of a spontaneous thing, really, it wasn't planned ahead, we said, well, we are not going home. We are not going to take recess until we have done our homework. 
   So there were, I don't know, 40 or 50 Members just kind of mulling around. And, lo and behold, the lights got turned off, the microphones got turned off, the C-SPAN cameras weren't showing no video. But these brave men and women, all on the Republican side, but we kept asking for our colleagues on the Democratic side, Mr. Speaker, to join us, because we know, we know full well that there is like-mindedness on this issue on both sides of the aisle, but for the stranglehold that they have with their leadership. 
   So we came back. We would fly, go home, go work a couple of days, jump on a plane, come back up there, stand right here. We would bring people in from the gallery. Not just this gallery, but out in Statuary Hall. People were taking tours through the Capitol. They marched in here in droves and sat in our seats and listened to us. And Members would speak 10 minutes, 15 minutes, a tag-team approach, trying not to be partisan, but just say, look, we have a job to do and we are not doing it. And when you go back home, particularly if you are a Democrat from the Midwest or the Northeast or you are a Republican from the Southeast or the Far West, or just an independent voter, let your Congressmen and Congresswomen know, let your Senators know that you want something done about this, that you are suffering, your grocery prices are through the roof. 
   So this is how it all got started. We kept thinking, I kept thinking that any day people would ask, how long are you Republicans going to keep this up now? How long can you go? Is it going to be 5 weeks? I said, well, I sure hope not. I hope that Ms. Pelosi is listening, Mr. Hoyer is listening. They are intelligent people, no question about it. They wouldn't be in these positions of leadership if they are not. 
   I thought, well, the force of public opinion, these polls taken all across this country, Mr. Speaker, are saying that 85-88 percent of the American people want us to do this. They don't want us to be dependent on Venezuela and Iran and Russia. They don't mind us importing a little oil from Canada and a little oil from Mexico, but they fully agree that if we have got this product, this natural resource right here in River City, why wouldn't we use our own? So if you believe in the law of supply and demand, you increase that supply from anywhere in the world, in fact, and you will help balance some of that demand and bring down prices. But even better, if you increase your own domestic supply, then you are a player. Then you are a player. So that is what we were all about. 
   Well, as we came to the end of the August recess, we began to hear little tidbits of sound bites from Ms. Pelosi, and it sounded like maybe that she finally was getting the message, either from the Republicans in Washington or maybe some individual late-night phone calls from her own conference, particularly the Blue Dog Members who I felt may have wanted to come up here and join us and speak. So Ms. Pelosi said, well, we will maybe look at drilling when we get back. 
   Lo and behold, we get back now, we had three weeks, three weeks, we thought 15 days, but as it turns out it is only going to be at the most 13, because they cut us short Friday of last week, they are cutting us short Friday of this week, and maybe we will go 5 days next week. But 13 days working out of five months, from August 1st. There are no plans that I know of for any kind of session after we end here next Friday. We won't come back to this body, Mr. Speaker, until after the new President, the new administrative team is sworn in. 
   So to think we are working full time for the taxpayer, and that by definition is what we do and we are not really permitted to go back home and have another job, and here we are working 13 days in five months, there is something wrong with that math, something very wrong with that math. 
   So I cannot tell you in strong enough terms, Mr. Speaker, how disappointed I was when I got back and looked at this bill, this none-of-the-above energy bill, not all-of-the-above, but none-of-the-above, that none-of-the-above, the acronym is NOTA, NOTA energy bill that was presented to us on this floor that we voted on this week, and it does very, very little in regard to drilling. 
   I tell you, I feel blessed tonight to have with me one of my colleagues from Tennessee, a Member that has been here probably twice as long as have. He is twice as young as I am. He  is not nearly as good looking. But he is a very good member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and he knows this subject inside out and backwards. 
   I am happy at this point to yield to my friend from 
   Tennessee, Zach Wamp. Then we will kind of do a colloquy and further discuss this issue. 
   Zach, take it away.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for his remarks. 
   You know, Representative Wamp made one statement, there are actually people, I know this is hard to believe, I know it is, in these trying economic times, that want the price of gasoline to be high, that want to make it so high that we eliminate all fossil fuel. Look at this quote from Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, a strong environmental club. ``We're better off without cheap gas.'' 
   I mean, it's not just him. Ms. Pelosi herself has said many times that any bill that includes drilling is a hoax, and that she is more concerned with saving the planet. That is a direct quote on the national news network, my passion is to save the planet. 
   Then HARRY REID, the majority leader of the Senate says, and this is almost a verbatim quote, fossil fuel is poison. Fossil fuel is poison, and it needs to be eliminated completely by the year 2020. That's the kind of thing that Representative Wamp was talking about, and the nonsense that we are hearing from the other side. 
   Before I yield to one of my other colleagues, I just want to make this comment. When the 110th Congress began in January of 2007, I happened to sit on the Science Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee. But our first Science Committee hearing of the year, our witness was--and this is pretty unusual, I have been up here 6 years, I have never seen this happen before, that the Speaker of the House would be a witness, or the sole witness before a standing committee--Ms. Pelosi. 
   It was all about global warming, and it was all about her plan to save the planet from carbon dioxide and greenhouse gases. She told us about the fact that she was going to create a commission of Congress, a bipartisan commission, I think. Ultimately she did, and Mr. Markey assumed chairmanship of that committee, even over the objection of the most venerable, distinguished long-serving member of this body, JOHN DINGELL from Michigan, who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
   But that was the kind of focus that Madam Speaker had at the time, when, of course, the price of gasoline was about $2.33 a gallon. 
   A couple of weeks later, our second hearing in the Science Committee, who did we have again, a single witness. Guess who it was, former Vice President Al Gore just after he had gotten his Oscar award for that documentary film, ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' about global warming. That's all they wanted to talk about was Kyoto Protocol and cap and trade and how we were going to eliminate the carbon footprint from this country. 
   It's a little hard, I mean, as we sit here tonight, talking, we are expelling, we are breathing out carbon dioxide. There are greenhouse gases all over the environment that are not necessarily created by what human beings do. 
   But, again, I think that certain people had drank all of the Kool-Aid in regard to global warming. Maybe when gasoline prices are low and $2 a gallon, you can afford to do that. Do you remember the old expression, I can't be worrying about draining the swamp when I am up to my elbows in alligators? 
   Well, I think that's kind of the analogy of where we are right now. They are still worrying about draining the swamp, and we are up to our elbows in alligators with these prices that are literally killing the American people. They can certainly starve to death a whole lot quicker than they can choke to death from greenhouse gases over the next 100 years. I think it's important that we put that into perspective. 
   At this time, I see I have been joined by a couple more of my colleagues that do such a great job on the floor, one of our newest Members, but you would never know it by hearing him speak and the level of participation that he engages in, and that's my good friend from Ohio. I yield to BOB LATTA, Congressman BOB LATTA.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my friend from Ohio. As Representative Latta described, he and a number of Members did go up to Alaska in August and had an opportunity to meet the governor of Alaska, Governor Palin, and see what she had done in regard to getting that natural gas pipeline and that natural gas flowing down to the lower 48. 
   I feel refreshed and energized, not to use a pun, to think that Senator McCain and Governor Palin understand this issue very well and have the wisdom and the strength of character and the force of leadership to deal with big oil, to deal with the environmentalists and to help us solve this problem as we go forward. So my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that hope is on the way. 
   Before I turn to my good friend and colleague from Louisiana, I want to say one other thing about this bill that Speaker Pelosi finally brought to us when we got back from this August recess, and certainly not by the regular process, not by going through the Energy and Commerce Committee and listening to the wisdom of John Dingell and Joe Barton and others who have worked so well in a bipartisan manner to come up with a bill that we could all be satisfied with and that was good for nobodies' politics, or maybe everybody's politics, but more importantly, good for the American people. 
   It wasn't done that way. Unfortunately, the bill was drawn strictly by the Democratic leadership behind closed doors. If any of my colleagues can remember the song ``The Green Door,'' behind the green door, and it was a 290-page bill and no Republican had any input. Indeed, no committee of jurisdiction. 
   But the ironic thing about that was that Ms. Pelosi, when she was trying to lead her troops to the majority, to the promised land back in the fall of 2006, she made some rather outstanding quotes, very attractive quotes like ``bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority,'' that would be us Republicans, we Republicans, ``the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' This is Speaker Pelosi, a new direction for America. 
   How quickly we forget. 
   Another quote from Madam Speaker, ``Members should have at least 24 hours  to examine a bill and a conference report text prior to floor consideration. Rules governing floor debate must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' A quote from Ms. Pelosi back in 2006. 
   We have far more important things to talk about than process, so I yield to a physician colleague of mine from the great State of Louisiana. And if anybody knows about energy and refineries and what goes on in hurricane alley, Congressman Charles Boustany does. And he probably spent a lot of time in his home in St. Charles after Ida and Gustav and the destruction and probably working in one of the Red Cross shelters trying to help victims of the hurricanes. But he did not lose sight of the ball in regard to energy. It only strengthened his resolve, and I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany).

   Mr. GINGREY. That is exactly right. I think you used the key word, and that is ``transition.'' We are talking about transition. It is just that some people want to transition just a little too quickly. 
   I wish you would speak a little bit and reference this slide that I am showing right now in regard to the revenue-sharing issue. This goes back to the Energy Security Act of 2006 regarding the gulf coast States and the energy sharing. And I know that you have talked with me and other Members of the conference about what Louisiana does with that revenue sharing and how important it is to the State. 
   As I close out, I will talk about this ``NOTA'' energy bill. I like to call it a ``nota,'' none-of-the-above act that we passed this week, and one of the key problems was the lack of any revenue sharing for the States on the east and west coast. If you don't mind addressing that, I appreciate it.

Everyone else, nada, again, zero, nothing, no revenue sharing. So where is the incentive for one of these States, Georgia, we've got 130 miles of shore line on the Atlantic Ocean. California, I mean, there's just not going to be the incentive to do it.

You're saying that currently, under this Energy Security Act of 2006, as I point to this slide, again, GOMESA, that Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, you've said you fought hard for it many years, Texas, you get 37 percent revenue sharing, 37.5 percent. 
   But are you telling me now that in that area in the Gulf of Mexico, when the oil companies go out and build new rigs and purchase new leases, then, according to this no energy bill that was passed this week, you wouldn't get any revenue on those new sites?

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, I just want to thank my colleague. And of course, we're both physicians, Dr. Boustany, a cardiothoracic surgeon, myself, an OB/GYN doctor for many years before we had the distinct honor of getting elected to the Congress and working in the people's House and representing the folks we represent. 
   And I, again, Charles, I think about this a lot of times, when I started the hour talking about how our leadership, Ms. Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi, Representative, I mean Senator Harry Reid, Majority Leader Harry Reid, former Vice President Al Gore and others were so focused on saving the planet and global warming and climate change. And I understand there's some concerns there, and I'm not oblivious, although all scientists don't agree with that. But, you know, it does really become a matter of priority. And you and I, as physicians understand that people literally without a job, without a home, without a warm set of clothing, they can starve to death. They can die a lot quicker from that than they can over maybe a 75- to 100-year period time from inhaling a little bit of an environment that's not healthy for their lungs. 
   So we care about it. We care about childhood asthma. We care about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema and lung cancer and all those things. 
   But it becomes, really, a matter for leadership of the Congress to make these decisions and place priorities on things. We don't want the planet to increase 1 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit over the next 75 years because there may be a scintilla rise in the level of the water and some remote island may get flooded and 50 people lose their lives. 
   Now, I understand all that science. But right now what I really understand, and I think you do too, is the job loss, the unemployment rate, the economy, these wild gyrations that are occurring in the stock market, the food prices, the oil prices. This is the crisis of the day, the crisis du jour, and I think real leadership should recognize that, don't you, Dr. BOUSTANY?

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, I think, and I want to thank you for your contribution tonight because I think you said the key word when you said transition. And we are going to transition. And I think that, you know, 50, 75, 100 years from now we may not be burning much fossil fuel. But you can't do that overnight. You can't, all of a sudden say we're going to, by 2020 we're not going to burn any fossil fuel. Coal is fossil fuel. Petroleum products, diesel fuel, gasoline. We would have no transportation and we have no electricity. We'd be back using kerosene lanterns and bicycles and skateboards, I guess, to get around in this country. 
   Well, Dr. BOUSTANY, thank you so much. I had a few more remarks to make as we concluded. I think we have, Mr. Speaker, do we have about 10 minutes left?

The Strategic  Petroleum Reserve is located in Congressman Boustany's State of Louisiana and Congressman Gohmert's State of Texas. So he's been working very hard on this issue. And I want to yield at least 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. GINGREY. I'll reclaim my time, Representative Gohmert, just for a second and yield right back to you, because what the gentleman from Texas is talking about, of course, is this, the bill that was passed by the Democratic majority. And I have a little poster up here comparing the Republican bill, the American Energy Act, to the bill that was actually passed. And I just want to quickly run through this before I yield back to my two colleagues. 
   In the American Energy Act, real offshore exploration, yes. Democratic energy plan, no. Renewables, without tax hikes, our bill, yes. Their bill, no. Real oil shale exploration. I won't get into details of that, but our bill, yes. Their bill, no. Arctic coastal plain, the ANWR. Our bill, go after that petroleum. Their bill, nada. Emission-free nuclear, our bill, yes, their bill, no, no, no, can't have nuclear. Clean coal technology, coal-to-liquid or coal-to-gas. Yes in our bill. No in their bill. New refinery capacity, Dr. BOUSTANY and I talked about that. Our bill, yes. Their bill, no. No energy tax hikes, yes for Republicans, no for Democrats. No electricity price spikes. Yes for Republicans, no for Democrats. Lawsuit reform, yes in the Republican bill. No in the Democratic bill. 
   So what Representative Gohmert and Representative Boustany are probably going to talk about now is when we had one, we had no amendments. We had a motion to recommit with instructions with a bill. And they've just referred to it, the Abercrombie, Democrat from Hawaii, Peterson, Republican from Pennsylvania that had 39 Democrats cosponsoring the bill. And when we offered that as a substitute, which we felt that each one of them, they had already signed on to the bill, surely they were going to vote for it. And I'd like for my colleagues to tell the rest of us what happened.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa for leading this Iowa Special Order, particularly in regard to what is going to be on the floor of this body tomorrow, Mr. Speaker, and that is this $463 billion monstrosity that, as the gentleman has already pointed out, gives no opportunity for Members of this body to have any input. 
   We heard all this rhetoric, as we started the 110th, about the need to pass those six per six bumper sticker issues that the Democratic majority had tested, had poll tested, that drew 75, 80 percent approval rating; so that was their justification of closing down the process and bundling all of those bills, H.R. 1 through 6, in a single rule, a single closed rule, and no opportunity for even Members on their own side of the aisle, the Democratic majority, the new Members of the Democratic majority, to have a voice and represent their constituents. I think it is appalling, Mr. Speaker, that they would do that. 
   But, also, as we railed against that process in the first 2 weeks, we had the assurance over and over again of the leadership of the Democratic majority that once they got through with their 100 hours, and as Representative King has pointed out, we are up to 147 hours now, where is the fairness that they promised? Where is the open process? Here this $463 billion so-called CR or, in layman's terms, continuing resolution, gets posted on the Internet at 11 o'clock last night. I don't think that Members of this body were sitting up holding their breath every 15 minutes checking on the Internet to see if Mr. Obey had finally posted the bill so that Members could see it and look at it and analyze it, study it, and hopefully come forward through the Rules Committee. Certainly there was no committee process in what they have done here. 
   And I do not know, maybe my colleagues can answer this question in just a minute, but I know the Rules Committee did meet today, and I am not going to hold my breath counting the number of amendments that were made in order. 
   But this is unconscionable, Mr. Speaker. First of all, it is not a CR. A CR would be a continuing resolution to continue to fund the government at last year's level. In fact, that would indeed save money. That would save the taxpayers money. This is no CR. A CR is three or four pages long. In fact, the last time we had a CR to cover an entire fiscal year was under the Democratic leadership back in 1987 and 1988. I don't know how long those bills were, but I do not think they were 123 pages, as this monstrosity is, Mr. Speaker. 
   I have heard this thing called a lot of terms other than a CR. I have heard some refer to it as a ``CRomnibus.'' To me, and maybe my colleagues can understand this better because ``CRomnibus'' is a little difficult to decipher, it looks like a hooker dressed up like a nun.     
   Now, I hope everybody can understand what I am talking about there. This is an appalling embarrassment to this body. And the Democratic majority talked about, in December and leading up to the election before that, how, give them the opportunity to lead this body and they will absolutely eliminate earmarks, totally eliminate earmarks in finishing up the fiscal 2007 and the fiscal 2008 budget. 
   This is a giant earmark, or if you want to call it an ``Obeymark.'' There are so many things in here. And, of course, you know we have had since about 9 o'clock this morning when people came to work, maybe a little earlier for some of us insomniacs, to study this bill. And the devil is, of course, in the details.

   But this is appalling, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues. I mean, the Democratic majority has talked about opening up this process and not doing as we did, as they say we did; but dawn of a new day, to start a new open process of bipartisanship. Whether they were truthful in that or not, I think if you say that, if you make that pledge as you ask people to vote or, in many instances, replace somebody on our side of the aisle, then you need to fulfill that contract. 
   That indeed was a pledge that has already been broken. And it does not have to be that way. It absolutely does not have to be that way. 
   So I thank the gentleman for allowing me to weigh in on this issue. With that, I will turn it back over to Mr. King and continue this dialogue with my colleagues. Thank you.

   Mr. GINGREY. And I hope I won't offend the gentleman, but just as he is pointing out, these earmarks are there but they are selected, in this instance, by one person. And as you start enumerating a few, like the ones that you have already mentioned, I have got to also say that the tropical rainforest in Iowa is back at $44.6 million. Now, I don't know how the gentleman feels about that one, but that is the whole point here. A CR is supposed to save money. It is literally supposed to save the taxpayers money, because instead of increasing the amount of spending at a rate of inflation or consumer price index, you go back to the last year and you just continue that process. 
   So, in fact, if we had done that, if we had this year-long CR, we are talking about maybe saving $6.1 billion. But, no, what the Democratic leadership of a committee of one or two decides to do is under that budget cap authority to plus this thing all the way up from 2006 levels to the budget cap, and that is an additional $6.11 billion burden on the taxpayer. 
   As I mentioned earlier, I won't repeat the phrase I used in referencing this bill. But people are going to call it all kind of things in addition to CRomnibus. But really it is a CR on steroids. Maybe we should call it a steroid. 
   And with that I will turn it back over to the gentleman from Iowa for the continuation of this discussion

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just wanted to point out, and I am sure the gentleman would agree with me, that there are things in this so-called CR that we approve of. As I look through the list, and of course, I have got a lot more looking to do, but as I see things like an increase in Pell Grants to $260 up to $4,310, I think that is good. And additional funding for the Head Start program. And I could go on and on and on. There are a number of things here that I see that I could vote in favor of, but there are a number that I would be opposed to. 
   And just as the gentleman points out, especially for the new Members on both sides of the aisle to not have an opportunity to go through regular order and a committee markup process, go to the Rules Committee with their amendments, I am talking now about majority Member amendments, things that they have heard about, as you pointed out, Mr. King, from their constituents, as they campaigned for the very first time for Congress and the excitement of that, and you pointed that out as well. It is just sad. It really is sad. And if it wasn't so sad, it would be almost laughable. 
   So I just want to say that, again, it is not that, as I register tomorrow my vote against this, it is unfortunate because there are some things in here that I would be in favor of. But I am going to be voting against the usurp of power and putting the process under the jackboot of the new majority.

   I want to thank the Chair for allowing me to manage the remaining time on our side in the absence of the ranking member, Mr. Hall, who had a very important meeting before the Rules Committee, and I thank the Chair for allowing that. 
   Madam Speaker, I am not an engineer but I went to an engineering school. In fact, I went to one of the very best engineering schools in this country. I am a Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech and a heck of an engineer and actually not an engineer but a chemist. I look forward to the next bill as we honor Dr. Julian. 
   But engineering, Madam Speaker, is a profession in this country that is very, very important to us, to our ability to compete in this global economy, and as we all know, we are losing unfortunately far too many engineers to retirement and not replacing them. If we are going to remain competitive in this country, and I know the work of the Education and Labor Committee of this House and Chairman Miller and before him Chairman McKeon and Chairman Boehner, we have addressed these issues in our reauthorization of higher education and how important it is; and I know that Chairman Miller, as we go forward to reauthorizing No Child Left Behind and highly qualified teachers and special incentives for math and science teachers at elementary, middle and high school levels so that we do stimulate more bright young minds in this country, and yes, many more women than may be traditionally would select engineering as a professional track, as a career, because this is the only way we are going to be able to compete in this global economy.  
   I love sports, Madam Speaker, and I know we all do and we honor sports teams all the time up here, whether it is basketball, football, hockey. You name it, we are doing these resolutions, but I like to see more and more of this kind of activity where we are supporting the goals and ideals of National Engineering Week with H. Res. 59 to say, look, what is really important in this country is not games. Games are fun and games are a diversion, but this is about life and the success of our individual young students and, indeed, our country. 
   So to have an opportunity to stand here and have the closing remarks on supporting H. Res. 59, I commend the majority and my friend Representative Lipinski and others that have brought this, Representative Johnson and other members of the Science Committee. I think this is a wonderful opportunity to salute our engineers and the profession.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, as my good friend and colleague, Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, has already stated, House Concurrent Resolution 34 honors the life of Dr. Percy Lavon Julian, a pioneer in organic chemistry, research and development. 
   Dr. Julian identified and synthesized, and my trusty assistant had to tell me how to pronounce it, physostigmine. I should know that from medical school. Dr. Julian, though, synthesized that, and it is a drug used to treat glaucoma. I think we all know about glaucoma and the ravages of that, particularly with our elderly, more recently to improve memory in Alzheimer's patients and as an antidote to nerve gas. 
   He also made great advances, Madam Speaker, in synthesizing the drug known, as we all know, as cortisone, and making it affordable treatment back then for arthritis, and of course, it is used for that and many other things today. 
   In addition to his glaucoma and arthritis treatment contributions, Dr. Julian's impressive achievements also include the invention of a soy-based fire extinguishing foam used on Navy ships during World War II, various improvements in paints and coatings while employed with the Glidden Paint Company, with which he was affiliated, I think, for over 18 years; and he developed a method to filter chemicals in soybean oil to mass produce hormones for medical application. 
   Once again, Madam Speaker, as a retired OB/GYN physician, I know a little bit about the use of hormones for medical conditions. 
   As an African American in the early 20th century, Dr. Julian overcame great adversity to succeed and to make his mark on society. The National Academy of Sciences recognized and honored his significant contributions to organic chemistry when they inducted him in 1973. 
   Madam Speaker, I remember to this day my organic chemistry teacher at Georgia Tech in those 5, 6-hour labs that we had twice a week in addition to all the classroom work. I wish I had had the privilege of being taught by Dr. Julian, but Dr. Cherry was a fine professor in his own right. 
   I encourage my colleagues to give Dr. Julian the same recognition today and support this resolution honoring him and his great life. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, just a few words in closing. We talked about Engineers' Week in the previous suspension resolution. I was just listening to my good friend, Rush Holt, talk about the importance of making sure that we encourage people of color and someone like Dr. Julian and many more like him to get an opportunity. 
   I am sure it must have been awfully difficult back in those days, and actually in 1961, that was when I was a student at Georgia Tech, and there were literally no African-American students at school. I don't remember any at that time, and that was just, what, 46 years ago. It is unbelievable. 
   But, thank God, you know, times have changed; and certainly to learn about Dr. Julian, I didn't know of him until my colleagues on the majority side, on the Science Committee, brought forward this resolution. 
   I am honored to manage for the ranking member, Mr. Hall, on this side of the Science Committee and to get to know more about the life of Dr. Percy Julian, talking about the work he did in developing and manufacturing a process for the production of cortisone. Madam Speaker, I can really appreciate him in regard to that, because just yesterday morning, I was lying on an operating table getting cortisone injected into my arthritic neck, and I feel better already. I will say, Thank you, Dr. Julian, for that discovery, and I appreciate it very much. 
   But it is an honor to pay respect to this gentleman. I am pleased in a reading of his life that, unlike a lot of other people who do great things, and they get honored 25 years after their death, and everybody else seems to capitalize on their discovery, the fact that he was not only honored in his lifetime by the National Academy of Sciences, but also was able to get financial remuneration for his work in the sale of his company to a big pharmaceutical, I think it was Smith, Kline & French or one of the major pharmaceutical companies back in 1961 purchased his company for $2.1 million. Well, that is great, and I am very happy that occurred and happy for him and his family. 
   It is great to have these good bipartisan opportunities, Madam Speaker. I want to ask all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and I know all my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, to support this resolution.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago the Supreme Court upheld the ban on the abomination of partial-birth abortion. 
   I come this morning to say thank you to one of our former Members, the Honorable Chairman Henry Hyde, who served in this body for almost 30 years. Chairman Hyde stood up for the sanctity of life at every step of the way, every day that he served in this great body, and I hope he is enjoying his retirement in the great State of Illinois. 
   Mr. Speaker, Henry once said, ``This is not a debate about religious doctrine or even about public policy options. It is a debate about our understanding of human dignity, what it means to be a member of the human family even though tiny, powerless, and unwanted.'' 
   And I hope my colleagues will all reflect on these words. 
   Chairman Hyde, we thank you from the bottom of our heart. God bless you for your service to this great body.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (HONORING THE MEMORY OF SPEAKER TOM MURPHY -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight with a heavy heart, saddened by the loss of not only a constituent, but also one of the most important figures in Georgia government in the modern history of our State. Thomas Bailey Murphy of Bremen, Georgia, Speaker Tom Murphy, was called home to be with the Lord last night at 10 p.m. 
   A native of Haralson County, Speaker Murphy was born on March 10, 1924, to Leta Jones and William Harvey Murphy. A graduate of Bremen High School and North Georgia College, a young Tom Murphy heard the call of his country and he enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He served in the Pacific theater from 1943 to 1946. 
   Upon his return home from World War II, Tom Murphy married the love of his life, Agnes Bennett, with whom he shared his life until her death in 1982. Soon after their marriage, Tom Murphy graduated from the University of Georgia School of Law. 
   And then, Madam Speaker, in 1960, he followed in his brother's footsteps, winning election to the Georgia House of Representatives. In his first seven terms in the legislature, he had the opportunity to serve as the Governor's floor leader and as speaker pro tem until being elected as Speaker of the House in 1973. As Speaker of the Georgia House from 1974 to 2002, he served not only with distinction but also as the longest-serving State House Speaker throughout this entire country. 
   While Speaker Murphy never forgot his rural roots or his constituency, he also recognized the importance of strengthening our entire State and fostering growth and economic opportunity in the capital city of Atlanta. 
   During his tenure, Speaker Murphy fought for funding and sponsored the construction of the Georgia World Congress Center as well as the Georgia Dome, the largest cable-supported dome stadium in the entire world. Speaker Murphy also pushed for improved and increased funding for urban transit and suburban roads and freeways. He had the foresight to realize the need to invest not only in destination infrastructure but also in the roads, the buses and trains to get people there. 
   While Speaker Murphy was a great advocate of his State and of all Georgians, to say he was partisan would be an understatement, Madam Speaker. He believed firmly in the principles of the old-guard Georgia Democratic Party, and he was vehemently loyal to those principles, his party and his members, even to his own personal and political detriment. In 2000, after over 40 years of service to his district, Speaker Murphy won by a narrow margin of about 500 votes in his Republican-trending west Georgia district. And yet later that year, during the decennial redistricting process, Speaker Murphy refused to make his district more Democratic and thus safer, refusing to risk the majorities of his fellow party members that served in contiguous districts and counties. 
   So in the following election, Madam Speaker, he narrowly lost his seat, but he did so with his conscience intact because he remained loyal to his principles to the end. 
   During my time in the Georgia senate, I had many opportunities to see Speaker Murphy in action. Though I certainly did not always agree with him, I always respected him, recognizing that above all, he exemplified the scriptural exhortation to ``let your yea be yea and your nay, nay.'' 
   Though his final years were made very difficult by incapacitating stroke,  I know that in his heart and in his mind, he knew that he had served his State and the people of Georgia to the best of his ability; and, indeed, he served them and us with distinction. 
   While I know that his son, Michael, daughters, Martha, Marjorie, Mary Jane, and all of the grandchildren will miss him dearly, they know that he longed for that reunion with his beloved Agnes. And I have no doubt that when he took his last breath, and he left this world, he was greeted with the words, Thy race is run. Welcome home, My good and faithful servant.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the City of Buchanan, Georgia, on the occasion of its 150th anniversary. 
   The City of Buchanan, which is located in the southwest corner of Georgia's 11th Congressional District, was incorporated on December 22, 1857. Named after former President James Buchanan, Buchanan, Georgia, has served as the county seat of Haralson County since its incorporation back in 1857. 
   As Americans, we celebrate the role of history in our daily lives, and we strive to preserve the heritage that has shaped us both as a people and as a Nation. Buchanan is truly a living example of that heritage, a city that is small in population, but abundant in heart, and that represents Georgia's warm and welcoming character so well. 
   Madam Speaker, Georgians take great pride in celebrating the traditions of our communities. The growth, rebirth and preservation of these historic towns are important to us all, for these communities are the very backbone of our great Nation. 
   And so, therefore, I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating the citizens of Buchanan on the city's sesquicentennial celebration of 150 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of this resolution, H. Res. 1315, honoring NASA on its 50th anniversary. 
   As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I'd like to commend my colleagues from the Science Committee, the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Lampson, the ranking member, Mr. McCaul of Texas, for introducing the thoughtful resolution commemorating NASA on this important milestone for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the years, NASA has not only been the leader in human space exploration, but has successfully used technological capabilities like, as mentioned by my colleagues, the Hubble Telescope and GPS systems. I anticipate the men and women of NASA, they will continue being the true leaders and innovators in the years to come. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we speak today, NASA is undergoing aggressive research to convert domestic energy sources, coal, natural gas, biomass, oil shale, into cleaner and more economical alternatives to traditional jet fuel. Now, why is that important? It's important, Mr. Speaker, because in the  year 2003, the NASA agency spent $4.5 million on their jet fuel, 4.6 million gallons. In 2007, 4 years later, they spent $18.3 million. So they're doing this research in conjunction with the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force to try to find alternative sources of fuel to lower the costs to the government. 
   And everybody in this chamber, everybody in this Nation, knows that we are suffering tremendously from a lack of supply and a tremendous demand, and that's why we're paying $4.11 a gallon for regular gasoline. 
   We can solve this problem, but there's one little glitch, and that's the Democrat Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which absolutely prohibits NASA and the Department of Defense from utilizing any petroleum source other than conventional petroleum if it's not as clean. 
   Well, in times like these, when the country's on the verge of bankruptcy, I think the first priority, Mr. Speaker, should be to lower the price of gasoline, and let NASA continue to research so that we can make the conversion of shale which has something like 1.3 trillion barrels of petroleum embedded in that rock and that we can convert coal to liquid, to petroleum. We have 1.5 trillion tons of coal in this country, and we only use about 1 billion tons a year. We have a tremendous excess amount of coal right here in River City, and yet, this energy bill the Democrats passed last year prohibits us from going after this source, increasing the supply so that the price of gasoline at the pump goes down. 
   And I would implore my colleagues to bring these bills to the floor. They're over there. There's a discharge petition. Republicans have signed them, just a handful of Democrats. We need to bring these issues to the floor, have an up-or-down vote. At least give NASA and the Department of Defense a waiver of section 526 so that we can solve this problem and we're not so dependent on these foreign Nations that hate our guts, countries such as Venezuela and countries in the Middle East. 
   It's time to act. I commend the committee for bringing this resolution. It's a great resolution honoring NASA on its 50th anniversary. I support it fully, but I also support a balanced approach to solving our energy needs.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1315 honoring NASA on its 50th anniversary. As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I would like to commend my colleague from the Science Committee, Mr. MCCAUL of Texas, for introducing this thoughtful resolution to commemorate NASA on this important milestone for our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no Federal agency that has risen to the challenge of innovation over the last 50 years like NASA. We, as a nation, are today the fortunate heirs of NASA's legacy: conviction, resolve, achievement. 
   When the Soviets put a man into orbit, NASA was challenged by President Kennedy--in the truest form of the American competitive spirit--to put men on the moon. Many of our NASA pioneers paved the way for the crew of Apollo 11--Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins--to reach that once unattainable goal. Now, those famous words, ``One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind'' exemplify the legacy that NASA has established. 
   Over the years, NASA has not only been the leader in human space exploration, but has successfully used technological capabilities like the Hubble Telescope to explore the far reaches of our galaxy. Given the precedent of achievement that NASA has set, I anticipate the men and women of NASA to continue being among the true leaders and innovators in the years to come. 
   While this resolution represents a time for us to celebrate the achievements of NASA over the past 50 years, this is also a time to reflect and memorialize those who gave their lives in their service to NASA and the Nation--particularly the crews of Apollo 1 in 1967, the Challenger in 1986, and the Columbia in 2003. The sacrifices that these men and women made in the service of our country will always remind us of the fragile nature of human life, and the risks associated with successes that NASA has accomplished. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to take this time to think about the impact and legacy that NASA has left our great Nation over the last 50 years, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1315.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, both the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business Technology Transfer programs have proven to be extremely successful since the their implementation in 1982. These are both grant programs that have been effective in providing government assistance to small businesses to help more people in our country achieve the American Dream. 
   Although I do have some concerns about the underlying bill, H.R. 5819, small business is still the cornerstone of the economy and job growth in this country, and I am happy that we're addressing these important programs on the House floor. 
   Madam Chairman, small business drives United States economic growth and innovation. These companies make up 99.7 percent of all United States employers and employ nearly half of all Americans who are not working for the government. In addition, small businesses employ 39 percent of high-tech workers, such as scientists and engineers, and they produce 13 to 14 times more patents per employee than do the larger firms. The SBIR and STTR programs were created to provide critical funding to these companies so they could conduct R&D that they otherwise would not be able to afford. These programs also provide further funding to commercialized promising technology resulting from that R&D. 
   Since their inception in 1982, these programs provide over $2 billion in grants and contracts each year, and they have provided the start-up funding for hundreds of small businesses in the United States. In my own State of Georgia, Georgia Tech, my alma mater, provides assistance to small business initiatives across the State, and as a result, companies have received $15 million in SBIR and STTR grants. Specifically in my district in northwest Georgia, the 11th, eight companies have received $8.3 million in SBIR awards since 2005. So, Madam Chairman, it is vital that these programs are reauthorized so we can continue to foster small business development in the emerging technology-based global economy. 
   While I am generally supportive of H.R. 5819, I do, as I said, have some concerns with sections relating to venture capital and phase one and two grant eligibility. 
   Venture capital helps small business entrepreneurs gain credibility on solid ideas that have the potential for commercialization. However, while venture capital serves as an important component in facilitating small business success, it must also be closely monitored and scrutinized. We must ensure small business interests are at the heart of SBIR and STTR programs. After all, that's why they were created back in 1982. 
   Through H.R. 5819, small business companies who utilize SBIR and STTR programs have the latitude to incorporate venture capital funding into their operation, but section 201 in the bill provides safeguards so that small businesses are not merely conduits for venture capital interests, and I want to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for this. While I believe this section of the bill is a very good step in the direction of protecting small business interests, I believe that this language could be even stronger to specifically reinforce the integrity of these two programs. 
   Madam Chairman, I do support the mission and the intent of SBIR and STTR programs. I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 5819. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I am very pleased to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Sestak), vice president of the Small Business Committee.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, Public Law 101 was signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt 100 years ago today on April 23, 1908. Accordingly, I rise to congratulate the Army Reserve on its centennial. 
   First conceived by President Roosevelt and senior military leaders as a means to increase the efficiency of the Army's Medical Corps by establishing a reserve force of specially trained personnel, the mission of the Army Reserve has since been expanded to include additional military occupational specialties. Indeed, it is testament to the stature of the Reserve that it now provides nearly 40 percent of the mission-essential combat support and combat service support forces of the Army. 
   Moreover, Mr. Speaker, since September 11, 2001, 98 percent of Army Reserve units have either deployed or provided mobilized soldiers, and more than 180,000 individual soldiers have been mobilized or deployed in support of this global war on terrorism. 
   As we honor the Army Reserve on its centennial, I would like to pay tribute to all of our citizen soldiers, past and present, whose personal courage, contributions, and sacrifices have helped preserve the freedom and advance the national security and homeland defense of the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I certainly come to the floor today in support of the Small Business Innovative Research Act, and if some of the amendments, particularly the one offered by my friend on the other side, Mr. Welch, is approved, and maybe a couple of other amendments, I definitely plan to support this bill. 
   But in regard to this rule, Mr. Speaker, I am fully supportive of my colleague from Pasco, my former colleague on the Rules Committee, that says we want to defeat this previous question to give Members an opportunity to come to this floor and talk about something that indeed is more of a crisis than what we do with our Small Business Innovative Research Grants, although that is important. So that is the reason why I will vote in favor of defeating the previous question. 
   Mr. Speaker, the promises that were made, and I just want to show, if my colleagues will look at this chart, the day George Bush was sworn into office as President, the price of regular gasoline was $1.49. Two years ago, about 2 years ago, the day that Nancy Pelosi was sworn in as Speaker, the price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $2.33, and today, 15 months into her leadership, gas prices have spiked at $3.50 a gallon for regular, a $1.30 increase in my home State of Georgia. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is really unacceptable, it's downright deplorable, especially when the new Democratic majority and the new Speaker of the House campaigned and made a pledge that they would bring down the price of gasoline. Instead of bringing it down, Mr. Speaker, look what has happened. This is not a linear growth, this is an unbelievable exponential growth. 
   So as part of this changing of the rule if we defeat the previous question, it would require, Madam Speaker, within 5 days, she's had 15 months, but it would require her within 5 days to bring a bill to provide a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. 
   The previous gentleman from Illinois had some great ideas; the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) had some great ideas. There are so many Members that could come to this floor on both sides of the aisle and give some amendments and some ideas that would truly bring down our dependence on foreign oil. Right now, 60 percent of our usage comes from either the Middle East or from Venezuela.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. My good friend, my subcommittee Chair on the Science Committee, made a comment. He said, the reason for the skyrocketing price of gasoline is because of what is going on in the Middle East; this war that we are waging in Iraq. 
   Well, I would like to point out to him that the production of oil from Iraq today is exactly what it was prior to the war 5 years ago commencing. And that is about 2.5 million gallons a day from Iraq. So the price of oil has nothing to do with that. It absolutely has nothing to do with it. We are going to control this with some of the ideas, the coal-to-liquid idea that Mr. Shimkus, the gentleman from Illinois, just talked about. We are going to help solve this problem by licensing some new nuclear power plants. 
   As the former chairman of the Rules Committee, Mr. Dreier, the gentleman from California, talked about, yes, we are going to look at solar, we are going to look at wind. We certainly, as our minority party, now former majority party, have tried so hard to get us to explore for more oil and gas in this country. ANWR could produce another 1.5 million barrels of oil a day, and drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, why are those things blocked? 
   It's time for us to do something about it, and I am glad that the gentleman from Washington is going to ask all Members to vote against the previous question and let's give an opportunity for Members to come down and give their ideas.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this evening on behalf of the Immigration Reform Caucus of this House of Representatives. Hopefully, as we go forward with the Immigration Reform Caucus in a bipartisan fashion, and our new chairman hopefully will be joining me during this hour, and that is Congressman Brian Bilbray from the great State of California who is determined to make the Immigration Reform Caucus of this House a bipartisan organization, and I really look forward to that change. 
   As we reach out to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, both Republicans and Democrats, I think we can solve this problem of immigration, and in particular, illegal immigration. We have to do that, Mr. Speaker. 
   This is a hugely important issue. It is an issue to our security, it is an issue to our economy, and it is an issue to this great country, this sovereign Nation, the United States. 
   Tonight I come to my colleagues to talk about a problem not regarding illegal immigration, we may have an opportunity tonight to discuss some of those issues which are so important and which we have worked so hard on in the 109th Congress and hopefully we will continue to do so in the 110th Congress; but my concerns tonight will be addressed toward a legal immigration problem, Mr. Speaker. Let me repeat that, legal. That is a situation that we refer to as chain migration. Let me try to explain that to my colleagues. 
   I have here to my left a first slide, if you will, in this presentation. As we look at it, Mr. Speaker, at first glance those in the audience tonight might think, gee, GINGREY is up here with a chart of his high school or college chemistry periodic table; or somebody else may say, no, that is his grandchildren's Pac-Man game. It is a confusing chart to look at, but I am going to hopefully be able to, in a short period of time, to simplify this rather arcane, complex looking first slide. But this really is what this whole problem, this legal immigration problem is about, this chain migration issue, Mr. Speaker.  
   If my colleagues will focus their attention at the bottom of this first slide, I point to this very prominent kiosk, this icon that would be a legal permanent resident in this country. That individual, man or woman, could be here through any one of several ways of entering this country legally. It could be a skilled worker. And that is indeed why we have an immigration policy, to make our country better, to bring in skilled individuals from countries throughout the world, as we have always done since we started this country. That is the whole purpose of being able to bring individuals in based on what they can contribute. Certainly we want to make their lives better as well, but we want them to be able to contribute to our great Nation and enjoy the privileges of citizenship eventually. 
   So this individual comes, maybe as one of those legal immigrants, as a skilled worker; or possibly this first person that I am going to refer to at the bottom of the slide is a part of somebody's nuclear family, maybe it is the wife of a legal permanent resident who has already come; or maybe it is a minor child who has grown up and become of age to marry and have a spouse; or possibly this is an individual, a third category, who has sought asylum in this great country. And certainly that is what the Statue of Liberty is all about, that is what the inscription of the bottom of Lady Liberty says in regard to opening our arms to the oppressed and the people that need safety in this great country. So any one of these three categories, Mr. Speaker, of legal permanent residence in this country can start this chain migration. Which clearly, clearly our country never intended that effect. 
   What happens is this legal permanent resident is able to bring in his spouse or her spouse. And they can legally bring in their minor children. And let's say, based on the current fertility rate south of our border, our southern border, it is three children, three minor children. Now, that is one individual that, by virtue of bringing in an additional skilled worker under the quota for that particular country, has brought in four additional people by virtue of genealogy. And this is, of course, a nuclear family so far. We are talking then about a nuclear family, a husband, a wife and their three children. 
   Now, once the husband and wife become citizens, then the real problem begins, because at that point then each of the husband and wife can bring in their parents. This is perfectly legal to do this. So there are an additional, assuming that both parents of both the husband and wife are still living, which is very likely, maybe it is a man and a woman on each side who are in their late forties or early fifties. 
   In addition to that, Mr. Speaker, in addition to that, again, this one individual that is in this country legally, as a legal permanent resident, hopefully has become a citizen. At that point, then all of his siblings and all of his wife's siblings can come into this country. And that is where the chain really takes off, because you repeat this over and over again. And at the end of 17 years, a short of 17 years and two generations, what you end up with under this insanity of legal chain migration is that one legal permanent resident who was brought into this country as a skilled worker, as an individual seeking asylum from a country in which they are suffering the devastation of oppression, or it happens to be a spouse of a legal permanent resident, that one person in a short span of 17 years can bring in 273 people, Mr. Speaker; 273 people. And that counts against the quota for that country. 
   So this is the problem, Mr. Speaker, that I think a lot of people just don't realize. We worry about a porous border. We worry about the fact that there are anywhere from 12 to 20 million illegal residents, immigrants in this country, many of them, of course, most 
   of them probably are hardworking, God-fearing, good people, moms, dads, good families, and they are trying to do the right thing. And the only thing that they have committed, of course, is coming into this country illegally. But it is a huge, huge problem for us, as I said at the outset, in regard to the stress and strain on our economy, on our infrastructure, on our safety net programs, on our public school systems. But here we have something that is part of our legal permission to let people come into this country, and then bring in 273 additional extended family members. Not, Mr. Speaker, what we originally intended. 
   I want to go back and talk about the Jordan Commission. In the early nineties, Congresswoman Barbara Jordan from Texas, a very, very distinguished Member of this body, chaired that commission to study immigration reform and clearly said as part of the recommendations, there were a number of those recommendations, only some of which, Mr. Speaker, were implemented, but one of them was to say very specifically that it should only be a nuclear family, not this situation where because of this chain effect, that in a very short period of time of a couple of generations, or really a short period of 17 years, we end up with 273 people. And they may be good, hardworking, skilled men and women that can contribute to our society, can make their lives better, can make our lives better. But it is really not based on that, it is based totally on genealogy, by virtue of being related in some extended way, first, second, third cousins, aunts, uncles, grandfather or grandmother and on and on and on. 
   And what that does, other than just overwhelming the number of legal permanent residents who come into this country from a specific country on a yearly basis, indeed, Mr. Speaker, from Mexico to our southern border we are talking about maybe 30,000 a year, and that quota is surpassed in day one of the calendar year. 
   So you can't say, well, it just doesn't matter; that means maybe you are going to push these skilled workers a little bit further behind in the queue, but they will get there eventually. Well, they may get there eventually, but instead of 2 or 3 years, Mr. Speaker, it may be 15 years, it may be far beyond the time that it would be any advantage to them or us for them to remain in the queue. So this is the problem. We have a solution. I have a solution for it, and I want to talk about that as we go forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, this next slide that I have again just points out, and I hope my colleagues, I hope this writing is big enough. In case it is not for those in the back of the Chamber, I would be happy to go through it bullet by bullet. But this says ``Chain Migration Equals Inter-Generational Relocation Program.'' It gives visa priority to the cousins, to the adult children and distant relatives of legal immigrants. It creates a backlog of visa applicants. And it allows, and this is the final point on this slide, Mr. Speaker, and of course I have already alluded to these points in my opening remarks, but it allows genealogy, not job skills, not education, not English proficiency to determine who immigrates to our country. We just can't afford that. We absolutely must use common sense and go back to the Jordan Commission recommendation in regard to limiting genealogy entry into this country based not on skills at all, but on just who you happen to be related to. And I will get to that in just a few minutes. 
   My colleague from Iowa is with us tonight. We call on him a lot, but he is always forthcoming with very, very good, useful information on many subjects, not the least of which is the issue of immigration. I am talking about Representative STEVE KING, my classmate. I thank him for joining me during this hour, and I look forward to his comments. 
   I would like to go ahead and yield the floor to him now for however much time as he would like to take. We can colloquy back and forth. And I certainly appreciate him being with us this evening.

   Mr. GINGREY. And the same thing, as I said at the outset, anywhere from 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants we estimate, and we hear talk about the need for a comprehensive bill that would include letting them pay a little fine and fess up and get a clear ID card, identify themselves, and all of a sudden become a permanent legal resident on a track to citizenship. Each one of those 20 million then could start this chain migration.

I would like to thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray), who is chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus in the 110th Congress.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman, and I hope the gentleman will be able to stay and continue as we have a colloquy on this issue. 
   Just by coincidence, we have the Catholic caucus here, as we have the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Iowa and myself, so we know about these large families. 
   But to put it in perspective, in regard to numbers, Mr. Bilbray mentioned the fact that a million come into this country as permanent legal residents every year. It varies from country to country and hemisphere to hemisphere, the overall quota. And then that million additional that come in under all of the visa programs, the H-1B, et cetera, temporary agricultural workers and various skill levels, you are talking about an additional million. 
   But from 1776 to 1976, 200 years of our country's existence, the average number of immigrants was about 250,000. So that just shows you where we are today; and of course we are not talking about the 3 or 4 million illegals if we don't close down our border and secure our border. Not close it down, secure our border. Then you are going to have 3 or 4 million illegals in addition to that. 
   The gentleman from Iowa has been mighty quiet for the last few minutes, and I yield back to him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Iowa. I want to move back now for just a moment and focus again on the solution to this problem of chain immigration, and we will get into further discussion of some of the many things this Congress, and the 109th Congress when we were in the majority and led this great House of Representatives, some of the many good things that have been done in regard to controlling illegal immigration. 
   But let me just for the moment, before my colleagues some possibly have to leave, refocus on this issue of chain migration, Mr. Speaker, because we have presented the problem. We have spent maybe 20, 25, 30 minutes talking about the problem of chain migration, the one person bringing in 273 others, not based on skill, strictly being, I guess, based on the luck of your birthright, geneology, and how inappropriate that is and how we cannot afford to continue to do this. We have a solution. 
   But Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to call my colleagues' attention to this next slide, and again, it depicts on this scale of justice, as we have here in the middle of this slide, on the one side you have an imbalance, too much emphasis, too much weight in regard to the second cousin of an immigrant, i.e., chain migration. 
   On the other side, however, not weighing so heavily in this scale of this balance of justice is the skilled laborer waiting to emigrate into this country. 
   This is what this hour is mainly about, Mr. Speaker, that we need to correct this. We need to get back to what Congresswoman Barbara Jordan recommended to this House back in the early 1990s as she chaired the Commission on Immigration Reform. 
   Basically, this is what she said, Mr. Speaker, in this next slide: Proposed tripartite immigration system, legal immigration. That basically, as I said at the outset of the hour, people come to this country first and foremost maybe as a skill-based worker, skill-based admission; or possibly on the far side of the slide, come in as a refugee for humanitarian reasons, a humanitarian admission; and then, finally, the nuclear family admissions that Congresswoman Jordan, the distinguished lady from the great State of Texas talked about, nuclear family admissions, Mr. Speaker. 
   That is the solution to this problem, and how we got away, how we did not follow her recommendation, there were a number of things that were recommended that were enacted by this body, but we missed the most important, and that is in regard to nuclear family admissions. 
   This print is far too small for my colleagues to see, even in the front of the room, so I want to point out, under nuclear family, the first priority would be spouses and minor children of United States citizens, under the nuclear family. The second priority would be parents of the United States citizens, and the third priority, as we talked about, would be spouses and minor children of legal immigrants. Of course, hopefully they will become and we want them to assimilate into our society. We want them to be part of this great country, the United States of America, and at that point of course they could bring their parents, both husband and wife, as part of this nuclear family. 
   Mr. Speaker, in my final slide, here is the result of that. Again, this is the initial skilled worker that comes in legally. This is her husband or his wife and their three minor children. That is a total of five people, one permanent legal resident and an additional four. Now, when husband and wife become citizens of the United States, then each of them under this new Nuclear Family Act, and that is what I want to present to my colleagues tonight, the bill that I have introduced, H.R. 938, remember that number, many of you on both sides are considering signing on to this bill. Many of you already have. I think we are up over 60 at this point, and hopefully, there will be many more when they understand the magnitude of this problem that we are presenting tonight. 
   So H.R. 938, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, taken almost verbatim from Congresswoman Barbara Jordan's recommendations back in 1990, again, a distinguished Democratic Member of this body, these two, husband and wife, when they become citizens, they can bring their parents. Assuming both parents are living, then that is four additional people, and then they in turn having become citizens can bring their parents in. There is a possibility that if the parents were divorced and remarried, that instead of two on each side, there would be four. 
   I do not want to confuse my colleagues with another arcane slide, but basically, this is the bottom line to take home. On this slide, if all of these people came in under the Nuclear Family Priority Act, you are talking about 35 people. Chain migration, which currently is the policy, you are talking about 273 people. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about cutting that down by 87 percent, and that is not small change. That is a significant solution to this problem, moving in that direction to enact the Nuclear Family Priority Act. 
   So, again, it is straightforward. I leave this slide up and let my colleagues continue to look at it. I want to yield back now to the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleagues, the gentleman from California, the gentleman from Iowa, for being with me tonight. The hour is getting late. I appreciate their sharing their knowledge. It is so important that our colleagues do that, because we have very bright Members of this body on both sides of the aisle. We are not all experts on every issue, but we help one another. We share our knowledge. We rely on each other. 
   I am very grateful to Mr. Bilbray and Mr. King of Iowa for being with me today, to help me talk about not just this issue of chain immigration, that's the main focus of the hour, but to discuss the overall problem of Georgia. 
   It is a huge problem. We can't really afford to turn our backs and shut our eyes and bury our head in the sand with regard to 3 or 4 million additional people coming in every year illegally on top of those 2 million that are coming, as the gentleman from California pointed out in his earlier remarks. There is no way, this country cannot sustain that. 
   He talked about the cost in California and their problem, indeed, as a border State, is a lot bigger than it is in the State of Georgia. Of course, their population approaches 55 million, and the population of Georgia is 9.3 million. But on a percentage basis, we have a huge problem in Georgia as well, maybe fourth or fifth number percentage-wise of illegal immigrations of any State in this country. I think the last count in Georgia was about 750,000. 
   We have got a problem. Certainly, we are a great country. I think that we have done some great things in the history of this Nation. Indeed in 1969, we put a man on the Moon. If we can do that, we can solve this problem. We just need to have the will. I think my colleagues are helping bring that to the attention of the Members of this House and this Congress, both House and Senate, to the administration, to the American people. I like it when we talk during these times to our colleagues in a bipartisan way and say that, look, we can do this together. We all worry about who has got the power and who is in control, and who is in the majority, and who is the Speaker, and who are the committee chairs, and who is the next President. Of course, that will be upon us pretty soon. 
   But in the meantime, there are so many things that we can do in a bipartisan way and really pat ourselves on the back, because I don't think our constituents care whether the Democrats solve this problem or the Republicans solve this problem. They want us to do it in a unified way. 
   We have got such a few more on the Democrats side of the aisle in this 110th, a few more on our side of the aisle in the 109th back to 1994, these things go back and forth. But we can't let that tie our hands and keep us from going forward and getting things done for the American people. 
   I know that my colleagues that are here with me tonight, and I think all the colleagues of this 435-Member body would hopefully say, right on, Gingrey, we agree with you on that.

   Mr. GINGREY. You know who else would be pleased, and that is the employers in this country, and a lot of the industries. In Georgia, I mean we have got agriculture, we have the poultry industry, we have the carpet industry. We all have the homebuilding industry in every State, and I know that most of my friends that are in those businesses pay good wages, they pay good 
   benefits, they are treating their employees in a compassionate way. 
   In return, they are getting a heck of a day's work for their wages that they pay, and I think they would welcome, I think that the employers would welcome. I know Representative King, in a bill that he introduced in the last Congress and has championed in regard to an identification system that is foolproof, and we can do that, we can have a tamper-proof, biometric identification card. And I think our employers, and I have talked to many of them, and I commend them, but there may be a few that are paying low wages and gaming the system. You always have that problem. But we will ferret them out. 
   At the same time, kudos to those who are playing by the rules and doing the right thing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. The point the gentleman from Iowa is making is that we have really tried hard in this body to address this problem. We on this side of the aisle, when we were in control and had the majority in the 109th, felt very strongly that first and foremost to solve the problem and ultimately decide what to do with the 20 million that are estimated to be here illegally, is to stop the hemorrhaging. As a physician member, I use that expression a lot, having been a surgeon in my previous life, OB/GYN physician, but you have to stop the bleeding. If you sit there and let the patient continue to bleed, and that is analogous to the porous borders, the 3 or 4 million that continue to come in every year, in addition to the 2 million that the gentleman from California was talking about earlier, then the patient is going to die. That patient, as the lifeblood seeps out of us, is the United States of America. 
   So it is so important to do the things that we have done, tried to do in regard to Mr. Sensenbrenner's legislation. He was a champion in regard to the REAL ID Act. Basically the REAL ID Act was just in response to the request of the survivors of the 9/11 victims. As they testified before the 9/11 Commission and made those recommendations, 41 or so specific recommendations, one of the most important ones was to say you have got States that issue driver's licenses without requiring any proof of legal residency. The 9/11 hijackers, 19 of them I think, had something like 53, a total in the aggregate of 53 legal issued driver's licenses from some 10 or 12 States. 
   So basically what we said is, look, we can't tell you, we the Federal Government can't tell the States how to run their motor vehicle department and how they issue driver's licenses and to whom and how long and how much you pay for driver's licenses, what age you have to be, whether you have to take driver's ed or not. That is a State prerogative, certainly. But if they do not have proof of legal residence, not citizenship, because a permanent legal resident certainly can be granted a driver's license, then they can't use that license from that State for Federal purposes, like getting on an airplane and blowing it to smithereens or using it as a guided missile. 
   I see Mr. Speaker is tapping me down. I didn't realize, I was having so much fun with my colleague from California, the chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus, that all of a sudden our time has expired. 
   I appreciate his patience and indulgence. I continue to promote the Nuclear Family Protection Act. Let's all get behind it and thank you.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in outrage over reports that Speaker Pelosi is threatening to revoke committee assignments and earmarks for Democrats who don't support the Iraq supplemental bill on the floor this week. 
   Talk about a culture of corruption. This is the lowest form of politics. But, sadly, while their strong-arming is audacious and unethical, it is not surprising. We know the Democratic leadership will go to extreme measures to garner votes for this bill, not only by tying troop funding to arbitrary deadlines for withdrawal, but by peppering it with so much pork, you would think our troops needed shrimp and avocados to beat the terrorists. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is little wonder Democratic leaders are scared to let Members vote their conscience on this bill. After all, even the Los Angeles  Times calls this ``the worst kind of congressional meddling in military strategy.'' 
   But arm-twisting and threats have no place in this people's House, and Americans have every right to be outraged with the current leadership.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   I stand in full support of her amendment to cut one-half of 1 percent from a $51 billion appropriations bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, a few minutes ago when my colleague from Georgia had an amendment that wanted to cut 1 percent, 1 percent, 1 penny on the dollar, you ruled that the voice vote was enough, that the Democratic majority had rejected my colleague from Georgia's amendment to just cut 1 penny. And now my colleague from Colorado, you won't accept that. So we are asking you would you cut 50 cents, one-half of 1 percent? 
   When my colleague from Georgia was talking, the gentleman from Ohio called us this ``fringe group'' on that side of the aisle. This ``fringe group.'' Well, Mr. Chairman, I am a proud member of that fringe group, as well as another 104 Members on this side of the aisle that are part of that fringe group, indeed, the majority of the minority. The gentleman from Ohio, who is part of that fringe group, the 30-Somethings, the next time I say that to him, I will say I am paying him a compliment. He is too young to remember the song from the musical ``Oklahoma'': ``The Surrey With the Fringe on Top.'' But it is that fringe on top of the surrey that makes that carriage so beautiful that it is going to deliver some fiscal responsibility to the great people of this country. 
   And how many times, Mr. Chairman, have you seen a spot on television or the radio where they tug at your heartstrings by asking, won't you just give 1 penny to the children, or won't you just give 1 penny to the starving people in Bangladesh, or won't you just give 1 penny to the veterans, or won't you give 1 penny to this group or that group? And what we are saying on this side of the aisle, Mr. Chairman, is won't you just return 50 cents to the hardworking taxpayers of this country who are sweating, slaving, and working every day trying to make ends meet? 
   And as the gentlewoman from Colorado pointed out, this is not a cut. This is just reducing the increase from 6.7 percent of what we spent in fiscal year 2007 to 6.2 percent. And say to my friends, the Democratic majority, who want to increase spending $81 billion in this fiscal year, when they are complaining about an $8.9 trillion debt, how does that make sense, if you are concerned about the debt, and you have got these signs all over the Capitol, and you want to increase spending $81 billion? 
   Let's get real. Let's get real. We asked you to cut 3 percent; you won't do that. We asked you to cut 1 percent; you won't do that. You won't even give a penny back. And we ask you to give half of a penny now in the gentlewoman's amendment from Colorado. It is the compassionate thing to do. 
   Vote ``yes'' on this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I rise today at a crucial time in our Nation's history, to address one of the most critical decisions Congress has ever made. 
   Without question, these are challenging times for our country. Citizens everywhere recognize that our economy is in peril. Yet Americans are divided over the solution, and rightfully so. What we do here will have a lasting impact on our Nation now and for future generations, so we have an obligation, not just to get this done quickly, but to get it done right. 
   Honestly, Madam Speaker, I have struggled with and reflected upon this decision more than any other I have made as a Member of Congress. But today, I will be casting a ``no'' vote on this bill. I do so after long, thoughtful, prayerful consideration, and after hearing from constituents on both sides of the issue, those who vehemently oppose this bill, and those who resolutely fear the consequences of inaction. 
   I do believe this legislation will pass today because fortunately, Congress has resolved to do something in a bipartisan way to address this looming financial crisis that has hit Wall Street and will soon, if not already, hit Main Street. While this bill aims to be an answer to the problem, I'm not convinced that it is the best answer. 
   To those who support passage of this bill, I agree with you that something must be done. Inaction is not an option. But I also fear that this bill treats the symptoms without curing the disease that plagues our economy. 
   Conservative Republicans, led by Senator McCain, have fought every step of the way for a meaningful solution that addresses the root of the problem and preserves our free-market principles. Because of their efforts, the economic rescue portion of this bill has been markedly improved since Secretary Paulson first made his request. But it does virtually nothing to assure that this will never occur again on our watch. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope and pray that what may be accomplished here today will ultimately work. But let's not lose sight of the fact that, no matter the outcome today, our work is not finished. Republicans and Democrats must come together and address the underlying causes of this economic turmoil. Wall Street and Washington, as well as individuals, must take responsibility for their actions. The American people demand accountability, and they deserve nothing less from us.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1026, recognizing the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Congressional Club. Founded by an act of Congress in 1908 and signed into law by President Theodore Roosevelt, the Congressional Club has been a home away from home for spouses of Members of Congress, fostering friendships across party and geographical lines. 
   The Congressional clubhouse was constructed in 1914, and since that time the club has been a vital and influential member of the U-Street corridor community, encouraging revitalization of the area by hosting programs with inner-city children, planning appreciation days at local nursing homes with senior citizens, and honoring the District's fire and police departments. 
   Mr. Speaker, the generosity of the Congressional Club members extends well beyond the District of Columbia. Club members have raised funds for the purchase of two evacuation planes for wounded soldiers, and donate tens of thousands of dollars to charity on an annual basis. 
   As a member of the Congressional Club now for several years, my wife Billie Gingrey has seen first-hand how the club has been a good friend and neighbor to the Washington, DC, community. I encourage all Members to join me today in recognizing the 100th anniversary of the Congressional Club, and to thank its members for their work and contributions to the community.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Well, I thank my colleague for yielding. I thank all of my colleagues for bringing this important issue to the floor tonight to make sure that each and every Member on both sides of the aisle has a good understanding of this issue. And anybody who might be listening or tuned in, but mainly for our colleagues here to understand. 
   The gentlewoman from New Mexico clearly understands the issue. The gentleman from Texas, having worked in the Justice Department, clearly understands the issue. Our colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent) who was here last week with us, I know that he clearly understands. 
   But it can be confusing. And you know, you listen to this, and I think sometimes eyes glass over pretty quickly when you get into the weeds of it. 
   But I think the bottom line is what my colleagues have already said. This law originally passed for the reasons Representative Wilson outlined back in the late 1970s. And it was very much based on the technology of the time. 
   And here we are in 2008, and I don't even have a hard line at my apartment here in Washington. We have a cell phone. And we have a cell phone that has a yearly contract. But, of course, the bad guys, what they do, in regard to cell phone technology, is they buy these throwaway cell phones and these burn cards and it's very difficult to track them. 
   So in the modernization of FISA in the Protect America Act, and indeed in the PATRIOT Act, we tried to bring that law into the 21st century. And I'll tell you this; I trust the three Michaels on this. I trust the Attorney General, Michael Mukasey; I trust Michael McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence. I trust Michael Hayden, the Director of the CIA. And I think they would tell us what they are telling us no matter who was in the White House, no matter who the Commander in Chief was. This is not political. They're basically saying to the Congress, we need these tools. We need these new tools. We need to grant immunity to the telecommunications companies so they can provide phone records to us, so that our intelligence experts can look at this data, if you want to call it data mining. I don't know exactly how it's done. But you have to have that ability. 
   And indeed, the telecommunications companies in this country are required by Federal law under the penalty of both civil and criminal if they don't provide this data. So they're darned if they do and they're darned if they don't. And the Democrats seem to want to insist that this liability persist. I don't know. Maybe it's a sop to the trial lawyers. But it's absolutely essential that we pass this bill. 
   And as my colleagues pointed out, here we are 18 days since the FISA law expired. I heard Mr. Reyes say on television this weekend on one of the Sunday morning TV shows, well, you know, we've talked to the telecommunications companies. He, of course, I'm referring to the gentleman from Texas, who is the chairman of the Select House Committee on Intelligence basically saying it's time, now that we understand, he understands the need that let's go ahead and pass this law. 
   And here we are this week and what happens? You know, this is the 18th day. It just goes on and on and on. 
   So clearly, I think when you strike right to the bottom line, it's exactly what my colleagues have said. You don't have to understand it any more than that. We need this renewal. We need this modern technology of this law to continue to protect our citizens. 
   I'm honored to be here with my colleagues and to share my thoughts, although I don't have the depth of knowledge that they do. I don't need to have that. I just have a little faith in what my colleagues are telling me and the need to protect our citizens. 
   So with that I will yield back to the gentleman from Texas, and be glad to be with my colleagues for the rest of the hour and continue to dialogue with them.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   It's just like I said earlier about the chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes), who I have tremendous respect for, and I think on both sides of the aisle, my colleagues would agree with me, a good man, a good Member. 
   And what he said Sunday morning, this past Sunday morning, was, look, we have now had the opportunity to talk with the telecommunication companies and understand what it is they need to provide under the law and why they did that, why they did it in a patriotic way, and yes, Mr. Moderator, we are ready to move forward and modernize this bill. And I'm reading his lips. I'm listening to what he says, and I believe him and I sincerely believe that he wanted this bill to be brought to this floor this week. 
   As my colleagues have already said, it would pass overwhelmingly, but unfortunately, I can't help but believe that a good man, Mr. Reyes, is being trumped by his leadership. And as the gentlewoman from New Mexico just said, why? Why would they do that unless, again, it's more concern for this special narrow interest group of trial attorneys that want to bring more lawsuits against telecommunications companies who were just obeying the law that they were required to obey. 
   I just want to point out, too, that as my colleagues have said, the 9/11 Commission, which was insisted upon by the 9/11 families, led by a distinguished Democrat, Lee Hamilton, former Republican Governor of New Jersey, Governor Kean, they clearly understood that we had a stovepipe system pre-9/11 in regard to intelligence gathering, as my colleague from Texas said, not really finding the dots, much less connecting them. 
   And it was a clear outline, a clear blueprint that that commission asked us to do. That, indeed, is what ultimately led to creation of a directorship of national intelligence so that those 16 or 18 communities of intelligence, many of which are within the Department of Defense, could talk to one another so that we could win this war. This global war on terrorism is not going to be won with air superiority, sea superiority, greater weapons systems. It's going to be won with greater intelligence, and that's what this is all about. And I yield back to my friend from Texas and I thank him for the time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   We have heard, particularly from our side of the aisle, the objection to this bill, H.R. 1424, in regard to procedure and in regard to pay-fors, which basically I agree with. The fact is that this is the 50th time that the Democratic majority has brought forth a bill, an important bill, with a closed rule and no opportunity for our side. In the case of myself as a physician member, I think I had some good thoughts about this bill. In fact, I was proud to support the extension of the original Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act. I thought that was a good thing. But now my objection to the rule and the underlying bill, Mr. Speaker, is mainly about policy. I think they have taken this bill and adulterated it to an extent that it is unbelievable that the gentlelady from Florida in her opening remarks said that this is a business-friendly piece of legislation. 
   Now if we were talking about covering things like bipolar disorder, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress syndrome, certainly this is very important that we have mental health parity. But as one of the previous speakers on our side of the aisle said, what you have done in expanding this to cover things on a mandated basis to our employees, diseases in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Illnesses, jet lag fatigue, caffeine intoxication, sibling rivalry, substance induced sexual dysfunction, transvestite fetishism, can you imagine any employer being willing to cover things like that?     
   You are throwing the baby out with the bath water. You had a good bill. I was proud to support it, and I would proudly support it today, but to expand it to the point where no employer will offer mental health coverage, that means so many of these people, families with adult children, adult dependent children, who are suffering from some of these conditions that we know of that I mentioned, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, they desperately need help, and they need health parity. I am in favor of that and I would support it. That is why I am supportive of the Senate version. 
   But I stand here, and I ask all of my colleagues to look at this and read it and understand why hardly any employer would accept this and provide health coverage when it provides all of these things that are totally unnecessary. 
   With that, I ask my colleagues to defeat this rule and this underlying legislation. Let's take it back to the drawing board and do probably what Paul Wellstone intended originally, and my friend PATRICK KENNEDY as well. We have ruined an otherwise good bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, Zach Wamp, for, first of all, conducting this special order hour, leadership hour on the Republican side, and for allowing me and my colleague and great friend from Virginia, Thelma Drake, for being part of that. Doug Lamborn, the gentleman from Colorado, I think, has joined us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was on the trip with Thelma Drake from Virginia when we visited Iraq and Afghanistan, and I am not going to repeat everything that she said, but I want my colleagues to know that this was my fourth trip to Iraq, my first opportunity to go to Afghanistan. 
   But this was a necessity that I go this fourth time. I think some 40 or 50 Members of the Congress during the so-called August recess spent 5 to 7 days in the Middle East and the combat zone in 120-degree weather. 
   Those of us on the Armed Services Committee, I am sure, felt duty bound to do this, particularly as we approach the report from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker that's going to be delivered to the House on next Monday, September 10. 
   I have been four times, but this was the most meaningful visit, because I came to a realization, really, actually, it emboldened my feeling that we need to give victory a chance. Again, I want to thank Zach Wamp, the gentleman from Tennessee, for the passion that he brings to this issue. I thought he was just an expert on energy, but he is also an expert on national defense, more important, the global war on terror, as he so passionately explains this issue. 
   I was on the floor last night during some of our special order time, 5-minute speeches and the two sides, the Democratic majority has an hour and the Republican minority has an hour. I heard one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a gentleman from Maryland, talking about losing a soldier, a 22-year-old brave patriot in his district, and he talked with the mom and was trying to, of course, console her. 
   The gentleman said on the floor last night, you know, it was sort of ironic, the mom of the fallen soldier said, isn't it ironic, I am here planning my son's  funeral and the Commander in Chief is planning a wedding. 
   That's not the kind of commentary that we need on the floor of this House to suggest that the Commander in Chief doesn't care, that he has got his head in the sand and that each and every one of these 3,700 or so KIAs and 18,000 of our best and bravest that have sustained, in some instances, massive injuries, if you don't think that the Commander in Chief goes to bed every night with this on his heart, then you are just flat wrong. 
   I think the gentleman, on more reflection, would agree with what I am saying. This President cares. This Commander in Chief cares. He wants to give victory a chance. 
   It's not a matter of staying the course and same old same old, the Iraq Study Group, the gentleman from Indiana, the long-serving distinguished Democrat, 37 years in this body, and Ambassador Baker, Secretary Baker, served under three Republican Presidents, you have got two people that made some suggestions. One of the main suggestions that they made was we need a surge, we need more troops, especially in and around Baghdad, and those four provinces, where all of the violence, most of the violence, 95 percent of it, is occurring. This is exactly what the President responded to. 
   What did we hear from our friends on the other side of the aisle? Oh, well, you know, too little, too late. 
   Yet, you know, 3 or 4 years ago it was, well, you're not putting enough troops in there to do the job, you didn't listen to General Shinseki, it's a constant pulling the rug out from under the combatant commanders, and we see 435 people that want to be Commander in Chief. It just doesn't work that way. 
   In the Democratic special hour last night, after we talked about our experience in Iraq and these recent trips, the team on the Democratic side said, you know, we can't afford to spend this money. We've almost spent $1 trillion trying to win this global war on terror, and we need to be spending this money to repair bridges, to give more money to the gulf coast, to maybe even give more money than a 300 percent increase in the SCHIP program to cover every man, woman and child from cradle-to-grave with universal health care. 
   Even if I were for some of those things, I will tell you this, you spend that money on those things, and you don't protect our people from global terrorism, then you will see, in a New York minute, how quick that money would go down the toilet as these people blow up this infrastructure, just like they did 9/11, almost 6 years ago now, and killed 3,300, almost the same number, that we have lost in Iraq and Afghanistan over a 4-year period. They killed them within a period of 45 minutes.

   Mr. GINGREY. I am so glad the gentleman brought that up, because what he is talking about, and I commend to all my colleagues, read the article, these were three, in one case, I think, a citizen of Germany, maybe of Islamic descent, but a German citizen, and not only were they planning on attacking Frankfurt, where most people fly into when they go into Western Europe, certainly from this country, but also, and I know the gentleman is aware of this, their plan was to attack Ramstein Air Force Base and the Landstuhl European Army Medical Center where every one of these troops, our troops, that are injured so severely, and our great physicians on the battlefield are able to save their lives to get them through Ramstein Air Force Base to that Landstuhl Army Medical Center there just a few miles away, and that's what they were going to attack.

   Mr. GINGREY. The lowest of the low. 
   Of course, I know we want to yield to our friend from Colorado, and we will hear from him in just a second, but as I conclude my remarks, I just want to say, and Mrs. Thelma Drake, the gentlewoman from Virginia mentioned this a little earlier, we had a report today in the House Armed Services Committee, a report that was requested by Congress in our last emergency supplemental, from the Government Accountability Office, the GAO, on these benchmarks, and the Comptroller General talked about the progress. Really, he talked mainly about lack of progress, and it was ironic that even though several of those benchmarks, we had made some progress, he pretty much gave the Iraqi government a failing report card. 
   I think that is disappointing here, just a matter of a few days prior to General Petraeus' report. 
   He even suggested that while General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are highly professional and we would get a professional report from them, we would not get an unbiased report. The only unbiased report was coming from him and from the Government Accountability Office. 
   I suggested to him, during that hearing, you know, you might be unbiased, but your ability to interpret what you see on the ground certainly militarily may not come even close to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. So let's wait for the report, let's give victory a chance. That's what I want to say to all my colleagues. Let's button our lips for the rest of this week, and let's see what the report says. 
   I would suggest that the President is going to listen to General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, and I would suggest that yes, indeed, the Iraqi government is making progress, that they are not making as fast of progress as we would hope, but we would continue to put pressure on them, but let's give victory a chance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my friend and classmate from Texas, Representative Neugebauer, and, of course, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here on the floor this evening with our colleagues and my classmate, Representative Pearce of New Mexico and Judge John Carter from Texas. And you'll hear soon from another classmate of ours from Iowa, Representative Steve King, and, of course, a new Member, but a very experienced one, Tim Walberg from Michigan. 
   It's an honor to be with them, Mr. Speaker, tonight, because this is a time really of victory for our men and women who are the patriots fighting this war in the Middle East. It's not a time for bragging, and we're not here to stick our finger in the eye of the Democrats and say, you know, you were wrong, you were wrong all along, and finally, after 107 days, you have admitted you were wrong, and we have won this argument. 
   Actually, Mr. Speaker, it's been a tremendous loss for the country to go 107 days, or whatever it is, from the time the President asked for the money that the Department of Defense has requested to continue to conduct this war for the rest of this fiscal year, 2007, the $100 billion with no strings attached, Mr. Speaker. 
   The Commander in Chief and the combatant commanders in the field and General Petraeus brought us a new way forward. It's what the American people wanted. It's what the Congress wanted. And our combatant commanders responded to that. And we put in place the highest-ranking four-star general on the ground in Iraq, General David Petraeus, who wrote the manual 6 months before on counterterrorism and knew and knows.     
   And it wasn't just his plan, but it was a plan that was worked out in combination with the Iraqi Government, with Prime Minister Maliki, and it called for essentially all of the things that the Iraq Study Group asked for. That report, Mr. Speaker, was a bipartisan report chaired by two very distinguished political public servants, the Honorable Jim Baker, Republican, the Honorable Lee Hamilton, a long-term member from Indiana, a Democrat, and this is exactly what the President tried to do. And yet the Democratic new majority wanted to insist on these benchmarks that weren't really performance benchmarks but they included a timetable, a timeline, for giving up no matter what the circumstances on the ground were. And the worst and most egregious of those, my colleagues, was to say that in August of 2008, just a little more than a year from now, that no matter what was happening in Iraq, even if it got like when Andrew Jackson had the British running down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico, as the song goes, even if we were in that situation, winning this battle, in August of 2008, this Democratic majority wanted to blow the whistle and bring the troops home. 
   And I am telling you at this particular time, as we approach the Memorial Day weekend, what kind of message does that send to those who have given the last full measure of devotion in this war, and in any war, while the Democratic majority tries to get the last full ounce of political blood on the floor of this House? It is shameful, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues. 
   Every one of us have gone to some funerals in our districts. And I stand here tonight and I think about the Saylor family, Paul, their son, 22 years old from Breman, Georgia. I think about young Justine Johnson, another 22-year-old from Armuchee, Georgia, up in Floyd County. I think about the former president of my student body at my alma mater, the Georgia Institute of Technology, who 2 years after serving as student body president at that great institution, that first lieutenant gave his life in Iraq, shot down by a sniper while leading his troops. I think about Command Master Sergeant Eric Cooke, who served 30 years in the military, multiple deployments at the tip of the spear, and on Christmas Eve, 2003, my first trip to Iraq, one day after I met him and gave him some books and school supplies for the Iraqi children; he promised to deliver them, but, unfortunately, he took that right seat in a Humvee so that one of his troops  could stay home and call his wife and his family and talk to his loved ones on Christmas Eve. And Command Master Sergeant Eric Cooke gave his life one evening when that Humvee went over an improvised explosive device. 
   In the history of this country, we are about to honor those who have given their lives on Memorial Day, the last Monday in May. And at that time I think about and I want my colleagues to think back to World War I when Dr. McCrae wrote that poem ``In Flanders Fields.'' I am not going to try to quote the poem, although it is a very short poem, but the last stanza basically says don't forget it us. Just don't forget us. We fought the battle. Whatever the cause, you may not agree with it, but don't forget us. 
   And I think that is why we felt so strong. I commend this President for vetoing bad bills that would forget the troops and would let them die in vain. 
   So it is an honor to be here tonight to say thank you maybe to the Democratic majority for finally coming to your senses and letting the combatant commanders and the Commander in Chief fight the war. Certainly we could talk about policy and we can talk about funding but not with strings attached. Let's give victory a chance. And I think we have an absolute chance, as my colleagues pointed out, and some of the progress is being made. The news media, of course, doesn't report good news. Good news is an oxymoron, isn't it? So they don't talk about that. But thank you, colleagues, for letting me come tonight and talk about this. 
   I know if the troops are watching over in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think they are very proud that the Congress is supporting them and we are not going to pull the rug out from under them. 
   With that, I want to yield back to my colleague from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer. I know there are a couple of other speakers and I thank the gentleman for giving me the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, my colleague from Georgia, Representative Johnson from DeKalb County, spoke just a few minutes ago. I have great respect for the gentleman from Georgia, a freshman Member doing a great job in this body. Of course he talked about the underlying bill and what is wrong with the bill. 
   Well, I move to strike the last word in support of the amendment. The gentlelady from Oklahoma, the former lieutenant governor, a long-term lieutenant governor, I think the first ever in the history of the State of Oklahoma, female lieutenant governor, I support her amendment. And I say to the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend, there is nothing wrong with the underlying bill, and possibly he is correct. As the subcommittee chairman has said, there are no earmarks in this Homeland Security bill or traditionally in a Homeland Security bill. 
   But the problem with the bill is it is an increase up to 14 percent in spending on that particular appropriations bill, 7 percent more than what is in the President's budget, what the President called for. 
   So as the gentlewoman from Oklahoma knows with her amendment, it is just one more opportunity to try to bring, as she is doing, to bring fiscal responsibility into the process and say some of these programs, you can pick them apart and name certain ones.     
   We have to have that, but pretty soon, we're talking about $60, $70, $80 billion worth of additional spending that the Democrats are going to bring on the backs of the American taxpayer at the end of this fiscal year, and that's what we're railing against. And I would say that to my good friend from Georgia, the gentleman from DeKalb. 
   But more than that, Mr. Chairman, much more than that, of course, is this issue of earmarks. I talked to a good supporter from my district just recently, in fact this afternoon, and he  reminded me of the outrage at our own party, at our Republican Party, and reminded me that we are in the minority because of not being fiscally responsible, fiscally prudent, losing our brand, if you will, not fulfilling the pledges upon which we took office, indeed upon which the President took office 6 1/2 years ago. 
   Yes, certainly our party is outraged and we get the message, and that's why we are determined to bring fiscal responsibility to the people's House and this issue of earmarks and all of this pork, the Democrats, the Democratic majority got that majority by railing against maybe the sins of my colleagues in regard to earmarks. 
   So this is what really it's all about, not particularly that we're opposed to this specific appropriations bill on homeland security. And I think the subcommittee chairman has done a good job, just as the ranking member has. 
   But Mr. Chairman, let me just say this. Here is what the Democratic majority has an opportunity to do. They can take all of these bills, all of these appropriations bills back to the Rules Committee and bring them to the floor with a closed rule, something that's unprecedented, and I don't think that the majority will do that. I hope they won't do that, but they could. 
   This is the option I would recommend. I recommended it yesterday when I spoke on another amendment. Mr. Obey, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Chairman, has said that he's going to take all of the earmarks that he plans to airdrop in a conference report, where none of the Members will have an opportunity to vote up or down, but he's going to airdrop them, but he is going to shine some sunshine, some daylight, on that by publishing them before the August recess in the Congressional Record; and any Member, they will have an opportunity, maybe over that month, to look at all of those earmarks. And if they don't like them, they can write a letter to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and say, I'm opposed to that particular Member's earmark. 
   And then who makes a decision? One person. He's not God. He's just chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and he makes a decision, well, am I going to airdrop those amendments, yes or no? 
   Well, I want to suggest once again, Mr. Chairman, to Chairman Obey, here is what you can do. All of those earmarks that you publish in that Congressional Record before the August recess, you can bring those back. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey) has expired.

   Mr. GINGREY. Then when we come back from the August recess, he can bundle those all up as a bill or a resolution coming through the Appropriations Committee, having a special rule, hopefully an open rule, bring it to the floor of this House, and then let each and every Member vote those earmarks up or down. And you can have them sectioned off for each of the 11 or 12 appropriation bills. 
   That's the opportunity that we want to give to the new majority, and I hope the leadership will, in consultation with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a member of almost 40 years of this body, will come to that conclusion, because as one of my colleagues said last night, we don't want to trade in our voting card for a piece of paper and a pen so that we can write a letter. 
   That's taking away the rights of the minority, but even more importantly, Mr. Chairman, it's taking away the rights of the American people. It's unfair. It's not the right thing to do. 
   And I pledge and plead and beg my colleagues in the majority to do the right thing.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague from Georgia, Dr. Price. Certainly the posters that he has got up there, Mr. Speaker, that I call our colleagues' attention to, I might just touch on that issue in regard to the tax on tobacco product, particularly cigarettes, that increase in that tax, just 61 cents a pack, I believe that would bring the Federal tax on cigarettes to a dollar a pack. But the Heritage Foundation and others have looked at that and said, well, how many new smokers would you need to have to raise the $70 billion that would actually not completely pay for this massive expansion of SCHIP that Democrats have recommended? And the number, Mr. Speaker, is 22 million, as Dr. Price's poster so vividly points out.

   Mr. GINGREY. That's right. And that means the ones that are already addicted, the poor grandparents and parents of these children that can't break that habit, and some of them, Mr. Speaker, and I know my colleagues appreciate this, are the poor members of society, for some reason that have developed that smoking habit. And we are going to put the burden on them, plus 22 million. And some of those 22 million, this is the irony of this pay-for that the Democrats have come up with, some of these very children, maybe some of the 5,000 that I delivered who are old enough to go buy cigarettes, they will have to be addicted to help pay for this massive expansion so that their younger brothers and sisters can get health insurance funded by the Federal Government. It makes absolutely no sense. I really appreciate Dr. Price bringing this leadership hour to us as part of the Truth Squad, the ongoing Truth Squad, because the truth just needs to be told. And I think the important thing for our colleagues to understand and anybody within shouting distance to know that Republican Members of this body, and our President, George W. Bush, is all for children and providing health care for children. If he wasn't, would we be spending $35 billion a year on the Medicaid program for children's health insurance? Absolutely we would not. The President even has recommended that because it is estimated that 750,000 children, we cover 6,750,000 in that income bracket that my colleague from New Jersey was talking about, the 100 to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level have fallen through the cracks, so the President said, look, let's increase this spending $25 billion over 5 years, let's increase it 20 percent and a little bit more money in there for inflation. But, instead, the Democrats come with a bill to increase the spending by 140 percent to $60 billion. In fact, in their original bill, the CHAMP Act, they wanted to increase it to $90 billion. 
   As Dr. Price points out, in this new bill the $60 billion version, that is covering 53 percent of all children in this country either on the Medicaid or the SCHIP program. Well, there is something wrong with that. There is no question about it. We don't need to be paying the health insurance for children from families who are making $62,000 a year. In some instances in the State of New York, it may be up to $83,000 a year. That's what we're railing against, this unnecessary, massive expansion. We Republicans and the President want to renew this program. It's a good program. We need to increase the funding. The President possibly would be willing to even go a little more than a 20 percent increase. But the only justification the Democrat majority can have for this type of increase is just what was already alluded to, a march toward a single-payer national health insurance program. In some of their rhetoric in regard to Medicare and wanting to start covering people at age 55, you see where the gap gets smaller and smaller, and then all of a sudden you're covering from cradle to grave  everybody in this country run by the government. 
   So I thank the gentleman from Georgia, my colleague from Georgia, my colleague from Cobb County, for leading this time. I know there are a number of other speakers that are here that want to weigh in on this. We just need to keep fighting. We will get this bill right. But we need to do it in a bipartisan way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, many of our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, and I have been listening to this debate for the last 5 hours, have lamented our efforts to highlight objections to not only this bill, but also the underlying process by which all of the appropriations bills, 11, and then 12 later on, will be brought to the House floor this year. 
   I believe it is crucial that we take this opportunity to register our strong opposition to the process, while I rise in support of the gentlewoman from North Carolina's amendment to cut $1.2 billion out of this homeland security appropriations bill, and that is not a small chunk of change. But it is a process which we believe is neither fair nor open nor in the best interests of the American taxpayer. 
   Late last year the new majority in this House assured the American public that it would bring transparency and openness to the appropriations process and specifically to this practice which we and the general public very well know now, as they campaigned on this issue last fall, the practice of earmarking. 
   At a minimum we believe that this commitment, and I think the American people believe as well, or they wouldn't have gained the majority, that it would equal that of the Republican majority in the last Congress, that the sponsors of earmarks would be identified in the bills themselves, whether they were authorizing bills, appropriations bills, indeed even in narrowly drawn tax bills, so that Members could debate and challenge those earmarks if they were found to be egregious on the House floor. Apparently the Democratic majority has very different definitions of ``transparency'' and ``openness'' than we do and than the American people do that elected them to this new majority. 
   The respected chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the gentleman from Wisconsin, how long has he been in this body, 39 years? I think he is going on his 20th term. He has been a former member of and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He is one of the most respected Members, one of the most knowledgeable Members. He clearly knows what he is doing in regard to not putting these earmarks in the appropriations bill, which he knew would be coming to this floor under an open rule so that we could have a free, a fair, an open debate. 
   We would accept some earmarks. They are not all bad. Certainly they are not all bad. But the ones that are egregious, that we should have an opportunity to debate on both sides of the aisle and strike. 
   Now, the chairman has said, well, you know, we are going to go ahead after we finish all these bills, these 11 bills, we are going to publish all of the earmarks that we are considering airdropping in the conference report. They are going to have transparency. They are going to see the light of day, because we are going to put them in the Congressional Record 2 months from now, in August. 
   But that does not give the Members of this body on either side of the aisle an opportunity. Yes, you can see them, and maybe it will remove the opportunity for the Senate to use a point of order to strike some of these amendments that have been airdropped because all of a sudden they have been published in the Congressional Record. That is not the same as having the opportunity, Mr. Chairman, on the floor to debate and to vote up or down some of these egregious earmarks. 
   Now, what I want to suggest in my time remaining, I want to suggest to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, why don't you simply then in August bring a bill?

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, what I would suggest is that very easily a package of these earmarks, I don't know how many are going to be put in the final conference report; if there are 30,000 earmarks, maybe 15,000 of them in the aggregate in these 11 bills will be published in the Congressional Record and then eventually airdropped in the conference report. 
   Well, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that a bill or resolution through the  Appropriations Committee could come to the floor of this House under an open rule, and let us at that point take each one of those earmarks, maybe specified for each of the 11 appropriations bills, and then have our opportunity to vote up or down. 
   I have been listening to the debate, again, like I said, for a couple or 3 or 4 hours, and nobody has made that suggestion. So I want to try to improve the process, Mr. Chairman, and I want to make that suggestion to the Democratic leadership and to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. It is not too late to do the right thing. We feel like you have done the wrong thing and shut the process down. It is not what the people want, but it is not too late to see the error.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, again, the comments that these are dilatory amendments, the subcommittee chairman from North Carolina saying, well, you want to strike a little bit of change here and there, and you are just trying to slow the process down. In some cases, yes. In some cases, like the amendment that we are discussing right now, the gentlewoman from North Carolina, the gentleman from Washington Mr. Reichert, who is a ranking member on the subcommittee, these are not dilatory amendments. These are important policy amendments. 
   But we are outraged by the policy. And to take my time and make the suggestion of what you can do to correct this, I hope you will take that to heart. I hope the chairman, Mr. Chairman, will take that to heart and give us an opportunity, if not now, at least in August, to vote on these earmarks. That is exactly what you promised the American people, and you need to deliver on that promise.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the second-degree amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) in regard to cutting something like $7.5 million out of this section of the bill. 
   The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the subcommittee, spoke a little earlier in the evening and questioned the logic, you know, why that amount. Well, if you do the math and you look at that section, Mr. Chairman, that cut is about 7 percent. That amount reflects the same amount of overspending in this bill. The $2 billion is about 7 percent more than the President requested, and actually a 14.5 to 15 percent overall increase. So I think that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) is absolutely appropriate in asking for a reasonable, fiscally responsible cut in a $120 million spending category. 
   Mr. Chairman, another North Carolinian was heard by me to say this morning, after the chairman of the Appropriations Committee had spoken and said what we are trying to do, what the Republican minority is trying to do is shut down the process. Mr. Chairman, what the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Robin Hayes, said was, we're not trying to shut down the process, we are trying to clean up the process. 
   Just a few minutes ago, before the last motion, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee said, and I paraphrase, it is not our fault that the former majority couldn't get their work done in the previous Congress. Well, I would say to him, Mr. Chairman, it is not our fault that the new majority and the Appropriations Committee spent 3 1/2 months debating an emergency supplemental for funding of our troops with benchmarks and timelines, Mr. Chairman, that would call for the withdrawal of our troops at a date certain, no matter what the situation was. Indeed, Mr. Chairman, there were a number of amendments in that process to bring the troops home immediately and not to give victory a chance. And, Mr. Chairman, it is not our fault that they refused to listen, this new majority, and insisted on milking this process for every ounce of political fodder that they could get out of it, knowing full well that in the final analysis they had a losing proposition. And they did lose that debate before we went home for the Memorial Day recess. So, that is not our fault. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, if the chairman of the Appropriations Committee says, you know, we weren't able to put these earmarks in the appropriations bill under the sunshine and the light of day, as always has been done, because we ran out of time. And, Mr. Chairman, I have heard it said that the chairman of the Appropriations Committee feels very strongly that he wants to get all these bills done before the 4th of July recess to do just as good a job as our distinguished former chairman of the Appropriations Committee Mr. Lewis did last year and the year before that in the 109th Congress.  
   Mr. Chairman, it is not our fault that the new majority wasted 3 1/2 months and were not able to get these earmarks together in time to put in these bills like they should have done. That's not our fault.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Harlon Crimm, who last week announced his retirement as president of Chattahoochee Technical College. 
   In the past 24 years, Dr. Crimm's contributions to Chattahoochee Tech have been profound. He quadrupled enrollment, making Chattahoochee the largest technical institution in the State of Georgia. He oversaw the college's accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. He instilled a sense of mission and pride in the institution, helping it gain national prestige. 
   But Harlon has been molding Georgia's young minds for nearly half a century. He began his career as a high school teacher in Mississippi, later becoming the principal of Lockheed Elementary School in Marietta and director of personnel for Marietta City Schools. My four children attended Marietta, and they benefited greatly from their exposure to Dr. Crimm. 
   Now in retirement, Dr. Crimm will be able to spend more time with his wife, Jo Ann, a retired Ph.D. educator, and his children and grandchildren. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in thanking Dr. Harlon Crimm for his years of service educating Georgia's young minds. In fact, Dr. Crimm eloquently summed up his own work when he referred to his past 44 years in education not as a job or a career, but as a calling.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, former chairman of the committee, for yielding time to me. 
   My other colleague from Texas, our conference secretary, part of our leadership, my good friend, Judge Carter, just said that he is not an expert on energy. But he certainly is an expert on common sense. He got some of that expertise by talking to his constituents at that impromptu town hall meeting at the gas pump in Texas. That is where we get some of our knowledge from the people that we represent, and they are mad as heck and they are not going to take it any more. 
   I am absolutely surprised, Mr. Speaker, shocked that this new Democratic majority is apparently not listening to what the American people are saying. Back in April of 2006, then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying, and I quote, ``Democrats have a plan to lower gas prices.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, here we are tonight, June 3, 2008, over 2 years after Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi now, announced that Democrats had this commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices. The average retail price of gasoline is $3.99 for a gallon of regular. That is what I paid last night to fill up my car, a 25-gallon tank. It cost me almost $100. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is something that the American people can no longer afford. I don't know what this comprehensive plan the Speaker had in mind when she spoke to us in January of 2007 for the very first time, I don't know what that comprehensive plan was, but I darn sure know what the results of the plan was. The result is gasoline prices at the pump for regular have gone up more than $1.65 a gallon. Some plan. The proof of the pudding indeed is in the eating. 
   There are some things that I want to point out in regard to some of the plans that the Democrats have had in regard to lowering these gas prices and a nationwide average of $3.98 a gallon; in my district, $3.99. Here's some of the things that maybe they proposed to bring down the price of a gallon of regular gasoline. Sue OPEC? You save nothing. Launch the seventh investigation into price gougers? You save nothing. Launch the fourth investigation into speculators? You save nothing. Twenty billion dollars in new taxes on oil producers? Increasing the debt. Halt oil shipments to the strategic petroleum reserve? Maybe save a nickel a gallon. 
   On the other hand, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the Republican plan to lower gas prices: Bring United States offshore oil drilling, ANWR, saving anywhere from 70 cents to $1.60 a gallon. Drilling in ANWR. My colleagues talked about that. Probably an additional 1 1/2 million barrels of petroleum a day from that source. 
   Bring United States deepwater oil on line. Out of the Outer Continental Shelf is what we are referring to. That  could save anywhere from 90 cents to $2.50 a gallon. Bring new oil refineries on line. Our good friend from Ohio, Representative Latta, pointed out that we haven't had a new oil refinery or a nuclear power plant license in this country in over 30 years. That could save 15 cents to 45 cents a gallon. Cut earmarks to fund a gas tax holiday. That could save 18 cents a gallon. Again, we agree with the Democrats on this one. Halt the oil shipment to the strategic petroleum reserve, saving a nickel a gallon. Our plan, the Republican plan, my colleagues, in a very conservative way, would save at least $1.98 a gallon; $1.98 a gallon. The Democrat plan, at most, a nickel a gallon. 
   Well, let me just tell you one thing that they did, the Democratic majority, Mr. Speaker, in their energy bill of 2007. There is a section in that bill, a section called 526. Basically, what it says is no agency of the Federal Government, no agency of the Federal Government can utilize a source of energy production that creates a bigger carbon footprint than conventional fuel, conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. They are absolutely not permitted to do that. 
   Now I want, Mr. Speaker, and all of my colleagues, I want you to think about the consequence of that. The Federal Government on an annual basis utilizes something like 480,000 barrels of refined petroleum products; 480,000 barrels.     
   I am sorry, that is a day. I said annually. That is a day, 480,000 barrels. And which branch of the Federal Government uses the most of that? Obviously, the Department of Defense. And which branch of the Department of Defense, which service branch, uses the most of that? The United States Air Force, flying the platforms that we have to maintain the security of this country. Almost 480,000 barrels. It is estimated, Mr. Speaker, that the Air Force will spend an additional $9 billion for that fuel in the year 2008, fiscal year 2008, because of these rapidly increasing prices of oil. 
   Now, that bill though says they can't go out and utilize anything other than that liquid petroleum we all think about bubbling up out of the ground. Yet in this country, my friend from Texas referred to it, Representative Carter, is something called shale oil that his grandfather told him about. 
   Shale oil, Mr. Speaker, is mainly in the West, in several Western States, and the total amount of additional petroleum that could be gotten from that shale oil is something like 3 trillion barrels of refined products. Yet we are not allowing the agencies of our Federal Government to utilize these sources. 
   Tomorrow in the Science Committee, of which I am a member, the NASA Subcommittee will be marking up the reauthorization of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. They do research on shale oil, on oil sands, another product that is very plentiful in Canada. A lot of oil could be gotten from that. They are doing that research. They are sharing that research with the Department of Defense, and yet they are not able to utilize any of that additional oil. The amount that we could get from shale oil is equivalent to the amount that we have probably utilized in the world over the last 100 years. That is how much capacity we are talking about. 
   Those are the sort of things we can do to bring down the price. I could go on and on, but the gentleman has been very generous with his time and I want to yield back to him. But we need a comprehensive plan that includes nuclear, that includes the use of these alternative sources of petroleum products, like oil sands and shale oil. And until we get together and do this on a bipartisan basis, the American public is going to continue to suffer. 
   I yield back to the distinguished gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I didn't know he was going to yield so quickly. I am still out of breath from running over here. 
   Madam Speaker, I wanted to come and lend my support to my good friend, Congressman David Scott, my colleague from Georgia, and the John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act. 
   Congressman Scott and I both served in the Georgia senate, he for a while longer than I did, and with more power in the leadership there, but we had passed similar legislation in Georgia, this commonsense provision, to help give some relief to these young, brilliant attorneys who are willing to go into work to serve either as a prosecutor or a public defender. 
   The reason I feel so impassioned by it, my daughter, Phyllis Collins, has been practicing in the Cobb County judicial system now for about 3 years. She came out of law school at Michigan State after graduating from undergraduate school with a microbiology degree from Georgia Tech. I thought she would become a doctor, but she became a darn good lawyer instead. 
   She came out of that school with about $100,000 in debt, just as this bill indicates in the language we have read. That's just a typical situation that my daughter, Phyllis, is in. She took that job for about $60,000 a year, I believe. She served a year and a half as a prosecutor. Now she is a public defender. 
   It's people like Phyllis Collins that we need to encourage to do this kind of important work on behalf of people, the public defenders, the prosecutors. They are bringing justice to people that otherwise could not afford justice. 
   I think that I want to say once again to Congressman Scott and all the others on our side of the aisle as well, my good friend from Virginia, Randy Forbes, who have brought this bill forward, I thank you for the time. I support it tremendously, and I congratulate you for doing this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Republican budget substitute, which is the most fiscally responsible budget before us today. It may not a perfect budget, but no real budget can be, because we live in a world of unlimited wants and needs but of limited resources. 
   I also want to take this opportunity to thank Ranking Member PAUL RYAN, my good friend and a fiscal conservative stalwart from Wisconsin, who has truly helped lead the way not only on the Republican budget but also on revealing the true effects of the Democrat budget and substitutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Republican budget, unlike those offered by the Democrats, does not, I'll repeat, the Republican budget does not raise taxes. 
   I know these numbers have been cited many times over in this budget debate, but it is important for the American people to fully understand the impact of the new majority's budget policy on their pocketbooks. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Democrat committee-passed budget raises taxes by almost $400 billion. The Congressional Black Caucus budget raises taxes by $711 billion. The Progressive Caucus Budget raises taxes by almost $950 billion. 
   Three Democrat budgets, three giant tax increases--and, since baseball season is upon us, I'll say these three budgets sound like strike one, strike two, and strike three--and you know how the rest goes. 
   However, Mr. Chairman, my Democrat colleagues don't have to strike out because they can vote for a budget that will balance in 5 years without raising taxes; they can vote for the Republican alternative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, a little while earlier when my amendment was introduced to cut the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture by 1 percent, $50,000, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee stood up and said, well, that is nothing. That is just pocket change, and it is a dilatory motion. It is meaningless. It is so insignificant in the big scope of things when we are talking about an $18 billion discretionary spending bill on the Agriculture appropriations bill that we are dealing with. 
   Well, I thank now my colleague from North Carolina for doubling that 1 percent cut to a 2 percent cut. So now I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we are not talking about $50,000, we are talking about $100,000. And the chairman of the overall committee, Mr. Obey, is absolutely right. It is a small amount. But he is also right. I have several other amendments. He might call those pocket change as well and dilatory amendments. But the first thing you know when you add those up, Mr. Chairman, you are going to get to over $1 million. 
   Now, on the floor of the House in this body inside the Beltway that may not be much money, but to the folks back in the 11th District of Georgia that I represent it becomes some significant money. 
   But, again, the chairman is right. We are trying to make a point here. And I hope not just our colleagues in the Chamber are listening, and I know they are, but I hope the American people are listening as well. Because we do want to make a point, and that is what we are doing with Mr. McHenry's amendment to double the cut to 2 percent on this small section, that is what we are doing in my base amendment with the 1 percent cut. We are saying, look, if you want to bring forth a bill, as you intend to do later this week, the so-called CHAMP Act, to massively increase spending that violates your own new PAYGO rules by $70 billion, as the ranking member of the Budget Committee just pointed out; then if you want to find the money to have these massive expansions, then you need to look at every other spending bill and set your priorities straight.     
   And let's say we're going to cut the money instead of doing it on the backs of our seniors. And that's why I say, you need a new acronym for this bill. It's not the CHAMP Act, Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. No, it's the CHUMP Act, Children's Health Unfunds Medicare Protection,  and for our neediest seniors. And that's why we're here; absolutely, that's why we're here. We don't want you to do that. We don't want you to hurt the seniors, the 3.5 million, a part of the 8 million that get their Medicare through that Advantage option, because most of those seniors, Mr. Chairman, most of those seniors are our poorest seniors. They're in that category of income from $10,000 to $20,000. And those are the people who you are pushing off the Medicare program of choice, their program of choice. 
   So anywhere we can find cuts, this amendment, the second-degree amendment, further amendments that we're going to offer, that's what we ought to do if we're going to have this massive increase in spending, which our side of the aisle feels like we should not do. 
   Now, we could go home in August, Mr. Chairman, and say, on Thursday or Friday of this last week that we were in session, before the long break, the Democrats have destroyed Medicare for 3.5 million low-income seniors, and they've said they've done it in the interest of providing health care for children. But which children are we talking about? 
   In their bill that's coming to the floor, with a closed rule, that we won't have an opportunity to amend, they want to cover children up to 400, maybe even more, the sky is the limit, 400 percent of the Federal poverty level, $82,000 a year for a family of four or maybe it's 500 percent or 600 percent. So what happens? Ninety percent of these children already have private health insurance. And so that's why we're here, and I support the second-degree amendment of the gentleman from North Carolina.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, this amendment reduces the necessary expenses of the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture by $50,050, a simple 1 percent; a 1 percent reduction in the expenses of the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment is not aimed necessarily at the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture, but it aims to make a simple 1 percent reduction in order to shrink the Federal deficit. Why is that necessary? Well, we should be paying for increased spending by reducing other Federal spending, that's the 1 percent I'm calling for, rather than raising taxes or putting the burden on our Medicare seniors, as we do  in this proposed SCHIP reauthorization and expansion, Mr. Chairman. 
   And as we all know, the Democratic majority, the Energy and Commerce Committee bill, which will be combined with the bill out of the Ways and Means Committee we will be dealing with in the next day or two on this floor, calls for a $50 billion increase over the next 5 years. Now, that's on top of the base program which, in the aggregate, was a $25 billion program over the last 5 years. We're not going to increase that by 10 percent, by 20 percent, by 50 percent, or even by 100 percent. We're increasing it even more than that, going from $25 billion, Mr. Chairman, to $75 billion. 
   So, that's why I'm standing before the body today and saying, look, this is a small cut; this is a little bit of money. But a little bit of money here and a little bit of money there, I've got lots of amendments where we ought to cut other programs here 1 percent to try to pay for some of these things that we are doing that violate your own rules, your own PAYGO rules. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will say this; this new SCHIP program, everything's got to have an acronym, doesn't it? And it sells well if it has a catchy little acronym. And the Democratic majority is calling this one, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee came up with a nice, little cutesy acronym for this mass expansion called the CHAMP Act, Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act. 
   Mr. Chairman, I've got an acronym for this bill which fits it a lot better, and that acronym is the ``CHUMP Act.'' That's what it is, the CHUMP Act, the Children's Health Unfunding Medicare Protection Act. Because, Mr. Chairman, what this bill calls for is to totally wreck, totally destroy Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage is that part of the Medicare program where some 8 million out of 41, 42 million seniors have chosen that health care delivery model because they know they get an opportunity for preventative health care, they get an opportunity to have a nurse practitioner, a physician assistant, or maybe even the doctor him- or herself looking at their health care needs and not just providing, as in traditional Medicare, episodic care where there is no coordination. And a lot of times patients, particularly our seniors with multiple systems diseases, will come home from one doctor with a handful of prescriptions and the next week they're going to another doctor with a handful of prescriptions. 
   The Medicare Advantage program was designed to help prevent that, to put an emphasis on coordination, on connecting the dots so that we wouldn't duplicate services, or in some instances, Mr. Chairman, even provide a level of care or prescription that could be detrimental to the patient, that could be counterproductive. 
   So, this is why I feel that my amendment, this small amendment to cut by 1 percent the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture, is a move in the right direction to say, look, don't do this massive expansion of the SCHIP program; reauthorize it. We all want to reauthorize it. In fact, I think maybe what the President called for in his budget was a little bit on the low side. Maybe increasing it $1 billion a year is not quite enough, if indeed, Mr. Chairman, there are 6 million youngsters who are needy and do not have health insurance in this country. 
   So, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise not in opposition to this bill, in fact, I plan to support the bill, and I think most of my colleagues will on both sides of the aisle, but to just say that I regret that this is an opportunity missed for the new Democratic majority. 
   If it's all about wanting to have one more of the 6 for '06 to take home during the August recess and say, well, now, we have passed three of the six, I would say that it should only be 2.25 at the most, because, as my colleagues have pointed out, this reform is only about a fourth of what was brought to us in that first couple of weeks of the 110th as part of the 6 for '06, six promises that were made to the American people that if you elect us, the Democrats, to a new majority, this is what we will deliver for you. 
   And I will say again that this is a tremendous opportunity missed on behalf of the new majority. This bill just absolutely does not go far enough. 
   Speaking to that point, I want to point out that in the bill that we passed in the House last year, in the 109th, when Republicans enjoyed majority status, I had an amendment to this bill, which I think that we need to have as part of the bill today. It was passed by voice vote. 
   Yes, I regret, as the majority leader pointed out a minute ago, that the  other body did not go to conference on this good sound, solid bill that had my amendment as a part of it. But let me point out quickly what that amendment says. 
   Twenty years ago or more, in this Congress, a person could retire, a Member could retire and actually take what money they have in their campaign account, whether that's five figures or six figures or seven figures, could take that with them at retirement and convert that into personal gain. They could buy a Malibu beach home or a Rolls Royce car if they wanted to or send their children to the most expensive college in the Nation. Whatever they wanted to do, they could convert those campaign funds to personal use. 
   Well, in the wisdom of the Congress, that was ended about 20 years ago. Just before it ended, a number of Members retired, took retirement, so they didn't have to forfeit that money. That was a good change. 
   We have a situation now where a lot of Members form what are known as leadership PACs. Now, they don't necessarily have to be in leadership. I formed a PAC that I called DOCPAC and raised a little money for that so-called leadership PAC. But what I am talking about is the fact that the most powerful Members of the Congress, both in the House and the Senate, formed these leadership PACs. Let me give you just a couple of names, not Members, but members of the PAC.     
   Searchlight Leadership Fund PAC, in the other body, in the 2006 cycle raised $2,346,000; spent $300,000 of that money to support other candidates in that party, which is an appropriate use of that money. But $2 million of it was spent for God knows what, Mr. Speaker. 
   Another PAC, Hill PAC raised $2,900,000. 
   Keeping America's Promises, $7,750,000 raised in the 2006 election cycle. 
   VOL-PAC, $8 million raised in the 2006 election cycle. 
   There is nothing, Mr. Speaker, in the rules that says that money cannot be converted to personal use when these Members, some of whom have recently, retired or are going to retire in the near future. 
   So I would think that Members on both sides of the aisle would want to support something like this, to say that once a Member leaves this body that PAC money cannot be converted to personal use. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me say once again, I have great respect for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and I am not opposed to the bill, and I know we have worked hard and I plan to support it. I am just saying the opportunity was missed. We should have gone much further. I hope sometime in the near future we will solve some of these problems like this leadership PAC issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (UNITED STATES FIRE ADMINISTRATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 4847, the U.S. Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008 reauthorizes USFA's activities in training, fire education and awareness, data collection, research and standards development and promotion. This legislation also authorizes $291 million in Federal funds for fiscal years 2009  through 2012 for the USFA. This authorization level, Mr. Chairman, is consistent with previously authorized levels and it only includes a very modest growth in funding that is capped at 3 percent in any of the fiscal years for the bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, as the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation, I am pleased to have worked with my colleague from Arizona, Mr. Mitchell, over these past few months to bring this bill, H.R. 4847, to the House floor today. 
   I am also pleased that this bill has gone through the regular order process. That is a refreshing phrase, Mr. Chairman, but I am certainly pleased that it went through regular order. In fact, in October, the Science Committee's Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, of which I am the ranking member, we held a hearing on reauthorizing USFA, and H.R. 4847 was unanimously reported out of our subcommittee earlier this year. 
   On February 27 of this year, the full committee, the full Science Committee, reported the bill after accepting both Republican and Democratic amendments that I think have improved the bill. 
   The mission of USFA is to limit economic and life loss ``due to fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support.'' 
   This organization provides vital assistance in the areas of training, fire education and awareness, and it awards grants to a number of our local fire departments across this country. We all have them in every district of all 435 Members. These activities have made a substantial impact over the last 30 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is important to note that because of the work of the USFA, smoke alarms are now standard issue in residences across the country. Over a million firefighters have received advanced training, and firefighter equipment and safety continually improves. 
   USFA should be proud of its record of achievement. However, it is also clear that certainly there are still improvements that can be made. In the last 10 years, deaths related to fires have decreased by approximately 25 percent, from nearly 5,000 in 1996 to 3,675 in 2006. Although that decrease in fire-related deaths is commendable, the United States still has one of the highest death rates from fires in the industrialized world. 
   Additionally, despite decreases in the numbers of fires, direct damage costs are increasing and have surpassed $10 billion per year. The number of fires have gone down, but the damage from them has gone up to $10 billion per year. In an average year, Mr. Chairman, fires caused as much damage in the United States as have hurricanes. The reauthorization of USFA will allow the agency to continue to improve our preparedness and to reduce our vulnerability to fires. 
   Unfortunately, last year we saw wildfires that literally ravaged southern California, and we need to develop a more cohesive way of combating these fires. I am happy to see that this legislation specifically addresses the issue of fighting fires in what we refer to as an urban-wildland interface by implementing methods to better respond and prepare for fires that move from wildlands to suburban and indeed urban areas. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, I am particularly pleased that this legislation now includes an amendment that I offered at full committee. It will allow the USFA administrator to perform studies related to the management of emergency medical services at the scene of a fire. Our brave firefighters, men and women, are called upon to extract victims from car crashes, building fires or collapses, and other emergencies, so it is critical that patients receive consistent care under medical direction. 
   While I do not expect USFA to pursue studies into the medical care EMS patients should receive, I believe my amendment, which was accepted by the full Science Committee, will give the administrator the authority to conduct studies into training, system design, on-scene patient management while making sure to work with appropriate Federal agencies and existing medical services in these local communities. 
   Mr. Chairman, the current bill is an important and well-crafted step forward for the USFA, and it represents months of diligent work by both the majority and the minority members and staff of the Science Committee. I want to make sure to commend the great staff of both the minority and the majority. 
   This legislation has been a bipartisan accomplishment of our committee. That is pretty much standard practice in the Science Committee, I am proud to say, Mr. Chairman. And it is being supported not only unanimously by the committee, but by a number of fire related advocacy groups, including the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Arson Investigators, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Firefighters, the International Fire Service Training Association, the National Fire Protection Association, the National Volunteer Fire Council, and the National North American Fire Training Directors. 
   Mr. Chairman, I could go on, but my staff didn't list any more. 
   I certainly want to say, Mr. Chairman, this is an outstanding bill and I urge all my colleagues to support it, H.R. 4847, because this bill will enable the USFA to continue its record of achievement, as well as prepare firefighters for the challenges that they will undoubtedly face in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I will yield to myself such time as I might consume. 
   I was recently in Iraq. I've been a number of times, of course, to Iraq, and Afghanistan. And also just recently, I saw a news special back home highlighting one of our great heroes from the Middle East who was burned severely. His injuries, I think, were the result of an improvised explosive device, and he was an occupant of one of the up-armored HUMVEES or the new MRAP vehicles. I think, indeed, it was an up-armored HUMVEE. 
   And while he was not injured by shrapnel or a projectile, there was a fire, and there was a significant fire. And of course, as he was pulled from the burning vehicle, he sustained severe, severe injuries to his person from the fire. And he described how he just, he knew what to do. He rolled, he tried everything in his power. But of course, thanks to what happened to him at Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany, and then eventually at Walter Reed and Bethesda, he's alive and well and has a family and children. And this little news clip featured him playing with his kids. But you could certainly see the ravages that that fire inflicted upon his body, and the scarring of course. What a brave--I wish I could remember his name, Mr. Chairman, because it was, talk about a profile in courage. 
   But it just made me think about, as we've been discussing here today, and you talk about what these firefighters do and how important they are. And actually, as we know, 40 percent of the workload in Operation Iraqi and Enduring Freedom has been carried by our Guard and Reserve, many of whom are firefighters who, you know, they've been trained. And thank God for that. And I'm very hopeful. I want to look into this further. I'm sure that our military, our regular Army and Marine Corps, they're all well-trained in that. But that just goes to show you how important it is, not just to save a life, but try to bring that life back and so they can rejoin their family and friends in society, go back to their job. 
   One of the statistics that I think both Mr. Mitchell and I mentioned in regard to the fact that the latest year that we had numbers, there was still something like 37, 3,800 people that lose their lives every year in fires in this country. 
   Well, you know what? That's about the number, we're at 4,000 now, that have lost their lives in this 4 1/2 , 5-year war. And of course there were practically 3,000 lives lost, many of them from fire, a lot of them firefighters themselves, on 9/11. So it just brings home the message that fire is an awful thing. It is an awful thing. It might not kill you immediately, like one of these high powered projectiles, but it can certainly destroy one's life. 
   And so what we're talking about here today is so important, and that's why this bill is so important. 
   I just wanted to make those remarks, Mr. Chairman. 
   I, at this time, don't have additional speakers waiting for time, but I would like to reserve the balance of my time. And I still make the offer to yield to the gentleman from Arizona if he needs some more minutes.

   Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   To close on my side, again, let me just simply say as I did before, it has been a great pleasure to work with Mr. Mitchell on this bill. It has been an even greater pleasure to meet with the many firefighters and fire chiefs who I have consulted with over the past few months: our own fire chiefs in my county and city, Cobb County, Georgia; Marietta City, Georgia; Chief Jackie Gibbs, Chief Becky Dillenger. I see them literally every week in the district and the great work that they do, and it makes me awfully proud to be up here representing not only them but the other eight counties in my district. They know that we are fighting to help them protect us, and that's a comforting feeling. 
   H.R. 4847 is a very good bill. And this is the least that we, in this body, can do to support our Nation's fire services. And I want to again say I hope that we will have as many Members that are present today, close to 430, I hope, voting ``yes'' for 4847 to support this bill. 
   At this time, I am prepared to yield as much time as the gentleman from Arizona needs for the purpose of his closing.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, the men and women of our Nation's fire services are among the very first responders to an extraordinary wide range of accidents, injuries, and disasters. And the gentleman from New Jersey, he knows as well as anybody in this body. He was right there. His district's right there, very close to the scene of 9/11. And I think that his amendment is very, very appropriate because this was a fire caused by a terrorist attack. Unlike the Murrah Building attack at Oklahoma City, which was an incidence of domestic violence by our own, if you will, homegrown terrorists, this situation that occurred on 9/11 is the reason why I'm sure the gentleman from New Jersey has brought forth this good amendment. And he is so right to point out that firefighters will also be the first to the scene when many of these catastrophes happen. 
   Hopefully, it won't occur in this country again. We've been blessed. I think there has been a lot of hard work on the part of this Congress and this administration to protect our country on our soil from another terrorist attack. Thank God so far it hasn't happened. But that doesn't mean you don't  train for and prepare for it. And those firefighters that went to work that day, they were well trained, but I'm sure they weren't expecting a terrorist attack. And in such an event like that, their first job, of course, always is to heroically save lives. But fire services will also act to minimize the damage and property loss that a terrorist strike or ensuing events may cause. I mean, as the amendment addresses, there may be biological weapons of mass destruction, and there could have been, right behind the two planes, maybe another plane with a terrorist coming into the city in parachutes with nuclear or biological weapons, a sarin gas attack. God knows what could have happened in the subways of New York City. So the United States Fire Administration works hand-in-glove with other components of the Department of Homeland Security, and Chairman Thompson is here on the floor right now, to ensure that our Nation's fire services have access to the best training and resources available. 
   So I'm proud of the U.S. Fire Administration's work to date to improve our resiliency and our preparedness, yes, for terrorist events, natural disasters, and, of course, the daily accidents and fires that occur in communities across the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support the gentleman's amendment. I urge all my colleagues and expect all my colleagues to support his amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GINGREY. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and the generosity of his time. 
   Mr. Chairman, in this decade, wildland fires have consumed 50 million acres in this country. While the term ``wildland fires'' brings to mind uninhabited areas in our Nation's parks, forests, and rural areas, wildland fires have done tremendous damage to urban and suburban development as well. I think that was the reason for the colloquy between Mr. Wu from Oregon and Mr. Sali from Idaho. 
   Last fall, western States were hit particularly hard by wildland fires that encroached into developed areas and destroyed homes, businesses, and livelihoods. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Idaho addresses that concern. The amendment allows the Administrator of the USFA to distribute information on the importance of clearing in these areas biomass materials from Federal lands, not out in the interior of a National Park. That was a point that was made in the colloquy. 
   The amendment requires USFA to work in consultation, of course, with other Federal agencies to ensure that USFA provides the best possible recommendations. Removing hazardous fuels, biomass materials, from Federal forests and lands will help to prevent, and more importantly, to limit these forest fires as they begin to encroach on urban areas. So if you leave these materials susceptible to forest fires, the consequences, as Mr. Sali pointed out, can be disastrous. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I support wholeheartedly his amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, millions of United States houses today contain smoke alarms. They have been credited with saving thousands of lives. Yet, smoke alarms can only warn the occupants of a fire. They cannot contain or extinguish a fire. Fire sprinkler systems provide the means to limit fire growth and therefore save lives and property. We already mentioned $10 billion a year, I think, in property damage, 3,600 lives lost every year. 
   Studies by the USFA have shown that the installation of residential fire sprinkler systems could save thousands of lives and millions of dollars in property taxes. Bottom line. So together with their Federal partners, USFA has reported a potential 82 percent reduction in fire deaths if fire sprinklers, along with smoke alarms, were installed in all residential dwellings. With the cost of a home sprinkler system in new construction being estimated as low as $1.50 a square foot, or as low as 1 percent of the total cost of the house, and of course, many insurance companies offering discounts up to 15 percent on houses that contain sprinkler systems, it is clear that the benefits in lives and property saved far outweigh the costs. 
   The amendment from the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin) supports the efforts of the U.S. Fire Administration to improve the awareness of the effectiveness and availability of residential sprinkler systems. 
   Mr. Chairman, I wholeheartedly support the gentleman's amendment, and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield back my time.

I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding, and I am proud to be here tonight with the Countdown Crew to talk about an issue which typically you would think or you hear said many times that our physician colleagues across this country are not real good business men and women. But as my colleague, the CPA from Texas, just pointed out, they better darn well become good business men and women.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the carve-out, but it probably specifically applies to the gentleman, the peach from Georgia. 
   But in any regard, the main point that I would like to make, and maybe my colleagues, the gentleman from Kentucky and my good friend from the Keystone State Mr. Shuster from Pennsylvania, have already mentioned this, but if Congress takes no action, and that is what the Countdown Crew is talking about in these 1,433 days leading up to January 1, I think, 2011. But in 2007, in fact I think this has already occurred, but we can do something about it because tax day, April 15, is, thank goodness, 3 months away. But taxpayers in States with no income tax will not be allowed to deduct their sales taxes from Federal income tax if we don't make a change. And we are talking about Representative Conaway's great State of Texas, a highly populated State. We are talking about the great State of Florida. We are talking about Tennessee and other States. And this is significant, because citizens in those States pay no income tax, no State income tax, but pay huge sales tax to fund their State government, and that will go away if we don't do something about it. 
   In 2007, I think the gentleman from Kentucky mentioned this, the exemption for the alternative minimum tax will decrease from the current $42,500 to $33,750 for a single filer, and from $62,500 to $45,000 for a married couple. 
   In 2009, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the standard deduction for couples as a percentage of the standard deduction for a single individual decreases from 200 percent to 174 percent, further discouraging couples from entering into the great sacrament of matrimony. 
   And in 2010, the section 179, Small Business Expensing Cap, will decrease from $100,000 to $25,000. 
   I heard my colleague from Kentucky, Representative Davis, talk about this just a minute ago; and he made the comment that most of the jobs in this country, and that would include those 7 million new jobs that have occurred since 2003, in fact more new jobs than the European Union and Japan combined, most of those 7 million new jobs are created by small business men and women. And this section 179 which allows them to write off $100,000 in the first year for capital improvement, buying a new piece of equipment, indeed, expanding the size of their operation so they can hire new people, if it goes down t 
   $25,000, you are going to see, just like a stand-alone increase in the minimum wage, you are going to see jobs lost, and all of a sudden that 7 million number is going to start trickling down. 
   It has been mentioned that the child tax credit will decrease from $1,000 to $500. 
   And listen to this, my colleagues: on marginal rates, if this has not already been mentioned, and even if it has, it probably deserves repeating, the 35 percent bracket will increase to 39.6 percent; the 33 percent bracket, 36 percent; 28 percent bracket, 31 percent; 25 percent, up to 28 percent; and, worst of all is the 10 percent bracket will increase to 15 percent. And not to mention capital gains going back up to 20 percent. Dividends, again, double taxation on dividend. All of these things are going to really hurt this economy. 
   And while maybe under our majority leadership there are a lot of areas in which we could have done better, I truly believe, and I think my colleagues here tonight would agree, we could hardly have done better than the 2001 and 2003 tax cut package, many of which I just enumerated, including finally trying to get rid of the double taxation of the death tax, the estate tax. This is what Republicans have done. This is what this President has done. And this has resulted in 7 million new jobs. 
   Instead of an estimated cost to the revenue of $1.3 trillion over 10 years because you made these cuts, guess what: within 2 years we have run the revenue, I think, and my colleague from Texas knows these numbers better than I do, but something like $275 billion more revenue because of the tax cuts. 
   I have said this a number of times on this floor, and maybe the folks at home watching on C-SPAN know this, but in 1960 Democratic President Kennedy cut taxes, revenue went up drastically; in 1980, President Reagan, Republican President, did the same thing and the revenue went up. And of course that is the case that we have here today. 
   Unemployment rate across the country, 4.6 percent. In my State, where we have actually, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, we have actually lost a lot of jobs here recently because both General Motors and Ford have shut down plants that have been in Georgia for a long time, but our unemployment rate is just barely above 5.1 percent, and we are growing jobs in other areas, small businesses primarily as I said earlier. 
   So to be here tonight to talk about this, talk with the Countdown Crew why this is so critical, because we know the Democratic majority has already said it. But this issue of PAYGO that they have put in the rules package, it is an absolute farce. It doesn't even look like the PAYGO provision that the then-ranking member on the Budget Committee, Mr. Spratt from South Carolina, that what he proposed was that there would be no point of order waiver allowed; and yet in this  new rules package that they proffered in the first week of the 110th, they allow that. So that at any point if PAYGO is violated, then they can simply in their Rules Committee waive that point of order. Or if they don't want to appear hypocritical and they don't waive the point of order, then whatever is done on the Senate side and comes back as a conference committee, they waive all points of order. So to have a really meaningful PAYGO provision, then it needs to have the force of law. 
   And I will conclude by pointing out the double standard here. What the Democrats would consider a tax cut and the expiration of these tax cuts as something that has to be offset, but they would not consider the extension of a program that expires, that has a sunset. Let's say as an example, and I think this is a great program and I hope we continue it and maybe even make it better, but as an example of the hypocrisy of PAYGO, take something like the SCHIP program which was authorized 10 years ago and we spend about $5 billion a year on that program. It is scheduled to sunset in June, I think, of 2007, this year. And I am sure it will be reauthorized, but that additional spending will be outside of PAYGO rules. 
   But yet when we have these tax cuts that expire, if we, the Republican minority now, want to continue those great tax cuts for the reasons that the Countdown Crew has enumerated here tonight, then that would be considered a new tax cut and would have to be offset. It is so hypocritical, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues. I think it needs to be said over and over again, and I want to come become and join my colleagues as often as we can to talk about this, because American people need to understand. 
   With that, I yield back to my colleague.

   Basically, what the problem here is the leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle are so focused on saving the planet that they are not going to save the United States of America when we are in this crisis over these oil prices and dependency on foreign countries. 
   Nancy Pelosi herself, the Speaker of the House, said, ``I want to save the planet.'' ``I want to save the planet.'' The majority leader of the Senate said, ``All fossil fuel is poison and we need to get rid of it.'' The gentleman from the Sierra Club, Carl Pope, the executive director, said, ``We are better off without cheap oil, without cheap gas.'' 
   We are better off without cheap gas? Tell that to the people in the 11th Congressional District back in Georgia  when they are paying $4 and $5 a gallon. 
   The bottom line, my colleagues, is what the Democrats have done is come in here with a farce, a hoax of an energy bill, and say, okay, we know the American people, 85 percent of them want an energy bill and they want to be able to drill.

It gives absolutely no revenues to the States for any drilling between 50 and 100 miles.

It ain't going to happen, and she knows it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise very forcibly in favor of this bill. I think that it is a good rule and a good underlying bill, and I'm proud to support it. 
   I agree with my colleague, my former colleague on the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Texas, when he says that this is an internal struggle within the Democratic majority, within the Democratic Party over this piece of legislation just as I think, Mr. Speaker, that they're engaged in an internal struggle over the issue of whether or not to allow drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf for both oil and natural gas and to utilize our own resources to bring down the price of energy and the price at the pump to the American people who are suffering so badly. 
   In that particular legislation, of course, the leadership is in favor of, Mr. Speaker, of saving the planet. The leadership of the Senate is in favor of getting rid of all fossil fuels, which he characterizes as poison; the leader of Sierra Club says it would be a good thing if we had to pay $10 and $12 a gallon for gasoline at the pump. That's the leadership. 
   But there are many, Mr. Speaker, in the Democratic majority rank and file, if you will, the Blue Dog Coalition, they're struggling. They're struggling very badly with that type of policy. And I think they would feel just as we do on this side of the aisle that in these dire economic times, it's time to save not the planet, but to save the United States of America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise, as I say, in strong support of the amendment in the nature of a substitute the Rules Committee has made in order for this legislation. The right of an individual to keep and bear arms is one of the most basic rights provided to all Americans by our Bill of Rights. 
   On June 26, 2008, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that very right for the residents of the Nation's capital in its ruling on the case of the District of Columbia v. Heller. The Court's 5-4 decision rightfully deemed the longstanding ban on handguns in the homes of law-abiding citizens in the District of Columbia to be unconstitutional. 
   Mr. Speaker, in theory, the result of this ruling should have simply allowed Washington, DC, residents to have the same second amendment rights as the rest of this country. Unfortunately though, the D.C. City Council chose to ignore the will of the Supreme Court by passing an ordinance that continues to infringe upon the rights of individuals constitutionally protected. 
   The strongly bipartisan amendment in the nature of a substitute for H.R. 6842 properly addresses the underlying issue to enforce the will of the Supreme Court. It does so by repealing the District of Columbia's current ban on semi-automatic pistols, which are the most commonly owned handguns in this country. It also repeals the needless requirement that a lawful firearm in the home must be either disassembled or bound by a trigger lock; these provisions undermining an individual's ability to provide for their own self-defense and the self-defense of their family and their children. 
   Currently, there are no registered firearms dealers within the District of Columbia, so the amendment made in order will waive Federal law for D.C. residents and simply allow them to lawfully purchase a handgun either in the State of Virginia or in the State of Maryland. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's imperative that we fully enforce the Supreme Court's rule and restore second amendment rights to residents of our Nation's capital. I strongly support the amendment in the nature of a substitute. I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment and, if it is adopted, the underlying bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 326 which commemorates the 25th anniversary of the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
   The idea of the memorial began in 1977 as a way to make amends for the indifference that had met Vietnam veterans who returned home to this country. It was also conceived as a place of honor for the brave young men and women who served and died in the Vietnam war including, Mr. Speaker, my Pony League baseball teammate, Dick Ulmer, and to give the estimated 43 million Americans, parents, brothers, sisters, wives, husbands and children, and yes, including those of 1st Lieutenant Ulmer of North Augusta, South Carolina, so directly affected by the losses in Vietnam a place to remember, to mourn, to reflect, and hopefully to heal. 
   Five years later, in 1982, ground was broken for the memorial and the first panel of the Wall, as the memorial is called today, was unveiled. Since that time, the Wall has become not only the most visited memorial on the National Mall with more than 4 million visitors annually, but also a very powerful and a moving place for recollection, solace and comfort for Vietnam veterans and their families. 
   As a place to honor the more than 58,200 servicemembers who died during the Vietnam war, and that number is just astounding as we think about the current situation in Iraq; and, of course, we mourn each and every one of those 3,600 lives that have been lost over a 4-year period of time. But Vietnam, 58,200 servicemembers died. The Wall has also become a national symbol of healing and coming together. 
   In short, the Wall has achieved a purpose and effect well beyond the original purpose, and no one who goes there can escape the emotional, deep impact that it conveys. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is entirely proper and fitting to commemorate the Wall's 25th anniversary. It honors the selfless sacrifice of not only those who died, but also the service of more than 3 million Americans who served in the Armed Forces in Southeast Asia. And beyond that, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial has helped this Nation reunite after one of the most divisive times in this Nation's history. For these reasons and many more, I urge all Members to support this resolution. I look for a unanimous vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, in my concluding remarks I just want to say that as I listened to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline), my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, talking about the Vietnam War Memorial, the Wall, as he pointed out, I reflected back maybe almost 25 years ago when I went to the Wall for the first time.  
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think I had ever been to any other war memorial. The World War II Memorial, as we know, was not there at the time. But I went to the Wall, the Vietnam War Memorial, to look for the name of a friend. It is kind of hard to find, as we all know, the small engraved names on the wall. Of course they direct you how to do that. I think a lot of us just go to the wall and start looking. 
   As I think back on those years ago when I looked up to see my friend Dick Ulmer's name, and think about that classmate, teammate, friend, weight-lifting buddy when we were in the sixth, seventh, eighth grade, and thinking about the fact, Mr. Speaker, that he had given his life. I thought about his parents, who are now deceased, and of course his wife and his sister. 
   This opportunity today to control the time on our side, and I thank Ms. Shea-Porter for that opportunity, to reflect back on a great hero. I think an important thing for us to remember today as we vote, and I think we will have a unanimous vote on this, is that no matter how popular a conflict, or maybe in the case of the Vietnam War, with many people unpopular, the men and women that paid the price, the ultimate sacrifice, and their families, it doesn't matter what the conflict, they do their duty. 
   God bless them and God bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of House Resolution 443, which recognizes the service of the 65th Infantry Regiment, Puerto Rico National Guard. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, the First Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment, Puerto Rico National Guard, continues a tradition of outstanding service in the Army established by members of that regiment in World War I, World War II, and in Korea. Their motto, ``Honor and Fidelity,'' summarizes that service. 
   Mr. Speaker, in Korea, as an active Army unit, the regiment fought with particular distinction, participating in nine major campaigns from 1950 until 1953. For its actions, the unit was awarded two Presidential Unit Citations, a Meritorious Unit Commendation, and two Republic of Korea Unit Citations. 
   Such outstanding service led General Douglas MacArthur to say: ``The Puerto Ricans of the gallant 65th Infantry on the battlefields of Korea are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle, and I am proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that I had many more like them.'' 
   In achieving such recognition for their competence and valor, the men of the 65th Infantry suffered heavy casualties and numerous vicious battles against determined North Korean and Chinese units. Moreover, the men of the 65th not only had to overcome severe weather and terrain and shortages of clothing and equipment, but also the elements of prejudice and unfavorable bias that they encountered. 
   Mr. Speaker, given the history of outstanding service by the 65th since its inception back in 1898, as well as the continuing commitment and dedication shown by the current members of this unit, it is fitting that we take the time today to recognize and to honor that service. 
   I strongly urge all Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time. Before yielding back, I would like to encourage all of our colleagues, both sides of the aisle, and I am sure we will have a unanimous vote on H.Res 443. I thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for allowing me to control the time on this side.  
   Mr. FORTU&#209;O. Mr. Speaker, during this month, our country proudly celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month. In the midst of this celebration, it is with great honor and pride that I stand in support of H. Res. 443 which seeks to recognize the service of the 65th infantry regiment during the Korean War known as the Borinqueneers Regiment. I also want to thank Congressman MCGOVERN for his leadership in honoring these brave soldiers. At a time when there is a national dialogue on the contributions of Hispanic Americans, there is no better way to recognize their achievements, than by voting for H. Res. 443. 
   We know that since the Civil War, where over 10,000 Hispanic Americans wore uniforms for both sides, the number of soldiers of Hispanic heritage that have served in each conflict has been significant. Their participation in every military conflict is a source of many heroic actions. 
   In World War I, 200,000 Hispanics were mobilized and to this day we hear stories of their valor, and devotion to spread democracy and freedom around the World. 
   Roughly half a million Hispanics served during World War II. They fought bravely in all of the major conflicts extending throughout Europe, the Pacific and Africa. 
   But it is during the Korean War that over 148,000 Hispanics served, of which 20,000 were from my district in Puerto Rico. 4,000 of them comprised the 65th Infantry Regiment, the largest U.S. infantry regiment for that war. This regiment fought in every major campaign of the Korean War and received numerous praises including a Presidential Unit Citation, Meritorious Unit Commendations and two Republic of Korea Unit Citations for their performance. I would like to quote General Douglas MacArthur, who said in Tokyo on February 12, 1951: ``The Puerto Ricans forming the ranks of the gallant 65th Infantry on the battlefields of Korea ..... are writing a brilliant record of achievement in battle and I am proud indeed to have them in this command. I wish that we might have many more like them.'' 
   It is due to this ever-growing identity in the United States, that Hispanic Americans continue to wear, with honor, the uniforms of our Armed Forces. This legislation honors the 65th Infantry Borinqueneers and the legacy they left behind; a legacy of valor, courage and self-sacrifice in the face of adversity. I am proud to be an American of Hispanic descent and equally proud to represent the members of the 65th Infantry Regiment; it is for them that I stand here today in support of this legislation and urge all my colleagues to unanimously vote in favor of H. Res. 443.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 207, recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service, joining my colleague, the mayor of Dayton, and my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee. 
   Many Americans may not realize that for the first 40 years of its existence, the United States Air Force was actually a department of the Army. It was not until President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 that the Air Force became an independent military service and W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force, later a United States Senator. 
   Since 1947, the Air Force has been an integral part of the United States military. Over the last 15 years the United States Air Force has been in continuous combat. Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm featured a full spectrum of Air Force capabilities. During the so-called ``peacekeeping missions'' in Somalia, Haiti and Kosovo, the Air Force contributed logistical and operational support and demonstrated its ability to achieve mission objectives without the use of ground forces. 
   In Georgia's 11th Congressional District, Mr. Speaker, Dobbins Air Reserve Base has contributed to the success of the Air Force by providing key training of pilots and support personnel on both the C-130 and the C-5 platforms. In addition to Dobbins' training capabilities, FEMA's Federal Incident Response Team Atlanta is staged at Dobbins, and it mobilizes throughout the Southeast to disasters, both natural and manmade. 
   Dobbins also plays a role in the continued air dominance of the United States as the initial testing grounds for the F-22 Raptor stealth fighter. 
   Never before has the United States' ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities. Whether in a leading role or a support role, the United States Air Force has proved its unsurpassed airspace and cyberspace capabilities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to remember the importance of a strong national defense and certainly vote in favor of H. Con. Res. 207.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to pay tribute to Mt. Sinai Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia, celebrating 143 years of spiritual service to our community. 
   The history of Mt. Sinai reaches back nearly as far as the history of Marietta itself. In 1864, 1 year before the Civil War ended, a group of black slaves gathered in the backwoods of Georgia and they began their own worship service, and by 1873 the now freed slaves built Mt. Sinai Baptist Church on a plot of land south of Marietta. 
   They were not content to merely be a house of worship. Mt. Sinai created a school to educate the children of former slaves and became a central gathering place for the whole community. 
   Mr. Speaker, today Mt. Sinai Baptist Church carries on that tradition as a spiritual and communal leader in Marietta. Currently under the guidance of Pastor Albert Johnson, the church is upholding its legacy of education and outreach, the same commitment that it has displayed for nearly 1 1/2 centuries. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me today in congratulating the Mt. Sinai Baptist Church on 143 years of service and request that they have at least 143 more.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment that I am offering along with the gentleman from Ohio, Representative JIM JORDAN. This amendment would ensure that none of the funds made available in this act may be used to establish or implement any requirement that individuals receive vaccinations of the human papillomavirus, or HPV, as a condition of school admittance or matriculation. 
   Essentially, the amendment would serve as an incentive to States to keep HPV vaccination programs voluntary and not mandatory. 
   Madam Chairman, at least 24 States have entertained legislation which takes the unprecedented step of requiring young girls to be vaccinated against HPV. I say ``unprecedented'' because HPV is not a communicable disease. It is not mumps. It is not measles. You don't get it by sneezing or sharing a juice box over recess. HPV is, in fact, a sexually transmitted disease. As such, vaccination should not be mandatory to attend school. 
   Indeed, Madam Chairman, we urgently need to address this issue. The Commonwealth of Virginia has already enacted a vaccine mandate into law. The District of Columbia City Council has passed one that is awaiting congressional action. 
   Madam Chairman, there are many reasons parents and students might object to mandatory HPV vaccination, from age appropriateness, indeed, initially, in the State of Texas it was going to be required for admission to middle school for fifth and sixth graders, and concerns over vaccine safety. I could go on. But whatever the reason, it is a discussion for parents and physicians, not legislators and bureaucrats. 
   Madam Chairman, excluding children from school for refusal to be vaccinated for a disease that is spread only by sexual intercourse is a serious, precedent-setting action that trespasses on the rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children, as well as on the rights of children to attend school. A mandatory HPV vaccine program improperly and unnecessarily inserts the government into lives of children, parents and physicians. 
   The American College of Pediatricians is opposed to it. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons is opposed to it. We need to make sure that these programs are not mandatory. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, on June 29, 2004, the United States Commission of Social Security signed a totalization agreement with the director general of Mexican Social Security Institute to coordinate our Social Security programs. 
   The Social Security Totalization Agreement with Mexico gives those who have broken our laws the ability to claim Social Security benefits. While current U.S. law prohibits illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security benefits, until 2004 the law did permit illegal aliens to claim credit for work in the United States. If these individuals have amassed over 40 quarters of work, whether their status was legal or illegal, they would be eligible for full benefits. 
   Considering the ongoing debate over reform and solvency of our Social Security system, it is important to first remove financial incentives to individuals who undermine our immigration laws and then claim benefits, further jeopardizing our U.S. citizens' safety net. The Social Security Administration estimates that this totalization agreement with Mexico would result in 50,000 additional Mexicans qualifying for Social Security benefits in the first 5 years alone. This will only added to the problem of Social Security insolvency. 
   Without necessary reform, our Social Security system is set to go broke by 2042. Nobody disputes that date. However, Mexicans qualifying for Social Security benefits would cost the system $650 million a year by 2050. 
   A totalization agreement between the United States and Mexico is good only for Mexico. The Mexican Government requires a citizen, including a United States citizen, to pay into their system 24 years as opposed to 10 in the United States. And because of this disparity, the Social Security Administration estimates that only 3,000 American workers would be able to claim benefits in Mexico compared to the 50,000 Mexicans claiming benefits in the United States. 
   The United States-Mexico Totalization Agreement, Madam Chairman, is bad policy for an already distressed Social Security system and I believe an irresponsible way to spend the money of the American taxpayer. On top of everything else, the totalization agreement can go into effect without congressional approval because it would automatically become law within 60 days of being filed by the White House if Congress does not act. 
   With this in mind, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, the Gingrey amendment, specifically address this problem with Mexico, and remove the incentive for the Social Security Administration to fulfill the United States-Mexico Social Security Totalization Agreement. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, I would just say to my friend, the gentleman from California, the totalization agreements we have with other countries, I think there are some 20 other countries, and this totalization agreement with Mexico would cost more than all of those 20 agreements combined at the 50,000 estimate that I gave. 
   In addition to that, the Social Security Administration estimates the 50,000 number is a significant underestimate. So I feel very strongly that at a time when our Social Security system is in such a dire crisis, needs significant reform, for us to have a totalization agreement with Mexico that in  fact of course has already been negotiated and signed for all of those workers prior to 2004; and, no, it doesn't apply to any after 2004, but this is a significant cost that we cannot afford. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Turner), the ranking member of the subcommittee, for yielding. I also, Mr. Speaker, want to thank my good friend from Illinois, Representative Davis, for the kind words that he just expressed toward Sergeant Paul Saylor and for allowing this bill to come forward today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6092, a bill that I introduced to honor the life of Paul Anthony Saylor by designating the post office in Bremen, Georgia, in Haralson County, as the Sergeant Paul Saylor Post Office. 
   Mr. Speaker, thankfully we are at a point today where the Iraqi Government is proving to be more and more capable of securing its country and where al Qaeda terrorists are on the verge of being completely routed. But we can all agree that the road on which we have traveled has been anything but smooth. Indeed, we have lost 4,166 of our Nation's greatest treasures in Iraq, the lives of the patriotic, heroic men and women who have served there.  
   They are not just statistics, Mr. Speaker. There is a story behind each and every one of the brave men and women who have died serving our country in this global war on terror. I have come to know Paul's story very well over the last 3 years. You have heard the stories of other fallen heroes today who are being honored in the same way. 
   Paul Saylor's story is indeed one of courage, kindness, generosity, and devotion to his family and to his great country. Paul was a beloved son to his parents, Jamie and Patti; a beloved brother to Little Jamie, his big brother; and a beloved nephew to Linda Kirkland. He enjoyed playing high school football with his older brother, and was known for his smile and his caring heart. My colleagues, I want you to look at Paul Saylor in this poster. He is, indeed, a kind young man. 
   Since Paul's death, many have spoken of his penchant for standing up for others who were being bullied, for picking people up when they were down. It is a testament to the affection that others had for Paul that of the 5,000 citizens of Bremen, Georgia, his hometown, over 1,500 attended his funeral. 
   Mr. Speaker, it was Paul's sense of duty that led him to join the Georgia National Guard following his attendance at North Georgia College and State University. Upon joining, Paul probably had no idea he would be called upon to defend his country and our freedom in Iraq, but when he was, he bravely answered that call. 
   He served our Nation in Iraq as a member of the Georgia National Guard's 48th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. Paul lost his life on August 15, 2005, almost 3 years ago, while on patrol in Al Mahmudiyah, Iraq, when the vehicle in which he was traveling rolled down an embankment into a canal. He and two of his fellow scout team members died that day. Paul was 21 years old. 
   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, upon being returned to his family, Paul's remains were in a state of advanced decomposition and they were not able to see him that one last time for the final good-bye.     
   His family has worked tirelessly since then to assure that the improved treatment of the remains of all fallen soldiers would ensure that no family, no family would ever have to experience a similar fate of not being able to view their son or daughter one last time. 
   As I worked with Paul's family to address any potential shortfalls in our mortuary process, I have visited the mortuary facility at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, as well as Mortuary Affairs Collection Point in Iraq, exactly where Paul fell, to try to evaluate the current processes and the procedures and identify any areas where improvements could be made. And those efforts led eventually to the inclusion of a provision last year in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2007 requiring that all medical personnel be thoroughly trained not only in saving lives but also in remains preservation before they are deployed into the theater. 
   This training is currently being carried out in the medical training facilities at Fort Sam Houston and the Brook Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas. On a recent visit last month, I was able to determine that the Army is solemnly carrying out this duty, and I am proud to report that to my colleagues. 
   While we could never do enough to support and honor Paul's sacrifice, it is the least we can do to ensure that we honor the remains of our fallen heroes with the dignity and respect that they deserve. Our Nation will be forever indebted to Sergeant Paul Saylor. I know he is here with us today, and I would like to say to him, Thank you, Paul. Thank you for your service. And I want to thank his family. Paul, your spirit lives on, and you will never be forgotten. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me today in honoring Sergeant Paul Saylor. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 6092.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much my good friend and colleague from Georgia yielding, and I appreciate his taking the time and leading the time tonight to continue to talk about what I consider and what my constituents in the 11th district of Georgia, Northwest Georgia, feel is the most important, the single most important issue facing our Nation and, for that matter, political issue as well as we move toward these November elections. 
   People in my district told me on Monday, just yesterday, at a town hall meeting in Bartow County, Cartersville, Georgia, a great part of my district--a town hall meeting, Mr. Speaker, as you know, they are not partisan. You don't just invite Democrats or Republicans. You invite your constituents. And we probably had 50 people there. And I don't know if it was an equal mix. I guess since I won my election last time with 71 percent of the vote, it probably wasn't an equal mix, but there were some very bright young Democratic folks there who probably in November won't vote for me. But we had a great discussion about this issue and just what Congressman Westmoreland is talking about in regard to the need to come up with a solution and not continue to play politics over this. 
   I have a couple of posters, if my colleagues will bear with me. I want you to take a test, one of these tests that I always loved taking in high school and college and even medical school, a multiple choice question. Sometimes you can guess. But I'm going to hold up this slide for my colleagues and ask them this question. And I appreciate my good friend from Illinois for helping me do this. 
   Question: How do we bring down the price of oil? A pretty simple, straightforward question. Well, it's multiple choice. 
   A, open up oil exploration in ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf. ANWR, of course, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. That would be one of the choices. 
   B, build new oil refineries. That might be a pretty good choice. We haven't made it in the last 25 years, unfortunately. All the oil refineries in the United States, unfortunately, are down along the gulf coast, and we know all too well how dangerous a situation that is, especially as we are coming into what could be a rather horrific hurricane season. 
   Maybe choice C, commercially develop renewable energy. Now, we are talking about wind and solar, two perfect examples of renewable energy. In this country our electricity grid, we generate about 1 to 2 percent of our power from those renewable sources. We can do better. I absolutely think we can do better when countries like Germany probably are producing 30 percent of their energy from renewables. 
   Well, maybe you would pick, let's see, D, if my colleagues could again refer to this slide, commission new nuclear power plants. I think since the mid 1970s, we have not commissioned a new nuclear power plant. I used to work in one as a co-op student in Barnwell, South Carolina, when I was attending Georgia Tech. Clean, efficient, safe, a great source of energy. Maybe when the price of gasoline was $1.50 a gallon, you might say, well, it's too expensive to start a nuclear power plant; but when it's $4.10 a gallon, I think it's time to consider strongly nuclear power. That could be a good choice as the perfect answer to this question, How do we bring down the price of oil? France, I believe, if I am not mistaken, and my colleagues can correct me if I'm wrong, I think, produces about 80 percent of their energy from nuclear power, as do some of the Scandinavian countries, and I have been there and I have visited.     
   Let's see. How about choice number E, promote conservation? I think a lot of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the American people would agree we ought to conserve. We are 300 million people, and a world population of 6 billion. If my math is correct, and I took six quarters of calculus at Georgia Tech, that is not 25 percent of the world population, but we are using 25 percent of the world production of fossil fuel. That is too much. And we need to bring it down, and we can do that. I think maybe that would be a good choice. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, choice number F. That says: All of the above. I won't keep you in suspense too much longer as we move to my second and last slide. The answer clearly is F, all of the above. We have got a few pictures here kind of pointing that out. Oil and natural gas off of the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico, the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, where we are prohibited from drilling, where there are literally trillions of barrels, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and billions of barrels of oil when you add that eastern Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of our country. 
   But the picture shows it all; nuclear power, wind and solar, drilling, of course, in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, which is a tiny portion, 2,000 acres out of 19 million, as depicted here in this corner of Alaska. 
   So this is basically, Mr. Speaker, and I appreciate very much Mr. Westmoreland letting me develop this point of argument that people in my district clearly yesterday let me know that this is what they want. They want a balanced approach, and all of the above is what we need to do. That is exactly what Mr. Westmoreland has been saying, and my colleagues, repeatedly. 
   We are ready, Mr. Speaker, and I turn to my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, the majority, who has the ability, the power. They can control everything that comes to this floor. And it's time to worry less about monkey bites and more about the people of this country suffering. 
   I think Mr. Westmoreland earlier used the expression: Let my oil and gas flow. It made me think a little bit biblical. I don't want to get too biblical because I will get out of my lane in a hurry, Mr. Speaker. But it's like Moses said to Pharaoh: Let my people go. Moses wouldn't do it, he wouldn't do it. He promised time after time. He kept reneging, even though his own people were suffering tremendously. I don't know what he was betting on back there many thousands of years ago, but he was wrong. He finally did let the people go. 
   I don't know what game, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority is playing. I don't understand it. If they look at the polls, if that is the way they are making their decisions on legislation, people, Democrats, Republicans, independents by a wide majority want a solution. They want a comprehensive approach. We are ready. We are reaching out. We are literally begging. That is  why we are here tonight, saying to our colleagues on both sides of the aisles, Let's get this done. Let's get it done ASAP, and that means as soon as possible, before we leave this town at the end of July and walk away from here for a month's break. Shame on us if we don't get this done. 
   I yield back to my colleague.

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, that situation I think needs to be answered. A lot of people say, well, we don't want to drill on the Outer Continental Shelf, the coast of California, because we may contaminate the San Francisco Bay. As the gentleman from Illinois pointed out, and I will yield back quickly, even during the hurricanes, when these oil rigs were blown over, not one drop of oil was spilled. But this tanker that was coming from the Middle East with hundreds of thousands of gallons of petroleum, it cracks up and that is where you get the spills. 
   That is why I would say to the environmentalists, help us solve that problem, so we don't have to import all this raw petroleum from other countries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I am very happy to be before my colleagues on the House floor this evening to talk about a hugely important issue that we will be dealing with once again this week in all probability. 
   As you know, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, I am talking about the issue of stem cell research. Last week the Senate was in session, and once again the bill that passed on the House floor in the 109th Congress, the Castle-DeGette bill, which would require Federal funding, taxpayer funding for embryonic stem cell research that was obtained by the destruction of the so-called ``throwaway embryos'' from infertility assisted reproductive technology clinics that couples say they did not want, that these were extras. Well, that bill that passed last year on this House floor passed the Senate last week, and, Madam Speaker, we will be seeing that bill very soon once again. 
   So, I want to be present tonight to talk about this very, very important issue with my colleagues and anyone that has an opportunity within ear distance of what we are speaking about tonight to help bring an understanding to this issue and to try to convince my colleagues that we can do this; that is, we can do stem cell research as we have been doing over the last several years. 
   Since President Bush's first term in office way back in 2001, we have been spending Federal tax dollars on stem cell research. But what the President said in August of 2001 was that he would not allow Federal tax dollars, your tax dollars, my tax dollars, those of my family, my parents, my constituents, to be used to fund stem cell research that resulted in the destruction of a human life. 
   What President Bush did say back then was that embryonic stem cell research that was ongoing, that was a result of cell lines developed from human embryos that had already been destroyed could continue; and Federal tax dollars could be used through the NIH to give grants to these researchers as they applied to use these existing cell lines, which indeed did come from the destruction of human life, as I believe life begins at conception, in these embryos that were taken from fertility clinics. 
   In fact, Madam Speaker, I want to emphasize that point because it is so important that our colleagues understand that, especially new Members on both sides of the aisle that weren't here for the debate last year, that got the impression maybe they and their constituents felt that this administration and the former leadership of this Congress in the 109th was spending nothing, was refusing to fund stem cell research whether it was adult or embryonic. 
   But the facts are really brought home by this first slide, Madam Speaker, that I want to present. And this is basically what it says: Our government invested in lifesaving research. The Federal Government has spent $161 million since 2003 on human embryonic stem cell research. As I pointed out, Madam Speaker, the President was willing to allow that funding to continue on those embryonic stem cell lines that had already been created. And there was some 60 of those stem cell lines where researchers could get a grant from the Federal Government and begin that important research on these stem cells. 
   Before that, no administration, no President, at no time in the 40 years that the Democrats controlled the Congress, certainly not during President Clinton's 8 years, was one dime of Federal tax dollars spent on embryonic stem cell research. Some was spent on adult stem cell research. But when it was suggested by scientists that maybe the embryonic stem cells had more potential to develop into a lot of different tissues and ultimately organs that could possibly help people with diseases, and we have all seen those television spots with celebrities in some cases, Michael J. Fox, who is suffering severely from Parkinson's disease.     
   The life of Christopher Reeves, we all know about the tragic injury and the quadriplegic state that he suffered in for many years before his tragic death last year. 
   When you see those things, you know, you think, well, we are not doing anything. But the truth is, and it is very important for us to understand this, that under President Bush, indeed, since 2003, some $608 million has been spent on stem cell research. And a lot of that, as I point out, because of those previous embryonic stem cell lines, a lot of it has been on embryonic stem cell research, and he is the only President that allowed that. 
   Now, we have great Members in both bodies and on both sides of the aisle. And I have a tremendous amount of respect, Madam Speaker, for the two Members in this body, in this House, that felt that because maybe these embryonic stem cell lines that were previously created that were being used for research would exhaust themselves, that we would use up all those stem cells. We certainly haven't, at this moment. I think there is still 20 of those stem cell lines in existence. Some were found to be contaminated. Originally, I think, back in 2001, we estimated that there were 60 of those lines, and now we are down to 20. So I can understand the concern that maybe we would exhaust that supply. 
   So Congressman Castle, a Republican Member, Congresswoman DeGette, a Democratic Member, along with the Senate colleagues, Senator  Reid, Senator Kennedy, Senator Specter, in a bipartisan way, felt the same thing. So these two bills came before the respective bodies in the 109th Congress. We did pass the Castle-DeGette bill, but the Senate failed to deal with that, until finally it was decided that they would go ahead and pass a companion bill, and then my colleagues, of course, know that the President, as he had said all along that he would veto that bill, and he did. 
   But what I want to make sure that the new Members understand is that people like myself, who are pro-life Members of this body, we support stem cell research, with only one exception. We don't support research that requires killing of a human life. And last year, I, along with Congressman Roscoe Bartlett, the gentleman from Maryland, a Ph.D. physiologist who knows more about this subject, I guess, than anybody in this body, and we worked together to develop an alternative bill that would allow us, we the Federal Government, to fund research programs that would use embryonic-like cells to get to the same point without destroying human life. And some of the things that were suggested in the Bartlett-Gingrey bill that we voted on, in this House, in the 109th Congress, were to obtain an embryonic cell from a stem cell from an embryo without destroying that embryo, to be able to, essentially, biopsy with a fine needle and obtain those embryonic cells without killing or even harming in any way that little embryo which had the potential, of course, for human life. We didn't want to destroy that life. 
   And this was part of the Roscoe Bartlett-Gingrey bill. And we felt that this was sort of a win/win situation, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, because we would be able to get to the same point without any collateral damage. And of course the collateral damage that I am talking about is the destruction of a human life. 
   And I want to go through a few of the posters that we have, and I want to point out, Madam Speaker, that a lot of our colleagues who are in support of destroying those human embryos, kind of indiscriminately, so that we can obtain the embryonic cells that hopefully can lead to cure of some of these diseases that I mentioned, would say in their argument, look, 75, 80 percent of the American people are in favor of this. How could we deny that overwhelming show of support when you ask the American people do they want us to do this, and therefore, we think we should, and we are going to pass this bill, over the President's objection. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, as we all know, in regard to a response, it really sort of depends on how you ask the question. If you ask the question, and maybe a person sitting at home gets a telephone call of a pollster, and they have been watching television, and they have just seen a clip of Michael J. Fox and the ravages of Parkinson's disease, or Christopher Reeves, as he sits there with the breathing machine, struggling to talk to the American people about his struggles, and then they get that call, and it is a pollster and they say, would you be in favor of using embryonic stem cells in research to help cure these diseases? And of course that individual may also just happen to have a family member who is in the nursing home suffering from something like Alzheimer's is an example. 
   And sure, I mean, Madam Speaker, if I were one of those individuals that got that call, I would say, absolutely. Absolutely. So I am surprised the number 
   was only 75 percent. I would think it would be 95 percent, if you phrase the question in that way. 
   Now, on the other hand, if you said, and you prefaced that with, would you be in favor of your tax dollars going to fund this research on embryonic stem cells that might help cure one of these devastating diseases, then no doubt that number would go down a little bit. I don't know how much, but no doubt. When you start saying, well, now, it is your money. It is not somebody else's money, in the abstract. It is your money. Now, do you want to spend your money, the numbers would not be as high. 
   But in this, the point I am getting to, Madam Speaker, in this next slide, if you ask the question this way, and this is the only fair way to ask this scientific question, say to the individual, stem cells are the basic cells from which all of a person's tissues and organs develop. Congress is considering the question of Federal funding for experiments using stem cells from human embryos. The live embryos would be destroyed in their first week of development to obtain these cells. Do you support or oppose using your Federal tax dollars for such experiments? That is the question that should be asked. And when it was asked, in a poll conducted by the International Communications Research in May of 2006, this is what the survey said. Those who support that, 38 percent. Those who oppose it, 47.8 percent. So, Madam Speaker, that really is the crux of what we are talking about in regard to, do the American people support research using embryonic stem cells that result in the wanton, indiscriminate destruction of a human embryo, the so-called extra, and I will get into that point later in the discussion, extra, throwaway, nobody wants them, little babies. 
   And if you believe as I do that life begins at conception, these embryos are several days to a week, maybe even 10 days old, long past the moment of conception. 
   We are blessed tonight, my colleagues, to have one of our colleagues join me in this discussion. And she just happens to represent a wonderful district in North Carolina that includes the Wake Forest Baptist University and Medical Center. And I want her to share with us some of the research that is going on there at Wake Forest and the Wake Forest School of Medicine. 
   I had an opportunity, Madam Speaker, as I was returning to Washington yesterday, to stop at Wake Forest and to visit with Dr. Anthony Atala, who is the president of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University, and to spend about 3 hours with Dr. Atala, to have an opportunity to meet with Dr. Hatch, the president of Wake Forest University, and Dr. Richard Dean who is the dean of the medical school. And with the 150, they weren't all there, but quite a few were, Ph.D. and M.D. scientists that are working there at that great university, and some of the things that they are doing to give us an opportunity to obtain pluripotent, almost embryonic-like stem cells that will help us do this kind of research that our colleagues want us to continue, and the President wants to fund, with no collateral damage. 
   So at this point I want to yield to my colleague, Virginia Foxx from North Carolina, to tell us a little bit more about that program and take as much time as she wants. And we will continue our dialogue. And I yield now to my good friend, Virginia Foxx.

   Mr. GINGREY. Reclaiming my time, on that point for just a second, Dr. Atala's research in regard to amniotic fluid cells, which that study was published just this January of 2007 in the journal Nature Biotechnology, was an amazing accomplishment in what Dr. Atala says. And I know this, as an OBGYN physician from the great State of Georgia in my prior life where I practiced for 26 years, delivering 5,200 babies. What Dr. Atala is doing, you can obtain this amniotic fluid from a pregnant mom, pregnant woman, in the process of trying to make sure that she is not carrying a baby that has a genetic defect. A lot of times this is done if a woman is a little older. She is not old at age 35 but is considered a little older for childbearing and the increased risk of genetic defects. So a lot of women do have this amniocentesis done. And if not an amniocentesis, a biopsy actually can be taken of a part of the placenta through the cervix as early as 9 weeks of the pregnancy or obtain the amniotic fluid with a very fine needle as early as 10 or 11 weeks of the pregnancy. 
   So I just wanted to point that out to my colleague that we are just talking about a few weeks more mature in getting those cells, which are almost embryonic because they are so early.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentlelady from North Carolina who I said represents Wake Forest University and Dr. Atala and his team there. 
   And her closing comments, Madam Speaker, segue really into my next slide in this poster that I've got. What Ms. Foxx said is we have to not go down that slippery slope. We have to consider the collateral damage of what we do. We have to be very, very careful that we are not playing God. And I say  that with all honest, sincerity, that we have an opportunity to do ethical stem cell research; and by that I simply mean balancing life and science. 
   Ms. Foxx talked about a number of the techniques. She talked about obtaining stem cells from umbilical cord blood. She talked about obtaining adult stem cells from bone marrow or from blood. And she talked about the many successes utilizing research with adult stem cell research. And the cures, I think she mentioned 70 different diseases, including Type I diabetes. There was just a study from Brazil where 13 of 15 Type I juvenile, we call it, it is not always in children, but a lot of children get juvenile diabetes, the severe kind of diabetes that almost always requires insulin therapy, and even with good control, leads to devastating complications, such as blindness, kidney failure, the need for a kidney transplant. Thirteen out of 15 of these Type I diabetics in Brazil who were treated with adult stem cells were found to be months later developing insulin on their own. These stem cells went to the pancreas and became the so-called islet cells, and now 13 out of 15 of those patients are not having to use insulin at all to control their diabetes. 
   So some of the ethical ways. And then of course we talked about Dr. Atala, who happens also to be chairman of the Department of Urology and operates every day on what you might call routine things, but at the same time is spending a lot of his effort running the Institute for Regenerative Medicine, where they are studying ways to obtain, through amniotic fluid, cells that are neither completely embryonic nor completely adult, but they have qualities that are very similar to both, in being similar to embryonic cells, those that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle mostly, although some Republicans supported the Castle-DeGette as well, the need to use these cells. Well, if you can get the amniotic cells, they can double every 36 hours just like the embryonic cells that we are talking about in destroying a human embryo. But also, similar to an adult cell, they do not form tumors. And that is one of the huge problems that the research on embryonic cells has resulted in. 
   How do you solve that problem? Well, with Dr. Atala's research, we wouldn't have that problem. These cells would double every 36 hours, and they don't form tumors. The best of both worlds. 
   I see my colleague from Texas has joined us. He is a fellow insomniac, although it is a little earlier out in Texas and maybe his constituents are still up, certainly some are in California; but it is great to have him with me tonight. 
   At this point I would like to yield to the gentleman from east Texas and let him join in on this very, very important topic.

   Mr. GINGREY. If the gentleman would yield, and I really so much appreciate him pointing that out. 
   I think what the gentleman is saying is, no tumor formation, no collateral damage, no destruction of life, lives that could be adopted and become a ``snowflake'' baby, we have a slide later on to show. But I wanted to mention to my colleague, and I like his comments on this. In addition to the work that Dr. Atala is doing at Wake Forest, and I didn't know this, this is the last year, I say to the gentleman from Texas, but in my great State of Georgia, at the University of Georgia, a Ph.D. researcher, Dr. Steve Stice, has a project whereby embryonic stem cells from embryos can be obtained if it is an embryo that once it is rethawed and there is maybe an attempt to place that in a mother's womb, but if you look at it under the microscope, he can tell if that embryo has the potential for further generation. It is not dead, but you might equate it to, say, a person who has no brainwave activity, the other extreme of life, and has no chance of recovery. Well, Dr. Stice, his research would be to obtain those embryonic stem cells from those embryos so you wouldn't be destroying human life. 
   And I yield back to my colleague because I wanted to make him aware of that. Our Senator, our junior Senator, who is so prescient and has a way of solving problems when you've got a divide like this, Senator Johnny Isakson, along with Senator Norm Coleman from Minnesota, introduced a bill in the Senate last week and it passed overwhelmingly. I think it got 75 votes. And I hope that we will have an opportunity to vote on that bill in this House if, Madam Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, will allow that to come to voice for a vote; because I can't see why any Member, Republican or Democrat, pro-life, pro-choice, would not want to support that, where it is a win-win situation. I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Judge Gohmert, I thank you for your kind remarks; and of course you are here not to praise me but to praise God and life and the sanctity of life at the extremes, the embryo and the senior citizens as well. 
   My colleagues, Madam Speaker, I cannot over-emphasize the point as I look at this and reference you to this next slide. No lives, no lives are thrown away. 
   We have heard, all of our colleagues have heard people speak on this floor and say there are 400,000 of these extra throw-away embryos available for this research, and they are going to be and I have even heard people say, thrown down the toilet, that they are garbage. I have heard the expression, and I know this is appalling, Madam Speaker, but to hear the expression that it is nothing but medical waste and they are going to be thrown away anyway, I know that gives many of us and you and me and many of my colleagues chill bumps to think about that. 
   But the point is of these 400,000, those are not all extra and scheduled for the trash can and available for the harvesting of embryonic stem cells. The fact is in April 2002, there were a total of 396,000 embryos that had been placed  in storage, frozen for possible later use. Of those, and that is what this slide points out, 88 percent of these frozen embryos, in fact close to 350,000, are being held for future family building by the donors. They have not completed their family. Maybe they have not gotten pregnant yet. They have not conceived. So 88 percent are going to remain preserved in a frozen state so that hopefully these infertile couples will hopefully at some point in the future become parents. 
   And only 2.8 percent, about 8,700 of the frozen embryos, are designated for destruction. Couples a lot of times are asked the question: Well, would you like to give this baby up for destruction so that we can get these embryonic stem cells, or would you rather just throw them away? Well, half of the people that own those embryos would say for whatever reason, maybe the same reason that folks sometimes say no, I don't want an autopsy on my loved one; or no, I don't want to donate an organ when I am in a massive automobile accident and I am brain dead. A lot of people will say, look, I don't want my embryo, my child, to be put in a blender for the sake of obtaining those embryonic stem cells. I would rather it be thrown away. 
   So this business of 400,000 available, it is nothing near that amount. It is very important for people and our colleagues to understand and to put that in perspective. 
   Madam Speaker, I know our time is running short. We are rapidly approaching the time that this body will be adjourning for the day, a busy day. And I have one poster in particular that I want my colleagues to take a close look at. This is the one that I am presenting now with these precious children. 
   These were frozen embryos. These were part of the so-called medical waste that was going to be thrown away; or, indeed, put in a blender and churned up, destroying these little lives. Thank God the ones on this poster were adopted by infertile couples, with the permission from the couples who owned those embryos. These are what we refer to as the snowflake babies. 
   Last year when we were debating this issue, many of them, the parents went out of their way to take time off work, to buy an airline ticket and fly up here with these toddlers, some months old, and some a few years old. And I saw at the White House, as President Bush vetoed this bill last year, he was holding a set of snowflake baby twins. Indeed, throw away medical waste. I think not. 
   These little children on this poster look a lot like my six grandchildren. I have three precious granddaughters and three precious grandsons, and I think how precious life is. 
   We need to think about this very, very closely. I want to ask my colleagues this question, just like the survey, the polling done and you ask the question in the right way: some of us are pro-life. Some of us are pro-choice. Some of us are Democrats, some of us are Republicans. But if we have an opportunity to obtain embryonic stem cells, maybe they do have more potential than the adult stem cells. I don't know. I do know they have this problem with tumor formation. But if the argument is our hands have been tied, although we have funded embryonic stem cell research on those existing cell lines, but if the opportunity is there and we considered that tonight and talked about Dr. Atala's work on obtaining nearly embryonic, nearly totipotential cells, we also can do things like biopsy an embryo, that is called pregenetic diagnosis, and we do that all the time now. 
   If an embryo is from a family that has a congenital defect like hemophilia or muscular dystrophy, you can biopsy that embryo to make sure that condition does not exist. If you can do that without harming the embryo, and it has been done thousands of times, we ought to be able to do the same technique and get embryonic stem cells. It takes some research. 
   If we can continue to fund scientists like Dr. Stice at the University of Georgia in regard to using those essentially brain dead embryos that don't have any potential for further life and get those embryonic stem cells, we don't have to get into this argument, Madam Speaker, between the pro-life and pro-choice community. 
   Isn't that, my colleagues, the way to go? I hope there is an opportunity this year in the 110th Congress to vote on that bill and give the President something that he can sign and get back to us and make it law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Congressman Price, I thank you so much for letting me join with you and the Truth Squad in talking about the real truth in regard to what burdens are on the American people, particularly on this day, tax day, April 17. And it reminds me that there is another date coming up pretty soon, and I think that is on April 22, and that is called tax freedom day. And that day gets later and later in the calendar year each and every year. That is how long a person has to work to pay their tax burden, not only to the Federal Government but to local and State and the entire tax burden. Almost a third of the year, Madam Speaker, people have to work to pay the tax burden. 
   So we in the Republican Party feel very strongly that we need to cut taxes, simplify taxes, lower taxes. And we can do that, and we have done that. We did it in 2001, we did it in 2003. And while we heard from our friends on the other side of the aisle in the previous hour, the so-called Blue Dog Coalition, in regard to the costs to the revenue stream of the tax cuts, saying that we only cut taxes for people making more than $400,000 a year, when in fact, Madam Speaker, everybody who pays taxes got a tax cut under the tax cut provisions that this President and the former majority, the Republican Party, enacted for the American people. 
   And while, when you crunch the numbers, that was estimated to cost $1.3 trillion, or $130 billion each and every year over a 10-year period of time, because supposedly you would be taking in less revenue, in fact it stimulated the economy; and over a 2 1/2 year period of time, the amount of revenue that came into the Federal Government actually increased by $250 billion. 
   So our good friends, the Blue Dogs, play a little bit loose with the truth in regard to their calculus. And really it is not calculus, Madam Speaker, it is simple math. The gentlemen that spoke, the four or five of them in the previous hours, our friends, the Blue Dogs, they would make great red dogs. They come from States that the so-called Blue Dog Democrats are traditionally conservative, they are fiscally conservative. They are conservative on social issues. 
   And we had the gentleman from Arkansas, we had a Member from Tennessee, we had a Member from Indiana, we had a Member from Ohio. It doesn't surprise me that they would be sounding like Republicans, because many of them represent Republican-leaning, typically traditional districts. And when we earn back our majority, Madam Speaker, I think that the Blue Dogs that we are hearing from, the five by tonight, there are a total of 43, many of them would make great red dogs; and I look forward to the day that they join us. 
   But, Madam Speaker, in the meantime, I think that I need to talk to them about their math a little bit. They spent some time talking about the debt and the fact that all of this money that we have had to borrow, this $8.8 trillion worth of debt, comes from foreign countries. The gentleman from Arkansas listed, I think, the top nine. And they want to imply that all of the debt is money that we have had to borrow from rogue nations, if you will. But they are not rogue nations.     
   But the point I want to make, Madam Speaker, is that only about 25 percent of that debt is held by any foreign nation, whether we are talking about Germany or France or Spain or Portugal or, yes, China or India. Seventy-five percent of that debt is held by my mom and my dad and our Blue Dog grandparents and corporate America and the United States citizens. Americans borrow or lend that money to the United States Government because they have faith in the full credit of this great country. So this implication that only rogue nations are willing to borrow money or lend money to this country is totally ludicrous. 
   And if the gentleman from Georgia, my good friend and colleague, Dr. Price, will indulge me for a few minutes, I want to also point out another very, very misleading figure. They take that debt, that $8.8 trillion worth of debt that has accumulated over a number of years. 
   Don't forget, Madam Speaker, and my good friends on the other side of the aisle, they controlled this place for 40 years. And that $8.8 trillion worth of debt didn't just occur overnight. 
   But they take 300 million people, man, woman and child, the population of this great country, and they divide it into $8.8 trillion, and they come up with $27,000 worth of debt for every man, woman and child in this country. 
   Well, Madam Speaker, what is the gross domestic product, the wealth of this country? I think 2006, maybe would be the last figure that I have, it was about $13 trillion. So you divide that same number into the gross domestic product, you could say that the share of the wealth of this country of every man, woman and child is $44,000.  
   So, like I say, they are playing a little loose with the numbers, and they go on and talk about this budget resolution that they have got and how they are going to balance the budget and have no deficit over a 5-year period of time and actually have a little bit of money in the bank in 2012. 
   How do they do that, Madam Speaker? They do it by letting the tax cuts of the Republican majority and our President expire. The decrease in the marginal rate for every person that is paying taxes, the increase, the doubling of the child tax credit, the elimination, and once again, reinserting the marriage tax penalty, and that is total, when you add up every one of those tax cuts that we enacted that they intend to let expire in 2010 and 2011, it is a total, I think, and my colleague from Georgia and my other colleagues that are here tonight will agree, almost $400 billion. And I think that is the largest tax increase on the people of this country in the history of this country. 
   So here, again, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for bringing out the truth once again, as he does so well in the Truth Squad's discussions. And I thank him for letting me weigh in a little bit tonight. And with that I will yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, the minimum wage has not increased in 9 years. Yet over the past decade, we have experienced vast economic growth, record low unemployment and, in the last 3 years, the creation of 7 million new jobs. Without a doubt, at 4.5 percent, our unemployment rate is so low that some employers seek out illegal foreign workers to fill the jobs that they say a lot of Americans won't take. 
   If we raise the minimum wage, businesses will have to find a way to offset added labor costs by one of two things, raising prices on goods and services or laying off workers. This is simple economics that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cannot seem to accept or understand. When prices go up, demands go down. In other words, as the minimum wage grows, so does the unemployment rate. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, unlike the debate in the Senate, H.R. 2 comes to the floor with no committee hearings, no committee votes, no opportunities for amendment. While our colleagues in the other body work on a compromise with President Bush,  Members of the House of Representatives are shut out of any constructive debate. 
   As a former member of the Rules Committee, I am extremely disappointed in the majority's failure to live up to its promises and allow an open and fair process on such a crucial issue.     
   For the benefit of the workforce, I ask my colleagues, vote against the minimum wage increase. Protect our small businesses. Let's sustain this economic growth.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much Dr. Price's giving me an opportunity to be here once again, once again, with a great team, the Truth Squad, and taking up where they left off in the 109th, Mr. McHenry and Ms. Foxx and others, led by Dr. PRICE. 
   And, of course, there are a couple of pretty darned important issues on the floor in this 100-hour rush to pass with no amendments, as you pointed out, Dr. Price, no opportunity to even present amendments to get rejected. And we are talking, of course, about the two bills, one tomorrow, and that is the stem cell issue, and then, on Friday, Medicare part D. I would be glad, happy, thankful for the opportunity to talk a little bit about part D and maybe later in the hour touch on just for a few minutes the issue of the stem cell bill that is coming up. 
   Medicare part D is working. You have heard that old expression ``If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it.'' I think that applies to this issue, my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, more than any I have seen in a long, long time. 
   Because I know the majority party particularly loves to look at polls, loves to look at numbers, and I don't blame them. I understand that, too. But this is an 80 percent issue of satisfaction, is it not? And we are talking in 1 year, our seniors, 38 million of them, 80 percent of them are very, very happy with Medicare part D. They have finally gotten it. 
   We delivered it, we the Republican majority at the time in November of 2003, and we gave them something that they have literally been waiting for not the entire 40 years of Medicare, but I would say certainly for the last 25 years, and that the previous and now new majority could not deliver on. 
   So I could understand their wanting to get on the bandwagon at this point and take credit for something. But I think, Mr. Speaker, that we are looking at a situation where they are about to gum up something that is working fine, and we need to let it continue to work. And I say that not just because it is an opinion that I hold as a physician or based on what people in my district, the 11th of Georgia, are telling me, but I base it on the fact that originally we predicted that the premium for Medicare part D would be about $37 a month. At that time, the Democratic minority both in the House and the Senate introduced amendments and/or legislation saying, let's fix the premium, the monthly premium, at $35 a month. Let's fix it. Well, if they had prevailed in doing that, Mr. Speaker, then today they would not be enjoying an average monthly premium of $24 a month. So let the market continue to work.

   Mr. GINGREY. If we start talking about the number of years we have been in practice, the folks back home and in the Chamber will figure out how old we are, so we better stay away from that. Suffice it to say, we have both been at it for a long time, you in the field of orthopedics and me as an OB-GYN. Again, I appreciate what you are doing with respect to the Truth Squad. 
   The gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) made some great points. First, anybody who suggests that this President is not for stem cell research just absolutely is ignoring the facts. The fact is, before 2001, when the President said we could start to use Federal dollars, your dollars, my dollars, our constituents' dollars, to fund stem cell research, indeed embryonic stem cell research on those existing lines that were indeed obtained from embryos from IVF clinics, because that destruction of life had already occurred and these stem cell lines existed, since that time in 2001, Mr. Speaker, we have spent I think the figure is $163 million on stem cell research. Representative Foxx mentioned that. We want that to continue. We want to be able to continue to fund that through the NIH. 
   But she also addresses the issue of truth in advertising. I know the majority party is thinking this is an issue that polls 80 percent. Sure, if you show a public service announcement with Michael J. Fox, unfortunately, with wild movements all over the screen or you show Christopher Reeve and he is on a respirator and is a quadriplegic, and you say to them: Would you, Mr. and Mrs. America, would you be in favor of embryonic stem cell research that could cure these diseases, you are going to get an answer 80 percent of the time, a resounding ``yes.'' 
   But on the other hand, if you held up two precious twin toddlers, as I have seen, who are part of the snowflake baby population that were adopted embryos, and said: Would you be in favor of destroying these embryos so these lives never existed in the hopes that we could help Michael J. Fox or Christopher Reeve or your mama or my grand mama, the answer would be a resounding ``no.'' That is where we get into this issue. 
   I want to remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that is why we want an opportunity, which we are not getting, to go to the Rules Committee with amendments. Maybe they would get rejected. Maybe we would have an opportunity to bring them up on the floor, and talk about alternative ways of getting these stem cells, adult stem cells or embryonic stem cells from this amniotic fluid study that just came forward, or to get embryonic stem cells by biopsying an embryo without 
   destroying it or even harming it, or taking one of these frozen embryos, thawing it out and you can tell microscopically that it has no chance of developing into a life, and taking those embryonic stem cells. That is all we are asking, Mr. Speaker. 
   I am very appreciative in the limited time that Dr. Price has left for allowing me to say a few words, and I want to turn the time back over to him for his concluding remarks.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5, COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill, H.R. 5, and we will have an opportunity later on in the day to discuss that thoroughly. But, mainly, at this point, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. You know, I heard my colleagues just say, the gentleman from Illinois and others, some of them new members of the Rules Committee, that in November the American people have spoken and they have asked for a break, a Federal break so that more students can go to college and get these low interest loans and Pell Grants. But I think what the American people said, my colleagues, in this last election, more than anything else, is don't trample on the rights of the minority. 
   And as a former member of the Rules Committee, my colleagues who are still on the Rules Committee, including the chairman, and Ms. Matsui, and others, we heard this repeatedly, Mr. Speaker. Don't trample on the rights of the minority. 
   I will say this. We did occasionally have closed rules that probably should have been open. But we always had a rule. And what this new majority has done in these first 100 hours is brought six pieces of legislation, four without any rules whatsoever. And now the very first piece of legislation, H.R. 5, it is a very important subject to try to help low income students afford a college education, there is a closed rule, immediately doing the things that you have railed against us about. 
   And I think this is what the American people basically said. They want you to guarantee the rights of the minority. You have heard from the ranking member of the Higher Education Subcommittee. You are going to hear from the ranking member of the overall Committee on Education and Labor in just a minute. 
   Essentially, Mr. Speaker, they speak for every Republican member of that committee, and they speak on this issue for every 202 Republican Members of this body who represent virtually half of this country. And you are taking their voice away. So this is really what this is all about. This is the time really to discuss the rule. 
   And, of course we can talk about the bill itself, as former Chairman DREIER did, and the fact that what you promised the American people in these fall elections is you were going to give them a $60 billion break on higher education, which all of a sudden you have reduced down to 10 percent of that, $6 billion, which virtually does nothing. 
   But as I say, Mr. Speaker, we will get into that discussion when we talk about the bill, when we finish discussing the rule. But I just want to say to my colleagues, all of whom, the former four Members, now the majority, and the new Members, that I respect, these are my friends, and we can talk about this, and we should. This is an opportunity to say to them, you said if you got the majority, which you now have and enjoy, and you worked hard and you deserve it, that you would not do the same things that you felt like we were doing to you, and I think in some instances you were correct. 
   So stand up, be men and women of your word, and do what you said you were going to do and not close this process down.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. Once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle bring legislation to the floor today that will do nothing to solve the problem they have outlined. 
   In this country, a college education is an accomplishment that all individuals should have the opportunity to pursue. I believe it is not only a noble, but also an essential endeavor for our government to pursue avenues to increase access to post-secondary education for any and all individuals interested. However, Madam Speaker, it needs to be said that this legislation does nothing to actually tackle that very real and crucial problem. 
   Right now our country is in need of leadership that will tackle the tough issues head on, not hide behind some quick sound bite solutions, rhetoric that does not translate to sound policy that actually combats the problem. 
   Madam Speaker, the problem really is the price tag of a college education. My colleague, the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee, has brought this fact to the forefront of this Congress over a number of years, and certainly as chairman of this committee in the 109th. This is the real problem, the sticker shock of these low-income families trying to pursue for their children a college education. And here we are offering them a little bit, a very little bit in small increments over a 5-year period, cutting the interest rate. 
   I want to remind my colleagues, Madam Speaker, of the old adage that you can absolutely go broke saving money. These kids cannot afford a college education because of the inflationary spiral of tuition and fees at our college campuses and universities, both public and private. 
   So this is the kind of issue that we need to address, not this window dressing of just lowering the interest rate. They don't really get that break until they get out of college, 6 months after graduation, at a time where that shouldn't really be a problem for them. But coming up with that $10,000 a semester to go to school is wherein the real problem lies, especially for these low-income families that would be eligible for the benefit, this $6 billion benefit, which, by the way, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, was actually a $60 billion promise in these recent elections last November. Ninety percent of the promise has automatically disappeared. 
   The point I want to make, Madam Speaker, is that this bill could be a lot better had we had the opportunity for it to go through the regular process, the Education and Labor Committee, so that both Democratic members of that committee and Republican members, the minority, would have an opportunity to offer amendments to make this much, much better, and to let the American people know that we can do a much better job than this. 
   So we can do a lot better than this, Madam Speaker, and I am going to oppose this bill. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look at this and give us the opportunity to recommit with instructions, so we can send this bill not back to committee, but to the committee under regular order and get a better product.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of delivering a knockout punch in Iraq, stabilizing Baghdad, securing freedom for the Iraqi people, and dealing a blow to terrorism across the Middle East. 
   There has been far too much politicking on this issue. Let me remind my colleagues that Iraq strategy is not about the legacy of Don Rumsfeld or General Abizaid or even President Bush. It is about 23 million Iraqi people. It is about the citizens of the United States of America. It is about the future of the Middle East, and it is about the 6 billion people on this planet who desire to live without the fear of radical terrorism. 
   We can achieve victory in Iraq. In the past we have underestimated the intensity of the death squads and the sectarian violence. Now we will confront them head on by ensuring we have enough coalition and Iraqi troops, not only to clear pockets of resistance, but to hold them. 
   Mr. Speaker, our President and combatant commanders are ready to deliver the knockout blow in Iraq. This is not the time for Congress to tie one hand behind their backs. We must be in this fight to win, and I support our drive to victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman's intentions with his amendment. But I do have some serious concerns, and I briefly want to outline them, Madam Chairman. 
   The protection of the names of WHINSEC students and staff is both a privacy and security issue, with broader implications for our international security cooperation. 
   Publicizing the names of WHINSEC students in their home countries, where in some cases there are active guerilla or narcotrafficking insurgencies could expose these students to threats to their personal safety and, indeed, to that of their families. This could include hostile attention from nations, organizations and individuals that may wish to do harm to the United States, its friends and its allies. 
   Such publication, Madam Chairman, could serve as a disincentive to foreign students who would otherwise want to attend WHINSEC, and it could discourage nations from sending their students to the institute. This would undercut the effectiveness of WHINSEC as a tool for building hemispheric security cooperation and communicating the democratic values and the respect for human rights that we champion. 
   A further concern I have is that cooperative training at WHINSEC does not just involve military personnel. We're also training police forces, of which more are from Colombia than any other nation. Many of these personnel are involved in counterdrug operations when they return to their country. It is incomprehensible that we would put their names out there, likely to be published on the Web sites of radical protest groups and put at risk not only their ability to participate in counternarcotic operations, but also their lives. Indeed, Madam Chairman, we would be putting a bull's-eye on their backs. 
   Madam Chairman, the gentleman noted that these names have been available upon request prior to 2005. That is true. 
   Well, Madam Chairman, the world has changed. You used to be able to drive freely around this Capitol prior to 9/11. You used to be able to get on an airplane without going through metal detectors. Obviously, you can't do that now. The security environment in the western hemisphere has also changed. 
   In his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Admiral Stavridis, the Commander of SOUTHCOM, testified, and I quote, ``Some trends in a few countries in SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility impede security cooperation, as their governments espouse vocal, anti-U.S. messages, and they undertake policies that portend a less stable and secure hemisphere.'' 
   For most of the period of time when names were released, as Mr. McGovern was mentioning, Venezuela's foreign policy toward the United States was much different than it is now. We now also know that China is engaging militarily on a daily basis with the nations in our own backyard.  
   Madam Chairman, those who seek to close WHINSEC will attempt to take advantage of this policy to create the appearance---- 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, they will take advantage of this policy to create the appearance of impropriety at the institute, and Venezuela and China will be the beneficiaries. Those concerned about human rights will then have to deal with these potentially hostile nations setting the human rights standard in Latin America. 
   As for transparency, Madam Chairman, you simply do not learn everything about any institution solely by looking at the names of those who have attended. If you followed that logic, one could contend that Harvard is an institution that trains brutal killers and human rights violators simply because the Unabomber once took a class there. 
   On the other hand, WHINSEC is open to visitors every working day. It invites people to sit in class, talk with the students, the faculty, review instructional material. This is perhaps the most open, transparent and welcoming organization in the Department of Defense. And it has certainly been the subject of more oversight than any other element of the Department. 
   Madam Chairman, unfortunately, I believe that the release of personal information has less to do with transparency and more to do with yet another effort to shut down WHINSEC. 
   On May 7, 2008, the Department of Defense provided to the Congress the names, country of origin, rank, courses, dates of attendance of students and instructors at WHINSEC for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 in accordance with the report language in the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations Act. This information was provided in a classified format. The Department of Defense deemed that sensitive personal information must be safeguarded to protect the privacy, security and dignity of individual students, instructors and families. The fiscal year 2008 information will be provided in a similar format no later than 60 days after the beginning of the next fiscal year, as directed. 
   There's a working system to provide information regarding WHINSEC students, instructors and courses. This information my friend is asking for with his amendment---- 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has again expired.

   Mr. GINGREY. This information that my friend is asking for in this amendment has therefore already been made available to Congress. He can walk over right now to the Rayburn Building and study the names to his heart's content. 
   So I am led to wonder, Madam Chairman, what is the McGovern amendment trying to accomplish? 
   I fear it will only give ammunition to radical groups who hope to ultimately shut down WHINSEC, which the Armed Services Committee and this Congress are opposed to doing.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, you have heard some serious, serious concerns with this amendment. But whatever the outcome today, we must remember what is at stake when it comes to WHINSEC. If we were not to engage with the participating nations, Madam Chairman, we would be abandoning our most effective means of developing relationships with the security forces of these countries. The void created would be filled by countries with poor records on democracy and human rights, such as Venezuela and China. 
   Madam Chairman, the friendships fostered at WHINSEC have enabled El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Honduras to provide well-trained forces to our endeavors in Iraq. Further, thanks to the counterdrugs civil military and medical assistance courses at WHINSEC, hemispheric military police and civilian organizations have also been capably providing counterdrugs and disaster-relief capabilities. 
   Madam Chairman, the success of current and foreseeable future conflicts will be highly influenced by the degree of international cooperation of allied and friendly countries. This requires engagement and building partnerships and relationships. And I certainly look forward to working with Chairman Skelton, Admiral Sestak, Mr. Bishop, my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Westmoreland, to ensure that we continue utilizing WHINSEC for this purpose. 
   Needless to say, Madam Chairman, since we already have a system in place where we're reviewing the names of students attending WHINSEC and because the institute is very transparent, I believe the amendment is unnecessary and could potentially do much more harm than good. 
   As for the brochures that the gentleman presented, I can assure him, and I'm sure he knows, that those pictures are only published with the permission of those students. So I don't think that is in any way indicative of what we're talking about here. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. It's a dangerous amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We just heard from the gentleman from Utah in regard to section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the Democratic Energy Act. 
   Section 526, as the gentleman described, puts handcuffs on our Federal Government, particularly the Department of Defense, in regard to the ability to get other sources of fuel. 380,000 barrels of refined products per year are used by the Department of Defense, mainly by the United States Air Force, Mr. Speaker. And the cost of that fuel from 2003 to 2007 has gone from $5 billion to $12 billion a year. It is anticipated that in this current year it will go up another $9 billion. This amendment that the gentleman was speaking of that I submitted to the Rules Committee last night offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn), and the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), making this a bipartisan amendment, and of course myself, to just simply strike that section 526 so we can allow the Federal Government, in particular the Department of Defense, to utilize things like coal liquefaction or shale products, tar sand, that can convert to energy and let us utilize that fuel and cut down this cost to our Department of Defense. 
   I mean, we needed an opportunity, clearly, Mr. Speaker, to be able to debate that amendment on this floor. I think that overwhelmingly the majority on a bipartisan basis would support striking that amendment. We are in a crisis, and everybody knows it, in what we are paying for. It is not just individuals, but of course the whole Department of Defense. And this goes to being able to purchase jet fuel. 
   That is why I am opposed to this rule. That amendment should indeed, Mr. Speaker, have been made in order.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in strong opposition to H.R. 4156, the so-called Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations of 2008, because in fact, Mr. Speaker, the bill should be called the Disorderly and Irresponsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act. 
   Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker. What we are debating tonight, disguised as a genuine bridge fund to sustain operations in the global war on terror, is nothing more than another defeatist measure intended to placate the Democrats' liberal base as we approach this Thanksgiving recess. 
   The Democratic leadership apparently has decided it's more to stand with the Out of Iraq Caucus, MoveOn.org and Code Pink than with our brave men and women in uniform. Rather than funding our soldiers' needs and delivering a decisive blow to the terrorist campaign in Iraq, the Democrats are again conditioning the funding on a date certain for withdrawal. 
   At a time of sustained progress by our forces, Mr. Speaker, it seems that what is great news for America and for our troops is consequently bad political news for a Democratic majority who has literally bet the farm on a defeatist agenda. 
   Just last weekend, Prime Minister Maliki stated that violence between Sunnis and Shias has nearly disappeared from Iraq, disappeared from Baghdad, with terrorist bombings down 77 percent. 
   The Washington Post reported that attacks against United States soldiers have fallen to levels not seen since the February 2006 bombing of the Shia shrine in Samarra. And an Investor's Business Daily article detailed that military analysts, including many who are opposed to the war, have concluded that the United States and its allies are on the verge of winning in Iraq. And, thankfully, United States casualties in Iraq are at their lowest level since March of 2006, Mr. Speaker. Now is not the time to risk impeding the progress we are making. Now is the time to continue building on the turnaround we have made, and to state unequivocally that we are on the verge of victory in Iraq and that we will finish the job. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot give in to the terrorists' extremist views and sinister plans for the Middle East and the world. And we certainly should not send a message to the terrorists that such a capitulation will begin in 30 days and will wrap up by December of 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on tying funds for our troops to a date certain withdrawal from Iraq. I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this dangerous bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2156, the so-called ``Orderly and Responsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations of 2008.'' Because, in fact, this bill is a ``disorderly and irresponsible Iraq Redeployment Appropriations Act.'' 
   Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. What we are debating today--disguised as a genuine bridge fund to sustain operations in the Global War on Terror--is nothing more than another defeatist measure intended to placate the Democrat's liberal base as we approach the Thanksgiving recess. 
   The Democratic leadership has decided it is more important to stand with the ``Out of Iraq Caucus,'' MoveOn.org and Code Pink than with our brave men and women in uniform. Rather than funding our soldiers' needs and delivering a decisive blow to the terrorist campaign in Iraq, the Democrats are again conditioning the funding on a date-certain withdrawal. 
   At a time of sustained progress by our forces, Mr. Speaker, it seems that what is great news for America and for our troops is consequently bad political news for the Democrat majority and their defeatist agenda. 
   Mr. Speaker, a July New York Times editorial authored by Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack stated ``We are finally getting somewhere in Iraq, at least in military terms....... The soldiers and marines told us they feel that they now have a superb commander in General David Petraeus; they are confident in his strategy, they see real results, and they feel now they have the numbers needed to make a real difference.'' 
   In September, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker spoke optimistically about the future of Iraq citing concrete progress. Acknowledging we still had a long way to go, they recognized we had achieved tactical momentum and were building momentum toward local reconciliation. Indeed, local Iraqis were turning against extremists. 
   Last weekend Prime Minister al-Maliki stated that violence between Sunnis and Shi'ites has nearly disappeared from Baghdad, with terrorist bombings down 77 percent. The Washington Post reported that attacks against U.S. soldiers have fallen to levels not seen since before the February 2006 bombing of a Shi'ite shrine in Samarra. An Investor's Business Daily article detailed that military analysts--including many who are opposed to the war--have concluded that the U.S. and its allies are on the verge of winning in Iraq.  
   And thankfully, U.S. casualties in Iraq are at their lowest level since March 2006. Now is not the time to risk impeding the progress we are making. Now is the time to continue building on the turn-around we have made and to state unequivocally that we are on the verge of victory in Iraq, and that we will finish the job. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues of the consequences of giving up on Iraq: the collapse of a democratic Iraqi government, likely leading to mass killings and genocide in the nation; an emboldened al-Qaeda; regional instability; Iran and Syria setting the course of Iraq's future; and Israel being pushed into the Mediterranean sea. 
   The stakes are too high for political posturing. Ayman al-Zawahiri has said ``the Jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals. The first stage: expel the Americans from Iraq.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot give in to their extremist views and sinister plans for the Middle East and the world. And we certainly should not send a message to the terrorists that such a capitulation will begin in 30 days and will wrap up by December of 2008. 
   Mr. Speaker, never have I been so glad that we've got General Petraeus leading our troops in Iraq and not the Democratic leadership of this house. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on tying funds for our troops to a date-certain withdrawal from Iraq. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, the former chairman of the Rules Committee, my colleague from California, and also congratulate the new chairman of the Rules Committee, our friend from New York (Ms. Slaughter). 
   I just want to point out to the gentleman from Massachusetts, the gentleman that just spoke, this ethics reform package, which we are not opposed to in the totality of it, but many, if not most of these provisions, Madam Speaker, were a part of H.R. 4975, the Republican ethics reform package which we passed in this House in May of this past year with only eight, count them, Madam Speaker, eight votes from the other side. There was total opposition to everything that we wanted to do in regard to ethics reform. 
   I will remind my colleagues in regard to the so-called K Street Project, that very provision, that is, Members not being able to put pressure on companies in regard to hiring practices, in regard to granting of any legislative favors, was part of that package. But yet our colleagues in the majority party now want to come forward and say ``the K Street Project.'' 
   Now, where is the sense of fairness and fair play and bipartisanship in sticking it in the eye of the new minority, when we tried to change that very thing that they voted against? 
   I would say furthermore in regard to this overall package of rules, what is this business about not holding a vote open for the sole purpose of changing a vote? If that is in fact a good policy, not being able to do that, and I tend to agree with the new majority that we shouldn't be able to break people's arms with favors for earmarks or special committee assignments which may not be appropriate, then why use the word ``sole?'' Putting in ``sole purpose'' would allow them or anybody to lock a Member in the bathroom and say we are holding the vote open because they are stuck in traffic. So I would suggest let's eliminate ``sole'' and say for the purpose of pressuring a Member to change their vote against their will. 
   Last and not least, and maybe the chairman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, can address this point of this unbelievable idea that members of the Rules Committee, the new members, maybe to protect the freshman members, are not allowed to have a roll call vote in the light of day.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I was surprised when reading title II of this resolution, as it looks conspicuously like the ethics package passed by the Republican majority last Congress; the ethics package that only eight Democrats voted to support. I suspect today more than eight Democrats will finally agree with the Republicans that meaningful ethics reform is a priority of the American people. 
   In fact, the most obvious change in the Democratic package is the overly partisan and adversarial tone, adding headlines like ``Ending the K Street Project'' to language that was included in the Republican legislation. And for what purpose other than a partisan poke in the minority's eye? 
   Democrats campaigned on the promise of a more open and inclusive government, assuring us of their bipartisan intentions. Well, today, on the first day of the 110th, that promise has  been broken. Indeed, it has been smashed. 
   Additionally, as the focus of title II is on fostering a spirit of civility, I find it particularly troubling that the Democrats have decided to allow only 10 minutes of debate, 5 minutes on each side, on title V of this resolution, which we will take up tomorrow. 
   During this brief 10 minutes of debate, we will dramatically change the way the Rules Committee does business and outline the process by which five bills, including stem cell research, the 9/11 Commission recommendation, and minimum wage legislation will be considered. That is not even 2 minutes per proposal. 
   So this is hardly, Mr. Speaker, the tone of civility my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are promising to foster in the 110th Congress. 
   The American people and the Members of this body expect more from the Democrats. Their false promises of bringing a new age of bipartisanship and transparency to the halls of this Congress have clearly not materialized, despite the insistence on this by my former colleague, Mr. McGovern, while a minority member of the Rules Committee who stated, on September 28, 2006, while discussing the Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act, and I quote, ``If my Republican friends want that trend of closed rules and no amendments, of no democracy in the House to continue, then, by all means, vote for this. Just go along to get along. But if you believe, as I do, that the monopoly on good ideas is not held by a few members of the leadership in a closed room, then vote ``no.'' Have the guts to vote ``no.'' End quote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know why the Democratic leadership is trying to limit debate on these liberal bills, but the American people deserve to have a voice in this process, the voice of their elected representatives. Today, it is clear we have been denied that voice.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague from Georgia (Dr. Price) for yielding, and I thank my friend from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the two co-authors of the minority bill of rights. I am a proud co-sponsor of that, and I am proud of their ethics in regard to that. 
   And also, Mr. Speaker, let it be known to our colleagues that this Official Truth Squad of the former freshman Members, now sophomore Members, this is not something they just dreamed up tonight. This is something that they have been doing for the entire 109th Congress and putting some sunshine out there on a lot of these issues and shining that light of day, and this is, of course, part of a continuing process. 
   Dr. Price and Mr. McHenry are exactly right; I was enjoying very much being on that select powerful, powerful Rules Committee, and had that opportunity to go home and tell the folks back home that I am a member of the powerful Rules Committee. And as a member, many times I had an opportunity to hear the minority, the current chairman, Ms. Slaughter, the vice chairman, Mr. McGovern, the senior members, Mr. Hastings and Ms. Matsui, talk about the process and talk about this idea, the appalling idea of a closed rule as Congressman Price points out, and what they are doing in this rules of the House package that they are sort of forcing upon us in asking us to vote on with much less than 24-hour notice. 
   Just listen to some of the quotes of the former four minority members of the Rules Committee who are now running the show and driving this package that contains not one significant piece of legislation, but five pieces of legislation, including the minimum wage bill, the stem cell research bill, which indeed is truly life and death issues, the 9/11 Commission Report, completing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. I mean, these are not naming of post offices, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues. We all know that and we know the significance. But listen to what my colleagues would say and did say many times in regard to one piece of legislation. 
   First of all, let me quote Ms. Slaughter: ``If we want to foster democracy in this body, we should take the time and thoughtfulness to debate all major legislation under an open rule, Mr. Speaker, not just appropriations bills which are already restricted. An open process should be the norm and not the exception.'' This is from the Congressional Record of June 14, 2005.     
   Listen to what my good friend, Mr. McGovern, had to say on September 28, 2006: ``If the Republican leadership does not agree with the bipartisan substitute, then they should defeat it on the House floor after a full and open debate. Instead, they cower behind procedural tricks, parliamentary sleight of hand and closed rules. No wonder the American people are disgusted with Congress. If my Republican friends want this trend of closed rules, of no amendments, of no democracy in the House to continue, then by all means vote for this rule. Just go along to get along. But if you believe, as I do, that the monopoly on good ideas is not held by a few members of the leadership in a closed room, then vote 'no.' Have the guts to vote `no.' '' 
   That was Representative Jim McGovern. 
   Listen to what our good friend, a senior member on the Rules Committee, Mr. Alcee Hastings, had to say on September 28, 2006: ``I have said it before: the way the majority runs the House is shameful. It is hypocritical, it is un-American, it is undemocratic, and it happens every single day that we have a closed rule, and in other circumstances as well.'' He goes on to say ``closed rules are an affront to our democracy. We should stop it now. My outrage and the outrage of all on this side is as much about process as it is about policy. Pure partisan politics never produces sound public policy.'' Congressional Record, July 12, 2005. 
   Finally, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Matsui: ``The American people want to hear practical, well-thought ideas from their elected representatives. Today we could have had that honest, engaged and realistic debate. These proposals and ideas deserve to come to the floor. They deserve to be debated, and they deserve a vote. Unfortunately, under the rule reported out, this will not happen. Instead, we will have a gripping session that yields no results. Congress is part of this government. In fulfillment of its responsibilities, this House should reject this rule and bring real policy to the floor.'' Congressional Record, June 15, 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could go on, but I think you get my drift. They are doing exactly what they railed against us about. The righteous indignation that we heard on a continuing basis in the Rules Committee, and here they come with the rules of the House, and they include in it five pieces of legislation with no rule whatsoever. What do we get? A motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding and giving me an opportunity to talk about that a little bit because at the beginning of my remarks, I talked about the powerful Rules Committee. And, Mr. Speaker, it is a powerful Rules Committee in that you decide how long you can talk on an issue. That is, you limit the time of debate. You have the power to make amendments in order to give a Member on either side of the aisle, majority or minority, an opportunity to come and talk about their amendment on the floor. They may get beat 434-1, but they have that opportunity. 
   As an all powerful member of the Rules Committee, as Representative Price was just saying, all of a sudden, in this rules package, they are saying that one of these all powerful members can make these votes, can set this time of debate, can deny the amendment opportunity for Members on either side of the aisle and then not take a public vote, not take a roll call vote, and not go home and face their constituents, these all powerful members of the Rules Committee, not answer to their constituents for why they denied maybe a Member of their own party a good idea to debate on the House floor, their body. 
   And I am going to tell you the rhetorical question Dr. Price asked, was why would this new majority do this? I can offer a suggestion. They now, of course, have nine members. The four that were in the minority are now the majority including the chairman of the Rules Committee and the vice chairman of the Rules Committee, but they also have an additional five seats, which they are filling with some of their newly elected freshmen Democrats who can go home in these marginal districts, these red Bush districts, if you will, and say that I am an all powerful member of the Rules Committee, re-elect me, but yet not have to answer for these difficult votes that they took probably in opposition to what their constituents would want them to do. 
   So I thank you for giving me the opportunity to explain the rhetorical question of why they might want to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only in strong opposition to this ``our way or the highway'' rule, but also to the underlying bill, which I believe encroaches on the constitutional principle of separation of power, particularly the President's authority as Commander in Chief. 
   Regretfully, this rule prevents every single Member of this body, both Democrats and Republicans, from offering an amendment to an emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act, a highly unprecedented attack on the democratic process. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the majority is insistent on a force pullout from Iraq, but the language in this supplemental puts this war and the soldiers' lives on autopilot. This legislation makes a flash-point decision about the war, about our men and women on the ground, with little regard to the actual facts 6 months, a year, and indeed 17 months from now. It looks like ``Magic 8-Ball'' foreign policy. 
   Last night, Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment to the Rules Committee. Unfortunately, it was not made in order, but it would have required this Congress to reevaluate the situation in Iraq at each of these timelines in the so-called Murtha language. So whatever the benchmarks, then we would have to come back and vote again, clean up or down vote, whether or not we want to bring the troops home. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is especially important at the drop-dead date of August of 2008, when this bill basically says no matter what, the troops come home, even if we have got the bad guys on the run. I think every Member of this body would want to support an amendment like this, so that we would once again be able to vote and reconsider, considering the situation on the ground. 
   So this legislation sets a dangerous precedent, and I respectfully ask my colleagues, oppose the rule, oppose the underlying bill. Let's work, both Republican and Democrat alike, let's produce a supplemental that will actually pass this House, pass the Senate and be signed by the President. Do right by our American soldiers, and our people and the people in Iraq.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recall the memory of three selfless and courageous Georgians, who tragically were killed in an accident last month while performing missionary work in rural Honduras. 
   Perry Goad and Ric Mason of Cartersville and Martha Fuller of Newnan were doing God's work on a church mission in the tiny village of Mal Pais. Together with a group of volunteers from several Georgia churches, they were working to set up running water, connect electricity, pave roads and improve life for the families living in Agalta Valley. It was during this effort that the group's truck rolled over on an undeveloped stretch of road, killing Perry, Ric and Martha. 
   Madam Speaker, these are three outstanding citizens who eagerly dedicated their time, their effort, their love and spirit to helping those in need. They were not content to simply sit in church and learn about the problems facing our world. They made an effort to go out and to fix these problems. And indeed, our community has truly lost three guiding lights. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in remembering the righteous lives of Perry Goad, Ric Mason and Martha Fuller and in offering prayers of healing to the other volunteers who were injured in the accident.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (CHARLIE W. NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for recognizing me, and I have a longer speech that I want to submit for the Record. I think my staff must have been looking over the ranking member's shoulder when they wrote it. He has already said those nice things about our good friend, Charlie Norwood. 
   I was touched, though, in the letter that he received and read, the phrases ``hogwash'' and an ``old country dentist.'' I was sitting here thinking, I can see Charlie saying those things on this floor. That is the way he was and that is the way we remember him. He wasn't an old country dentist, let me assure you. He was a prosperous dentist in Augusta, Georgia, a population of 130,000, the home of the Masters; but that was Charlie. 
   Let me join JOE BARTON, the ranking member, in thanking Chairman Dingell. I mentioned this bill to the chairman last week, and he looked at me and said, Doc, and he had a little mist of tear in his eye, he said, Don't worry about this; we are going to do this. And I knew then that the chairman and Representative Inslee and others were fully supportive of what Charlie was trying to do. 
   If he was thinking just of himself, Mr. Speaker, this bill probably would say the Living Lung Organ Donation Act, which also would be possible; but that wasn't Charlie. He was thinking about those 70,000 other people who are waiting for a kidney. 
   Charlie himself had to wait a long time to get that lung. Too long, we think. I don't know if it would have saved his life if he would have had an opportunity for a paired living lung donor, but he was thinking of others who were suffering, and as others have said, to bring a commonsense solution to problem solving in a bipartisan way. They described Charlie as a dog that has got ahold of a bone and won't let it go. Well, we can say to Charlie today, as part of our legacy to him, that he has succeeded. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's support this bill as a legacy and tribute to the great Member, Charlie Norwood  
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation honors a dear friend and former colleague in this body, the late Congressman Charlie Norwood. Charlie worked tirelessly as an advocate for patients across our Nation, and this bill is a fitting tribute to the tremendous impact he's made on healthcare in America. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this country, there are more than 74,000 men, women and children on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. Unfortunately, if the current trend of kidney transplants continues, only about half of these candidates will ever receive a life-saving transplant. Tragically, in 2004, nearly 4,000 listed patients died while awaiting a kidney. 
   One way for individuals to avoid the kidney transplant waiting list all together is to find a living donor, like a friend or family member who is willing to selflessly donate a kidney to save a loved one. The limitation on this compassion is that only compatible matches can donate kidneys; if your friends and family are not a match, they can't be your donor. 
   But those of us who knew Charlie know that he was an excellent problem solver, always turning challenges into opportunities. With the limited donor options individuals face within their community of family and friends, patient advocates and healthcare providers have pushed for living organ donors. Charlie was convinced of the unlimited potential that could be realized when the pool of living donors would be expanded beyond one's immediate family and friends. In fact, there have been success stories of hospitals doing just this--finding pairs of living kidney donors who aren't matches for their own loved ones, but are matches for someone else's loved one. 
   Unfortunately, due to conflicting interpretations of the National Organ Transplant Act, hospitals across the country are hesitant to make this type of procedure a rule--and this where the Charlie Norwood Living Kidney Organ Donation Act will create miracles. 
   H.R. 710 would clarify in statute that this type of paired living kidney donation would be allowed under Federal law. This will alleviate the concerns of hospitals and healthcare providers that want to give all kidney patients the hope that transplants represent but ambiguity in law currently prevents. 
   Mr. Speaker this is a win-win situation. More patients would benefit from a kidney transplant, thereby reducing the number of individuals on the waiting list. In turn, more Americans--both on the waiting list and off--will have that miraculous second chance at life. 
   Mr. Speaker, passing this legislation will be a lasting tribute to Charlie Norwood's selfless efforts to help those in need. While we all wish our friend's lung transplant had saved his life, we can honor him by giving Americans across our Nation greater access to the potential miracle of an organ donation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I attempted to offer an amendment to H.R. 3221, the New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act, to prevent possible waste and maintain appropriate management of our government expenses. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the Secretary of Energy to contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct a study for assessing management practices for research, development and demonstration programs at the Department. 
   My amendment would simply prohibit funds in the bill to the Advanced Research Projects Agency, or ARPA-E, within the Department of Energy, until the study has been completed and it makes a recommendation that we do establish ARPA-E. 
   However, the Rules Committee would not accommodate my amendment and refused to make it in order. Without this amendment, we are shooting in the dark. We are authorizing $300 million for fiscal year 2008 that may not be necessary. This is not a good way to manage the people's tax money. If the majority is going to gamble like this, we might as well put the whole Federal Treasury on green double zero and just hope for the best. 
   I have another concern, and that's about a new portfolio standard. The renewable portfolio standard in this bill calls for 20 percent renewable by the year 2020, and it will not include any nuclear. 
   Well, the Southern Company, in my district, provides about 12 to 15 percent of their power by nuclear, but, yet, that cannot be included as a renewable. So we are projecting a wind farm off the coast of Georgia bigger than Cape Wind in Massachusetts, and that would only produce 1 percent toward this renewable standard. It's almost an impossible standard to meet, if you do not let us include nuclear as a renewable source, which, surely, it is. Basically, the compliance penalty for not meeting this standard, for the Southern Company in my district, would be $745 million. 
   This legislation is nothing more than a backhanded attempt to ease our Nation into a carbon trade scheme, and it victimizes Georgia by making us a donor State.  
   I ask my colleagues to vote down this rule and vote against the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in recognition of all the hard work the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, and their staffs, have put in on behalf of our Nation on the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2008--and in gratitude for their work on behalf of the 11th District of Georgia. 
   And I would like to commend Chairman Murtha and Ranking Member Young for their efforts on behalf of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who are so bravely defending us at home and abroad. 
   Mr. Chairman, in its current form, this appears to be legislation that--although not perfect--does a fine job covering a wide range of priorities that are vitally important to our Armed Services. While regrettably cutting funding for both missile defense and future combat systems, the bill does appropriately include an across-the-board 3.5 percent pay raise and provisions addressing both Guard and Reserve readiness concerns. This bill also provides much-needed funds to grow the  Army--by 7,000 soldiers--and the Marine Corps--by 5,000 Marines. 
   Our House colleagues also did a good job providing funding for many important programs which are our military's top priorities. Chief among these, Mr. Chairman, is the F-22 Raptor. 
   I am particularly encouraged by the work the Appropriations Committee has done to fund F-22 procurement this year, as this aircraft is vital to our Nation's defense. This bill contains $3.153 billion for 20 F-22 Raptor aircraft as part of the multi-year procurement strategy of 60 F-22s over the next three years. This will go a long way toward providing stability for the program and ensuring that America maintains air dominance for the foreseeable future. 
   Further, Mr. Chairman, as we fight the global war on terror, the United States must without question continue to modernize and strengthen our ability to support our men and women in harm's way. Maintaining our Nation's airlift capabilities is critical to this mission, and I would like to applaud the Committee for their recognition of this by including funding for the modernization of the C-5 fleet, in line with the Air Force's program of record. 
   The Committee also responsibly recognizes the importance of developing life-saving innovations to benefit our war-fighters. Accordingly, $2.5 million dollars was included for the research and development of BioFoam Protein Hydrogel, which is manufactured in my district. BioFoam has the potential to save lives on the battlefield by using an expanding, adhesive, foam sealant to stop uncontrollable bleeding from internal wounds where tourniquets cannot be applied. Additionally, I am grateful that the Committee worked with me to provide funding for the Covert Waveform Program and for the development of Active/Smart Packaging for combat feeding. 
    Mr. Chairman, I would like to again thank my colleagues for their hard work on this bill.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona's yielding, and I appreciate the gentleman bringing up a point of order  against the rule. And to take away that opportunity to raise a point of order against the conference report, Madam Speaker, where there are air-dropped earmarks, in this case I think the gentleman said nine, I still remember the calls from the Democratic leadership, led, of course, by Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, when the Democrats won control of the House by virtue of the elections almost exactly a year ago, that this would be the most open, honest, and transparent Congress in history. 
   Madam Speaker, I just want to give you a quote from Speaker Pelosi promising fiscal restraint if Democrats win. And here's the quote: 
   ``Breaking with many Democrats, Ms. Pelosi also spoke out against earmarking billions of dollars for home-State projects, a practice she calls a `monster' that hurts Congress.'' And here is what she said: `` `I'd get rid of all of them. None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism the public has ..... and the fiscal irresponsibility of it.' '' And that was in the Wall Street Journal, July 13, 2006. 
   Another quote from Madam Speaker Pelosi: ``We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks and will give the American people the leadership they deserve,'' Nancy Pelosi, press release, December 12, 2006. 
   Madam Speaker, this is absurd. And, again, I commend the gentleman from Arizona for calling attention to this. Where is the openness? Where is the transparency? What good do we have in regard to a point of order so that we can look at these conference reports? Where are the 2 days that we are supposed to have to look at them? So it is taken away from us. What good does it do if the Rules Committee waives all points of order? 
   So I commend the gentleman. He's absolutely right. We need to have some true transparency in this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was on the floor earlier today railing against the rule on this conference report, and I voted against the rule. The reason I did that is because I thought the rule and the bill, in fact, were rushed to the floor and didn't follow regular order. I thought it was appropriate that I voted against the rule. 
   But I am here today to tell you that I am going to vote for this conference report. 
   As a member of the Science Committee, and as a conferee, I am very proud of the work that has come through the Science Committee. I commend Chairman Gordon. I have been enjoyed being on the Science Committee. This is my second term serving on the Science Committee, first with Chairman Boehlert and now with BART GORDON and serving with DAVID WU on the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee. I think we do great work on the Science Committee. 
   Now, I typically associate myself with the more conservative, fiscally conservative members of the Republican conference. I know that some of my colleagues are going to vote against this conference report because they are concerned with the level of authorized spending, and they are maybe going to be a little surprised that I am voting in favor of it. 
   My good friend back in Georgia, Joe McCutchen from Ellijay, Joe from Ellijay, I bet you Joe is watching right now cringing that I am going to vote for this bill that increases spending. It does authorize more spending than I am comfortable with, but I am very, very hopeful that when we get to the point of appropriating, I will be standing here asking, probably, for 1 or 2 percent cut in the amount of money that's appropriated, as I have done on most every spending bill that has been brought before the 110th Congress. 
   But I think this is one of those situations where it's better that we spend a little too much than not quite enough, because we are at war in this country on an economic level. We are in an economic war. 
   We are also in a shooting war, and we all know that. Every Member on both sides of aisle is committed to funding and supporting our troops, give them the equipment and what they need to win. 
   Well, this is the same situation, the analogy is we need to give our soldiers, in this economic war, the equipment that they need to win. These soldiers are our students, particularly at the K-12 level. That's why it is important that we support this conference report. 
   I hope my colleagues on this side of the aisle will understand that. I hope that I will not lose my brand as being a strong fiscal conservative. 
   Now, it was mentioned earlier that there are some score cards going around, and I will do pretty well on some of them, and I will do rather poorly on others. But we can't always worry about score cards. Like I say, in this situation, you got both sides kind of tugging at you one way or another. You have to, in the final analysis, do the right thing. 
   We have members on this committee, on both sides of the aisle, I think there are five Ph.D.s, Dr. BAIRD, Dr. EHLERS, Dr. BARTLETT, Dr. MCNERNEY, Professor LIPINSKI, Dr. Gingrey. I am not a Ph.D. I am as much a doctor of art as I am a scientist. This is some serious business, as has already been stated. It's important for us to understand that. 
   We can remain to our fiscal conservative principles, but in a situation like this, let's give our kids a chance to compete so we can win this global war, this economic war we are in. I am going to support this conference report. I encourage all my colleagues to do the same.

But I am very concerned with this conference report and the process, this lightning speed quickness that it has been brought to the floor of this House is absurd. 
   I want to ask what is the rush. As ranking member of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, I was very pleased to be picked as a conferee. I don't get that opportunity often in the 5 years that I have been a Member of this Congress. However, I was only made aware of the appointment Tuesday at 3:30 and, immediately, that the full conference committee would be holding the one and only formal meeting at 5 o'clock, an hour and a half later. 
   This is a 470-page document that was not even available to conferees until 4:30 yesterday. I can't speak for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but I don't want to go back home to Georgia next week and explain to my constituents that I spent, as Representative Hastings just said, $43 billion of their tax money on this measure that neither I nor most of the Members of this House on both sides of the aisle even had an opportunity to read, much less think about, before casting that vote. Further, I am extremely concerned with the cavalier attitude with which the majority appears bent on bringing this report to the floor today. 
   The rules require, and I noticed that earlier the chairman of the Rules Committee was on the floor. She knows the rules require that it shall not be in order to consider a conference report that has not been available to Members, Delegates and Resident Commissioner in the Congressional Record for at least 3 calendar days. This report was filed yesterday, yet here we are today preparing to vote on a negotiated deal that is incorrectly being labeled as bipartisan. It was bipartisan in the House. It's not bipartisan in this conference report. 
   It was only bipartisan to the extent we were invited to the party, but we were told to please just observe the dancing, and, by the way, don't eat any of the refreshments. 
   The House did not use proxy votes, and yet that rule was also waived yesterday for the purpose of the formal conference. 
   In addition, by a vote of 258-167, this House passed a motion to instruct conferees Tuesday to insist on the House authorization levels and to restore language on coal-to-liquids technology that had previously been accepted in this House by a vote of 264-154. Both instructions were ignored in conference. The coal-to-liquids technology provision was offered as an amendment in the conference yesterday and was voted down, despite the wishes of this whole House. 
   What's the point of having rules if we're not going to follow them, and what's the use of holding votes if we are not going to adhere to their outcome and insist on a conference committee report? It's extremely unfortunate that again this week we are faced with the regrettable fruits of the Democratic leadership's rush to adjourn. 
   My point is, this rush to get things done so you can go home and say that you accomplished this, and that's fine, but we've got to get it right and we have got to follow the rules. I mean, whether this side, we were in the majority, if we are guilty of doing the same thing on occasion, and maybe that was done on appropriations bills, but when you are dealing with something like this, and this is the policy in science education and trying to stimulate our young people and make this country more competitive in the global economy, we have got to get it right. 
   When we have a bill coming out of the House that very generously authorizes almost $23 billion, $24 billion, $25 billion, and all of a sudden it's $43 billion, I have some real concerns about that. So it's extremely unfortunate that we are rushing this through, and it is the American public who is being left with an ever-increasing bill for this attitude. 
   I asked my colleagues on the policy, or on the process. I am not talking about the issues that others have raised, but I am saying vote ``no'' to this rule and the underlying report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this modified closed rule on an appropriations bill. 
   I had two very substantial amendments. The gentlelady from Connecticut, the distinguished chairman, said that she was going to accept my message amendment, my 1 percent cut, the $50,000 amendment that I brought on Tuesday. Of course, it was a dilatory amendment to try to get an opportunity to speak about the CHIP legislation that we knew was coming under a closed rule. 
   But now I have two good amendments that were not made in order. One amendment would say no money in this bill would be allowed to grant food stamps or WIC money to anybody but United States citizens, not to immigrants, not to illegal immigrants. In some cases, the current law is very vague on that issue, a very substantive amendment that was not made in order. 
   Finally, one other amendment, the Farm Service Agency in my district, in Gordon County, Calhoun, Georgia. In fact, that Farm Service Agency serves several counties and is doing a great job. 
   I am denied the opportunity to argue on behalf of the citizens of Gordon County to keep that Farm Service Agency open. I am denied that by this modified closed rule. 
   Regretfully, I have to stand and say that I am going to vote ``no'' on this rule, urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENSURING MILITARY READINESS THROUGH STABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY DEPLOYMENT POLICY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to refer to my colleague from Georgia who just spoke. I reference article II, section 2, of the Constitution where it says the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and the Navy of the United States and of a militia of the several States. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this legislation. It's rather outrageously being hailed by the Democrats as a readiness measure. Unfortunately, I fear this becomes nothing more than another attempt by this majority to pander to their liberal base and capitalize on public opinion polls by once again, this time a little more subtlety, attempting to draw down the troops in Iraq. 
   This is because the readiness provision within this bill apply only to troops returning from Iraq. While a unit which just completed a 15-month tour in Iraq could not be deployed for 15 months, they could be deployed to combat in Afghanistan or, for that matter, Mr. Speaker, anywhere else in the world tomorrow without any regard for dwell time or readiness. 
   Inexplicably, while we're engaged in a worldwide campaign against terror, this majority is only concerned with the readiness of the troops deploying to Iraq. 
   Further, Mr. Speaker, by legislating the military deployment cycle, this bill would hamper the Department of Defense and bar the deployment of units that may be needed to reinforce our efforts in Iraq. Any constitutional scholar would tell you that these decisions, by their very nature, are the job of the Commander in Chief, not 435 would-be commanders in chief. 
   Now, to get around these unfortunate facts, my friends on the other side of the aisle included in their bill a Presidential waiver. During consideration of the bill in committee, the dangerous implications it could have on our ability to fight and win this global war on terror were often dismissed by the Democrats, my colleagues on the House Armed Services Committee, because of the presence of a waiver in the bill. 
   In reality, Mr. Speaker, not only will this bill make it more difficult to prosecute the global war on terror, the waiver adds another layer of bureaucracy that could potentially disrupt the deployment preparation cycle. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of this comes, unfortunately, during a time when we are just now starting to see marked progress and the momentum swinging in our favor in Iraq. Sadly, what is great news for America and for our troops is consequently bad news for the Democratic majority and this defeatist attitude. 
   Just this week, a New York Times editorial authored by Mike O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack reflected this progress. Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, these two men have steadily criticized the prosecution of the war and lack of progress in Iraq over the past 4 years. However, just this week they wrote, ``We are finally getting somewhere in Iraq, at least in military terms. Today, morale is high. The soldiers and the Marines told us they feel that they now have a superb commander in General David Petraeus; they are confident in his strategy, they see real results, they feel now they have the numbers needed to make a real difference.'' 
   And thankfully, U.S. casualties in Iraq are the lowest in 8 months. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know we are all passionate about this issue, and I care deeply about our troops and our Nation, and I know Mrs. Tauscher and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do as well. But now is not the time to risk impeding the progress that we are making. Now is the time to continue building on the turnaround we  have made in the Anbar Province and the improvement we are seeing in Baghdad. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (MEDICARE PART D PRESCRIPTION DRUG PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, this opportunity for the minority party during this hour is dedicated to the subject of what we are going to be dealing with tomorrow, H.R. 5, and that regards the Medicare Part D prescription drug, allowing or, in fact, requiring the Secretary to negotiate prices. And this is a hugely important issue. 
   But I want to take just a minute to respond to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that just spent their hour with the Out of Iraq Caucus. In fact, they asked me for permission for an additional 5 minutes because they had some very passionate Members that had not had an opportunity to speak. 
   I gladly granted them that opportunity. That is what makes this Congress great. That is what makes this country great, the willingness to listen to diverse opinions. 
   But I want to say, and I want to take just a few minutes before we get into the discussion of Medicare Part D, how diametrically opposed I am to what the Out of Iraq group just had to say during this last hour, and, indeed, Mr. Speaker, hour and 5 minutes. 
   I don't object to their right to have that opinion. I do certainly take exception, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, when folks stand up here, and I am not talking about new Members of this body. In fact, there was one new Member from Illinois, the gentleman from Illinois, who is going to be part of the Out of Iraq Caucus. I am talking about very senior, thoughtful Members. To stand up and suggest that the President lied to the American people, I think, is really not, in fact, even close to being the truth. 
   The President, I think, is an honest man. And last night, Mr. Speaker, in his presentation to the American people, I thought he did an excellent job of explaining why it is so important for us to try to apply, if not a knock out blow to the insurgence and the terrorism, the sectarian violence that is  going on in and around Baghdad, certainly, to strike a blow that would put them on the ropes, would get us off the ropes and put them on the ropes. And yet, we hear from the majority party wanting to tie the President's hands behind his back and our great military. 
   I think we have got a wonderful opportunity. Mistakes have been made. Absolutely. There is no question about that. I think the President acknowledged that last night in his 20-minute speech to the Nation. But we have an opportunity. 
   And this is really, I want my colleagues to think about this. This is not about the President's legacy. This is not about the legacy of Donald Rumsfeld, or General Abizaid or even our new Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, who we just heard from in a 3-hour hearing at the House Armed Services Committee, or our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Peter Pace, or General Petraeus. This is about 23 million Iraqi people. This is about the citizens of the United States of America. This is about the entire Middle East. In fact, this is about 6 billion people on this planet. And we have to, in my opinion, we have to support the plan. If we don't, even if our colleagues in the Out of Iraq Caucus absolutely abhor this President and would like to see his legacy be one of failure, surely, surely, they are with the American people. And I think they are. I think deep down within their heart, they are. 
   But I am absolutely convinced that they have not thought about the consequences of, all of a sudden, I mean, almost instantaneously pulling our troops out of Iraq, as they say. And I have heard many of them say that, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues. And the fact that, if that would happen, I think you would, indeed, have another Vietnam. You would, indeed, have a total bedlam and sectarian violence in the country of Iraq. You would have Syria and Iran taking over the Middle East. 
   And I just wonder how much longer the country of 7 million people in Israel would last. I mean, they have already pledged, Ahmadinejad and others, to drive them into the sea. And what respect, Mr. Speaker, would the world have for the United States of America if we, indeed, cut and run? 
   I am not suggesting that that is what they are saying. But I think that is a perception that the rest of the world would have. You cannot depend on the United States. And those terrorists would be back after us again. 
   We haven't had another 9/11 or any kind of a terrorist attack on this soil in 5 1/2 years. But if we follow the recommendation of the Out of Iraq Caucus in this Congress, that is exactly what will happen. It will be far worse than 3,000 lost lives, of innocent people. 
   Certainly, the gentleman from Illinois, the new Member, I have great respect for all of the new Members, Mr. Speaker. And he talked about Martin Luther King, a 
   man of peace. We need people, like Martin Luther King, that pray for world peace. I pray for world peace every day, and I know all of my colleagues do. 
   But we also need fighting men and women. We need a strong military when we get attacked, an unprovoked attack, when those prayers are not working so that we can defend this Nation. 
   So I am glad to give them an extra 5 minutes so it gives me an opportunity to refute most of what was said here in the last hour. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will turn to the subject of the hour, and that, of course, is what is going to be on this floor tomorrow as part of the new Democratic majority's 100 hours. This will be H.R. 4. 
   We have had three bills this week. We have had the so-called 9/11, completion of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We had the minimum wage bill and then today of course the stem cell research issue. 
   And tomorrow what the Democratic majority wants to do is require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prescription drug prices. Government price control; put the government in the medicine cabinet of 42 million seniors and disabled folks who are part of the Medicare program and prescription drug Part D. And they want to do that, just as they have done with these other three bills this week, with absolutely no opportunity, no opportunity for the minority party or even members of the majority, maybe the rank and file, as many of us refer to ourselves, to bring amendments, to have an opportunity to go before the Rules Committee and say, you know, I think we can improve on this bill a little bit. There are certain things I have been thinking about it. I am a doctor. I am a nurse. I am a health care worker, and I think we can make this a little bit better. 
   But, no. No, no. This new Democratic majority that railed for the last 2 years almost every day that their rights were being trampled upon and their amendments were not made in order, and here we are with four bills this week. 
   We are not talking, Mr. Speaker, about naming Post Offices here. We are talking about hugely important pieces of legislation, legislation that is controversial. This issue today on stem cell research, and we are talking about the destruction of what I feel, as a strong pro-life physician, is a little human life. And the proof of the pudding of course is the snowflake babies, literally thousands of them. And to suggest that those little embryos are just extra and throwaway, and we don't need them, and why waste them? We didn't get an opportunity to offer a single amendment. And this same thing in regard to this Medicare Part D issue which will be debated on the floor tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, if there is ever an issue of the old adage, ``If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it,'' it is this one, because this law that was passed in November of 2003 went into effect January 1 of 2005, the bill, the benefit, the optional benefit of prescription drugs under Medicare has only been in place for 1 year. And the success is unbelievable. I mean, it is far beyond anybody's expectations. It has an 80 percent approval when you poll seniors because they are getting their prescriptions, those who are having to pay for them, are getting them at a much lower price. The average savings is $1,100 a year for those who are paying their monthly premium and their deductible and their copay. And for those who, because of their low-income status, are virtually paying nothing but a dollar or maybe $3 to $5 for a brand name drug, if that is covered by the supplement because of low income, then they are saving at least $2,400 a year. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, to try to improve upon something that is working so well, I think, is a grave mistake. And I think, as the expression goes, they are going to gum up the works. 
   Now, let me tell you how setting price controls works and how poorly it works for that matter. When we were debating this bill in 2003 in the committee on the House side, a Democratic Member, I think it was Representative Strickland, now Governor of Ohio, a very good Member of this body, suggested, had an amendment and said look, let's set the monthly premium at $35. Let's require that the monthly premium be $35, I guess, over concern that it could be higher than that.     
   Let us set it at $35. The same bill was introduced on the Senate side, and I am not sure which Senator, which Democratic Senator, introduced the bill on the Senate side. 
   But, again, to set that premium. Well, had we done that, then our seniors today would not be enjoying an average monthly premium of $24 a month, $24 a month, because the market, the competition between the multitude of prescription drug plans that are out there competing for business allowed that to happen as they brought down the price of drugs as they compete with one another. 
   I will give you another example in regard to the Medicaid program. You know, the States each have their own Medicaid program, and they can cover prescription drugs if they want to. They don't have to. Most do, and they set prices. The State governments do that to try to save money. They set prices. 
   Well, people who are eligible for both Medicaid, because of their low income, and Medicare, because of their age or disability, now these dual eligibles, the prescription drugs are paid for by the Medicare part D program as the first payer. Well, our community pharmacists are so upset because they were getting a higher price for prescription drugs under the Medicaid program than they are under this new Medicare part  D program which has forced those prices down. Obviously, the neighborhood druggists, the community pharmacists are making less money, and they are upset. I can understand that. 
   But this just goes to show you once again, when the government sets the price, it is just as likely, if not more likely, that they set the price too high. The bureaucrats are notorious for that. The marketplace would never let that happen because of competition. 
   This opportunity to talk about this subject tonight is a very, very important issue at an important time. We will talk about it on the floor tomorrow and try to proffer these same arguments against requiring the Secretary of HHS to set prices. It is the first step down the road toward a national health insurance program, a single-payer program, or, if you like, Hillary Care. I don't think the country liked Hillary Care when it was offered back in 1994, and President Clinton paid a price for that, a dear price. 
   It is just really surprising to me that the Democratic majority would come back with this type of issue. 
   I think what is driving it is the success of this program is so resounding, and they, my good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that resisted this program every step of the way, fought it every step of the way, now I think they kind of want to get on the bandwagon and get a little credit for something. 
   But I warn them, I warn them, what I frequently hear them and others say, when you are in a ditch, when you are deep in a hole, the first thing you need to do is stop digging. I think they are digging themselves a bigger hole. And, politically, that is good for us. That is good for the Republican minority. That will help us regain the majority. But it is not good for the American people. It is not good for our needy seniors, and that is why I am so opposed to it. 
   I am very happy to have with me tonight a couple of my Republican colleagues, great Members, not just Republican Members that don't have special knowledge on this issue, but I am talking about a couple of our physician Members. 
   At this time I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), a fellow OB/GYN physician.

   At this point, I want to turn the program over to my colleague from Georgia. Not only do we represent part of the same county, but we are both physician Members, and Dr. PRICE is an outstanding orthopedic surgeon, an outstanding Member of this Congress. In fact, I was at a very important press conference earlier this afternoon on 
   this issue, and I heard Dr. Price, he may want to say it again; I don't mean to preempt him. But I heard Dr. Price say this looks like a solution in desperate search of a problem. And that kind of goes along with what I said earlier: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And if the Democrats find themselves in a hole, they need to stop digging. So with that, I will turn it over to Dr. PRICE.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Price and Dr. Boustany for their very informative contribution to this hour. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the few minutes that we have remaining and as we move toward wrapping up this hour, I want to just read a couple of quotes to my colleagues from former President Bill Clinton, who remains their rock star and who certainly tried to do some things on health care, unfortunately for him, unsuccessfully. But will listen to what President Clinton said in 1999 on his idea of a Medicare modernization proposal, which, as I 
   say, was not passed: ``Under this proposal Medicare would not set prices for drugs. Prices would be determined through negotiations between the private benefit administrators and the drug manufacturers. Thus, the proposal differs from the Medicaid program in that a rebate would not be required and from the Veterans' Administration program in that no fee schedule for drugs will be developed. Instead, the competitive bidding process would be used to yield the best possible drug prices and coverage, just as it is used by large private employers and the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan today.'' That was July 5, 1999. 
   And the then Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, Secretary Shalala, on this same Clinton proposal said: ``Private pharmacy benefit management firms will administer prescription drug coverage for beneficiaries in original fee-for-service Medicare. These firms will bid competitively for regional contracts to provide the service. They, not the government, will continue to negotiate discounted rates with drug manufacturers, and beneficiaries will receive these discounted rates even after they exhaust the Medicare benefit coverage.'' 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, again, I said at the outset of the hour, why are the Democrats doing this? I know that when this bill was first passed, like anything, there was concern. Well, you know, is this going to work? Is it going to be successful? And, of course, they all opposed it. I think there were just maybe a handful of Democrats that ultimately voted for Medicare modernization, the prescription drug act of 2003. And they were asking their constituents and seniors to tear up their AARP card. Some of them symbolically did that from the lectern here in this Chamber. They were just outraged that a senior organization could support a Republican proposal, which, of course, they did. And when it passed and then over the last year of the program, it has been so successful that  they want to get in on it, even though that was such a bad idea, as Bill Clinton and as the Congressional Budget Office have said, in response to Dr. Frist's request back in 2004, that allowing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate prices would not save any money. The program is working so well. 
   Every one of these bills that have been brought up this week under this special rule of no rule, no opportunity to meet in the Rules Committee and no amendments, all these issues, minimum wage and completing the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and stem cell expansion, poll really high. Yet this particular issue is just the reverse of the information they have got. It is an 80 percent positive issue for us. So I can only presume that they still want a little skin in the game. They want to get on the bandwagon. 
   Well, I am going to tell you, what is going to happen is our seniors are going to get skinned because they are about to ruin a good program. A program that is working well, that 80 percent of our seniors are in favor of. It has brought down prices of prescription drugs. It has come in now at $22 a month average monthly premium and this is great satisfaction. And they want to try to improve on that by letting the government negotiate prices. It is going to be a disaster for them. And I hope some of their Members, if they are smart, from these districts that they won from our Members in these elections in November, in these marginal districts, they had better talk to their folks back home before they follow the lead of their leadership and vote for this atrocious piece of legislation. 
   I railed at the outset, Mr. Speaker, about the fact that the new minority has been given no opportunity for amendments on any of these first four bills that are brought up during their 100 hours, and I do think it is an atrocity. But they may be doing us a favor inadvertently by not allowing us to amend this piece of legislation, which can't be amended. It needs to be killed. We need to kill this sucker dead. And I think every Member on our side of the aisle will vote against it, and the smart ones on their side of the aisle will vote against it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3, but definitely not in opposition to stem cell research; indeed, not in opposition to embryonic stem cell research. That is the position, my colleagues, of this President and most of the Republicans in this House. It is not an issue of being opposed to research on embryonic stem cells, but it is in opposition to research that results in the destruction of human life. 
   Certainly if you ask the American public when they look at this picture on television if they would be in favor of embryonic stem cell research, if you could help this man, or, even more compelling, our colleagues in this body, Lane Evans and James Langevin, the answer would be a resounding, yes, 80 percent. I think maybe I would be one of those who would be inclined to so vote. 
   But on the other hand, Mr. Speaker, if you held up this picture, snowflake babies, and asked them, would you be willing to support embryonic stem cell research if it meant the destruction of these lives, or not giving these lives an opportunity to ever develop, I think the answer, with the statistics, would be completely reversed. 
   Now, the Members in this body, some are strongly pro-life, some are mostly pro-life, some are slightly pro-life and some are pro-choice, whether we are Republicans or Democrats. But I think most of us would say we are pretty much opposed to abortion, and we wish there would be no need for abortions. 
   Well, we have an opportunity with H.R. 322, the Bartlett bill, of which I am a very proud original cosponsor, to do it another way, to do research, indeed, to obtain embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo, either through a biopsy or through using embryos that have no chance to live. We can get viable embryonic stem cells. 
   The point is, we don't have to divide this body and this Nation. We have lots of things that we can argue about legitimately in a friendly atmosphere, and that is the way it should be in this body. 
   We have gotten Members, a Republican and a Democrat, Mr. Castle and Ms. DeGette, who are very popular Members, very persuasive, but are very committed to this issue. We have a better choice. Now with this research from Wake Forest utilizing amniotic cells and the provisions within the Bartlett bill, H.R. 322, let us give that a chance. Let us give life a chance.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. I do so not because  I oppose embryonic stem cell research but because as an OB/GYN physician I oppose federally funded embryonic stem cell research that destroys life. And the truth of the matter is, Mr. Speaker, I am not alone in this belief; in fact I am joined by nearly half of the American public. 
   Let me say that again, nearly half of the American public opposes using taxpayer dollars to fund embryonic stem cell research when a human embryo is destroyed in the process. 
   I know that the supporters of this bill claim that an overwhelming majority of Americans whole-heartedly endorse their bill. However, when individuals in our society are asked specifically whether or not they would like the Federal Government to fund research that destroys a human embryo, the survey results are absolutely divided. 
   And that Mr. Speaker is what we are actually debating on the floor of the House today. We are debating the question of whether or not the American taxpayer should pay for research that encourages the destruction of human embryos. 
   We are not debating whether or not embryonic stem cell research is legal in this country, because, of course, it is not only completely legal but also well funded in both the private and public sector. In fact, between state governments and the private sector there is nearly $4 billion committed to embryonic stem cell research over the next 10 years. 
   I also want to dispel the myth that the Federal Government currently does not fund human embryonic stem cell research. In actuality, by the end of 2007, the Federal Government will have spent over $160 million. When President Bush signed the Executive Order in 2001, he made possible the federal funding of embryonic stem research. His executive order merely limited federal funds to support research which utilized already established stem cell lines. This decision removed any backdoor federal incentive and separated the United States government from the business of encouraging the destruction of human embryos. 
   Mr. Speaker, another policy issue we are unfortunately not debating today, is the use of federal funds to research alternative and ethical ways to extract embryonic-like or pluripotent stem cells. The fact of the matter is the hope held dearly by many individuals of this country with respect to embryonic stem cell research is not grounded solely in the fact that these cells are embryonic. Rather, researchers are interested in embryonic stem cells because they are flexible, that is they can specialize into any type of human tissue. This characteristic is also true of pluripotent stem cells, and the good news is that pluripotent stem cells can be obtained in a variety of ethical and scientifically promising ways. 
   Mr. Speaker, this point cannot be illustrated anymore clearly than in the study made public this weekend by researchers at Wake Forest and Harvard. This study shows not only the capability of researchers to obtain pluripotent stem cells from amniotic fluid but that these stem cells grow fast and show great flexibility. 
   This new, cutting edge research has great relevance in the debate we are engaged in today. The fact of the matter is that this study is yet another reminder that science moves faster than the Federal Government. We no longer need to engage in a passionate debate that divides our country in half. We no longer need to contemplate a unilateral decision to spend taxpayer dollars on research methods that nearly 50 percent of the public oppose. 
   No, Mr. Speaker, let us instead bring to the floor legislation that unites this country and does not divide. Let us examine and debate the multitude of alternative and ethical methods of obtaining pluripotent stem cells, methods similar to the research recently published regarding amniotic stem cells. 
   Representative Bartlett and I have introduced such a piece of legislation, it is bill H.R. 322. Today, on the hallowed floor of the House of Representatives, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with us and half of the American public, in supporting a bill that promotes lifesaving medical research that does not sacrifice life in the process.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE SCOURGE OF ABORTION IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for putting together this special order hour this evening. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have been a Member of this body now for 4 1/2 years, this being my third term. And as I stand here tonight in front of my colleagues, I want to say emphatically that this is my finest hour as a Member of this great body, this United States House of Representatives that I have been a part of with 434 of my colleagues. 
   We have disappointments. We have good days, we have bad days. But this is a good day, and this is a good day. And this is a day that the Lord has made. And that is why it is a good day.  I sincerely believe, Mr. Speaker, that God's hand is in everything we do, every deliberation, every bill, everything that seems so important to us, every victory, every defeat. Indeed, I even think maybe God's hand was in the Republican majority, my party, losing that opportunity possibly as a wake-up call. But I want to thank God this evening for Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, Justice Alito and Chief Justice Roberts. 
   It has taken a long time, Mr. Speaker. Back in 1992, when this abhorrent procedure was first described, and then finally I think it was in early 1995 maybe when the Member of this body from Florida, Representative Kennedy, first introduced this bill to ban this procedure. And that bill to ban this abortion procedure, not to ban abortion, but to ban this type of abortion, which really is not an abortion; it is literally infanticide. It is killing of an infant. And it passed this body, and it passed this other body, only to be vetoed twice by the then President of the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, today I thank God for Representative Steve Chabot from Ohio, who brought this bill once again to this body in 2003, my first year, my freshman year. And I was so proud to vote for Representative Chabot's bill. And I thank God for former Senator Rick Santorum from the great State of Pennsylvania. Wherever he is tonight, I want to say, Rick, you lost your race, but you didn't lose the battle. And we thank God for your efforts then, because it has come to fruition now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to maybe make sure that my colleagues remember as they listen to my remarks tonight that I spent 26 years practicing obstetrics and gynecology. And in that great specialty, which I am so proud to be a part of that group, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, I had an opportunity to deliver 5,200 babies by my estimate over a 26-year period of time. They weren't all perfect. Some were born with birth defects. Some had spina bifida. And I have great friends in my hometown of Marietta, Georgia, in Cobb County, great, great parents like Brad and Kim Barfield, who have a beautiful little girl today who is suffering from spina bifida. They knew at 20 weeks that their little girl had that condition, but they didn't elect to terminate that pregnancy by a partial-birth abortion. And many others know ahead of time that they are going to have a child with Down's Syndrome, but they know that that is a gift from God that makes their lives better and the lives of their other children, the siblings. And I thank God for them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues to understand how this procedure of partial-birth abortion came about, because I remember. I remember when I was a resident in this specialty at the Medical College of Georgia back in 1974, 1975, shortly after Roe v. Wade was passed within a year.     
   There was a physician at a major medical center in the northeast, I do not remember the hospital, I do not remember the doctor's name, but it was at a teaching center. Back then, if a woman did not have an abortion at 12 to 14 weeks of pregnancy, the first trimester, and in fact, 90 percent of the million annual abortions that are performed in this country are done in the first trimester by a fairly simple procedure called a D&C, but if the pregnancy went beyond and it got to the second trimester and approaching the third trimester, and we are talking now about a 22, 24-week pregnancy when a baby weighs two-and-a-half pounds, the way the abortion procedure was done then back in 1975, and this was perfectly legal under Roe v. Wade, all it required is a licensed physician performed the procedure in a licensed medical facility with the consent of two other physicians. 
   This is the way the procedure was done. A strong salt, we say saline in the medical parlance, but a salt solution was injected into the mother's womb through the abdomen, and that salt solution, most of the time, killed the baby, killed this baby at 24, 26 weeks, maybe even 3 pounds, certainly capable of not only a live birth but a great life without disability. But as long as the baby was killed, and then the mother was put into labor and delivered a dead baby, that was perfectly legal. 
   Unfortunately for this doctor back in 1975, he injected the saline and it did not kill the baby. So the next day he injected saline again, and it still did not kill the baby. So he took the mother to the operating room and performed an operation that he called a hysterotomy, that is, an opening of the uterus which really is an early, very early cesarean section. But instead of delivering that live baby, he reached his hand inside the incision and grabbed the umbilical cord and held it until that baby's heart stopped beating. 
   There just happened to be a nurse in attendance in that operating room that said this esteemed doctor killed that baby, and there was a court decision, a lot of brouhaha, and in the final analysis, the doctor was acquitted. 
   But from that day forward, that is when partial birth abortions, Mr. Speaker, started because nobody wanted to be in a situation, no doctor, of trying to abort a baby and inadvertently, deliberately and knowing then that they could not kill the baby because it was outside the mother's womb. 
   So they devised this procedure of partially delivering the baby. If the baby is head first, put the patient into labor, dilate the cervix, and when that head comes out, crush the skull, or if it is a breach presentation, dilate the cervix, put the patient in labor, and when the baby is delivered to the naval, then go up inside and crush the skull and then deliver and then the baby is dead, and it is perfectly legal. 
   That is what this is all about, and we are talking about maybe 2,000, 2,500 procedures a year out of the million legal abortions that are performed, mostly in the first trimester. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is unbelievable when I read quotes, and this happens to be a quote from a member of the other body and certainly I would not name names here tonight but this is a quote: As a result of today's ruling, the health of women who have dangerous pregnancies is now in deep jeopardy. Women who are in need of this banned procedure will be denied it, even if they risk losing their fertility, becoming paralyzed or sustaining organ damage. 
   Mr. Speaker, the risk of any of the those things is greater, much greater if they have this procedure done. Our judiciary committee in this House and in the other body have had multiple hearings from physicians across this country that say this procedure does not need to be done to protect the health of the mother, unless you call the health of the mother anxiety over not wanting that baby. There is still an exception that this abhorrent procedure could be done to protect the life of the mother. 
   Mr. Speaker, I did not mean to take quite this much time, and I know my colleague needs time to conclude, and I thank God for him, too. I thank God for each and every Member that has spoken here tonight, and I will remember them for the rest of my life. I will remember each one of these Members who have spoken and applauded and, yes, smiled on this great day because to me and to them this transcends any other disappointments and frustrations and aggravations that we may have had on both sides of the aisle in maybe not getting our way on a particular piece of legislation here and there. Nothing is more important than this. 
   I want to say as I conclude, I want to say to my 9-year old identical, twin granddaughters, Allie and Hannah, who were born at 26 weeks, each weighing 1 pound 12 ounces, thank God for your mom and dad, my daughter and son-in-law, Gannon and Hank Manning, that they did not make a decision that they did not want you, even though you were so fragile. God reached down and lifted you up and now you are the beautiful love of our lives, your grandparents, Mommy and Grand Doc, and so proud as you make progress now in the second grade. 
   I say to my grandson Hank and my brand new grandson Sabine, just 2 weeks old, your brothers, and to my two other grandchildren, of Phyllis and Jerry Collins, little Grey, two-and-a-half years old; and little Marion, 8 months old, Grand Doc is proud of you, and I know that you are proud of Grand Doc. You are proud that he stood here tonight in defense of the sanctity of life, and I know that God's hand is in all of that. 
   I just say, as I conclude, I am blessed. We are all blessed. We are all blessed to  have this opportunity in a historic moment. No, it does not ban abortion, and most of us hope eventually that there will be no need for that and that the sanctity of life, at the earliest and at the last moments, will be honored and respected. 
   Again, I just want to thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Franks). I am proud to be his classmate. I am proud to be a colleague, and I thank him for giving me the opportunity to talk to my colleagues tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1361, RELIEF FOR ENTREPRENEURS: COORDINATION OF OBJECTIVES AND VALUES FOR EFFECTIVE RECOVERY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I can certainly understand my former colleagues on the Rules Committee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Castor) being in favor of this rule and this underlying bill. 
   But I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong opposition to the underlying legislation, H.R. 1361, the RECOVER Act. This legislation is bad fiscal policy. It increases the cost to America's taxpayers of providing disaster assistance, while increasing the probability that the Federal Government will lose money to default losses. 
   It was Huey Long, the long-time Governor and Senator from Louisiana, the gulf coast, the Kingfish, as he was known, who said, ``I can frighten or buy 99 out of every 100 men.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not suggesting that my Democratic colleagues are trying to buy votes with this bill. But I do know that we need to closely examine the money our government spends to ensure that it is spent responsibly. 
   We have worked hard to fund the redevelopment of the gulf coast, committing more than $110 billion of Federal resources. That includes $4.7 billion to FEMA to remove debris and repair and rebuild public infrastructure and buildings; $17 billion from HUD for Community Development Block Grants, the largest housing recovery program in United States history; $6 billion for the Corps of Engineers to rebuild and restore levees so that we can rebuild below sea level; $16.1 billion paid out in national flood insurance claims, $1 billion for Health and Human Services to cover all of Louisiana's health care costs. And the list, Mr. Speaker, goes on and on. 
   There are right ways and wrong ways to fund redevelopment. This Congress has delivered $14 billion in incentives to spur private business investment and economic development to create jobs, another $600 million in Gulf Opportunity Zone tax credits to the region, with an additional $400 million expected to be awarded this fall to encourage more business investment. But today we are debating a bill which would harm small business across the Nation by giving away money that will never, and I repeat, that will never get repaid. 
   Mr. Speaker, provisions in title II of this bill would allow gulf businesses whose application for a disaster loan has been denied, to then receive $100,000 in grant money. And if a business has already received a loan, this bill will make sure that same business can also get a grant, and in the process, they will make certain that the grant money is not used to repay the loan. 
   So, yes, Mr. Speaker, you heard right. If the SBA decides your business is not viable enough for a loan, Congress is going to come in and just give you the money. What is more, now you can get paid twice for the same disaster. 
   Mr. Speaker, the sad fact is, this bill will hurt small businesses across the country. When the SBA makes a loan and that loan is repaid, the SBA loans that money to another business, and the cycle repeats itself. But by removing the repayment part of this cycle and requiring the SBA to send a $100,000 grant to those businesses who do not qualify for a disaster loan in the first place, we are diluting the resources of the SBA and hindering its ability to extend loans to businesses in other parts of the country, businesses fully capable of repaying them. 
   Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues are ignoring any semblance of restraint by treating our Treasury as a bottomless pit. In raising the risk of unrecoverable default losses, by giving away free money, it would certainly seem they are doing their level best to prove Huey Long's words to be true. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote against the rule and vote against the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE FINANCIAL CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding. The gentlewoman from North Carolina is such a strong voice on energy policy that we think this country ought to be pursuing. 
   I didn't hear the first few minutes of the hour, Mr. Speaker, but clearly we on this side of the aisle were most disappointed last week. We, as you know, spent a lot of time during the August recess, I think 134 of us, some several days, some one or two days, but came back from our break, if you will, to try to address the people who were here during August visiting the Nation's Capitol, the people's House. It was a most enjoyable time. 
   We talked to the American people. They came down and sat in these chairs that we occupy. They got to see where we voted. They weren't just up in the gallery. Because we were Members and we were not in session, we were permitted to bring, to escort people into the Chamber. And on many days the Chamber was almost full. It was almost like a day of voting on an important issue for us. I think they enjoyed it. Many of these people were Republicans, many were Democrats, some  probably Independents. We weren't overly political. We just tried to make the point that to solve this problem, we really do need a comprehensive approach. 
   Some may, and I have heard some on the Democrat side of the aisle say that we are Johnny one note. All we can talk about is drill, drill, drill. Drill, baby, drill. Drill here, drill now, and low prices. While that has been the cornerstone of the American Energy Act, the All-of-the-Above Act, it certainly isn't the only thing in that act. There are so many provisions, not the least of which is conservation, and to foster and pay for research and development for fuels, alternative energy sources such as the sun and the wind, to continue research and development on taking this abundant supply of coal that we have in this country, and everybody knows what coal looks like. When you mine it, it is in a solid form. I think, Mr. Speaker, that I read recently that in the United States of America there are 1.4 trillion tons of known coal resources and maybe twice that much. But if it is limited to 1.4 trillion tons, I think we burn, generating electricity mainly in this country, about 20 billion tons a year. So we may well have 150 years worth of coal to produce electricity. 
   So this research and development to take that coal, that rock that we all know, to convert it into gas, gasification, just methane gas, natural gas, or to liquefy it and basically turn it into petroleum and diesel fuel. So we have the capability of doing that. 
   We have something like 1.5 trillion barrels or at least 900 billion, but I think the closer estimate is 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum that is embedded in a rock, not coal, but in a way you can think of it as coal, in the Rocky Mountain States. There are three or four States, Colorado being one of them, and this rock can be mined just like coal or anything else, copper ore, anything that we mine, and we can extract that petroleum from this rock. You can almost think of a sponge that was fully soaked, saturated with water, and you just kind of squeeze out the water. 
   It is a little more complicated than that and it is going to take some more research and development, but the Democratic majority in their Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 put a provision in the bill that said you couldn't use that. That no agency of the Federal Government, including the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force which uses all of that jet fuel, they couldn't enter into a contract because the mining or production, burning of that alternative fuel would result in one little scintilla increase in carbon dioxide emission. 
   We hear, and I will yield back to my colleague in just a second, but I want to make this point. When this 110th Congress convened in January of 2007, the first witness we had in the Science Committee, and this was kind of unprecedented, was none other than the Speaker of the House. We were thrilled. That was an honor. The Speaker of the House was going to be the one witness at the Science Committee talking about global warming. 
   And several weeks later our second witness was former Vice President Al Gore who had just gotten an Oscar for the documentary film ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' I think was the name of it, again in regard to global warming.     
   Well, the price of gasoline at the pump at that time was maybe $2.50 a gallon or a little less than that, $2.33 a gallon. And it was clear that Madam Speaker's passion, and she said it later, and she said it recently, her passion was to save the Earth in regard to global warming and carbon capture and all of that. And of course Vice President Gore, the same thing. And I could understand their passion. 
   I didn't necessarily agree with all of the scientists, the U.N. committee that had those five different reports on global warming and what we should do about it, capping trade and whether or not these were just sort of natural cycles and phases of the sun. And you have little ice ages and warm ages and that sort of thing. 
   But even giving them the benefit of the doubt, and we are talking about some very bright scientists, that that is a priority maybe when gasoline is $2, $2.25 a gallon. But when it's $4 a gallon, and crude oil, light sweet crude is $140 a barrel, that cannot be the number one priority of this country, when we're on the verge of going bankrupt. 
   We literally, I really say, Mr. Speaker, I don't know if my colleagues would agree with me, but I truly believe that what we're facing now in the financial markets, it all started with this dependency on foreign sources and being at the--they almost have a gun at our head in regard to this. 
   So the number one priority, at least from this side of the aisle, is to have a comprehensive energy plan, lower these prices and become totally independent. It doesn't mean that we will not continue to buy fossil fuel from foreign sources, but at least we wouldn't have to. And so that's why we're here tonight, to talk about that. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for letting me speak maybe a little longer than they had anticipated I would. But the gentlewoman from Minnesota is here tonight, Mrs. Bachmann, and she's been here so much over the last 2 months talking about this issue, as has Congressman Latta from Ohio. So at this point I yield back to my colleagues, and I thank you for letting me participate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I risk in strong support of S. 2606, the United States Fire Administration Reauthorization Act of 2008. 
   This legislation reauthorizes the United States Fire Administration (USFA) for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for the agency's activities in training, fire education and awareness, data collection, research, and standards development and promotion. S. 2606 provides $291 million in federal funds over this 5-year period, which is consistent with previously authorized levels and allows only for a modest growth in funding, capped at 3 percent in any of the fiscal years covered by this bill. 
   The mission of USFA is to limit economic and life loss ``due to fire and related emergencies, through leadership, advocacy, coordination and support.'' This organization provides vital assistance in the areas of training, fire education and awareness, and awards grants to a number of local fire departments across the country. Since its inception in 1974, USFA has trained over 1 million firefighters through local delivery courses as well as through the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland. USFA has provided support critical to reducing deaths and injuries in the U.S. from fire by 25 percent between 1996 and 2006.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding. 
   I, too, want to rise in support of the amendment of Mr. Grijalva and Mr. Bishop in regard to this amendment. But, Mr. Chairman, I want to state rather emphatically that I rise to express concern that this committee, the Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, has jurisdiction over the miles and miles and hundreds if not thousands of miles of Outer Continental Shelf on both coasts of this country and also the Gulf of Mexico, this committee, the Natural Resources Committee chaired by Mr. Rahall, has jurisdiction, and yet here we are, Mr. Chairman, taking up the time of this body to delay the work that we clearly need to do in regard to a sound energy policy. And to think that we have 2 more weeks left before the majority leadership has decided that we are going to leave this place and not come back until the 111th Congress, ladies and gentlemen, that is next January. So starting from August 1 until the end of the year, that means we will have worked, what, 13 days in 5 months. That makes this congressional job, Mr. Chairman, a part-time job. If I had known that, I would go back home and deliver babies for 6 months out of the year. 
   We ought to be doing an energy bill right now, this week. There is no excuse for it. And there was really no excuse, Mr. Chairman, for us adjourning and going home to our districts for whatever reason for 5 weeks. We could have stayed here and in 3 days, 5 days at the most, done exactly what Mr. Rahall just a few minutes ago on the floor of this Chamber said that you were going to do; you, the majority, were going to introduce a comprehensive bill allowing 99 percent of all United States energy resources to be utilized. 
   What I have seen, Mr. Chairman, of this proposal, if it looks anything like what has been suggested on the Senate side, doesn't even come close to that. This is certainly not an all-of-the-above energy bill; it is almost none of the above. And, quite honestly, the acronym for that is the NOT-A bill, none-of-the-above act. It is a NOT-A energy act. 
   But if the chairman is right in what he said, Mr. Chairman, that we are going to see an all-of-the-above energy bill, let's get with it. Let's get with it. There is no reason why the Committee on Energy and Commerce, with Chairman Dingell and Ranking Member Barton who work very well together, very respected members on both sides of the aisle in this Chamber, we could not in a regular order go through the regular process, have an open rule, and give and take on both sides. 
   Put the politics aside, and let's do what we should have done 6 weeks ago to bring relief to the American people in regard to these high gasoline prices.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about policy and process. 
   This is a situation where in the process the voices on both sides of the aisle have literally been shut down by bringing forward one of the most important pieces of legislation, I think, that I have had to discuss in the 4 1/2 years that I have been a Member of this Congress. To say to the 11 position Members, almost equally divided between the Democrats and the Republicans, that we don't want to hear your voice, we don't want to hear some amendments that you might want to proffer because you have spent maybe 30 years, in my case maybe 25 years, 250 years in the aggregate of these 11 physicians' practicing medicine, no one being able to bring meaningful amendments to this issue. 
   The other side has talked many times about the Republican former majority running up this massive debt and borrowing money from the Chinese. I am going to tell you something. This might be a time, Mr. Speaker, where the new majority should borrow this $75 billion massive expansion of the SCHIP program from the Chinese rather than getting the money off the backs of our Medicare recipients under Medicare Advantage, 8 million of whom choose that option, and many of those are the lowest income; and also encouraging 22 million people to become addicted to smoking so they could raise this revenue. The chairman says it is a modest increase in tax on a pack of cigarettes. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, it doubles the tax on a pack of cigarettes. 
   So we have a better idea. I am opposed to this bill in its present form, and I support the Republican motion to recommit, which is the Barton-Deal bill, which says, look, we will cover children that are slipping through the cracks. The CBO estimates, Mr. Speaker, that 600,000 children have fallen through the cracks. They are in that group 100 to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. Under the Barton-Deal plan, we can cover them and we will do that. We don't need to increase the funding by $50 billion and start covering children who already have health insurance because their families make more than $100,000 a year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, while I was unavoidably absent from the floor today to attend the funeral of a close personal friend and great Georgian, C.W. Matthews, I want to express my strong opposition to H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007. Had I been present during the actual vote, I would have voted ``no'' to H.R. 1592 because I believe all crimes should be prosecuted equally without special rights based on gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. All criminal acts are committed with the intention of harming or depriving another individual, and trying to elevate crimes against certain individuals would be an arbitrary way to punish. I absolutely believe that those who commit crimes against anyone should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Furthermore, I would have voted ``yes'' in strong support of the motion to recommit which would have amended the legislation to protect seniors and veterans.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (AMERICAN HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, my colleague; and as he pointed out, we're both in our prior life MDs and both in the same specialty, OB/GYN. I practiced a little bit longer than the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess; but we certainly know of what we speak in regard to the stress and strain of everyday life, a work day in a physician practice across this country, whatever specialty it might be. 
   I was listening in my office just a few minutes ago, Mr. Speaker, to the gentleman from Texas, Dr. Burgess, as he talked about some of the things that we failed to do in the first session of this 110th Congress last year, 2007. He started off his discussion talking a little bit about that, the SCHIP program. I think most people, all of our colleagues of course, understand SCHIP is an acronym for State Children's Health Insurance Program, as Representative Burgess pointed out, enacted 10 years ago. It was a good, a good program. I think 1997, a 10-year authorization for this program, and it would expire. We wanted to see, of course, how it would work, was it going to be a good thing. So when you put sunsets on programs that makes sense, because sometimes ideas don't turn out so good. But this one really did. 
   And the basic concept, Mr. Speaker, as we all know, was to try to help parents have health insurance for their children when they were in a situation where their income was too much to qualify for safety-net programs, in particular the Medicaid program; they were making more than that minimum amount. But, yet, in no way were they coming close to having enough income, discretionary income to pay even their portion of a health insurance premium for their children if their employer happened to cover part of it. And, of course, many didn't. 
   So this program was a wildly successful program covering about 6 million children a year, Mr. Speaker, and spending about $5 billion a year in the process. And it was a Federal/State matching program, more generous on the part of the Federal Government, the taxpayers across this country, than the Medicaid program, which was more a 55/45 sharing. The SCHIP program was a better deal, if you will, for State governments. And it worked so well, of course, that there were 6 million children covered, I stated, and it was estimated that in some States that there were children that were falling through the safety net and not getting the coverage because States like my own of Georgia, and my own district, the 11th of Georgia, we were running out of money. 
   So I think clearly, as this program came to its expiration date this past year, everybody in this body, in this House and in the other body, in the Senate, I think all 435 Members realized we wanted to reauthorize this program and we needed to spend a little bit more money to make sure that those children that were eligible, needed the coverage, there would be enough money available for them.     
   Most people estimated that about 1 million additional children, 750,000 to 1 million children, we have some of them in the State of Georgia, needed that coverage. So President Bush in his wisdom said let's reauthorize this program and let's increase the spending by 20 percent, and I thought that was a pretty generous thing; that would cover these additional children. 
   But as Dr. Burgess pointed out, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority came to the floor with a bill that was not even vetted in committee, certainly no Member of the minority party had much chance at all to see this bill, that wanted to increase coverage to up to 10 million children. Now, we were covering 6 million, and they arbitrarily wanted to increase that coverage to 10 million. So that's an additional 4 million children, Mr. Speaker, when by anybody's estimate there were no more than 1 million that were in this range that warrant getting coverage. 
   So I honestly believe that the Democratic majority wanted to bring forward a piece of legislation that in no way could any fiscally responsible Member of this body vote in favor of. And it's hard to stand up here and say what people's motives are, but I think the gentleman from Texas alluded to it earlier. There are a lot of politics involved in this one, Mr. Speaker, and of course, here we are now, we ultimately we have an 18-month extension. But we need to come together. This is just a perfect example, in the health care arena in particular, where we can and should come together in a bipartisan way to do things for the benefit of the American people to provide better health care. 
   We like to tout that we have the greatest health care system in the world. Maybe we do. But sometimes I wonder, and clearly, I think there are things that we could do in a bipartisan way to improve it, and Dr. Burgess has mentioned it. He's talked about the payment formula, that flawed formula, in regard to paying our physicians, and so it's no surprise that not only are more and more of them unwilling to accept Medicare patients because they're not even being reimbursed enough to cover their expenses, there's no surprise to me when I picked up the Sunday newspaper, the Atlanta newspaper in my hometown of Marietta this past weekend, and there's this big full page ad where one of the chain drugstores is now opening up these clinics, manned and ``womanned'' by men and women who are not MD's, but they're nurse practitioners. They're very skilled. They're trained. They certainly are dedicated, and the fees for seeing them are anywhere from $60 to $75 for a 15- or 20-minute visit. 
   So what you're seeing is so much of medicine is not an MD providing the care. It's these situations like these drop-in clinics in chain drugstores. I don't think this is the way it should be,  and I think we can do things like enact tort reform to take some of the pressure off of the physicians so that there's not so much defensive medicine. And of course, that runs up the costs tremendously. 
   Tort reform is hugely important. Dr. Burgess and I, Mr. Speaker, have worked very hard in the 5 years into our 6 years as Members of this body trying to get that passed. We have been trying to get association health plans where people can come together in an industry and purchase health insurance across State lines, free of all these mandates of the individual States. Fifty different States have all these mandates on health insurance policies that drive up the premiums. 
   I thank Dr. Burgess for taking the time tonight on our first day back in this second session of the 110th to continue to talk about health care. This is clearly a passion of his. It's certainly a passion of mine, not just physician Members of this body, but a lot of very, very good, experienced Members who are concerned with this. 
   Before I yield the time back to my colleague and I continue hopefully during the remaining time tonight to engage in a colloquy with him on these issues, I think one of the most important things we could do and we could do it now is to enact electronic medical records, say a complete fully integrated system and incentivize doctors. We can do it through the tax code to give them an opportunity, particularly the small group practices, the primary care physicians so they can get electronic medical records. This would clearly save a lot of the money that Dr. Burgess was talking about. My friend has done some good work on that in his committee assignment on Energy and Commerce, Health Subcommittee, as well as the ranking member there, my colleague from Georgia, Representative Nathan Deal. We'll continue the discussion.

   Mr. GINGREY. I also had an opportunity over that Labor Day weekend to go down on an angel flight to Baton 
   Rouge and to try to help man, staff an emergency Red Cross clinic there. I think it was called the River Center, a huge clinic that had been set up. And as we began to see patients, I realized the enormity of this situation, as Dr. Burgess points out with his poster. One patient in particular was HIV positive and seven months pregnant and had not received any medication, retrovirus medication in 2 weeks, and this is the kind of thing that is life or death. 
   This situation in New Orleans really pointed it out. But suppose someone from this country is traveling in another country where they don't speak the language, and all of a sudden some catastrophic event occurs, a stroke, where the person cannot communicate. There's no way that the physicians, no matter how skilled they might be in the emergency room, and in the Ukraine they're not going to be able to take care of somebody from the United States that cannot communicate. 
   But with electronic medical records, it's just a matter of a swipe of a card, just like you do your American Express card where the radio frequency, identification system, secure, absolutely secure, privacy maintained, guaranteed, a system set up by our Federal Government where the standards are the same across the board. It, without question, would save a tremendous amount of money. The Rand Corporation estimates something like $175 to $200 billion a year out of that $1.6 trillion medical expenditures each year, $200 billion savings. But more important than the cost saving, of course, is the life savings aspect of it. 
   So I'm so glad the gentleman from Texas (Dr. Burgess) brought that up and showed that very, very telling poster.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (AMERICAN HEALTH CARE -- (House of Representatives - January 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank Dr. Burgess for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the issue of medical liability reform is something that we've been talking about for a long time in this House of Representatives and in the other body, and it's time that we do something about it. I remember back in 2004, during the Presidential debate between our current President Bush and the Democratic nominee, Senator Kerry, and on one particular debate they were talking about the cost of medical malpractice insurance. And Senator Kerry made the statement that, well, you know, if a doctor has to pay $40,000, $50,000 a year, some can afford it; that's just a very small amount in the big scheme of things. And I thought President Bush did such a great job of responding to that and he said, you know, Senator, I believe you missed the point. Yeah, some doctors can afford to pay $50,000, some can afford to pay $75,000 a year, depending on their specialty, for medical malpractice coverage; other doctors can't. But that is really not the point. 
   The point that causes the cost of medicine to go up so much is that all of these physicians practice in a defensive mode, and they order tests in many instances that are absolutely unnecessary, way too expensive, and, indeed, can be harmful to the patient. 
   You know, I would imagine today, Mr. Speaker, if you went to any emergency room in this country with a headache, you are not going to get out of there without a CT scan being performed. And that particular procedure, by the time it is done and the radiologist reads the film, you're talking about $500, $600, when it would be obvious to a clinician, a skilled clinician in physical diagnosis that this patient is suffering from a tension headache or maybe a migraine headache. So this is where that cost goes up so much. 
   I appreciate the gentleman giving me an opportunity to talk about it because the model for tort reform is what the State of California did back in 1978; the acronym is MICRA. But basically what we're talking about is to say that no patient who is injured by a physician practicing below the standard of care or a health care facility practicing below the standard of care that results in direct harm to the patient, they should have every opportunity for their day in court. 
   Dr. Burgess and I probably have seen situations 
   where we are pulling for the plaintiff because we know what happened in the particular setting and maybe in our community. But the judgments for so-called pain and suffering that can be up into the millions of dollars, which are totally unrelated to the degree of injury, is inappropriate. And that's basically what was passed in California and it has worked. The State of Texas, my State of Georgia, the State of Florida, several States have done this; but the vast majority of States are in situations where you don't see any neurosurgeons covering the emergency room. You see very few OB/GYN doctors staying in practice beyond the age of 50. They're all either getting out of the practice completely or they're going over to just a GYN practice. So I thank my colleague for bringing this issue up. 
   And as I finish my remarks and yield back to the gentleman from Texas, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that what happens so many times in what we do, we're constrained because of the cost. And we base cost on programs like Medicare part D, by this so-called static scoring that it cost too much money  when so often programs like that have the potential to, in the long run, save money, but would get no credit for it. So we don't do things that we should be doing. Just like, as we were talking about earlier in the evening on electronic medical records, yes, it would cost some money, Mr. Speaker; the Federal Government would have to spend some money. I think that the new Democratic leadership has made a mistake in enacting these PAYGO rules which make it impossible in some instances to do things like the physician payment fix that Dr. Burgess is talking about, the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, which clearly was a mistake, an oversight 35 years ago when it wasn't indexed for inflation. 
   And so now the Democratic leadership has put themselves in a position where we can't get things done because of those PAYGO rules when in the long run the program that we would enact would save money; it wouldn't cost money. So you would be paying for it doubly by cutting another program and raising taxes to pay for something that will eventually pay for itself. And, certainly, I think that's true with Medicare part D, and I absolutely believe it is true with the electronic medical records system that we need in this country, and I think it's true in regard to medical liability reform that Dr. Burgess is talking about. So I thank the gentleman for bringing that up, and I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1868, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND MANUFACTURING STIMULATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, let me just thank my former colleague on the Committee on Rules, Mr. PETE SESSIONS, the gentleman from Texas. I realize as we get busy running from pillar to post around here, that he was in the process of wrapping up, and it is awfully kind of him to go kind of out of regular order and give me the opportunity, knowing how committed I am to this program, to take a few minutes. I appreciate so much that opportunity. 
   I do rise to support the underlying rule and the bill, H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007. I want to take the opportunity to thank my chairman on the Subcommittee on Technology and Innovation, DAVID WU from the great State of Oregon, for incorporating into this bill the many suggestions and additions from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as the administration. The final legislation is a better product because of that, and, DAVID WU, I thank you so much. 
   Last year, with his American Competitiveness Initiative, President Bush provided a vision to maintain America's position in the global marketplace by actually doubling the investment in physical science research over the next 10 years. H.R. 1868 helps fulfill that mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2008, 2009 and 2010 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST we know it as. It is an agency in the Department of Commerce and one of the three agencies highlighted by the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. 
   NIST has an annual operating budget of about $843 million. It operates in two locations. The headquarters, of course, are in Gaithersburg, Maryland, I have had a great visit there with Dr. Jeffrey, the Director. There is also the facility at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
   NIST employs 2,900 scientists, engineers, technicians and administrative. These employees all play a critical role in this research, which enables cutting-edge technologies to make the leap from basic research into successful commercial products. NIST labs accomplish this goal by conducting research that supports United States technology infrastructure by developing tools to measure, evaluate and standardize processes and products in almost all industrial sectors. 
   For example, NIST labs develops performance standards for bulletproof vests, chemical and biological protection equipment guides for first responders, measurement standards vital to sustaining cutting-edge industries like nanotechnology, we are doing some great work at my alma mater, the Georgia Institute of Technology, on nanotechnology, and, of course, next generation solar cells. 
   The Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act codifies  the American Competitiveness Initiative by authorizing 3 years of the proposed 10-year doubling for NIST laboratories and construction budget. That indeed is exactly what the administration asked us to do. That is exactly what Chairman Wu has done and the Science Committee has done. 
   H.R. 1868 also strengthens oversight of NIST programs by requiring the director to submit to Congress annual programmatic planning documents and requiring NIST's Technical Advisory Board to comment on those plans. This will ensure that the budget of NIST is spent on activities that meet the needs of American industry and that Congress is kept abreast of how NIST plans to use its increased funding. 
   Manufacturing is so fundamental, Mr. Speaker, to our Nation's economic vitality. Manufacturing jobs continue to pay more than the average U.S. salaries and they provide better benefits. 
   Mr. Speaker, a strong manufacturing base is so critical to U.S. economic competitiveness. H.R. 1868 supports small and medium-sized manufacturers by reauthorizing the highly successful Manufacturing Extension Partnership. I know every Member is enthusiastic about Manufacturing Extension Partnerships. We refer to them as MEPs. They are wonderful. They are great programs. They help businesses improve manufacturing processes, reduce waste, they train workers to use new equipment. 
   The MEP program receives one-third of its funding from the Federal Government, one-third from the States, and, yes, one-third from fees charged to the participating small businesses, these potential small business manufacturers. This MEP program has over 350 offices located in all 50 States and Puerto Rico. In my great State of Georgia, and again, I mention my alma mater, Georgia Tech, plays a critical role in successfully coordinating the efforts across the State for these MEP programs. 
   H.R. 1868 improves the MEP program by incorporating changes that have passed the House in both the 108th and 109th Congresses. These changes include the codification of an MEP advisory board, the establishment of grant programs to research and identify innovative manufacturing technologies and the formation of research fellowships. 
   I know my colleagues and I can all agree that small and medium-sized manufacturers are the workhorses of our economy. Their future depends on our ability to foster an innovative environment which will enable them to continue developing and adopting advanced technologies that allow them to remain competitive in the ever-increasing global marketplace.  
   Our country's current system of collaboration with university and national lab-based basic research is the best in the world. However, many experts agree that in the phase between science-based ``inventions'' and commercially viable ``innovation,'' inefficiencies exist in our capital markets that contribute to the funding gap for early stage technology development. 
   Currently, the Advanced Technology Program at NIST provides cost-shared funding to bridge the technology development gap for research with potential to deliver widespread economic benefits that would likely not be developed because private sector capital is unavailable. 
   H.R. 1868 repeals the Advanced Technology Program, ATP, and establishes the Technology Innovation Program, TIP, which will award cost-shared grants to small and medium-sized businesses and joint ventures including universities to pursue high-risk technologies with potential significant broad benefits to the Nation. 
   The new Technology Innovation Program incorporates recommendations made by the Bush administration to improve and update the former ATP program to make it more effective in promoting technology transfer that will benefit our entire Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, past ATP funding advanced technologies for the next-generation auto equipment and techniques including: robotic welding, ceramic coatings, and reinforced plastics as strong as steel. One project dramatically improved the fit of a car body's 300 stamped parts. This advancement may save consumers and automakers up to $650 million in annual maintenance costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again want to underline my whole-hearted support for the underlying legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.  
   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that what we are doing here today in regard to the NIST program is so important to our economy. We worry about jobs. We worry on both sides of the aisle. We talk about that. Every month we look at the number of jobs that were created. It is a barometer that is watched so closely by the Members of Congress, both Republican and Democrat, and by the people back home. 
   This is really what this is all about, these kinds of programs. We can fight about a lot of things, but we shouldn't fight about funding the National Science Foundation and the NIST program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership and anything like that, like last week when we passed those two bills to improve math and science education in this country. 
   We have to compete globally. Yes, we are in a shooting war in the Middle East and we want to give our soldiers an opportunity to win, but we need to give ourselves an opportunity to win this economic battle of the global economy, and that is what it is all about. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to again underline my whole-hearted support for the underlying legislation. I urge my colleagues, as I know they will, to support it.

   In the 1940s, a 23-year-old Matthews established the C.W. Matthews Contracting Company, which today is the largest highway contractor in the southeastern United States. C.W. was a natural businessman, making friends with ease, growing his company the old-fashioned way, through hard work. 
   Over the past 60 years, the company has employed thousands of workers, built many of the roads that help Cobb County thrive, and even worked on the expansion at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. In fact, Mr. Matthews, with only an eighth-grade education, created one of the most successful family-run businesses in the Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to tell Mr. Matthews' wife, Myrtle, of 66 years, his two sons, two grandsons, and seven great-grandchildren, the entire Cobb County community shares in your loss. We will always remember C.W. as a man of passion, drive and ingenuity. 
   I ask all my colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy of C.W. Matthews.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this rule and the underlying resolution. No amendments allowed, no committee hearings, no committee votes taken, all we have is simply a closed rule, a closed process, a bunch of broken promises. 
   So here we go again, Mr. Speaker. Once more, Members of the House find themselves with really no good choices, forced to accept the ``our way or the highway'' mentality of the new majority, despite their promises to do otherwise. 
   As if the majority's broken promises for civility and openness in the people's House wasn't disconcerting enough, this continuing resolution is one giant broken promise. 
   For instance, the Democrats promise no earmarks in this continuing resolution. They even include ``window-dressing'' language to that effect for the  purpose of their talking points and sound bites. Yet, on closer inspection, one realizes that, while this resolution does eliminate earmarks for organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, various law enforcement programs, schools and hospitals, it somehow still provides funding for several notorious million-dollar earmarks such as the Bridge to Nowhere. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic rationale for picking at which earmarks stay and which earmarks go strikes me as bizarre and hypocritical, to say the least. 
   Even more troubling, this continuing resolution shortchanges our military, their families and our communities transitioning under the BRAC process by almost $3.1 billion, not to mention an additional billion dollar shortfall for military construction. Clearly, the majority has a ``tough love'' philosophy when it comes to our military, their families and the war on terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, we could have even fixed some of these problems right here, right now if Members had been allowed to offer amendments. But I guess that is not the way it works in this moveon.org Congress.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding, and I do rise in support of H.R. 2608. But I wanted to take the opportunity, Madam Speaker, to talk about energy. 
   Obviously this is the main issue I think on the minds of most Americans today, and it has led, these high energy prices and dependency on foreign oil that we have been burdened by for lo these many years, since back when we knew this back in the seventies when we had a similar crisis and failed to do anything about it, and it has caused this economy, it is almost like a domino effect in my opinion, Madam Speaker, when you look at the high price of everything, the unemployment rate going up, what has happened on Wall Street, the meltdown in the subprime market. 
   So we felt and I think most of my colleagues would agree on both sides of the aisle that the energy crisis is our number one concern as we move into the fall elections and congressional elections. Obviously this is a Presidential year.     
   So my disappointment yesterday, when Speaker Pelosi, returning from the August recess, we, as you know, many on the Republican side, we invited our Democratic colleagues to join us, came back to Washington on a number of days. I think a total of 134 participated, some of us several times. 
   We had lots of folks down here sitting in the seats because a Member could bring people on the floor, even though the C-SPAN cameras were off, microphones were off, the lights were dim, and we had some in the gallery as well, and talked about this issue. We just couldn't wait for the rest of our colleagues to get back so we could do something. 
   This motion to recommit with instructions last night, the Abercrombie-  Peterson bill, I think, had 39 Democratic cosponsors, many, many, Republicans, and I think it was a very, very good piece of legislation that did not include ANWR. It carved out ANWR, realizing that was something we agreed to disagree on, and leave that out of the legislation. 
   But the most important part of the Peterson-Abercrombie bill that differed from what the majority party, as you know, brought to us for a final vote that did pass, it has no incentive whatsoever for the States to allow drilling off of their shores for the billions of gallons of petroleum and millions of cubic feet of natural gas, because they are sitting there thinking, well, gosh, on the gulf coast, Alabama, Texas and Louisiana are getting those royalties and putting them to good use, and we need that. 
   My State of Georgia, right now, we have 135 miles of shoreline, the great State of Georgia, and we are $1.5 billion short in this revenue year, this fiscal year. I am sure Georgia would be one of the very first to get in line if we had that included. I am disappointed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding. 
   As a proud member of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 1432. This important resolution recognizes the goals and ideals of National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month by promoting and raising national awareness of adoption and children in foster care, as my colleague from Nevada was just explaining. I commend him, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter), for working in a bipartisan matter to bring this important resolution to the floor, a resolution that celebrates the children and the families involved in adoption, as well as the current programs and efforts designed to promote adoption. 
   As was said by my colleague in Illinois, I was an OB/GYN physician for nearly 30 years before coming to the Congress back in 2003, and I am especially passionate, Madam Speaker, about protecting children and their right to life by encouraging adoption. 
   Madam Speaker, adoption brings joy to many loving families who cannot have children of their own or who simply wish to welcome even more children into their homes and into their hearts. Both National Adoption Day and National Adoption Month, which will be recognized on November 15 and, indeed, throughout the entire month of November, raise awareness nationally for the more than 129,000 children who are currently in foster care and looking, almost begging, for those permanent homes. 
   I wholeheartedly believe that raising awareness for adoption, as this resolution does so well, will help place more children in those loving homes. However, I believe that we should spend more than just 1 day, or even 1 month, during the year raising awareness on this issue. Both children and parents greatly benefit from adoption, and I want to applaud all individuals in my home State of Georgia and across this country who work so tirelessly to bring joy to these families who sometimes have very little joy. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to urge all my colleagues, and I'm sure they will, to support H. Res. 1432.

   I think that the problem is that a lot of people in this country--and certainly it would appear that the leadership of this House, Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker, and the leadership of the Senate, the Majority Leader, Mr. Reid of Nevada--are completely convinced that fossil fuel is a bad thing and it needs to be stamped out, eliminated; kill that sucker dead as soon as possible. 
   The quotes that I have heard, I think Senator Reid said, ``Fossil fuel,'' which includes, of course, coal and petroleum and natural gas, ``Fossil fuel is poison, and we need to get rid of all fossil fuel in the good old U.S.A. by the year 2020.'' 
   Madam Speaker, when I asked during the August recess about whether or not she would come back and allow some drilling to obtain our own domestic sources of fossil fuel, she said, ``I want to save the planet.'' She hit her fist on the table and said again, for emphasis, ``I want to save the planet.'' 
   A spokesperson for the Sierra Club, maybe it was the president of the Sierra Club, Madam Speaker, said it's a good thing that American people are now having to pay these astronomical prices for petroleum. 
   In other words, the idea is this is such a horrible thing, this burning of coal, which, by the way, generates 65 percent of our electricity, this driving cars and trucks and using gasoline and diesel fuel in our trains. Literally, our transportation system couldn't function without fossil fuels. 
   Now there may come a day, and hopefully there will come a day, when we will be able to wean ourselves off of fossil fuel and come up with some other alternatives, alternatives like wind and solar and bio-products and ethanol that absolutely give us great efficiency for our needs, electricity and transportation, and cause us absolutely no harm and that we have a tremendous abundance of all of these alternatives and renewables so that we're not dependent on anybody. That is kind of a euphoria, and hopefully it will one day occur. But we don't know for sure that it might not be opening up Pandora's box, Madam Speaker. We don't know that. 
   While it's true that greenhouse gases probably do cause a little bit of global warming--

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our troops who are faithfully serving our Nation in harm's way. Therefore, I must oppose this resolution brought to the floor by the Democrats because it offers no plan, no strategy, and no hope for victory. In fact, it does nothing but risk demoralizing our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that Republicans and Democrats alike recognize mistakes have been made in Iraq and neither side of the aisle is happy with where we are today. But rather than offering solutions to move us forward or engage in a productive debate on alternative strategies, the Democrats have decided to propose what certainly seems to be a politically motivated resolution. 
   I ask, Mr. Speaker, what are we really accomplishing with this resolution? The answer is nothing. With this shameless stunt, the Democrats are locking down this body for 36 hours maybe in hopes of scoring political points by criticizing the President. But by using our troops as pawns in an attempt to gain political leverage, this resolution serves only to weaken troop morale while giving hope and comfort to the enemy.     
   In doing so, Mr. Speaker, the Democrats have done nothing to end the war or help our troops achieve victory. 
   Mr. Speaker, seeing as the Democrats have hijacked the Floor all week to debate this resolution, surely they must have an alternative to the President's plan. I will bet the American people are as eager as I am to hear about this new plan for success, their plan. Certainly my constituents in the Eleventh District of Georgia are waiting. 
   So what is their magic alternative? Mr. Speaker, here it is. It is the same on both sides. They don't have one. We have heard from members of the Democratic team threaten to cut funding, to cap troop levels or to compel a forced withdrawal. But where are those ideas in this resolution? I have read through its two brief paragraphs and I can assure you they aren't to be found. 
   Sadly, the Democrats lack the political will to fully engage in a meaningful debate on Iraq policy. They have refused to allow a vote on funding for the war which would give Members an opportunity to show support for our troops with actions and not empty words. 
   Simply put, Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leadership is afraid to ask their Members to put their money where their mouths are and either vote yes or no to fund our troops and the mission. Isn't this why they have denied Republicans an opportunity to offer an alternative bill, or even a motion to recommit? They were for that last Thursday,  before being against it tonight. Sound familiar? 
   Apparently, Mr. Speaker, calls for funding cuts and troop withdrawals are good enough for newspaper headlines, but they are not good enough for votes on this House floor. Let me remind my colleagues that sound bites for the nightly news will do nothing to win this war against terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, America has a long tradition of standing on the right side of this fight for freedom, even when it is a difficult stand to make, and the right course of action today is to stand by the Iraqi people until their government, their police and military can ensure the security of their own nation. 
   As in any war, there have been setbacks in Iraq. But as in past wars, we will move forward with victory as our goal. This Democratic resolution is a thinly veiled attempt to sound the retreat. That amounts to an unacceptable act of playing politics with our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, as you have heard over the past 2 days, this is a serious debate, with very serious ramifications. It is not simply a simple resolution as the Democrats would like to characterize it. But on one hand, we have a shot at victory. We have an opportunity to push back the cause of radical terrorism. On the other hand, we have a two paragraph, nonbinding resolution that is essentially a vote of no confidence in the commander in chief. 
   This is not the time for our majority party to cave in to their anti-war supporters of the liberal left and play politics with the security of the United States. This is a time for bold leadership and bold plans. Sadly, Mr. Speaker, neither is on display here today. 
   I hope for the sake of the American people, our troops and freedom-loving nations around this world, that this resolution's flimsy words are not taken as a substitute for America's long tradition and commitment to achieving victory. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to point out to my colleagues this poster on my left. These brave soldiers, Paul Saylor from Breman, Georgia; Justin Johnson from Rome, Georgia; Lieutenant Tyler Brown, a Georgia Tech graduate, the president of the student body; and Hayes Clayton, III, from Marietta, Georgia, all died for their country. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot turn our backs on them. We cannot say to their moms and dads, their brothers and sisters, their wives and their children, that we supported sending them into harm's way and they gave their lives for their country, and now we are saying it was for naught, it was for nothing, it was not worth it. We can't let that happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in voting down this meaningless resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of our troops, who are faithfully serving our Nation in harm's way. Therefore, I must oppose this resolution brought to the floor by the Democrats because it offers no plan, no strategy, and no hope for victory. In fact, it does nothing but risk demoralizing our troops.

I'll bet the American people are as eager as I am to hear about this new plan for success. Certainly my constituents in the 11th District of Georgia are. 
   So what is their magic alternative? As far as I can tell, Mr. Speaker, they don't have one. 
   We've heard members of the Democrat team threaten to cut funding, cap troop levels, or compel a forced withdrawal. But where are those ideas in this resolution? I've read through its two brief paragraphs, and I can assure you--they aren't to be found.

   Isn't this why they've denied Republicans an opportunity to offer an alternate bill, or even a motion to recommit with instructions? 
   They were for that last Thursday before now being against it. Sound familiar? 
   Apparently, Mr. Speaker, calls for funding cuts and troop withdrawal are good enough for newspaper headlines, but not for votes on the House floor. Let me remind my colleagues that sound bytes for the nightly news will do nothing to win this war on terror. 
   VICTORY 
   I can tell you one thing the Democrats aren't discussing here today, and that's victory. Victory in Iraq will result in a nation that can defend itself, govern itself, sustain itself, and be an ally against terrorism rather than a safe haven for terrorists. Victory should be the focus of our debate today, because victory is the goal of our military's efforts. One of my Democrat colleagues said yesterday that ``we have given war a chance.'' Well, Mr. Speaker, I retort that we must now, at this darkest hour, give victory a chance, rather than appeasement! 
   So I implore someone to please tell me how this resolution achieves any advancement toward victory. 
   Mr. Speaker, the President has offered a new idea that can help us achieve our goals in Iraq, so we can foster a more stable Middle East and yes, then bring our troops home to a grateful nation and the comfort of their families. This ``new way forward'' isn't perfect, nor will it make every Member of this body happy, but it is a reasonable plan which offers perhaps our last best chance to silence the insurgency, allow the Iraqi political apparatus to thrive, and help the region realize greater security and stability.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLIE NORWOOD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood was a very successful dentist in my hometown of Augusta, Georgia. I didn't know Charlie at that time because I had long since moved away. 
   But as a practicing physician in Marietta, Georgia, as an OB/GYN, several years ago I went to the annual meeting of the Georgia OB/GYN Society to hear Dr. Charlie Norwood talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. Physicians across Georgia and across this country were concerned with managed care and HMOs and liability and that sort of thing. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, when I heard Dr. Norwood speak to my colleagues, physicians about this issue, and them, in turn, including myself, give him a standing ovation, I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, and I never did tell Charlie this, but that was an inspiration to me to want to some day have the opportunity, and thank God that I did, to follow in that walk that he walked. 
   What a great Member of this body and what a fierce competitor and a fair competitor, Mr. Speaker. As my colleague on the other side of the aisle, the distinguished John Lewis, knows well, Charlie would fight for something he believed in but in a very respectful way. And he thought about others before himself. 
   An example, Mr. Speaker, is that just in this last election cycle, when Charlie was suffering so much, as Representative Deal has just mentioned, he didn't think about himself. He won his reelection with 67 percent of the vote. And it wasn't that he couldn't campaign because of his illness. He was working all that time for another colleague in a very competitive district. He was essentially running that other campaign. That is the kind of guy Charlie Norwood was, and the kind of fellow that we will all remember here on both sides of the aisle in this great House of Representatives. 
   He was a friend, he was a colleague. He was a fighter. He was a fighter for patients' rights. He was a fighter for students, as his work on the Education and Workforce Committee, the Energy and Commerce Committee, he is somebody that we can all emulate. 
   And I just want to say to his wife Gloria, to his two sons, Carlton and Charles, Jr., and to the four grandchildren and to the Norwood family, we are praying for you. We want to uplift you. We will be with you tomorrow, but we know, as you do, that Charlie is in heaven right now, and God has accepted him in open arms and saying, well done, my good and faithful servant.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank you. 
   We're going to spend our hour tonight on behalf of the minority party talking about energy, once again. This is the most pressing concern, I think, of our Nation right now in these tough economic times. 
   But before I get started, I want to join with my colleagues, my Democratic colleagues, and pay tribute, Mr. Speaker, to STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES, the gentlewoman from Ohio. I guess you can say that everything's been said that needs to be said, but not everybody has had an opportunity to say it. I can't improve upon the kind words that we've heard here over the last hour in regard to her life and what a great person she was. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention one thing that I thought about a lot after hearing of her untimely and sad passing. She is the second member, Mr. Speaker, of the Ohio delegation to die in office during this 110th Congress. The first was a member on our side of the aisle--again, very loved and respected--Paul Gillmor. Just like Ms. JONES, like Representative Jones, as bipartisan whenever he could be, as she was. 
   And I went to his funeral in Columbus, Ohio, the great capital of Ohio. And the eulogies that were offered on behalf of Representative Gillmor, the very first one, Mr. Speaker, was offered by Representative STEPHANIE TUBBS JONES. And it was very touching, very loving. You know, it's a sad thing, of course, her passing. But God has His plan, and we have our plans, but His plan takes precedent over everything we do. 
   But she was a great Member of this body, and I join my colleagues in expressing my sincere sympathy to the family. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are here finally back in session after a long 5-week absence, the so-called August recess. And, Mr. Speaker, I think you and all of my colleagues know that many Republican Members--we asked our Democratic colleagues to join us on this floor during the recess--in fact I think some 134 Republican Members--that's not 100 percent on our side, but it's getting darn close to 80, 85 percent--Members came back, some several days, took a break away from their families, from their constituents in this traditional August recess to come back here and say, you know, we really should not be at home. We should not be in our districts no matter how important the work there is. It's very important. Certainly, there is some politicking going on during election season. 
   But I think, Mr. Speaker, most of my constituents told me, and I'm sure every Member of this body, that you need to get back up there and do the people's work. We're suffering, we're struggling with these high gas prices; our kids are going to be going back to school in a couple of weeks and the school bus is probably not going to be running, and it's a safety issue. And some school districts across the country are talking about cutting back to a 4-day school week. It's one thing for a 4-day work week, but a 4-day school week for our youngsters ..... 
   So we were talking about that every day. Every day we had anywhere from 5 to 15 Republican Members in this Chamber. 
   Now, the lights were dim, the air-conditioning was either too cold or it was too hot, the C-SPAN cameras were not running. These microphones--I'm hoarse today Mr. Speaker, because of straining my voice during that time. But it was an absolute wonderful experience. 
   All of the people that were visiting the Nation's Capitol, their Capitol, the people's House, during that time, during those 5 weeks, we asked them if they wanted to come and have a unique opportunity to sit in our seats right here in this Chamber. Rarely do they get the chance to do that. It's not like sitting in the gallery. To actually come down and sit in the seats where the Members sit and debate and vote. 
   And this Chamber was virtually full many of those days, a lot of times three-fourths full, half full. But untold numbers of American citizens had an opportunity. And they were not just Republicans, Mr. Speaker. They were Democrats, they were independents, they were voters. They were people that enjoyed listening to this discussion about the crisis that we're in and what, at least on our side of the aisle, we felt need to be done. 
   We talked at length about the American Energy Act, the bill that was introduced by minority leader JOHN BOEHNER of the great State of Ohio. Leader BOEHNER introduced the American Energy Act probably 2 1/2 months ago, in fact. And it languished wherever it went to, probably the Energy and Commerce Committee, and never saw the light of day. And that bill, Mr. Speaker, is the all-of-the-above Energy Act. Yes, the cornerstone of the bill is to drill, to drill here in the United States or off of its Outer Continental Shelf, to drill now so that we lower these gas prices and get some relief to the great people of this country who are struggling so much right now economically. And yet the bill never had an opportunity to see the light of day. 
   I have got a number of posters, Mr. Speaker, that I want to refer to, and I'm going to put that on the easel here for a minute so my colleagues can join with me in understanding some of the issues.     
   Well, the first poster says, ``Nancy Pelosi, we're here and where are you?'' Well guess what, my colleagues. She's back. She's back. But it took 5 weeks to get her back, and during the time that we were begging her to come back and call this Congress into a special session, she had the power to do that. 
   Madam Speaker was out, among other things, promoting her new book, ``Know Your Power.'' I'm sure Madam Speaker was referring to the power of a woman, and I think that's a good thing. I have three daughters and four grand-daughters, and I hope one day that they will have an opportunity to achieve what Madam Speaker's achieved. They obviously won't be the first female Speaker in the history of this country because she has that title now, but know her power, the power to convene the Congress and pass legislation. She, and only she, could do that, and yet she refused to come back even for a few days, even maybe for a week. She would still, as would the rest of us, have 4 weeks to work in our districts or go on vacation or whatever during that August recess. 
   The ironic thing, Mr. Speaker, about this is Ms. Pelosi said in the elections of 2006--gee, it's been almost 2 years ago when the Democratic Party was the minority party. She said that, you know, this do-nothing Congress, these do-nothing Republicans, we need to replace them, and among other things, of course, she said that bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate, consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute. Now, that is a direct quote by Speaker Pelosi back in 2006. 
   Well, she has already pretty much said that any energy bill, Mr. Speaker, that comes to the floor is going to be basically with a closed rule. We, in the minority, are not going to have an opportunity to amend, and it's not going to look anything like the American Energy Act, the All-of-the-Above Act, which allows not just drilling here, drilling now, but it includes so many other things that we'll speak about during this hour. 
   But before I go on, I wanted to take the opportunity--two of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and I hope maybe some others will join us later in the hour, but the first colleague is the gentleman from Florida, and he should know a lot, a lot indeed, about the Outer Continental Shelf and what is being done and what's not being done. I yield at this time to my colleague from Florida, the honorable RIC KELLER.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the gentleman from Florida being with us tonight, and I thank him for that very intelligent discussion of ANWR and some of the statistics that he presented to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the 1.5 million barrels a day that Representative Keller was talking about is not an insignificant amount of oil, and if you add that to 2.5 million barrels a day that we could be getting from the Outer Continental Shelf and another 2.5 million barrels a day that we could be extracting from the shale out in the Midwest, those five Rocky Mountain States, you would have a doubling of the amount of domestic production of oil. We would go from 7 million barrels a day to about 14 million barrels a day, and of course, you know, right now we're importing 60 percent of what we use. So his discussion is very pertinent and very timely. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, I was talking about what our current Speaker, Ms. Pelosi, some of the quotes that she made back in 2006, and I want to share in this poster a few more with you. She said then, This leadership team will create the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history. Now, Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said that November 16, 2006. 
   This is now, a recent quote. When we asked for an opportunity to have regular order on an energy bill coming through the Energy and Commerce Committee, a bill that was marked up by both Democrats and Republicans, majority and minority, and that would go through the amendment process and that maybe even some amendments submitted to the Rules Committee would be made in order so that we could have a fair and open discussion, when she was questioned about that, when reference to a quote back in 2006, Ms. Pelosi said, and this is a quote, I'm not giving the gavel to them. They will have to use their imagination as to  how they can get a vote. Speaker Pelosi said that on August 3, 2008. I guess kind of like she's using her imagination to lower energy prices. 
   And I think my next colleague who is going to speak will talk a little bit about the imagination and what her plan happens to be, but I'll show a couple of more slides before I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) who has been such a strong advocate on this issue. 
   This is another quote from Ms. Pelosi. This call for drilling in areas that are protected--in other words, the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR that the gentleman from Florida was just talking about--this call for drilling in areas that are protected is a hoax. It is an absolute hoax on the part of the Republicans and this administration. 
   Another quote from Speaker Pelosi, If you don't agree with that, my colleagues, just call (202) 224-3121 and voice your concern about a quote like that.     
   But listen to this. Look at this quote that Ms. Pelosi, our distinguished Speaker, gave on one of the national news networks a week or so ago when she was asked: ``Why not drill? Why not open up these areas?'' After all, the United States owns this source of fossil fuel, both natural gas and petroleum. Her quote then was: ``I'm trying to save the planet.'' I think she actually banged the table and repeated it. ``I'm trying to save the planet.'' 
   Well, so is this guy Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. His quote was: ``We're better off without cheap oil. We're better off without cheap gas.'' 
   So what they want to do is save the planet, but I fear, Mr. Speaker, that in the process they'll be destroying this country. 
   With that, I am going to yield to my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, a champion who has been back on this floor for most of the August recess, not just for a day or two. In fact, she led the Republicans on several occasions, and she does such a great job. At this time, I'm honored to yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, VIRGINIA FOXX.

   Also, I want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that the leader of the Senate, the Senate majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, said fossil fuel is poison, that fossil fuel is poison and that we need to completely rid ourselves of that by, I think, the year 2012. So I just wanted to point that out. 
   I yield back to the gentlewoman.

   Mr. GINGREY. In reclaiming my time just for a second before yielding back to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, what she is talking about, Mr. Speaker, is an energy trust fund that could be, as she pointed out, obtained from royalties that the Federal Government gets from the oil companies--Big Oil, the Democrats use that pejorative constantly--but they would have to pay significant royalties to the Federal Government, which, as Ms. Foxx pointed out, would be put in a trust fund to have grants for research and development for alternative sources such as wind and solar and other things. 
   I'll continue to yield to the gentlewoman.

   Mr. GINGREY. I want to thank again the gentlewoman from North Carolina, who did a wonderful job, I think, of explaining what has not been going on in this body. 
   And I think it's important for the American people to understand something. When the Democratic minority back in the 2006 election cycle, Mr. Speaker, when they were campaigning--this is campaign season now; so 2 years ago they were in the minority and talked about the ``do-nothing,'' ``do-nothing'' Republican majority and made statements such as, well, they are only here 3 days a week, only here in Washington doing the people's business, passing laws that need to be passed, these Republicans, these ``lazy'' Republicans was the characterization, Mr. Speaker, of the then Republican majority. They are only up here 3 days a week, not doing anything, not doing the people's work, and when we get the majority, we promise to do the people's work. And indeed, Mr. Speaker, you weren't here at that particular time,  but the statement was we will go to a 5-day work week like everybody else across America, and, indeed, some people work 6 and 7 days a week and they have two jobs, not one. So this idea of coming and doing the people's work, that sounded good to me. I liked that. 
   Now, keep in mind what has happened since the Democrats have gained the majority. The people gave them that confidence, gave them that trust and said okay, that sounds good to us, and they gained the majority. Well, what have they done? Well, let me just say that we are now back in session here in September, the second week in September. And we are going to be here, including today, and this day is almost gone, it's 10:30 at night--Mr. Speaker, we are going to be here 15 days. Now, we are going to be here 15 days. Maybe it will turn out to be 12 or 10. But the Democratic majority says that we are going to be 15 days, 5 days this week, 5 days next week, and 5 days the following week. Ladies and gentlemen, that's 15 days out of 5 months. 
   Remember now, the whole month of August and the first week in September, we were on recess, and the Democratic majority, Mr. Speaker, has already emphatically said that we want our Members to go home and be in their districts and campaign for re-election or whatever and we are not coming back until the next Congress, until the 111th Congress in January after the new President is inaugurated. I mean it's just unbelievable. 
   Now think about it. Mr. Speaker, if the American public were watching our proceedings tonight and they heard what I'm saying to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 15 days in 5 months, that's deplorable. If that's what we are going to do, if that's what we have resorted to in this Congress, then this ought to be a part-time job. This shouldn't be a full-time job. That's fine with me. If you want to make it a part-time job, I will go back home and start delivering babies again 6 months out of the year. 
   But let me just use a word that I think most of my colleagues understand: This is the height of mendacity. This is the height of hypocrisy to make that kind of promise and then not deliver to the American people. Ms. Foxx talked about it, Representative Foxx, Representative Keller. 
   And Representative Keller is still with us, and I would be happy to yield to him for further thoughts or comments that he may have on this issue. We only have about 10 minutes left, but let me yield back to my friend from Florida.

   As I was saying, of course, Mr. Speaker, 15 days in the last 5 months, and you look at the schedule for this week, and there is unbelievably nothing, nothing on the agenda that has anything to do with energy. 
   We are going to have two bills, one I guess on Thursday and one on Friday or maybe Wednesday and Thursday. One of them is the No Child Left Inside Act of 2008 to reauthorize the National Environmental Education Act to help improve the quality of environmental education for primary and secondary school students. And then if you think that one's important, H.R. 3667, the Missisquoi and Trout Rivers Wild and Scenic River Study Act of 2008, authorizes $300,000 for a study of a segment of the Missisquoi River in Vermont for potential designation as Wild and Scenic. Not only does H.R. 3667 not create more American energy, but it might actually prevent future energy exploration along the river like the siting of a liquefied natural gas plant as an example. 
   And the other 2 days we are doing nothing but suspension bills, and those suspension bills are the ones that you have to have a two-thirds vote. There is little opposition to those bills, and yet they are given 20 minutes of debate on each side, 40 minutes on each of these suspension bills to make it look like we're doing something up here. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I will say that the Democratic majority has done some things since they took control. In January, 2007, when the price of regular gasoline was $2.22, that date we congratulated the U.S. Santa Barbara soccer team. And then on September 5, when the price of regular had gone to $2.84, that was National Passport Month. February 6, 2008, when the price of regular had gone to $3.03, we were commending the Houston Dynamo soccer team. Then on May 14, 2008, the price of regular $3.77, that was National Train Day. Then on May 20, 2008, regular gasoline $3.84 a gallon, that was Great Cats and Rare Canids Act. Really important. On June 10, 2008, the price of regular $4.09 a gallon, the International Year of Sanitation bill. Really important. And then last but not least, June 17, 2008, when the price of regular had gotten up to $4.14, that was the Monkey Safety Act day. We were doing some things all right. We were really working hard up here. 
   Well, look, the bottom line is this: We have a bill. The Republicans have a bill. We have a comprehensive bill. Yes, the cornerstone is ``Drill Here, Drill Now.'' But this is the all-of-the-above approach to energy independence, and that's what we have to have, not only for our domestic needs but for the security of this Nation. And I commend our nominee for President, John McCain, and our nominee for Vice President, Sarah Palin, because they understand we need to drill on the Outer Continental Shelf. And we will have a Vice President who is from an energy State and understands the importance of those resources that we own. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, we want to do things in a bipartisan way. And in closing, I know we are getting very close to that hour, but in closing let me just say this: We can work together. We can work together. I know I spent a lot of time up here railing tonight against Speaker Pelosi, but I respect her. She is the Speaker of this House not just for the Democrats but also for the Republicans. We respect her. We respect the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the distinguished Mr. John Dingell from Michigan.     
   He knows about this country and its needs. Why can't we get together, Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton, and let's have a bill that is comprehensive, a little give and take on both sides of the aisle, because it's for the American people, and let's worry more about them than the next election. The next election, Mr. Speaker, will take care of itself. Let the people judge on that. 
   I am going to tell you, when you go back home I am hearing from my constituents, and I know everybody in this House Chamber is hearing from their  constituents. We can do it. It's time. It's time to do it, and it's time to do it now. 
   I think it would be unconscionable if we go home 3 weeks from now and we have not done this. I am willing to stay. I am willing to stay, and 134, maybe even 194 Republicans, and hopefully some good, rock solid Democrats will stay with us this time until we get an energy bill done in a comprehensive, bipartisan way.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Republican motion to instruct the conferees on the 2008 Department of Defense authorization act. 
   Madam Speaker, as we adjourned for the Thanksgiving recess, we witnessed something remarkable. We witnessed the Democratic majority, in working to mollify their liberal base one more time before the Thanksgiving recess, come to the floor pounding their fist declaring that we must not give our troops additional funding without congressional mandated withdrawal guidelines. They recycled the same old rhetoric, seemingly oblivious to the facts on the ground. 
   Thankfully, the direction of our efforts in the global war on terror is being guided by General Petraeus and others who do understand the momentum that we have garnered; that violence between Sunnis and Shiites has nearly disappeared from Baghdad, with terrorist bombings down 77 percent; that attacks against United States soldiers have fallen to levels not seen since before the February 2006 bombing of the Shiite shrine in Samarra; that United States casualties in Iraq are at their lowest level since March of 2006; and that many military analysts, including some who are opposed to the war, have concluded that the United States and its allies are on the verge of winning in Iraq. 
   Indeed, Madam Speaker, the distinguished chairman of the Defense Authorization Appropriations Subcommittee just returned from Iraq, and he declared that the surge is finally working. I reference Mr. Murtha from Pennsylvania. 
   Madam Speaker, this is something the other side doesn't like to discuss, victory in the global war on terror. That is tough to squeeze in with the defeatist rhetoric recited to appease MoveOn.org and Code Pink. 
   Another thing the Democratic majority never discusses are the consequences of failure, and they have been discussed this morning on our side.     
   That is why this motion to instruct is so important, Madam Speaker. It is critical that the House accept Senate provision 1536 and recognize that failure in Iraq would mean a collapse of a democratic Iraqi Government, likely leading to mass killings and genocide in that nation; certainly emboldening al Qaeda; regional instability; Iran and Syria determining the course of Iraq's future; and Israel being pushed into the Mediterranean Sea, just as Ahmadinejad called for. 
   These are the consequences of defeat and these are the reasons why Congress must commit to a strategy that will not leave a failed state in Iraq and why Congress must not pass, indeed, not pass legislation that risks demoralizing and undermining our military, as they are indeed on the verge of victory in Iraq. 
   So, Madam Speaker, the Democrats are zero for 40 in trying to compel this precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. With this motion to instruct, I ask them for once to get on the right side. Join not just the Republicans, but, more importantly, our brave men and women in the military, and give victory a chance. 
   Madam Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues, let's vote ``yes'' on the motion to instruct.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to offer an amendment to H.R. 6599, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2009, and to ask my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   A little over a month ago, property rights advocates across the country spoke out on the third anniversary of the now infamous Kelo decision by the Supreme Court.     
   I, along with Representative Maxine Waters of California, Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, mark the date  by introducing a resolution that expresses congressional support for the private property rights protections guaranteed by the fifth amendment to the Constitution. 
   Today, we in the Congress have an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to the preservation of these rights. My amendment would ensure that none of the Federal funds appropriated by this act can be used in the taking of private property without just compensation. 
   Ideally, Mr. Chairman, eminent domain should never have to be used, but even the Constitution provides for its application in instances involving public use, such as construction of a road or a public school. Public use also includes the common defense, which is a central focus of the Military Construction and Veterans' Affairs Appropriations bill. Accordingly, from time to time the needs of our military may require the use of eminent domain. However, even when the Federal Government exercises the power of eminent domain on behalf of the military, private property owners must always receive just compensation. 
   The taking of private property is among the toughest decisions a government should ever have to make. A government should only make that decision when it is absolutely necessary and only after working with property owners to try to reach a mutual agreement. 
   The sanctity of private property rights and the security they afford are among the greatest blessings this country offers its citizens. Individual liberty and freedom are at the very root of our property rights and therefore we must ensure that these rights are never abused and they are always protected. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, it seems the protections of the fifth amendment do not apply to the wallets of hardworking Americans who are now struggling at the gas pump. The inaction of this Congress to address in a real way these historically high gas prices, I believe, also constitutes unjustified taking, but it seems that this Congress has little interest in justly compensating the American consumer by increasing domestic energy production, creating new American jobs, and lowering the price of gasoline. In fact, it seems to me the fear of even a vote on domestic energy production has led the Democratic majority to essentially shut down the appropriations process, the process with which we fund the entirety of our Federal Government, from the Pentagon to the schoolhouses across the country. 
   With only 17 legislative days left until the next fiscal year, seven of the 12 appropriations bills have not even been considered by the full Appropriations Committee, and this is the first appropriations bill considered on the House floor. So while Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership continue to refuse pleas for at least a vote on increasing domestic supply and lowering the price of gasoline, House Republicans will continue to fight to open up American energy and to prevent the unjust taking occurring every day at the gas pump. 
   From wallets to homesteads to family businesses, this Congress has an obligation to protect the property rights of all Americans. So I again call upon my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1585, NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and the conference report for Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act, and I would certainly like to commend Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member Hunter for standing strong throughout conference negotiations and representing us so well during these proceedings. 
   Madam Speaker, I think it proves, as my colleague from Washington just stated, Mr. Hastings, that we can, when we put our heads together and have that cooperative spirit, we can do things in a bipartisan manner, and I commend Chairman Skelton and his excellent staff for making that happen. Certainly, I want to thank Subcommittee Chairman Neil Abercrombie, as well as Ranking Member Jim Saxton, as well as all the conferees for the hard work in getting this legislation before the floor. The staff of the Armed Services Committee, as I say, deserves our thanks for their tireless efforts in support of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who are bravely defending us both at home and abroad. 
   Madam Speaker, as we move toward adjournment, it's essential that we pass this legislation, which covers an extensive range of issues that are so vitally important to our Armed Services. From a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise to an additional $17.6 billion for MRAP vehicles, mine resistant ambush protected vehicles, this legislation addresses the most pressing needs of our troops during a most trying time for America. I am further pleased that the bill provides for an increase of 13,000 Army and 9,000 Marine personnel, active duty personnel, and at a time when our Guard and Reserve forces have been so heavily utilized, it appropriately includes Guard empowerment provisions. 
   Madam Speaker, although I do remain concerned about the overall underfunding of missile defense and the lack of full funding for our European missile defense site, I am thankful that the conferees significantly restored funds for certain critical missile defense programs. I am also proud, as my colleague from Washington State made note, that the Wounded Warrior legislation is included in this conference report, which will help our injured heroes as they face challenges encountered on their long road to recovery. 
   Additionally, the legislation authorizes $189.4 billion in supplemental funding to support current operations in the global war on terror, and it fittingly recognizes the dangers posed by a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq. By providing increased funding for force protection and for the repair and replacement of battle-worn equipment, this legislation authorizes the necessary supplemental funding to give our deployed soldiers the resources they need to continue taking the fight to the terrorists. 
   I am further very pleased with the work the committee has done this year to authorize funding of 20 F-22 Raptors, in line with the current multiyear contract. The F-22, Madam Speaker, is the world's most capable fighter, and these funds will go a long way towards providing stability for our forces and ensuring that America does maintain air dominance for the foreseeable future. 
   Madam Speaker, section 1257 of the conference report affirms the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, acronym WHINSEC, as an invaluable education and training facility which the Department of Defense should continue to utilize in order to promote security cooperation with Latin American countries. I proudly serve, along with my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, Ms. Sanchez from California, we serve on the Board of Visitors for WHINSEC, and have for a number of years, Madam Speaker, and know how important that is, important for my colleagues to remember that WHINSEC may be the only medium we have to engage future military and political leaders of these Latin American countries. If we were not to engage with these nations in this way, the void created would be filled by countries with different values than our own regarding democracy and, yes, human rights, countries such as Venezuela and China, whose influence in the region is growing. Therefore, I am so proud that Congress stands behind WHINSEC. 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to again recognize our fallen soldiers. A brave young man from my district who heroically gave his life for our country, Sergeant Paul Saylor from Bremen, Georgia, his remains were not able to be viewed for a final time upon being returned to his family 2 years ago. 
   Last year's authorization bill, H.R. 5122, included a provision which requires that all medical personnel be trained in remains preservation to ensure that these fallen heroes get the dignity and respect they deserve. This is the least that we can do for the families as they are grieving so much. I would like to thank my colleagues for following up on this measure by honoring my request for a report on this program in this year's bill, and I want to certainly take an opportunity to thank Paul's parents, Jamie and Patti Saylor, for their help in this regard. 
   Madam Speaker, there is much to be proud of in this bill. I again commend Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their efforts to keep this bill focused on the needs of the warfighter. In this spirit, I urge all my colleagues in these days ahead, let's abandon any defeatist rhetoric and any partisan bickering which only serves to demoralize our troops and, yes, to embolden the enemy. We must stand united in providing our troops every needed resource and send a strong message to these terrorists and our allies that the resolve of our great Nation is stronger than it has ever been. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of the rule and the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise for the second time during this 36-hour marathon to strongly oppose this, I almost want to say, meaningless resolution, Mr. Speaker. But make no mistake about it, this is not a meaningless resolution. The consequences of failure in Iraq are drastic, and let me just read to you what some of those are. 
   Number one, collapse of a democratic Iraqi government, likely, very likely leading to mass killings and genocide in the nation. 
   Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups would use this defeat to boost recruitment. They would use Iraq as a staging ground for deadly attacks paid for with Iraqi oil revenue. 
   Iran and Syria would exert tremendous influence over the region. You think they are bad actors now, you just wait until this scenario plays out. And, indeed, and they have said that Israel would be pushed into the sea. 
   Mr. Speaker, the real Democratic plan is coming later. And if you don't believe me, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle just read a recent article this week in Roll Call. I am not going to stand up here and read it to the Members. You can read it. 
   But the Progressive Caucus of the House Democratic Conference, the Out of Iraq Caucus of the House Democratic Conference, led by Ms. Woolsey and Ms. Waters, basically say that this is just the first step. They say that in this op ed article. This resolution is not meaningless. It is the first step, my colleagues, toward cutting off funding for the troops and pulling the rug out from under them. 
   What does this say then to our brave fighting men and women who are trying to defend this country? We have heard over and over again from the other side that, ``Look, we can't afford this war anymore. It is costing too much in lives and money. We are making too big a commitment there, and we need to bring our troops home because some other conflict may break out in this world.'' 
   Well, I say, Mr. Speaker, to my colleagues. What is more important than the current war? What indeed are we going to save our troops for? Working the rope lines at 4th of July parades, helping senior citizens cross the street? We have got to stop this and stop it now. 
   And listen to what the terrorists themselves say about the message that that would send. And this is a quote, Mr. Speaker, from bin Laden himself: ``Hostility toward America is a religious duty, and I am confident that Muslims will be able to end the legend of the so-called superpower that is America.'' 
   His top deputy, bin Laden's deputy Zawahiri, says, ``The Jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals. The first stage: Expel the Americans from Iraq.'' 
   Make no mistake about this. What we are doing with this resolution is not a salute to GI Joe, it is a capitulation to Jihadist Joe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind the previous speaker that this body and the other body passed a spending bill for our veterans increasing by $4 billion over 3 months ago, and the President made very clear, emphatically stating that he was ready to sign that bill to get this money to our veterans, and the Democratic leadership has made a decision, for whatever reason, not to send that bill to the President. So I think it's important to point that out. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in opposition to the rule and to the underlying bill in its present form. In regard to the rule, I can't expound and do any better than the comments that the senior Republican long-term member of the Rules Committee has just outlined, the gentleman from Florida. That stack of 11 bills in this omnibus sitting in front of the gentleman from Florida is almost as large as the Internal Revenue Code, which I understand is as thick as nine Bibles. Mr. Speaker, that's probably as thick as at least six Bibles, and every rule has been waived. And all this business about earmark reform, it makes a total mockery of that. So, Mr. Speaker, from the standpoint of the rule, absolutely I am opposed to it. 
   We need earmark reform. I have submitted legislation to cut earmarks by 50 percent immediately and then 1 percent of discretionary spending in the subsequent year and to say that no Member of this body, no matter how powerful, should have a larger bite at the apple in regard to Member-directed initiatives, or what the general public, who's so outraged at that process, knows as pork and/or earmarks. 
   In regard to the bill itself, my colleagues, I'm sure, hopefully on both sides of the aisle, will be opposed to this omnibus because there's not one penny, Mr. Speaker, not one penny of money for our troops in Iraq. That in itself is a reason why absolutely I would be opposed to this omnibus. But, Mr. Speaker, there's more. There is much more when we look into the weeds and finally see some of the things in these bills. 
   Last year this body voted to strike language from the energy and water bill that would not allow the Corps of Engineers to update manuals in regard to how they control water releases from certain dams in the Southeast where we are suffering from a severe drought, Mr. Speaker. And yet this same language now is stuck in on the Senate side, and it's in this omnibus bill that would prohibit the Corps of Engineers from updating these 25-year-old manuals, making the drought in the Southeast worse than it has ever been. And, Mr. Speaker, I want to point out the fact that in this body last year when we voted to remove that language from those bills, Speaker Pelosi voted to remove the language; Majority Leader Hoyer voted to remove the language; Appropriations Chairman Obey voted to remove the language; Minority Leader Boehner voted to remove the language; and every subcommittee chairman on the Appropriations Committee, the so-called cardinals on the Democratic side, voted to remove that language. Now it's in there sort of air-dropped on the Senate side. 
   There are other things in here, Mr. Speaker, that I am so much opposed to. There's increased funding for title X, almost $17 million for Planned Parenthood and abortion providers, but there's no increased funding for critical abstinence education, which goes a long way to ensure that abortion services wouldn't be needed, Mr. Speaker. 
   There is $2.9 billion in here, Mr. Speaker, to provide for security on our southern border, to build that fence that this body has called for; yet there are all kinds of restrictions. In fact, the committee says 15 conditions have to be met before this money can be spent on 300 or 400 miles of fencing on our southern border that we so desperately need, and at the same time there's millions of dollars in this omnibus, Mr. Speaker, that provides legal defense funds to defend illegal immigrants who are in this country. I just don't quite understand the logic of that, Mr. Speaker. 
   I am sure my colleagues are as confused as I am over this gimmick of advanced appropriations. But how does this body say that we are going to spend $2.4 billion additional money on Labor-HHS and say that we are not going to count it against this year's appropriation, that it's going to be counted in 2009, this so-called advanced appropriation? Is it an emergency, Mr. Speaker, to spend $100 million to provide security at the upcoming Republican and Democratic National Conventions? Is that, my colleagues, what we would call money that needs to be spent in an emergency? 
   And last but not least, Mr. Speaker, I put language in an appropriation bill that would not allow funding for States that mandate that our little girls in the fourth and fifth grade, our 9-, 10-, 11-year-old children, could not attend public school unless they receive a shot against human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted disease, not a communicable disease like measles, mumps, and whooping cough. Unfortunately, this funding is allowed in this omnibus, but my language is removed. 
   So for many, many reasons, my colleagues, vote ``no'' against the rule and vote ``no'' against this bill when it comes to us in its present form.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (REPORT ON IRAQ BY GENERAL PETRAEUS -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the gentlewoman from Texas who just preceded me stated, we just completed a memorial dedication remembrance ceremony on the steps of the Capitol as Members on both sides of the aisle came together led by our distinguished Speaker, our distinguished majority leader, and our distinguished minority leader. We came together in a very bipartisan way to once again pay tribute to the lives that were lost, indeed, and to their families, and to our first responders and the lives that were lost on their part and, of course, the City of New York on that great tragic day, that  great tragedy that occurred 6 years ago today, Mr. Speaker. 
   Before we went to the steps, the majority leader made a statement to our colleagues on this floor, which I fully support and endorse. I paraphrase his comments, but basically what Mr. Hoyer said to us, just a few minutes ago, was that the terrorists, the extremists, those who hate our way of life and hate everything about this country, our great country, brought us to our knees, but they didn't bring us down. And they will never bring us down. 
   I absolutely agree that it showed the resolve of the American people that they can't bring us down. They got our attention, absolutely. And, Mr. Speaker, today, of course, also is the day that General Petraeus, the commander of Multinational Force Iraq, the four-star general, the combatant commander on the ground in Iraq, along with our ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker, gave their report to the American Congress, to the House of Representatives, they will do the same thing over the next couple of days to the Senate, and directed this report to the House Armed Services Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, there were 111 Members of those two respective committees present for this hearing today, which went on almost 7 hours. It was an opportunity for Members on both sides of the aisle to come together to listen carefully to a report that we mandated in our emergency supplemental spending bill that was passed March of this year, some 6 months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, the thing that bothered me about this report was that in this town, last week, in this Congress, indeed, we heard nothing but negative comments about the messenger and what he might bring in regard to this report to suggest that it would be less than honest. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times today ran an article that basically showed a picture of General Petraeus and said, underneath the caption of that picture, General Petraeus is General Betray Us, to suggest, Mr. Speaker, that this general, our combatant commander of Multinational Force Iraq, would lie to the American people for some political advantage. 
   At this time, Mr. Speaker, I want to yield to my friend from Mississippi. I think that he may have a copy with him of that particular ad. I will be happy now to yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).

Now, at the bottom, you can't see the fine print, but moveon.org disavows itself from any political affiliation. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to give the Members of this body an opportunity to repudiate that ad. I have introduced a resolution. I understand our leadership on the Republican side will have a resolution to just say to the Members, please, in a bipartisan way, this cannot stand, and we cannot tolerate this.

   You know, this situation with the ad that the gentleman from Mississippi so kindly brought to the floor so all of our colleagues who may not have seen it in the newspaper this morning would have an opportunity to know exactly of what we are speaking about tonight, the gentleman from Tennessee suggested that sometimes people want somebody else to do their dirty work. 
   Mr. Speaker, look at this first slide to my left. Here is the quote: ``No one wants to call Petraeus a liar on national TV, noted one Democratic Senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The expectation is that the outside groups will do this for us.'' 
   This was last week, an anonymous Democratic Senator being interviewed by Politico.com. 
   Well, lo and behold, it looks like one these outside groups indeed are doing the dirty work of calling General Petraeus ``General Betray Us.'' How despicable. 
   As I said just a few minutes earlier, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a gentleman, a patriot, a great leader who has served this country honorably and selflessly for over 35 years. He has risked his life in combat. He accepted lengthy deployments away from his family to defend our Nation and its citizens from its enemies. 
   For this, Mr. Speaker, he deserves the respect, the admiration and gratitude of every single American, and not disgraceful slander from despicable groups like moveon.org. Is that Phil Gingrey coming up with an original statement? No. I am quoting Senator JOE LIEBERMAN. God bless Senator Lieberman.

   I want to bring my colleagues' attention to the next poster I have got. I am going to give two quotes, one from General Petraeus from the hearing today and the other from Ambassador Crocker. 
   First from General Petraeus: ``To summarize, the security situation in Iraq is improving, and Iraqi elements are slowly taking on more of the responsibility for protecting their citizens. Innumerable challenges lie ahead. However, coalition and Iraqi security forces have made progress towards achieving sustainable security. As a result, the United States will be in a position to reduce its forces in Iraq in the months ahead.'' That was from the testimony of General David Petraeus. Later in the hour we will talk a little more about specific recommendations for troop withdrawal that General Petraeus made. 
   I will read that quote from Ambassador Crocker in just a minute, but at this point I see my friend from Mississippi is still with us, and I would like to yield to him, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. The gentleman is right, I was having a little trouble finding that poster because I don't have that poster; but I do have a smaller copy of it. I guess you would call this a slide, Mr. Speaker. 
   But I did want to read this quote from the testimony of Ambassador Crocker before I call on my colleague, Colonel John Kline. Here is what Ambassador Crocker said: ``A secure, stable democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbors is attainable. In my judgment, the cumulative trajectory of political, economic and diplomatic developments in Iraq is upwards, although the slope of that line is not steep. The process will not be quick. It will be uneven, punctuated by setbacks as well as achievements, and it will require substantial United States resolve and commitment.'' 
   I think the ambassador and General Petraeus served this country extremely well today in their testimony, and their facts were accurate. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I want to yield to my colleague on the House Armed Services Committee, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Kline).

   Mr. GINGREY. The point you made, of course, about the Iraqi national police, General Jones, you're right. I was in that same hearing with Representative Kline last week, Mr. Speaker, and General Jones did talk about this Iraqi national police force of about 25,000 that in the past was rife with corruption, and of course, a lot of changes in the leadership, as General Petraeus pointed out today, that has occurred. 
   But I think it's important, and I think Mr. Kline would agree with me, for our colleagues to understand that the press in the last week, talking about the Jones report, suggested that the entire Iraqi security force was incompetent and corrupt when, indeed, 49,000 is only about 10 percent of the 550,000 Iraqi national army and combined police force. So many of them are doing a good job, as you pointed out in the hearing today.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would have time to stay, I would be glad to yield back to him as we go forward, but absolutely this Jones report last week, I couldn't believe what I was reading the next day after hearing the report and hearing General Jones, retired Four-Star General Jones, Marine, former Marine commandant, and Colonel Kline, a Marine, knows him well. He was one of 20 members of that commission. 
   Again, this commission was created by the Congress, by the new majority, as we passed that emergency supplemental spending bill back in February or March, 6 or 8 months ago, to tell us, you know, what's the situation with the Iraqi security force, both army and the police, and not just, as we pointed out earlier, the national police. 
   And almost to a person, the members of that panel who spoke, not all 20 did, but they gave encouraging news. They pointed out the shortcomings, of course, of the national police and the Iraqi police force that was not perfect. They didn't give us some Pollyanna, glossed-over, varnished report. They told the truth. But as Colonel Kline points out, I thought it was an encouraging report. Of course, you would never have known it, Mr. Speaker, by the headlines the next day. So the gentleman may want to comment on that.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman again. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield to one of my colleagues, another of my colleagues I should say, on the House Armed Services Committee, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight Investigation, a new subcommittee, a good subcommittee chaired by my good friend, majority member Dr. Vic Snyder, and I'm speaking of the gentleman from Missouri, Representative Todd Akin, and at this time I'd yield to the gentleman from Missouri.

   Mr. GINGREY. Light at the end of the tunnel, indeed. The gentleman is right on target. 
   As we conclude this Special Order hour, I want my colleagues to take a good look at this ad that ran today in the New York Times. 
   I know it's hard for the Members to actually see the text, or you can see the picture; but, basically, what it says, the caption is: ``General Petraeus or General Betray Us?'' With a big question mark. Then under that: ``Cooking the books for the White House.'' 
   The first and last paragraph, I will quote, let me read this to you, this is what MoveOn.org, a political action committee says.

   Mr. GINGREY. I hope not, I say to the gentleman from Missouri. I think if you look at their funding trail though you would find that they haven't contributed probably too much support in any way, shape, or form to Republican Members. 
   But hears what they say about General Petraeus: ``General Petraeus is a military man constantly at war with the facts. In 2004, just before the election, he said there was 'tangible progress' in Iraq and that `Iraqi leaders are stepping forward.' 
   ``And last week Petraeus, the architect of the escalation of troops in Iraq, said `We say we have achieved progress, and we are obviously going to do everything we can to build on that progress.' '' 
   Then their final paragraph, I skipped the middle one, they say: ``Most importantly, General Petraeus will not admit what everyone knows: Iraq is mired in an unwinnable religious civil war. We may hear of a plan to withdraw a few thousand American troops. 
   ``But we won't hear what Americans are desperate to hear: a timetable for withdrawing all our troops, General Petraeus has actually said, will need to stay in Iraq for as long as 10 years.'' 
   Finally, they say, MoveOn.org, today, before Congress and before the American people, General Petraeus is likely to become General Betray Us. 
   In conclusion, as the majority leader said a few minutes ago, before we walked out on the steps, to commemorate and honor the American people on the sixth anniversary of that tragedy of 9/11, we did that in a bipartisan way. This is not a political argument that we bring to the floor tonight, and this business, if we are winning in Iraq, the Democrats lose. If we are losing in Iraq, the Democrats win. If we are winning in Iraq, the Republicans win. This is not about who wins politically. This is for the American people. 
   We are going to win. We are going to let victory have a chance. We are not just simply blindly staying the course. 
   In regard to this surge, this is exactly what the Iraq Study Group, Lee Hamilton and former Secretary James Baker, recommended to the Congress; and this is what the President has done. 
   I commend him for it. I think we are making progress; but there is, indeed, as the gentleman from Missouri said, light at the end of the tunnel, a bright light. We need to give victory a chance.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me before he yields to the gentleman from New Mexico, because as I join this hour Special Order and I am hearing from my colleagues, some of the brightest minds and best speakers on our side of the aisle, I don't think I could stand to go behind all four of them. So I am happy to have the opportunity. But it's awfully tough following my colleagues of the likes of the chairman of 
   the Policy Committee and part of our leadership. 
   But I wanted quickly, Mr. Speaker, to again pay tribute to General Petraeus and also Ambassador Ryan Crocker. I just want to point out, in regard to Ambassador Crocker, I was reading his bio before they testified before our two committees today, the 6 1/2 - to 7-hour testimony, physically an ordeal, but Ambassador Ryan Crocker, I think a lot of people, Mr. Speaker, don't know his bio, and I don't have time to read it all. But suffice to say that in September 2004 President Bush conferred on Ambassador Ryan Crocker the personal rank of career ambassador, career ambassador, the highest rank in the foreign service. This is the character of the man and the men that presented this report to us today. 
   And, basically, we cut right to the chase, and what they said is, now is not the time to quit, and give victory a chance. You can slice it and dice it any way you want to, but that is basically what they said to the 111 members of those two committees, the House Armed Services Committee, the House Committee on Foreign Relations. 
   And so I just want to make three points, though, Mr. Speaker, that I have thought about and that I have heard in the last couple of weeks on reasons that I have heard Members give for wanting to give up and not give victory a chance. 
   One of them was this business of, well, you know, it has been too great a strain and stress on our forces. We don't have enough troops back home. What if some other conflagration, war, would break out somewhere in the world in the next year, 2 years, 5 years? We don't have enough troops. We need to bring them home. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, retired General Jack Keane, the Vice Chairman of the United States Army, Vice Chief of Staff, spoke to us last week as well, and he also spoke on Saturday morning on Washington Journal. I hope some of my colleagues saw that. But what General Keane said, and I agree with him so much, is, You mean to tell me that you want to accept defeat? You want to lose the war, a war of this magnitude, as the gentleman from Tennessee pointed out, and what all is at stake in regard to the Middle East in this global war on terror? You want to give up that war so that you can bring the troops home and then restock and get ready for the next potential conflict and that's a good trade-off? I don't think so. 
   And I want to say another thing, Mr. Speaker, that I have heard a lot of people say: We can't afford this war. We cannot afford to spend $750 billion, almost $1 trillion and counting, on this war because we need to rebuild our infrastructure in our country. We need to shore up our bridges. Obviously, that was in the news because of the tragic occurrence in Minnesota. Or we need more money for Head Start, or we need more money for K-12 education, or we need more Pell Grants, or we need to have more money for the food stamp program and the farm bill or whatever you can come up with. 
   Let me tell my colleagues, if you don't spend the money to protect the American people, what good do all these other things do us when you see what can happen and did 6 years ago today on 9/11 when over 3,000 were killed and the economic blow to this country was over $2 trillion? You talk about destroying some infrastructure. That's what it's all about when you let your guard down and you don't stand up and be secure in this country. 
   And last but not least, I have heard many say, well, you know, our troops are coming home injured and many of them are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or syndrome. That's where you wake up at night, having nightmares, and maybe for the rest of your life you can't get over the mental trauma that you have gone through in a time of difficult war. 
   Well, let me tell you something my colleagues, as a physician Member of this body. You talk about post-traumatic stress syndrome. You think a lot of them are coming back with that now? You think that that is a tragedy? Well, you just wait and see the numbers that come back with mental illness and post-traumatic stress syndrome and nightmares and a life of anxiety when they have to come back knowing that their comrades in arms have died in vain, their buddies in the foxhole have been blown to smithereens by some improvised explosive device and they have to come home a loser. And we are not going to let that happen, and I think that is what General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were telling us today: let's give victory a chance. 
   With that I will say, finally, as I conclude, who wins politically? Who cares. The American people lose if we lose in Iraq. That is what is important. This is not about the next election; this is about giving victory a chance.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5719, TAXPAYER ASSISTANCE AND SIMPLIFICATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule and the underlying bill, H.R. 5719. 
   As we are all aware, today is April 15, and once again Americans from all  across this land and from all walks of life must fork over their hard-earned income to the IRS. So to ease the burden on the taxpayer, the House Democratic leadership, under a closed rule, no opportunity for amendment, brings up this so-called Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, anyone who takes a good, hard look at the language in the bill, they might not think today is April 15 but rather April Fools Day. In fact, this legislation should really be entitled the ``Tax Evader Assistance and Simplification Act.'' 
   For example, this legislation will provide assistance to those who just don't feel like paying their taxes by eliminating a successful debt collection program that my friend from Texas just mentioned. Instead of lowering taxes for hardworking Americans of over half a billion dollars, this majority would rather give a tax break to these tax evaders to the tune, Mr. Speaker, of about $600 million. 
   And, unfortunately, to pay for these tax-evader protections, this bill targets what? Health Savings Accounts and the millions of Americans who are trying to take control of their own health care decisions. This legislation will cost those Americans who use HSAs, as my children do, nearly $500 million. It effectively works to destroy market-based solutions in order to force government-run health care down the throats of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier that this bill makes today seem more like April Fools Day. Well, that moniker already belongs to April 1; so perhaps we can just call today ``Thank a Congressional Democrat Day.'' 
   I would say to the American people if they are happy that this Congress today will basically give away $600 million to tax evaders, thank a congressional Democrat. 
   If they are happy with the fact that this Congress has done nothing to repeal the deplorable death tax, thank a congressional Democrat. 
   If they are happy with the fact that this Congress has refused time after time to extend the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 when our economy needs it most, thank a congressional Democrat. 
   If they are happy with the fact this Congress has for 2 straight years passed budgets that included the largest tax increase in United States history, thank a congressional Democrat. 
   And if they look forward to the prospect of writing an even bigger check to the IRS next year than they did this year, well, you guessed it, they can thank a congressional Democrat. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again ask all my colleagues, Democrat and Republican, to oppose this rule so this bill can be amended to provide real assistance to the American taxpayer. But if this rule passes, I call upon them to oppose the underlying ``Tax Evader Protection and Simplification Act.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, firmly and resolutely opposed to both this rule and the underlying conference report. 
   I regret to say that the Democratic leaders have once again demonstrated that it is either their way or the highway, except this time it is our fighting men and women who are left stranded in the middle of the road. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am truly saddened and, in truth, even angered by the majority's insistence on putting this war, our generals, and our war fighters on auto pilot with a forced retreat and an inflexible timetable. 
   The consequences of this decision, should it become law, will echo long beyond this date, this year, this decade. Defeat should not be an option, and yet it seems that this majority believes it is the only option. 
   We are at a critical juncture in history when the defenders of liberty and freedom have to stand firm against tyrants and terrorists. 
   And I will remind the gentleman from Virginia that just spoke, indeed, the famous quote says, ``There are times in our history when the tree of liberty must be nourished by the blood of patriots.'' 
   Sure, without question, this war has been hard fought every step of the way, and it will continue to be. But few things worthwhile in life are ever easy. 
   Regrettably, this majority was bought and paid for by MoveOn.org and liberal extremists, and now they have come to collect, unfortunately, at the expense of our military and our security, today, tomorrow, and for decades to come. 
   When the Speaker of the House pushes to rewrite our foreign policy and yet refuses to meet with General Petraeus, our commander on the ground in Iraq, it becomes abundantly clear this majority would rather push left-wing politics over sound policy. 
   This political theater would be funny if its consequences weren't a matter of life and death, of victory and defeat. Every day that we delay a legitimate war-funding bill, the resources of our military and our soldiers' quality of life are diminished. In fact, this delay has forced the Pentagon to move $800 million from the Air Force's personnel accounts, money to pay our servicemembers, to make up for the gaps in the war funding. 
   I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, oppose this rule, oppose this conference report. Let us end this political game and truly give victory a chance. 
   We can do better, Mr. Speaker. We have an obligation to do better for the sake of the men and women who put their lives on the line in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect ours.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Fairbanks Company in Rome, Georgia, which is celebrating their 120th year of manufacturing this year. In fact, the Fairbanks Company is the oldest surviving manufacturer in Floyd County, dating back to the plant's establishment in 1987. 
   Well, much has changed over the past century. The company has seen its original product line of wagon and railroad track scales give way to the current line of hand-trucks, wheels, dollies and platform trucks. In fact, the company was responsible for all of the trucks that serviced the British steamship Queen Mary and S.S. United States. 
   But one thing has not changed over the past 120 years, Mr. Speaker, and that is the company's commitment to quality and community. Indeed, the Fairbanks Company is a critical industry in the Rome community, and the company's leaders and workers take exceptional pride in their product and their work.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask that you join me in congratulating Fairbanks Company on 120 years of industry in the Floyd County community.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008. 
   I would like to say a special thanks to Chairman Skelton, my good friend, and also to Ranking Member Hunter, as well as Subcommittee Chairman Abercrombie and Ranking Member Saxton, for their tireless efforts in support of our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen, and marines who are bravely defending us both at home and abroad. 
   Madam Chairman, while not a perfect bill, this legislation covers a wide scope of issues that are vitally important to our armed services, both active and reserve components, and clearly meets the immediate needs of the warfighter. 
   From a 3.5 percent across-the-board pay raise to an additional $4.1 billion for the MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, this legislation addresses the most pressing needs of our troops during a very, very trying time for this country. I am further pleased that the bill provides for an increase of 13,000 Army and 9,000 Marine Corps active-duty personnel, as well as $1 billion for National Guard equipment. 
   While I applaud the work of the committee in addressing pressing readiness issues, I am very concerned, Madam Chairman, about the deep cuts to missile defense and, of course, the Army Future Combat Systems. A viable missile defense system is critical to deterring and countering emerging threats to our national security, especially as Iran and North Korea develop their nuclear capabilities. I look forward to working with Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter and the rest of the committee as this bill moves forward to address these program needs. 
   I am pleased, however, that the Armed Services Committee voted unanimously on a bipartisan basis to support another program critical to our national security. Madam Chairman, that is section 1243 of this bill. It affirms that WHINSEC, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, is effectively accomplishing its mission and expresses that because of this success, the Department of Defense should continue utilizing this program to promote security cooperation with Latin American countries. 
   Those who have been taking the time to visit WHINSEC at Fort Benning in Columbus understand the critical importance of this program. By virtue of WHINSEC, the United States is able to engage the military and the security forces of Central and South American countries in a forum where they will be able to learn our values regarding democracy and human rights, especially now human rights, while also being trained in counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism tactics. 
   It is so important to remember that this may be the only medium we ever have to engage the future military and political leaders of these Latin American countries, who are America's closest neighbors; and they can serve as  our closest allies. If we were not to engage with these nations, we would be abandoning our most effective means of developing relationships with the security forces of Central and South America. The void created would be filled by countries with different values than our own regarding democracy and human rights, countries, Madam Chairman, such as Venezuela and China, whose influence in the region is growing. And, therefore, I am glad that the Armed Services Committee stands behind WHINSEC. 
   Madam Chairman, there is much to be proud of in this bill, and I again commend Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their efforts to keep this bill focused on the needs of the warfighter, a fact I hope is not lost as we progress through the amendment process. 
   I urge all my colleagues to remember the importance of a strong national defense and to prioritize that over partisan issues which divide us.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (THE HIGH PRICE OF ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady from Minnesota for yielding to me and for my having the opportunity tonight to join my colleagues to discuss what clearly is the most important issue facing our Nation at this particular time. 
   Mr. Speaker, you know my background is that of an OB/GYN physician, and health care has always been a passion of mine. Ever since I got here in the Congress, I've been working on health care legislation in a bipartisan way. Clearly, with 45 million, 47 million uninsured in this country, health care continues to be a very important issue, but when I talk now to my constituents in northwest Georgia, in the 11th District of Georgia, the most important thing to them as we come upon these Presidential and congressional elections in November of this year, without question, is the price of gasoline, and my colleagues have pointed this out so clearly, Mr. Speaker, with the statistics that they have given. 
   Mrs. Bachmann just talked about the fact that the price of a gallon of gasoline, regular gasoline, is about $4.08 a gallon. Disease fuel is even higher than that. People are going to enjoy a 4th of July weekend at home this year, I can assure you, not just in my district in Georgia but across this country. 
   A few minutes ago, Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Iowa was talking about the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. With his words, he was trying to put a picture, a description, in our colleagues' minds of what it looks like. I just happen to have a couple of posters that I want to show my colleagues. If we look at this first poster, I think that a lot of people across this country have received this in their mailbox, this picture as it may have appeared from MoveOn.org or from whoever happened to send this across the Nation, suggesting to people that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge looks like this--some pristine, beautiful area with lots of swans and caribou and moose--and that this is a year-round picture of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
   Really, in fact, if my colleagues will take a look at this second poster, 11 months out of the year, this is what ANWR looks like. It's a frozen tundra. There is nothing there, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, in the area, in the footprint, where we would drill and where there is plenty, plenty of oil. In fact, we estimate there could be 1.5 million barrels a day that we could add to our domestic production by drilling in this very small area, which is, I think, something like 2 square miles. In any regard, it is a very small area. 
   So what we have tried to present to our colleagues in this hour is the fact that we are suffering. Yet there is plenty of oil and natural gas within this country and on our Outer Continental Shelf. There are literally trillions of cubic feet of natural gas off of our east and west coasts. There are probably tens of billions of barrels of petroleum off of our Outer Continental Shelf in addition to that, that I mentioned, in ANWR, up in Alaska. Yet we are just simply doing nothing. 
   I have another poster, my colleagues, I want you to take a look at. This pretty well depicts what this ``do nothing'' Congress has been up to for the last year and a half under this new majority. If you would look at this cartoon, starting over here, I'll read it to you. 
   Now, this is from Congress. It says: We demand you energy companies do something about these high energy prices. Their first answer is: Well, we can drill in ANWR. Congress' response: Forget it. 
   The next cartoon: Well, how about offshore? the Outer Continental Shelf? Congress' response: Are you kidding? 
   The next response from these oil companies: Well, how about clean coal, converting coal to liquid in a clean way? We can come up with millions of gallons of petroleum by doing that. Congress' response: Out of the question. 
   Well, the oil companies say in this next cartoon: Well, how about nuclear power? We haven't licensed a new nuclear power facility for over 30 years in this country, back in the 1970s. You know, nuclear power since then has gotten more sophisticated. It's clean. It's safe. Congress' response: You must be joking. 
   Finally, the energy companies just throw up their hands and say: What? Congress' response: Well, don't just sit there. Do something. 
   Well, it's a cartoon, but it's also very serious. The bottom line is we are spending and have spent for the last 2 years all of our attention worrying about global warming and climate change. Yet here we have seen, in the 17 months that Speaker Pelosi has enjoyed her speakership, this Pelosi premium, and the price of gasoline has gone up about $1.75 a gallon.     
   It is clearly time to get some of these domestic sources on-line, these resources which are right here that we have, rather than continuing to depend on foreign countries, like the OPEC nations, like Venezuela, that are not very friendly to us. And that's, pure and simple, Mr. Speaker, the reason why we're here tonight to say to our colleagues, in a bipartisan way, we ought to do this. 
   And in addition to drilling for oil and natural gas and doing it now, certainly, there are other things, nuclear power, as I mentioned, alternative fuels, solar, wind farms, all of these things are part of the mix. But it is time, and it is time to act now. And that's what real leadership is. And that's what the Republican Party is trying to bring to this Congress and say to our colleagues, look, we have got six bills sitting right over there with discharge petitions which will allow us to do some of these things which will make us energy independent and absolutely will bring down that price of gasoline, almost overnight, because a lot of this is sort of speculation. And people, as soon as they realize that we are going to do something, the price will definitely come down. 
   So I appreciate the opportunity to be with my colleagues tonight. I know there are others here who want to weigh in on this issue, so I want to thank the gentlelady from Minnesota, especially thank her for giving me this time, and I yield back to her.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (EMBRYONIC STEM CELL RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. This is going to be like two discussions, one from the professor and the other one from maybe his first year master's program student. Although I have a M.D., Dr. Bartlett, of course, is a Ph.D. physiologist, and as he explains this, it is compelling, the evidence that he gives. 
   Sometimes I get a little lost in the science myself, but I think the main thing to know about the bill that he has introduced, and introduced in the last Congress and introduced again in the 110th this year, H.R. 322 is an alternative way to obtain almost totally potential, totipotential embryonic, almost embryonic stem cells, without getting into this moral-ethical dilemma of the question of are you for life at its earliest and its most advanced stages, are you pro-life or pro-choice. This is a debate that will go on probably for long after we are all gone and other people have taken our places on both sides of the aisle. 
   But what I like about the Bartlett bill, H.R. 322, is it says, Mr. President, we don't have to divide the country over this issue. It has been divisive. The President made a very difficult decision back in I think August of 2001 when there was this call for Federal funding for stem cell research. Before that, there had been none, or none on embryonic stem cell, let me say. There had been some research on adults in bone marrow and cord blood and things like that, and I am sure Dr. Bartlett has talked about that. 
   But the President has said, look, we will allow embryonic stem cell funding by the John Q. Public taxpayer on these existing stem cell lines that had been indeed obtained from a living human embryo, little life in their earliest forms, that were obtained from these fertility clinics that were considered extra or throwaway or whatever. So the President, I forget the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of research that the Federal Government has funded through the National Institutes of Health and other agencies, but it is substantial, but he did not want to fund any more research on new destruction of life. 
   So that is where we have been for these last few years, until Ms. DeGette and Mr. Castle in the House passed their bill that would allow the use of the little embryos from the fertility clinics.  
   So I want to commend Dr. Bartlett, because what he says is that maybe it is true, maybe it is true that the embryonic stem cell in its earliest form has more potential than the adult stem cells. The adult stem cells are multipotent, but not pluripotent, and certainly not totipotent. So what Dr. Bartlett has done in his bill is say, look, there are other ways. 
   Madam Speaker, there is a doctor at Wake Forest University and just recently he did some research and reported in a very respected medical journal of being able to obtain cells from amniotic fluid as early as 10 to 12 weeks of a pregnancy. 
   Now, that is not a true embryonic cell, but it is getting pretty darn close to it. It is getting darn close to it. I would be very interested in hearing what Dr. Bartlett says about if you compare the potential of those cells in amniotic fluid that you can obtain when a woman, let's say for genetic diagnosis she is 10 to 12 weeks pregnant, she is over the age of 35, she has concerned about the increased risk of Down Syndrome, and she wants some assurance that that baby, her baby, doesn't have Down Syndrome. So that is why the amniotic fluid is obtained, to get some of those cells to know the exact genetic makeup of that child. 
   But there are lots of extra cells that could be then used with the patient's consent without harming anything, certainly without destruction of any living embryo. 
   So this is why I as kind of a practical-minded former OB-GYN physician, who has not researched, who never published a paper, who didn't work at one of the great medical centers in this country, but I did go to a wonderful medical school, the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, and I did my residency there in obstetrics and gynecology, and then went out and practiced for 26 years and delivered a lot of babies, and I feel I know of what I speak. 
   But what I want to do, and the purpose of me being here tonight and sharing this time with Dr. Bartlett, is to say we don't have to fight about this. We got lots of things we can fight about. 
   We are fighting about the conduct of the war right now. We have people in this body that say it was the wrong thing, and then other people say, no, no, it wasn't the wrong thing, but the thing is wrong, and they are arguing about how we have conducted that. We will have and are having a fair debate and difference of opinion. 
   But this is one that, because of what is in the Bartlett bill, H.R. 322, we don't really have to fight about it. We don't have to get ugly about it. And most importantly, we don't have to destroy any human life in getting these nearly totally potential, almost embryonic stem cells. 
   Of course, Dr. Bartlett will want to discuss further, I think, that as part of his bill there are techniques that you actually can obtain an embryonic stem cell without destroying the embryo, by doing a biopsy technique. 
   So that is why I strongly support his bill. We all, everybody in this House and in the other Chamber, the 
   other body, our heart goes out to the Michael J. Foxes of the world, the Christopher Reeves of the world and the folks that are not famous that may be members of our own family. I have heard my colleagues come down and speak in the well compellingly about members of their own family. Our esteemed colleague from Rhode Island, a wonderful Member of this body, who, as a paraplegic, when he talks, people listen, obviously, on both sides of the aisle. 
   So we want help. We want help ASAP. But I don't think we have to divide our country, we don't have to divide ourselves, we don't have to destroy any human life. 
   As I kind of sum up and close and turn it back over to the real expert, I just want to say, Madam Speaker, that it is suggested there are extra and there are so many, 400,000 or whatever, just sitting around waiting to be utilized for their embryonic cells and they are going to be thrown away. It is really not true, and we all know that. 
   We all know that many of the Snowflake Babies have been up here in Washington, in some instances twins that were adopted as embryos and implanted into a mom who couldn't have a baby before that, and in some instances had more than one and had two. I have held them in my arms. We call them the Snowflake Babies, but they are beautiful little toddlers for a lot of infertile couples. So there are no extra babies. There are no throwaways. 
   With that, I yield back to my colleague. I appreciate him giving me a little time to join him and say hoorah for the work he is doing on H.R. 322.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentleman from Arizona, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee. We heard, Mr. Speaker, earlier from Mrs. Blackburn, also a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. These Members are on the Committee of Jurisdiction from whence the bill came. 
   Unfortunately, their only input into this CHAMP legislation, as the Democrats originally phrased it in their acronym, their only opportunity, the Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, is to be here on the floor during this Special Order hour to try to educate Members on both sides of the aisle. The gentleman from Arizona has been on the committee for a number of years, and he knows of what he speaks. 
   Mr. Speaker, talking about this issue of the pay-for, now, the PAYGO idea was the Democrat's campaign pledge, that if they had a new program or they expanded an existing program, and this is an expansion of an existing program, that they would pay for it. They would pay for it by either cutting spending somewhere else or raising taxes. 
   So this is one of those programs. This is a renewal of a program that has worked very well. It needs some additional funding. I don't think any of us would argue about that. Republicans, as well as Democrats, can support a reasonable renewal and expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
   But this is such a massive expansion that the Democrats found themselves in a bind. Mr. Speaker, to this day, they find themselves in a bind, and the bind is they are trying to pay for this with a massive increase, a tax increase, sin tax, if you will, on tobacco, especially cigarettes at 61 cents a pack. 
   As the gentleman from Arizona pointed out and as my colleague the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Westmoreland, it would require 22 million additional people, grandparents, parents, and, yes, indeed, even the children, to start smoking, to pick up the smoking habit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I delivered 5,200 babies over a 31-year career as an OB/GYN physician, and I would hate to think that some of those kids who are in their late teens or early twenties now, would have to be puffing away so they could pay for a health insurance program for their little brothers and sisters. Now, that makes a whole lot of sense, doesn't it?

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. If the gentleman will yield back, in his chart, my colleagues, it is so telling, because as it points out, this is over a 10-year period, up to 2017, but yet this program, all of a sudden they let it fall off the cliff. 
   The other chart there in front of my colleague from Texas, if you pay attention to that, again, the cigarette tax continues over the next 5 years, and all of a sudden they slash the funding for SCHIP so that the numbers work. 
   Because even with the cigarette tax, enticing 22 million additional people to get addicted to tobacco over that period of time, it still falls short of funding the full program by $40 billion. So that is why they say at the end of 5 years, around 2012, all of a sudden there is no money. There is not sufficient money. Even though our young people are addicted to cigarettes, puffing away, trying to pay for the program, it doesn't pay for it. So they use this trick, Mr. Speaker, and I think that is really deplorable. 
   I will close my remarks by saying this and then yield back to my colleague from Arizona who is controlling the time. I know there are other Members that want to speak. 
   But the original bill that the Democrats brought to us, the Democratic majority in this house, called for not $60 billion worth of funding on SCHIP, but $90 billion. Thank goodness they were reined in a little bit. 
   They called that the CHAMP Act. Well, I call it, based on what we have presented here tonight in this disingenuous funding mechanism, I call it the CHUMP Act. The only difference in ``CHAMP'' and ``CHUMP,'' I say to my Democratic majority is you; you, the majority, trying to hoodwink the American public on this bill. 
   Do what is right. You have an opportunity. The President will work with you. The Republican minority will work with you. Just simply do what is right, and for once, tell the truth. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman from Arizona.

   Mr. GINGREY. What the gentleman is saying, and I thank the gentleman for yielding once again, because the Democrats are determined, Mr. Speaker, to increase this funding to a point that they get 4 million additional children covered under this SCHIP program. 
   Under the current law, about 6.5 million children in this country, I think close to 300,000 in my great State of Georgia, are covered under the program. There may be 750,000 kids in that income range of 100 to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level up to $42,000 a year for a family of four, as was pointed out early in the discussion, there may be 750,000 kids that have fallen through the cracks. 
   That is why the President said let's renew the program and increase the  funding by 20 percent. A 20 percent increase is not chicken feed, Mr. Speaker. That is a lot of money. 
   But what the gentleman from Arizona is referring to in regard to this cliff, if you all of a sudden try to cover an additional 4 million, where are those kids coming from? Well, they are coming from families who already have health insurance for their kids in the private market. Of course, if you get an opportunity, who wouldn't? You are making $60,000 a year and you are providing health insurance for your wife and yourself and your two kids, and all of a sudden you get an opportunity to get the kids on the government trough and you do that, and then you are used to that wonderful largesse of ``Uncle Sugar'' for 4 years, and all of a sudden you get to the point where there is no funding, who comes off first? They do. That is where they drop off the cliff. I thank the gentleman for pointing that out.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this closed rule and the underlying bill which the Democratic majority refers to as the Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008. I don't know how anyone can call this an energy creation act when it does nothing, absolutely nothing, to lower the price of gasoline. 
   With a week-long recess ahead, I am sure the majority wants to pass something with the word ``energy'' in it so they can pay lip service, while the American people are paying more at the pump. 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding real change and real solutions. They want Congress to end this energy crisis which is eating into the budgets of American families and harming their quality of life. 
   This bill will not solve their problems. While this bill does extend temporarily some important tax provisions, it does absolutely nothing to address the looming alternative minimum tax which will hit millions of Americans, in fact, 22 million of them, if this Congress fails to act. And there's nothing in this bill concerning the alternative minimum tax. 
   Shortly we will begin debate on another rule for the budget conference report. I have often heard my colleagues on the other side refer to the Federal budget as a moral document. Mr. Speaker, I agree with them. I agree with them. 
   However, when I look at the details of this budget, I can't help but ask, how is it moral to impose the largest tax increase in the history of this country on working Americans, almost $683 billion over the next 5 years? 
   Mr. Speaker, how is it moral to raise the marginal tax rate on lower income workers and impose tax burdens on marriage, children, and family businesses? 
   Mr. Speaker, how is it moral to provide more than $1 trillion in discretionary spending, while doing absolutely nothing to reform entitlement spending and to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare for our future generations, indeed, our children and our grandchildren? 
   The majority can refer to its budget as a moral document all they want to, but the devil is in the detail, Mr. Speaker. Apparently the majority believes it's moral to rack up debt and raise taxes to pay for it. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to cut government spending, and we need to reform uncontrolled entitlement growth by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, so that we can provide tax relief to hardworking Americans and to prevent the tax increases of the Democratic budget, $683 billion. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote against this rule, the underlying bill and the Democratic budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 5658, the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. I want to thank Chairman Skelton, Ranking Member Hunter, and my subcommittee chairman, Neil Abercrombie, and Ranking Member Jim Saxton, for their tireless efforts on behalf of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines who continue to bravely defend us at both home and abroad. 
   While it is not a perfect bill, this legislation covers a wide scope of issues that are of vital importance to the armed services, both the active and reserve component, and it clearly addresses the most pressing needs of our troops in the most trying times that we face in America. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the Armed Services Committee voted unanimously and on a bipartisan basis to support another program critical to our national security. Section 943 of this bill states that the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, WHINSEC, is one of the most effective mechanisms that the United States has to build relationships with future leaders throughout our hemisphere and influence the human rights and democracy trajectory of countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and mitigate the growing influence of non-hemispheric powers. 
   It is especially important to remember that WHINSEC may be the only medium we ever have to engage the future military and political leaders of Latin American countries, who are, by the way, America's closest neighbors and can serve as our closest allies. If we were not to engage with these nations, the void would be filled by countries with starkly different values than our own regarding democracy, and, yes, human rights, and I am talking about countries like Venezuela and China, whose influence in the region, as we know, is growing. 
   The WHINSEC school in Columbus, Georgia, at Fort Benning, the home of the infantry, was formerly part of my congressional district. I am very proud to continue to serve on the Board of Visitors of the school. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also want to further mention how pleased I am of the work of the committee this year to authorize funding for 20 F-22 Raptors in line with the current multiyear contract, and also to authorize the advanced procurement funds needed for a follow-on lot in 2010. The F-22 is the world's most capable fighter, and these funds go a long way towards providing stability for our forces and ensuring that America maintains air dominance for the foreseeable future. 
   There is so much to be proud of in this bill, and I again commend Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their efforts to keep this bill focused on the needs of the warfighter. I would also like to take this opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to recognize Ranking Member Hunter, Air and Land Forces Subcommittee Ranking Member Saxton, and the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Terry Everett of Alabama, for all their contributions, both to the Armed Services Committee and to the Congress over the years. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Georgia has expired.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in strong, strong opposition to this budget. 
   Mr. Speaker, this budget conference report calls for record tax increases and it increases discretionary spending by $241 billion above the President's budget over the next 5 years. It does nothing to reform entitlement or earmarks. Even worse, the Democrats have already signaled their intent to put off the appropriations until next January, at the earliest, making this budget an exercise in futility. 
   Mr. Speaker, I wanted also to say something about the energy crisis that we are in today. On April 24, 2006, Mr. Speaker, that is almost 2 years ago, then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi stated in a press conference that, and I quote, ``Democrats have a commonsense plan to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices.'' Not only have House Democrats failed to offer any meaningful solutions to address gas prices, they have actually put forward policies that will have exactly the opposite effect. She made this statement April 24, 2006, 6 months before the November elections, when the Democrats did gain the majority. 
   Since taking control of Congress, Mr. Speaker, gasoline prices have skyrocketed by more than $1.60 a gallon in my home State of Georgia. In fact, in Georgia's 11th District, my congressional district, northwest Georgia, working families are now paying as much as $3.78 for a gallon of regular gasoline. 
   Every dollar counts, Mr. Speaker, and families should not have to spend them on this ``Pelosi premium.'' They need to buy school equipment, they need to put shoes on their children's feet, they need to buy clothes this fall. Every dollar indeed counts, Mr. Speaker. Working families and their budgets  need relief. They do not need more broken promises. Energy prices are rising, cost of living expenses are up, and the Democrats do-nothing leadership has proven that it's content to just sit on the sidelines and do little, other than raise taxes and increase spending. 
   With gasoline prices skyrocketing, our dependence on foreign oil increasing, and the American peoples' anxiety growing, it is long past time to increase the supply of American-made energy to help lower these prices here at home. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am not holding my breath for a commonsense plan. Maybe there was a plan, but it sure wasn't common sense, and it definitely didn't lower gas prices. That is what Speaker Pelosi promised the American people 2 years ago. I hope the Democrats will begin working with the Republicans and let's do lower energy prices. Let's have a meaningful energy bill that makes sense. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, again, I oppose this rule on the budget resolution, and I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, let's do something meaningful about gas prices.

How much of that 750 million barrels would you suggest? And as my colleague from Texas points out, we would have to change the law.

   Mr. GINGREY. If the gentleman from Pennsylvania would continue to yield to me to ask a question of the gentleman from New York. The gentleman from New York said, well, he wasn't sure, but maybe anywhere from 30 to 50 million barrels would be released from the SPR, Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   The purpose of that reserve is if the countries that hate us, and certainly many in the Middle East and Venezuela do, if they cut off the supply of oil to us tomorrow, we're talking about about 12 million barrels a day, about 12 million barrels a day that we would not have of the 22 million that we need. So releasing 30 to 50 million barrels of oil from the SPR would do nothing. And the purpose of the SPR, of course, is if we do get cut off completely from 12 million barrels of oil a day, we literally have about 60 days to utilize the SPR, and then that is all gone. And it's during that period of time, of course, that we would need to negotiate with these countries and bring whatever power to bear that we need, hopefully diplomatic, to free the flow of that oil back up. So that is why we say on this side of the aisle we can ill afford to release any of the SPR because of price manipulations in the market.

Many of our parents and grandparents have stock in oil companies, and they are glad that the companies are doing well. 
   But I wanted to point out during the Clinton years, during the dot-com years when profits were double digit year after year after year, I never heard my colleagues call for windfall profits against these dot-com companies, mostly out in California and Silicon Valley, and then the bubble burst and the market corrected itself. And it will do the same thing in regard to this. Oil companies will not continue to make record profits forever. I want my colleagues to put that in perspective.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I just want to refer back to the statement the gentleman from Michigan just made in regard to the 22 million acres in Alaska that you could now drill on, yet our Democratic colleagues, our friends, are denying the opportunity to drill on 2,000 acres--not 22 million--2,000 acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, and to obtain an equal amount, an equal amount of petroleum from that area without harming the environment. It makes no sense to destroy 22 million acres for the same amount of oil that you could get out of 2,000. But that's another subject, and I look forward as well to later in the hour, when the gentleman is going to talk about hedging and speculation and, in his opinion, what effect that has on the price of petroleum that we're paying. 
   The gentleman from West Virginia, the distinguished chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, was talking earlier in his opening comments about the fact that drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, which we had been prohibited from doing--thank God the President lifted that Presidential moratorium, and now the only thing that is holding us back from going after those 20 billion barrels of petroleum and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas is inaction on the part of this Congress. 
   Now, earlier the discussion was about this use it or lose it. The gentleman from West Virginia talked about that a lot and said, well, you know, you've got these 68 million acres leased from the Bureau of Land Management--by the way, that's out of 750 million acres under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. These oil companies, my colleagues, they pay for those leases, they're not free. And so they're kind of betting on the come, they're hoping that their geologists will then tell them that, yes, indeed, there is a certain amount of oil in that area of land that they have leased. And if it's true, then they're going to go after it. If there is no oil there or if there is an insufficient amount of oil there and it's not going to be productive to spend that kind of money for a little amount of oil, then maybe they will sit on those leases. And I would think that they would probably gladly yield it back to the Federal Government--especially if they got a refund on their money, they probably wouldn't. 
   But these same people that realize that right off the Outer Continental Shelf, whether it's the eastern seaboard or the Atlantic or the Pacific or the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico where there are trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and billions of barrels of petroleum, that's the leases that they want, that's the leases that they need. And it just is beyond my comprehension to understand why the leader of this House, Speaker Pelosi, would say that is a nonstarter. 
   Now, we could stand here on the Republican side of the aisle and say to the gentleman from Michigan and others who are concerned about noncommercial speculators and what effect that might have on the price of a barrel of petroleum, we could say, well, you know, for us that's a nonstarter; or you're interfering with the free market. Are you going to do the same thing with pork bellies and wheat and corn and all these other things that are traded on the commodities market and regulated by NYMEX? Are you going to force them offshore by overregulating and interfering with the natural flow of market? So, you know, we have concerns about that. 
   But I don't think that our side of the aisle has said, my colleagues, that that's a nonstarter, that we won't even discuss that. And yet your leadership, Ms. Pelosi, the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. Reid, has said drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, where we know there are trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and billions of barrels of oil, is a nonstarter. I think that's just totally wrong, that the American people don't want that. They want bipartisanship like we're having here tonight in this discussion, this colloquy between the two sides. And I think we can and should get together.

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, reclaiming my time from the chairman--and I don't disagree with his last statement, it will certainly require a comprehensive approach; there is no doubt about that.  
   But the gentleman from West Virginia has said repeatedly tonight that opening up these reserves, whether it's the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, where we estimate that 1.5 million barrels a day increased production, increased domestic production--I mentioned the numbers for the Outer Continental Shelf in regard to natural gas and petroleum, and your response, your statement earlier was that, well, if you did that tomorrow, if you started that tomorrow, it would be 2030--I think you used that date--before any production of oil would be seen, and therefore, that's not going to solve the problem. Yet your colleague from Michigan is going to tell us in a little while how important it is to rein in these noncommercial speculators because just the anticipation causes the price of oil to go up or down. 
   And what I want to say to my colleagues is that it might take 5 years, 10 years, possibly 15 years, depending on where you're going after the source. Certainly, mining shale out in the west, where we could get 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum, may take a while. But just the fact that we're doing these things in a comprehensive way and we're increasing the domestic supply, I will almost guarantee you that overnight the price of a barrel of crude would drop by 20 percent.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PRACTICAL ENERGY SOLUTIONS NEEDED -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, for literally months now, House Republicans have come to the floor in a concerted effort to convince Democratic leadership to bring legislation to the floor that would allow us to drill here and drill now so we can all pay less at the pump. 
   But even as we offered practical energy solutions and a willingness to work with the majority, Speaker Pelosi has continually blocked such legislation from coming for a vote here in the House, and we are not the only ones who have noticed it. 
   Mr. Speaker, here is a headline from today's Roll Call newspaper. Here is what it says: ``Pelosi maneuvers to block drilling votes. Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears intent on preventing votes on opening more areas to offshore drilling, despite the stirrings of a revolt by rank-and-file Democrats after months of concerted efforts by House Republicans.'' This was in Roll Call today, Monday, July 14, 2008. 
   As this article notes, we are starting to hear some rumblings from Members on the Democratic side of the aisle who are ready to put partisan politics aside and work with Republicans on compromise legislation that will start to decrease our pain at the pump. Increasing numbers of rank-and-file Democrats seem to have grown tired of their leadership's failure to allow votes on legislation that will break our dependence on foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to show a couple of posters here and some quotes. The first quote, ``Americans need Congress to look at real solutions in addressing our energy needs, especially when we have $4 a gallon gasoline. We need answers and not just slogans. We need to do it all. We have Senators going to Saudi Arabia begging them to increase their production, but we won't increase ours in some of the most, potential, productive areas?'' That was a quote from a floor remark made June 26, 2008, by Mr. Gene Green of Texas.     
   Here is another one. Another quote, ``Then we better get started, because the longer we delay, the more we're jeopardizing the American economy.'' That quote came from Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE, the gentleman from Hawaii, on Fox News on July 7 of this year, a member, NEIL ABERCROMBIE, of the Natural Resources Committee. 
   Many Members on both sides of the aisle understand that there is not one single solution to our current energy crisis, and that we must work in a bipartisan way to develop a comprehensive plan to alleviate the pain that American families face every time they fill their gas pumps. 
   I want to commend the leadership of Representative JOHN PETERSON of Pennsylvania, and, as I said, Representative NEIL ABERCROMBIE of Hawaii. They are now heading up a working group to form legislation that incorporates long-term energy solutions while also providing short-term relief for Americans who are now, today, paying $4.11 a gallon of gas. 
   This bipartisan approach is what we need to find a solution. House Republicans stand ready to find a middle way that not only guarantees an increase in domestic production, but it also addresses concerns about excessive speculation. 
   While House Republicans are prepared for a comprehensive approach that looks not only at supply but also market factors, Speaker Pelosi must be willing to, at the very least, allow an up or down vote on increasing domestic supply. She must recognize that the American people don't want any option left off the table. 
   As further indication that we need to increase the domestic supply of oil, President Bush today lifted the 18 year-old executive order that prohibited responsible energy exploration along our Nation's Outer Continental Shelf. Let me show my colleagues that poster. Here is the quote, ``In another push to deal with soaring gas prices, President Bush on Monday will lift an executive ban on offshore drilling that has stood since his father was president. But the move, by itself, will do nothing unless Congress acts as well.'' This was from the Associated Press today. 
   This decision leaves Congress as the last remaining hurdle to domestically producing billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas for the American people. Allowing our Nation to explore the energy resources available off of our coast would be a great first step toward declaring America's energy independence. 
   We need to have a comprehensive approach, and I hope Members on both sides of the aisle recognize that, and we need action now.  
   Unfortunately, sound energy policy is being held hostage by Speaker NANCY PELOSI because she believes that it is more important to pander to out-of-control environmentalists than to enact a ``common-sense plan'' to lower gas prices--as she promised to the American people over 2 years ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, as American families and small businesses face record prices at the pump, they are counting on their leaders in Congress to work together on reforms to help reduce fuel costs. I call on Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic Leadership to listen to House Republicans, a growing coalition of House Democrats and most importantly the American people--allow a vote on legislation that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to follow-on to what my colleague from New Jersey just said. The gentleman from New Jersey was just talking about the need in the northeast and how important it is to homeowners, particularly during the winter season, the cold season, in regard to fuel oil. So many homes, as he pointed out, in that part of the country are disproportionately heated by natural gas and fuel oil. 
   He talked about the fact that these coastal States along the eastern seaboard, not just New Jersey, but Massachusetts as well, have been in opposition to opening up the Outer Continental Shelf because of all of these environmental concerns and the fact that you are going to spoil the view. As our colleague so rightly pointed out, you can't see oil rigs 20, 50 and indeed even 150 miles offshore, as my colleagues from Georgia and Texas pointed out earlier in regard to the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   But here is the thing that I want to point out to my colleagues, the folly of what the Democratic majority is presenting to this House tomorrow. Tomorrow, under a rule, a regular bill, they are going to bring up this issue of the Taunton River in Fall River, Massachusetts. 
   They want to designate this river, and I hope my colleagues can see this poster and see how industrialized and busy and developed the shoreline of I think at least 8 miles of this 20-mile river already is, and they want to make this designation of a Wild and Scenic River. 
   Now they should have done that 50 years ago, maybe 100 years ago when this river may have been wild and scenic. You can look at it today, and it is anything but scenic. It may be wild, but it is certainly not scenic. 
   But guess what, it allows them with this designation to deny the siting of a liquefied natural gas plant. And so that means that these tankers with liquefied natural gas that the northeast desperately needs to heat those homes in the winter time, to bring relief to those homeowners who are really struggling. What will they do? They will pass this bill. That means there can be no liquefied natural gas terminals along that entire river, and then I guess the Democratic majority will come back and put more money into the LIHEAP program so people can afford to pay their bills. It is absolutely ridiculous. 
   I have another poster that I want to show because I think what we are talking about here tonight, when you cut right to the chase, is that the Democratic majority are creating all of these paper tigers. And this business about use it or lose it, I'm not going to comment on that because, thank goodness we have Representative Westmoreland and the gentleman from Texas, Mike Conaway, who has been in the oil business, and to have Members with that expertise explain it to us and the folly of that use it or lose it. If they lose it, who in the world is going to come back and be able to afford to drill these expensive oil rigs, especially offshore. I appreciate him pointing that out. 
   Look at this poster, Mr. Speaker. Just a little cartoon. I think it is cute, but it is well to the point. 
   Here's the Democratic leadership asking a question of the administration. ``We demand you energy companies do something about these high energy prices.'' It is the voice coming from the United States Capitol. 
   The response from the energy companies: ``Clean coal?'' 
   And the response back from the Capitol: ``Well, that's out of the question.'' 
   The energy companies say well, ``We can drill in ANWR,'' that 2,000 acres out of 19 million up in the frozen tundra of the north slope of Alaska. 
   The response from our Congressional House majority and Speaker Pelosi: ``Forget it.'' 
   Well, okay, ``How about nuclear power?'' 
   The response: ``You're joking, right?'' 
   And then finally: ``How about offshore?'' How about this Outer Continental Shelf drilling for oil and natural gas? Millions of cubic feet, billions of barrels of petroleum. 
   The response: ``Are you crazy?'' 
   So finally you throw up your hands and say, ``Huh?'' 
   And they say, the response: ``Well, don't just sit there, do something.''     
   Don't just sit there, do something. Well, I am going to tell you, the Republican minority wants to do something. The Republican minority wants to do a lot of things. The Republican minority hopefully soon to be the majority, when we tell the American people and show the American people that we want to do something in a comprehensive way, and we want to get it done before we leave here for any kind of August recess. We are making that pledge, and that's why I am proud to be here tonight with my colleagues. I know that others want to speak, and time is short. 
   But I hope that people will listen. I hope that our colleagues are listening. I know that there are Democrats who want to vote and support a comprehensive approach to this. There is some give and take. We can do this in a bipartisan way. But this business of use or take a little oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would--all of that oil, that 750 million barrels that we have in reserve, if the Middle East cuts us off tomorrow, that would be exhausted in 60 days. That's why we don't tap that, just because we want to bring down the price of oil. 
   I yield back to my colleague.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our troops who are still waiting for critical funding needed to fight the war on terror. I want to make sure the American people understand what is happening with legislation that provides money for our soldiers. 
   Instead of passing a clean bill the President could sign into law, the Democrats chose to pass a political statement that ties troop funding to arbitrary withdrawal deadlines, and it's loaded with earmarks. The Democrats have even dragged their feet on their own legislation, taking a 2-week recess without funding our troops and spending another week in Washington bickering over a bill that they know that the President will veto. 
   Why are we playing politics with money for our soldiers? Our troops can't win this war with political rhetoric. They need money, they need supplies, and they have been waiting over  70 days since the President made the request. I call on this House to pass a clean bill, get it to the President's desk, so we can give our war fighters the tools that they need to achieve victory.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (SOWING THE SEEDS THROUGH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I do rise today in strong support of  H.R. 363, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Research Act. 
   This legislation, just like H.R. 362 which we just passed, is a fantastic opportunity for bipartisanship to support math and science education in this country. Taken in combination with that bill, 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds, we lay a crucial foundation in maintaining America's competitiveness worldwide. 
   The National Academies released a report entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' It looked at ways in which the Federal Government could enhance our country's science and technology enterprise so we can continue to compete and prosper in this global marketplace. In addition to its recommendations with respect to K-12 education, the commission came to the conclusion that there is a general lack of research in science and engineering in America. 
   Our country must face the reality that China and India are making significant strides and pouring major resources into science and engineering. Therefore, in order to stay competitive, we need to not only encourage young students to get excited by the possibilities that exist with technology advances, but we also need to support young scientist research. Since younger scientists are more likely to do innovative and transformative work, it is in our country's best interest to ensure that these young scientists indeed have the support that they need. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Sowing the Seeds Through Science and Engineering Act offers rewards for younger students in order to encourage them to continue their work in the fields of science and engineering. 
   This legislation also strengthens Federal support for science and engineering researchers at the early stages of their career by expanding the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program at NSF, establishing a Presidential Innovation Award, and authorizing NSF to authorize research on innovation. 
   Again, I want to emphasize that I truly believe in order for our great Nation to remain competitive in the ever-advancing global marketplace, we need to sustain and strengthen our commitment to long-term basic research. This is research that has the potential to be transformational in maintaining the flow of new ideas that fuel our economy, provide security and enhance the quality of life for all Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe this legislation is a great first step to address this impending crisis, both in America's workforce and our country's research institutions, and I am proud to support the bill, and I ask all of my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Chairman, before I conclude, and hopefully I will not run out of time, but I did want to at this point say that as much as I am for this bill, I have to oppose one of the amendments that is going to be offered by the gentlelady from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, the Gillibrand amendment. It is duplicative. We already do that under the Department of Education in regard to providing scholarships, merit scholarships for advanced students in our high schools. We already do that through the Department of Education, and it is a very well-funded program. 
   But more importantly, Mr. Chairman, the reason I am opposed to the amendment, in a way it contradicts what we just did in H.R. 362, where we said we will give these grants to these students to encourage them to study and pursue math and science and engineering types of advanced degrees in college with a payback, a two-for-one payback if they go into the teaching profession in a community where we have that great need for outstanding math and science teachers. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, again, I support the bill. I am opposed to the Gillibrand amendment for the reasons outlined.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (10,000 TEACHERS, 10 MILLION MINDS SCIENCE AND MATH SCHOLARSHIP ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the chairman's amendment. I know on this bill, H.R. 362, this is a perfect example of everything being said but not every one of us having an opportunity to say it. I rise in support of the amendment of Chairman Gordon and also the bill. 
   I can't improve on the words of the distinguished Speaker that we heard from just a few minutes ago, but I do want to applaud and support this H.R. 362, 10,000 Teachers, 10,000 Minds Science and Math Scholarship Act, and certainly applaud Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall and the work that they have done. I am proud to be a member of the Science and Technology Committee and to see this come to the floor today.     
   The National Academy released a report, Mr. Chairman, entitled ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' that looked at the ways in which the Federal Government could enhance our country's science and technology enterprise so that we can continue to compete and prosper in the global marketplace. The commission arrived at one outstanding and alarming conclusion: American students are falling behind in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math, sometimes referred to as STEM. 
   In response to this sobering reality, the report recommends vastly improving the K-12 science and math programs in classrooms across the country in order to increase America's talent pool. We talk about raising the level of H-1B visas, doubling them. That might be part of the solution, Mr. Chairman, but we need to develop our homegrown talent. Early education is crucial in getting children not only excited about math and science, but adequately prepared to pursue these fields later in life. And I strongly believe by recruiting, retaining, and training better educators in these fields more students will want to attend college in the areas of science, technology, and math. And that is the key to keeping America competitive in the ever-increasing technological global marketplace. 
   The 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds Science and Math Scholarship program begins to remedy this situation by implementing a variety of action items recommended by this report. First, H.R. 362 seeks to raise both the quantity and quality of math and science teachers in America by increasing the number and amount of grants available to teachers and students who pursue continuing education in these fields. It also increases grants within a program at the National Science Foundation that provides financial aid to students who make a commitment to teach after college. 
   Mr. Chairman, I firmly believe this legislation is a good first step to address this impending crisis of America's workforce. I am again proud to support the bill, to support Chairman Gordon's amendment. I respectfully ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (NATIONAL HEALTH CARE DECISIONS DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 323, expressing congressional support for the goals and the ideals of National Health Care Decisions Day. 
   National Health Care Decisions Day was recognized by hundreds of organizations across the United States last Wednesday, April 16, and it is appropriate for this body to stand with those organizations in recognition of this important day. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, though, I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, and his staff for their cooperation in helping us get this to the floor. I want to thank the ranking member, Mr. Barton, and the minority staff and the 100 Members, many of them members of the Energy and Commerce Committee who are cosponsors of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, the goals of the resolution are twofold. First, it aims to raise awareness of the importance for everyone at all stages of life to take the time to discuss important end-of-life medical decisions with their loved ones. 
   Second, this resolution recognizes the emphasis of over 450 organizations spanning all 50 States that worked together on April 16 to educate Americans about their options in preparing advanced medical directives and appointing medical powers of attorney. 
   Of these groups, 75 are national organizations, including AARP, the American Bar Association, the American Medical Association, National Right to Life, and an additional 370 State and community organizations participated in the National Health Care Decisions Day efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a result of the National Health Care Decisions Day, thousands of people across the country have received information on advanced directives through newspaper articles, television, and radio broadcasts, all released last week on April 16. I want to thank and congratulate all those involved for their hard work on this important cause. I am also proud of the broad bipartisan support this resolution has garnered. 
   Companion legislation sponsored by Senators WYDEN and ENZI has already passed the Senate, and now over 100, as I mentioned earlier, of my fellow House Members of both sides of the aisle have signed on to this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to urge the American people to invest time and effort into seeking out information on advanced directives. Advanced directives allow individuals to maintain control over their health care decisions even at the end of their lives, regardless of the circumstances they may face at that time. And I also encourage Americans to educate themselves on the options and details of the various types of advanced directives so that their wishes may be correctly documented and carried out. 
   Let me be very clear: This bill does not express what an individual's end-of-life decision should be. Those are the decisions that should be left to the individual undertaking this difficult but important step. 
   This resolution merely seeks to raise awareness about advanced directives themselves. And that's why this resolution is being supported by such a diverse range of organizations. Educating individuals and making them aware of their choices is a key to respecting and preserving life. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a physician, I cannot stress enough that these decisions should be made with the input of medical professionals and should be accessible to the patient's doctor in the time of greatest medical need. Too many times, families are left to guess what medical decisions their family member would have wanted. Think about the Terri Schiavo case a couple years ago. But physicians are sometimes left to guess as well. 
   A recent study by the U.S. Agency for Health Care Research and Quality  found that 75 percent of physicians whose patients had advanced directives were not even aware that those directives existed. This is a problem, Mr. Speaker, and I hope that as we get electronic medical records and HIT, Health Information Technology, becomes more sophisticated and intraoperable, these advanced directives can be stored electronically and be made accessible to the medical staff in an instant, really, in a timely manner. 
   So, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage all Americans to set aside time to have what may very will be one of the most vital conversations that any family can have. 
   I urge my fellow Members to vote in support of this resolution and to recognize the critical role of education in allowing Americans to effectively express their end-of-life wishes. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IN MEMORY OF SERGEANT WILLIAM ALLMON -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, today the residents of Floyd County, Georgia are saying goodbye to a native son who died while bravely serving his Nation in Iraq. Sergeant William Elliot Allmon was killed in action on April 12, 2008 outside of Baghdad, after his vehicle encountered an IED, an improvised explosive device. 
   Last night, I joined Sergeant Will Allmon's family, friends, and supporters at his visitation to honor the life of this brave soldier. He was remembered as a man of the highest character whose receipt of two Army commendation medals, an Army achievement medal, a combat action badge are testament to the supreme sense of duty he felt to his country and to his brothers in arms, his comrades. Most importantly, he was remembered as a first-born son, a father, and grandson whose contagious smile brought a sense of warmth to those in his presence. 
   Born and raised in Floyd County, Georgia, Will joined the National Guard at age 17 before going full active duty in 2003. After serving one tour in Iraq, and even being wounded, Sergeant Allmon selflessly decided to return to the war zone for a second tour, from which his unit will return home this summer. 
   His whole mission in Iraq centered on keeping his fellow soldiers safe, risking his life for the sake of others. Sergeant Allmon served as a combat engineer for the Army, where he specialized in building protective structures for friendly forces and destroying protective structures for the enemy. 
   I think his mom put it best when she said, ``He was a leader who was looked up to by other soldiers. He was a loyal soldier who went beyond the call of duty.'' 
   Sergeant Allmon leaves behind his wife, Jennifer; his 3-year-old son, Damien; an 11-year-old stepson, Jason Luke Johnson; his mother, Donna Fortune; his father, William Allmon; his  grandfather, Leonard Allmon; and grandparents, Billy and Joann Phillips. 
   Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family and my deepest gratitude goes out to Sergeant Allmon for his selfless sacrifice for this Nation, and I ask all Members, and I know they will, join me in honoring the distinguished memory of Sergeant William Allmon.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, this morning I was honored to join with Senator McCain and other Republican and Democratic Members of both the House and Senate to welcome over 400 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan that were here for a rally in support of all those who are risking their lives on the front lines in this global war against terror. 
   This morning's rally marks the single largest gathering of Iraq and Afghan veterans since the war began. Make no mistake, these heroes were gathering in support of victory, not a politically driven withdrawal, which would ensure defeat. 
   These veterans are so committed to success in Iraq and Afghanistan that they have formed a nationwide group, called Vets for Freedom, with a mission of educating the American public and Congress about the importance of achieving success in this global war on terror and what the failure to do so would mean for our Nation's security. 
   Every Member of this body should, this week, meet with these veterans, talk to them, learn of the benefits of their firsthand experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the words of the Vets for Freedom, it is time to put ``long-term national security before short-term partisan political gain.'' 
   Again, I thank the Vets for Freedom, as well as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, for their great service to this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (CONFLICT IN THE MIDDLE EAST -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank you. And it's indeed an honor to be here tonight to talk with my colleagues about something that's going on in the world today that is of huge import. And no, I'm not talking about who was the victor in the NCAA Final Four Basketball Tournament. 
   I'm not here to talk to my colleagues about who might be the winner this year of the American Idol contest, as we get closer and closer and that draws the interest of so many of television viewers throughout the country. 
   What I'm talking about tonight, Madam Speaker, is probably the most important thing that this country has on its plate in a long, long time, and that is the situation in the Middle East and what's going on in Iraq and Afghanistan and how important that conflict is, not just to this country and its citizens, but the region in the Middle East and, indeed, the entire world, Madam Speaker, as we continue to wage, as we have for the last 5 1/2 years, this battle, this war against global terrorism. And ground zero, Madam Speaker, make no mistake about it, ground zero is in Iraq. 
   Today our commander there, of the multinational force Iraq, General David Petraeus, and the United States Ambassador, Ambassador to Iraq, Ambassador Ryan Crocker, are here in Washington, D.C. to testify before both the United States Senate and in this chamber, the United States House of Representatives, to the Armed Services Committee of both the House and the Senate, and to the Foreign Affairs Committee of both bodies. General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker spoke to the Senate today in a full, long day of testimony, and they will be speaking tomorrow to the House committees that I just mentioned. 
   Madam Speaker, along with yourself and many other very fortunate Members of this House of Representatives, I do serve on the Armed Services Committee, and I certainly look forward to hearing from these two great men who have served so well and for so long in a difficult part of the world, and also to have the opportunity to ask some questions, and I'm sure some of them will be tough questions, hard questions for Members of both political bodies, both the majority and the minority. 
   So, as I say, this opportunity tonight, on behalf of my party, the Republican minority, to take this hour and talk about this and try to explain to my colleagues that this is really, we are at a critical point in this war in the Middle East. And we have an opportunity, as I've felt for a long time, as I felt last September when General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker first came before the committees and explained that the surge that we enacted in January of 2007 is, indeed, working. And what they said last September is that we need to give it a chance. 
   Indeed, if you made an analogy to a sporting event, you might say that we're in the fourth quarter of a tough game, and at times, indeed, January of 2007 and several months before that, it did appear that we were losing. Members of this body and the other body in leadership positions made some pretty drastic statements, even to the extent of saying the war's lost, it's hopeless, it's a hopeless situation; we need to just pack up and come home. 
   But General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, last September told us, no, that is not the case because we did change courses. We listened to the recommendations of the Iraqi Study Group, co-chaired by a very prominent Democrat and Republican, and we listened very carefully to their recommendations in regard to what needed to be done. And this surge of about 30,000 additional troops has certainly given us the opportunity to regain control and get the upper hand against these Islamic extremists and thugs that could, and would, and are determined not only to destroy Iraq, but to make that country the base of their support. And, yes, of course I'm talking about al Qaeda. 
   Anyone who thinks, Madam Speaker, that Iraq is not ground zero now for al Qaeda simply is ignoring the words of Osama bin Laden. 
   So we are, as General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, we are at a very critical point. And today, the evidence will show, and during this next 45 to 60 minutes of time that me and some of my colleagues on our side of the aisle will have to discuss this, we are going to present the evidence that we are succeeding. We have not won yet, but we're ahead in the fourth quarter, and this is certainly not the time to pull our team off the field and say, well, you know, they're tired, they're stressed; the ranks are thin. It's cost us too much money. And hey, you know, we may have some conflict break out somewhere else in the world, and we have to be ready for that. Maybe 6 months from now, maybe a year from now, maybe 10 years from now. 
   So this approach, strategy of giving up something that we have almost won, after sacrificing 4,000 killed in action, and closer to 20,000 of our brave men and women severely wounded, and an untold number, maybe as many as 100,000 Iraqi civilians who have also given their lives for the cause, it makes no sense to this Member, Madam Speaker, that you would give up at such a critical, crucial time. 
   So what we're going to talk about tonight is really four things. I want to concentrate on four things. And as I say, hopefully, a number of my colleagues will be able to finish up their previous engagements and be here with me on the floor, because these Members are members of the Armed Services Committee and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States House of Representatives. And they, Madam Speaker, know of what they speak. 
   And what we're going to do is break it down, as I say, into four areas of discussion. The first area would be to talk about where are we today? What difference has a year made? Actually, it's a little more than a year. 
   January of 2007. But it took until October, just this past fall, to get all of the additional troops and their support, logistical support into the theater. And you really couldn't expect a lot of change in the battle until we got the full force of those 30,000 additional troops. And you, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, we all refer to that as the surge. And this was what was recommended by General Petraeus. 
   And so we're going to talk about it, what a difference a year makes, and talk about some of the statistics about overall violence and progress. And the statistics don't lie. You can't put spin on numbers. Numbers are what they are. And I think the numbers, when we finish this special order hour, Madam Speaker, I think my colleagues will agree that by any standard, any parameter, any metric that I talk about, you'd have to say that the surge that was essentially envisioned, planned by General Petraeus, is, indeed, working, maybe even far better than he expected. 
   And the second thing that I'll talk about is, what would victory look like? You know, we're on track. We're not there yet. I think it would be presumptuous, maybe even naive of me to say that we have victory in our grasp, or to suggest that the mission is over, we won. No, we're not there yet. 
   And I think the violence that broke out recently in Basra, the second largest city in Iraq, after Baghdad, the port city where every drop of oil that's taken out of the ground, those 2 1/2 to 3 million barrels a day from the reserves in the country of Iraq, they flow out of that port at Basra. And there's been a lot of violence there. And, you know, that's some disappointing news after we have had a string of several months of good news and great statistics. 
   But we know from that little wake-up call that there's still a lot of work to be done. Unfortunately, as has been the case in so many conflicts throughout the course of the history of our country, we have had to take the lead so many times. And we have had strong allies, certainly, the Brits have been a great ally of ours throughout history, and continue to be. But the fact is that they're citizens are, they're not as supportive, maybe, from time to time, as we would like for them to be.     
   And it's very difficult for their parliament to keep troops as part of our multinational force. There are some in Basra, but something like a thousand British troops were removed from that  critical area, which they have had responsibility for since day one of Operation Iraqi Freedom. A lot of those troops were brought home for political reasons in September of 2007, and it weakened our situation in Basra. We are paying the price today, I think, because of that, but we will talk about these statistics, and we will certainly talk about what victory would look like. 
   The third point that I am going to ask my colleagues to discuss, and I will discuss as well, is the fact that despite these overwhelming statistics and the progress that we've made, there are Members in this body, in this town, the media, voices, that say and continue to say, it is not worth it. It is not worth it. It is not worth the lives that we have sacrificed. It is not worth the money that we've spent. Even achieving victory is not worth it. We need to bring the troops home and spend that money on social welfare programs, on health care for everybody, and maybe a $5,000 tax rebate for every man, woman, and child in the country. There are other things that we could do to spend that $10 billion a month that this war is costing us. Now, I want to talk about that, and we will get into it. 
   And then lastly, and maybe most important tonight, we will talk about the consequences of failure, the consequences of withdrawal, which I am absolutely convinced, if done prematurely, will lead, inevitably, to failure. 
   So we will conclude by talking about the consequences of that. And I think, as my colleagues listen, it will be quite sobering to them as they think in their mind and understand, and this is an intelligent body of 435 great Americans, of people who have served this country well and representing their districts well, but sometimes we need a wake-up call. Sometimes we really, Mr. Speaker, need a wake-up call. And that's why we do these Special Orders on both sides of the aisle. 
   But tonight, I don't think there really is anything more important to talk about than the situation in the Middle East, and I'm proud to have this opportunity, and it's a great honor and a privilege. 
   I see my colleague from Tennessee, one of my classmates who joined with me in the 110th Congress. We were both elected in 2002. We both had served, me in the State of Georgia, she in the State of Tennessee, in the General Assembly; and we are part of a proud group of, I think there were 53 freshman back in 2003 as we got here. And we all, I'm sure, felt like we had the answers to all problems and that we were going to solve all of the country's problems and the world's problems. And I can tell you that we haven't, but we haven't given up, and we will continue to work hard. 
   So it's an honor to be joined now by the gentlewoman from Tennessee, my good friend and outstanding Member, Marsha Blackburn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. The gentlewoman remembers, I think we all remember, hopefully, that last year the Congress asked for the Iraqi government to meet certain benchmarks. And this is exactly what Representative Blackburn is talking about now in regard to certain laws that their parliament would need to pass. It was sort of like a, you know, we'll only continue to help you if you promise by a date certain that you will have provincial elections, that you will pass a de-Ba'athification law, which essentially meant that those Sunnis, those brave soldiers that we are calling now and referring to as sons of Iraq, and as I say, mostly Sunnis, that they would have an opportunity to be included, maybe to be officially a part of the Iraqi security force. 
   So the government had to get over the fact that there was this rivalry, if you will, between the Shias in the majority and the Sunnis in the minority and the Sunnis led by the brutal dictator. Saddam Hussein had suppressed, oppressed, murdered so many of the Shias for so many years of his reign of terror that it's difficult to all of a sudden reach out an olive branch, but that's what we asked them to do in regard to de-Ba'athification, and I think it's important. And also asking them to share the oil revenue with all parts of the country, not just where the oil is found in the oil-rich Kurdish region but also in the west where there's very little oil and in the south as you have sharing.     
   So that's what the gentlewoman is talking about, and I yield back to her. 
   I just wanted to say that, and I'll make this one last point before I yield back, if the gentlewoman will bear with me just a second. It was said that those benchmarks needed to be met before we would provide additional troops and security and help stabilize things on the ground. But you couldn't have an effective parliament, an effective government until the people on the ground, in the towns, in the villages felt that their new government that they voted for could protect them, that had the ability, had the military strength, had the training that they felt secure and that they could go forward with this government. So the provision of security on the ground was first and foremost, and that's what the surge was all about. 
   I yield back to the gentlewoman from Tennessee.

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee. And I would like to reemphasize the statistics that she was talking about that we said at the outset, Mr. Speaker, of this hour that we're going to talk about what a difference that a year makes and present those statistics, how particularly violence has decreased. And Representative Blackburn has already talked about that. 
   But I would ask my colleagues to reference this first slide in regard to its title. This is a little difficult to see in the back of the Chamber, but ``Civilian Deaths.'' And it is amazing, if you look at this top line going back to January of 2006 and then coming forward almost to present day, March of 2008, and you see that about the time of the surge, that peaked the civilian deaths. We're talking about on an almost monthly basis, 4,000 civilian deaths. I think if you follow the line down, that would be about January or February of 2007. And in March of 2008, at the far side of the chart, you're looking at a number just slightly over 600. So to go from almost 4,000 deaths to 600. And I have some additional charts to basically show the same thing, again, the statistics that we promised to present at the outset of the hour, to show you what a difference a year makes. 
   And this slide, my colleagues, says ``High Profile Attacks,'' basically explosions. And the blue line is the total. The next, I guess you would call that the brown graph, is car bombs. The red is suicide car bombs. And then on the bottom is suicide deaths. But this is a total. And that's where the rubber meets the road in these statistics. 
   And again, about a year ago, you were talking about attacks occurring in the range of 125 a day. And until this recent outbreak in Basra, they were down to about 40 a day. So, again, as I said at the outset, by any measure, by any parameter, any metric you want to take, the success of the surge is obvious.

   Mr. GINGREY. I will be glad to yield. I will make one further point, and then I will yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee. 
   These success stories you don't see on the nightly news. I think it was Ann Murray that sang a very famous hit a number of years ago, and I think the title of that was ``A Little Good News Today.'' You don't hear about good news because, by definition, it's not news. It's only mayhem and violence and killings and rapes and people putting their children in the trunk of a car and leaving them there for a day as a disciplinary action for some minor infraction. These are the kind of things that are on the front pages of our newspapers and on the 24-hour news service. They only talk about it when there's violence. Unfortunately, there's not much credit given to a little good news, in fact, a lot of good news. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman from Tennessee.

   Mr. GINGREY. And I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for those very intelligent remarks and understanding of what is going on. She has added so much to this hour. 
   We're getting into the final third of our time. And I'm very pleased that one of my colleagues, a freshman, it's hard to believe, Mr. Speaker, indeed, that he is a freshman because his wisdom is far beyond that. He serves with me on the Armed Services Committee. He will be there tomorrow when General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testify to us, to the House Armed Services Committee. 
   At this point, I would be happy to yield to the gentleman from Colorado, Representative Doug Lamborn.

   Mr. GINGREY. Well, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for being with us. And I hope that if time permits, he can remain with us for some of the additional time. I would be happy to yield to him if you'll just let me know. But, again, he is a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and indeed, he knows of what he speaks. 
   Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, the testimony today that went on with the Senate Armed Services Committee was very telling. We are all busy on this side of the Capitol with committee meetings and other responsibilities, so you don't have the time to sit there glued to the television set and watch every single member ask questions of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. But I was able, on occasion, to hear some of the dialogue and the exchange. And I want to share just a little bit of that, Mr. Speaker, with my colleagues at this time. And this poster, this slide that I have, you can reference what I'm talking about. 
   Senator Lindsey Graham, the senior Senator from the great State of South Carolina where I spent most of my youth, I live and represent Georgia proudly now, but Senator Graham, formerly a Member of this body, the House of Representatives, and now serving so well in the United States Senate, asked this question of General Petraeus: ``Is it fair to say that when Muslims will stand by us and fight against bin Laden, his agents and sympathizers, that we're safer? Is it fair to say that?''     
   And General Petraeus's response: ``Absolutely.'' It only took one word, my colleagues, ``absolutely,'' we are safer. 
   And Ambassador Crocker responded this morning in a similar manner, and let me give his quote: ``In the little over a year that I have been in Iraq, we have seen a significant degradation of al Qaeda's presence and its abilities. Al Qaeda is our mortal and strategic enemy. So to the extent that al Qaeda's capacities have been lessened in Iraq, and they have been significantly lessened, I do believe that makes America safer.'' And this is the direct quote from Ambassador Crocker's testimony this morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   We will get into now the third point that I said, Mr. Speaker, at the outset of the hour that I wanted to emphasize, and that's the question of is it worth it? Despite the progress that we have talked about tonight that General Petraeus told the Senate this morning, there are those who would ignore that progress and still as they did last September. Maybe it was a more credible argument then. Of course, they were making it before the surge had even gotten there, not really giving it much of a chance. But today to argue for immediate withdrawal and to give up, to snatch defeat literally from the jaws of victory, that's basically what they're saying: It's not worth it. It's not worth it. It's time to quit. And this is what General Petraeus said this morning, another quote, and I share it with my colleagues: 
   ``I do believe it's worth it. I took on the task,'' and just like General Petraeus he would say this, ``the privilege of command of Multi-National Force Iraq because I do believe that it's worth it and I do believe the interests there are of enormous importance, again, to our country, not just the people of Iraq and the people of that region, and the world.'' That's a quote taken from General Petraeus's testimony this morning. 
   I am pleased at this time, Mr. Speaker, to yield to another one of my classmates, the gentleman from Iowa, Representative Steve King. Representative King is not only on the Armed Services Committee, but I do believe he's on the Committee on Foreign Affairs. And he is extremely knowledgeable about foreign affairs, about national defense, about so many critical issues. So it's indeed a pleasure to welcome this evening another of my classmates, the distinguished gentleman from Iowa, Representative King.

   Mr. GINGREY. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, I will yield right back to the gentleman, but I think his point is just so well taken. 
   This morning, I started the day at 8 o'clock in the morning with a rally in the park on the Senate side, and it was organized by a group called Veterans For Freedom, Vets For Freedom. And 400 of them, 400, were there to give us that very message that Representative King is talking about, that it is worth it, it is worth it, and to beg us, literally to beg us. And I am sure, my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, you will be hearing from them. We will all be hearing from them. I did today. The members from Georgia that are part of the Veterans For Freedom are here, and they're going to make sure that we hear that message loud and clear. 
   And I yield back to my friend.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Iowa so much for being with us. 
   As we rapidly approach the conclusion of this hour, I wanted to make a few other points. The gentleman from Iowa spoke of it when he said we are not there for their oil. We are not there for their land. We're not there for anything except to try to bring a democracy to the Middle East. And you think about the history of this country in other battles that we have been in, in World War I in Belleau Wood, in World War II on the beaches of Normandy, or in the Argonne Forest, in the Korean war, in the rice paddies of Vietnam or the sands of Iwo Jima, whom were we fighting for, and what did we ask for in return? We were fighting for other people as much as we were fighting for ourselves, and the only thing that this country asked for in return was a little  bit of dirt to bury our dead. We don't bury our fallen soldiers anymore on foreign soil, but that's really all we ever asked for. 
   The 4,000 that we have lost in this battle, how can we possibly turn our back on them? How can we turn our back on the Veterans For Freedom that I talked about that we met this morning? 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I have sufficient time, and I hope you will allow me to read these 25 names from my district, the 11th of Georgia, who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this conflict to bring a little bit of democracy to the Middle East. And let me read quickly, Mr. Speaker: 
   Sergeant Michael Hardegree from Villa Rica; Lance Corporal Samuel Large, Jr., also from Villa Rica; Specialist Joshua Dingler from Hiram, Georgia; Sergeant Paul Saylor from Bremen; Captain Hayes Clayton from Marietta, my home; Private First Class Jesus Fonseca, Marietta; Lance Corporal Stephenen Johnson, Marietta; Airman First Class Antoine Holt, Georgia; Sergeant Brian Ardron, Acworth; Private First Class Marquis Whitaker from Columbus; Staff Sergeant John McGee, Columbus; Sergeant First Class David Salie from Columbus; Corporal Tyler Dickens, Columbus.     
   Staff Sergeant Rickey Scott, Columbus, Georgia; Corporal John Tanner, Columbus, Georgia; Sergeant Thomas Strickland, Douglasville, Georgia; Spec. Marvin Camposiles, Austell; Spec. Benjamin Bartlett, Jr., Manchester, Georgia; Lance Corporal Juan Lopez, Whitfield; Private John M. Henderson, Jr., from Columbus; First Lieutenant Michael Fasnacht, from Columbus; Lance Corporal Kristopher C. Warren, from Resaca; Specialist Justin Johnson, from Rome, Georgia; First Lieutenant Tyler Brown, president of the student body at Georgia Tech, died in Iraq, from Atlanta, Georgia; Jack Hensley, a civilian contractor from Marietta, Georgia was beheaded by the brutality known as al Qaeda. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I conclude my time, again, I thank you for allowing me to read those names. 
   And my colleagues, I hope that some of those families are listening because I pledge to you we will not turn our back on them. They have paid the ultimate sacrifice. You are continuing to pay the sacrifice, but God bless you for the support of this commander in chief and with your patience and our determination here in Congress, we will give victory a chance, and we will achieve victory. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, in the other body yesterday, under the leadership of Senator Reid, the gentleman from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, had a resolution supporting the funding of our troops, and the Senate leadership prevented that resolution from being brought to the floor under regular order because they wanted first to bring a resolution condemning the President. 
   Now the Speaker of the House has announced that next week we will have a resolution brought to the floor of this body condemning the President's plan for a new way forward in Iraq. 
   I challenge the Speaker and the Democratic leadership, if that resolution is on this floor, to bring forward also the resolution of a true war hero, Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, supporting the continued funding of the troops in Iraq. 
   We have heard Members on the other side of the aisle continue to say we can and will, if necessary, cut off funding. This will give them an opportunity to put their money where their mouth is.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my former chairman on the Rules Committee for the time. And I rise in opposition to this rule and the underlying resolution, with some degree of sadness, because I certainly have great, great respect for the representatives of the territories and the District of Columbia. They are sitting here on the floor and speaking, and they are great Members. But I have to oppose this because I think that indeed, Mr. Speaker, it will be ruled unconstitutional in the final analysis. 
   And I know that the Democratic majority in the first 2 weeks, in the 100 hours, with the Six for '06 legislative agenda, the bumper sticker issues that were poll-tested; if you took an issue like this and you said to the American people, We are about to grant voting rights to the members from the territories that do not pay Federal income taxes, and these votes can raise your taxes, and they don't pay Federal income taxes, I think that the poll on that would be at least 90 percent in opposition. So if you are going to do things on a poll-driven agenda, you would not be doing this. 
   I think that it may end up being a moot point, Mr. Speaker, because voting in the Committee of the Whole, giving the Members that right, it may never occur. It may be a moot point, because with these closed rules and no regular order, there may never be any votes in the Committee of the Whole. 
   So I regrettably rise to oppose this. I think it is absolutely wrong. But I have great respect for my colleagues from the territories and the District of Columbia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the well this evening to talk about a very, very important subject that we just went through some very contentious debate on, and my colleagues are familiar with that, and it is the immigration issue. The American people are familiar with it. And the people in the great State of Georgia, the 11th Congressional District that I serve, are familiar with it as well. 
   And the big concern was to not do something in a, quote, ``comprehensive way'' that resulted in granting amnesty to up to 12 million people, possibly more than that, that have over the last 20 years, since 1986, the last time we granted amnesty to 3 million at that time, we have not secured our borders and because of porous borders,  it is estimated that something approaching 400,000 a year, and some are turned back, obviously, but approximately 400,000 get through. I am talking about illegal immigrants now. And when you do the math over 20 years, that is how we got to the 12 million that are here today. So that bill was all about we need to have the triggers. I am very proud of my Senators, our senior Senator SAXBY CHAMBLISS and JOHNNY ISAKSON. JOHNNY ISAKSON who obviously had the trigger so you couldn't do any of this stuff even if you didn't call it amnesty, you had to secure the borders first. 
   In the final analysis, because of their great concern, our Senators from Georgia said ``no'' to the bill that was being cooked up on the Senate side and could not be amended to their satisfaction. I am proud of them for that. 
   But there is another problem, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, something that maybe the American people are not sufficiently aware of, and that is the fact that so many people come into this country every year on a program called the visa waiver program. I want to repeat that because I want each and every one of you to remember this, the visa waiver program. It too was started back in the mid-1980s, about the time of the amnesty bill we were talking about. What it does is this: it allows citizens from 27 countries, mostly Western European, and it didn't start as 27, but basically the initial countries were the United Kingdom, Germany, France, some of the countries that are really our best friends and best allies, there is no denying that. Without question, over the history of our great country, we have had wonderful friendships in Western Europe. 
   So the thinking back in 1986 was we need to not spend our time on worrying about doing background checks and our consulates, and those are the offices of our Department of State that exist in all of the other countries. They are part of our embassies. There are more consulates in a country than embassies. My colleagues know what I am talking about, and hopefully folks listening understand that you have State Department employees in all of these countries so when people come and apply for a visa and they want to come visit the United States or come over here to study, or get permanent legal resident, a so-called green card, they have to go through our consulates. They have to fill out forms and pay an application fee. They are all checked to a fare-thee-well, as the old Georgia expression goes, but it was decided in 1986, you know, for the countries where these are our friends, they look like us and in some instances they speak our own language, we don't need to worry about them, and so let's just let them come in without a visa. Therefore, the visa waiver program. 
   Now it has been expanded to 27 countries and growing. So they just show a passport. Our customs agents at our ports of entry, airports mainly, simply look at the passport. If the passport is from one of the 27 countries, they put a stamp on it and in the person comes. 
   The thinking is this is good for relations with other countries and we want to be on a friendly level with them. And of course it promotes tourism. And certainly folks involved in the travel industry, and maybe it is businessmen coming over for a 2-week or 2-month period of time. Actually, under the visa waiver program, the maximum amount of time that can be spent here under that program is 90 days. 
   In the year 2005, Mr. Speaker, 15 million people came to the United States under the visa waiver program. At first it was just a temporary program in 1986, and then it was expanded to more countries. And finally it was made permanent in about the year 2000, this visa waiver program. But we began to realize maybe there was a little bit of security risk, and so we said, look, we want to make sure these passports that we are just looking at and stamping and letting folks come in from these so-called friendly countries, that these are legitimate passports, that these are not fraudulent documents. 
   Those of my colleagues, and most of you are either parents or grandparents, and you have gone through those teenage years yourself and with your children and grandchildren, and you know it is pretty darn easy to get a fake driver's license. And of course my children, adult children now, never did that. They wouldn't do anything like that, Mr. Speaker. But some of their friends did, and they showed me how it was done. You can go on the Internet and just take your picture and paste it on. That is the kind of thing that is bad enough if it is a fake driver's license in this country, but when we are talking about a fake passport, and they are pretty easy to fraudulently prepare, that is where the danger arises. 
   Some of the countries, the 27 countries that are participating with us in the visa waiver program, have reported that they have had literally hundreds of passports stolen, and we don't really keep a close record on that but we should. We should be very worried about that, as a matter of fact. 
   So in 2000 we said, look, here is the way we prevent passport document fraud when people are coming into this country under the visa waiver program. It is a passport issued by Spain, France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Australia, and I'm not going to name all 27 of the countries, but we want to say, look, we want a digital photograph that we can scan. We don't want some fake overlay laminated on a passport, and we also want to be able to machine read this document. 
   So, therefore, all of you countries that are participating in this program, that is promoting business and tourism in exchange between countries, you are going to have to prepare your passport in that manner so we know that you have done a background check and we can do a background check. We look at that passport. We know we have a watch list, a terrorist watch list, a criminal felon watch list, so that we do not just let them come in that minute, 1 1/2 minutes that a busy custom agent has at the Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport. They have to do this quickly. If you spend 10 minutes per passport, you are going to have some people outraged, and that is not acceptable. They have to be able to do that quickly. 
   We knew this back in 2000, and keep in mind, my colleagues, I am talking about a year, a year and a half before 9/11 occurred. We said in the reauthorization of 
   the visa waiver program and making it permanent, the countries had to have these passports based on biometrics, and we called that program US-VISIT. It has not been completed to this day. And after 9/11, of course, a huge wake-up call on many aspects of how we can do things better in regard to maybe we need some armed guards on the planes, and maybe we need to secure the cockpit door and maybe we should allow in certain circumstances the pilots, if they are trained properly, to carry a weapon, we have done a lot of these things to improve. 
   And of course all these lines, and every Member of this body, every one of you, probably waited in line today for a good little while getting through security before you were allowed to go to the gate to board your plane, and hopefully the plane was on time. If you were delayed too long going through security, hopefully the plane was delayed. 
   We continue to do these things, but yet this very important aspect, US-VISIT, to make sure, Mr. Speaker, those 15 million folks that come in for business or tourism or whatever, to promote goodwill with these other countries, and I am for that, but they are to stay 90 days. We don't know where they are or how to find them if they don't go back home in 90 days. And to think that even after 9/11, we still keep putting off that date certain these countries have to have and abide by US-VISIT and have to have the biometric passports and we have to have all of the equipment at our ports of entry so the custom agent can simply swipe that passport and it is fine, or a red light goes off. 
   This is what I am here tonight to talk about, and hopefully you are aware of it. I think most of my colleagues are. But we need to be thinking about this. We need to be thinking about it in a bipartisan way. This is not one of those issues that we should be fighting about politically. We know that this is for the citizens of this country, whether they are Democrats or Republicans, whether they are young or old, whatever their occupation, their religion, ethnicity. This is for everybody. This is not for PHIL GINGREY's district, the 11th Congressional District of northwest Georgia. This is for all of my colleagues' districts. That is why I am here tonight  talking about such an important thing, and I hope we can get everybody's attention on this. 
   Later on in the hour I am going to talk about a bill that I introduced in regard to the visa waiver program, talk a little bit about what is going on in the other body in regard to the 9/11 bill that we passed I think the first day we were voting on anything in this 110th Congress, the so-called 6 for '06, to do those things that the 9/11 families asked us to do. 
   After all, they suffered then, are suffering now, and will suffer forever. We listened to them on both sides of the aisle, and we passed a bill. We did most of what they asked in the 109th Congress under different control, and now we have added a few things in the 110th Congress, and we are waiting on the other body. There are some provisions in their version in regard to this visa waiver program that gives me a little heartburn; we will talk about that as well. 
   I am expecting that some of my colleagues will join me during this hour, Mr. Speaker, and certainly when they get to the floor after their busy meetings that they are attending right now, I am going to yield time to them to give a little different aspect to this visa waiver issue or some other issue of concern to them. 
   I am a proud member, Mr. Speaker, of the Immigration Reform Caucus. In this 110th Congress, the Immigration Reform Caucus under the leadership of the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray), we have worked hard to make sure that the Immigration Reform Caucus is a bipartisan group of Members, and it is.     
   I'm not going to stand here and try to name names, but we have got great Members on both sides of the aisle under the leadership of Congressman Bilbray from California, and I think that's good. I think that's refreshing that Members know that this is not for politics. This is for policy, and this is for protection. 
   I see that Mr. Bilbray is actually on the floor now, and I will look forward to hearing his perspective on the visa waiver program. And then we'll develop a colloquy during the next 40 minutes or so. At this time, it's my distinct privilege to welcome him to the floor and to this Special Order hour. I'm grateful to our leadership, the Republican leadership, for making this the minority party's Special Order hour for the evening and that Congressman Bilbray is going to share the time with me. So I yield to my friend from California.

I can't tell you how many of the 9/11 families are a part of this group, but this is how they feel. This is a quote. ``If Islamic extremists commit another 9/11, it will not make any difference to the victims of that attack that the people responsible carried French passports rather than ones issued by Iran, Saudi Arabia or Lebanon.'' 
   This is when they endorsed the bill that I introduced, and we will talk about that a little bit later, but I wanted to yield back to the gentleman for his additional thoughts. But I thought it would be good at this point to interject this quote from the 9/11 Families for a Secure America.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Mr. Speaker, the next slide that I want my colleagues to focus in on now is really the kind of a passport that we are wanting, and that U.S. VISIT, and indeed the law in regard to the visa waiver program that was made permanent in 2000 requires them to have this type of passport because let me make one thing perfectly clear to my colleagues. 
   The visa waiver program trusts the security of our Nation to the background check capabilities and the passport procedures of all these foreign governments, the 27 countries that I mentioned and expanding all the time. 
   Basically, what we're saying, and if you will look at this next slide, on one side of the passport would be a digital photograph, again, one that is scannable. We have these iris scans, not just the old-fashioned finger prints, but everything in a digital way, including the photograph on the passport. And then I'm going to have to get a little closer to read this, but a machine readable passport has two lines of text, has letters, numbers and something called chevrons. Those are those greater than or less than, these little upside down Vs that you put, but it's a way of bringing a secure method to make sure people are not using fraudulent documents. 
   I want to talk a little bit now, Mr. Speaker, about some of the things that have been happening lately. It's hard to believe that 9/11 was almost 6 years ago. 2001, we're now 2007 and approaching September. It's almost unbelievable, but people tend to forget, and that's part of the problem. 
   One of my colleagues, whenever he gives a 1 minute or a 5-minute speech or has an opportunity to speak from the well, he always says, and this is the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), as he concludes, and we will never forget 9/11. God bless him for doing that. Sometimes it gets a little trite, but JOE WILSON knows of what he speaks. 
   But it's easy to forget, but nobody has forgotten about these doctors, doctors, medical doctors, health professionals that just within the last couple, 3 weeks in London and at the airport in Scotland, Glasgow, tried to blow up the terminal with the car bomb, laden with highly explosive material, and there was a warning in fact. Someone had said in some text messaging, beware of those who would cure you, meaning the doctors will kill you; those who cure you will kill you. 
   Well, these doctors in the United Kingdom were citizens of that country. I mean, they had passports, British passports, and in fact, a couple of them had actually, Mr. Speaker, made an application to come to the United States, I think to come to a hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They wanted to practice medicine here. Everybody does want to practice medicine in the United States because, despite the previous hour from the other side, we do have a great health care system. Certainly it needs some improvement, and we're going to work on that hopefully in a bipartisan way, but these terrorists, those who would cure you that would kill you, were trying, at least some of them, to come into this country. 
   And they could have come in under this visa waiver program and simply showed a passport that did not, by the way, have a digital photo or any digital text or iris scanning. And we didn't have a U.S. VISIT machine that we could run that passport through that so that that would immediately come, go into a data bank so when the 90 days were up or the period of time that they planned to stay, that we could find them, ferret them out and have the ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, agents go after them. 
   So this is not child's play that we're talking about here. This happened just within the last 3 weeks, and these were homegrown British terrorists that had ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. 
   I don't doubt the United Kingdom was one of our closest allies. Indeed, they are. Tony Blair has been our best friend and Gordon Brown will be and has been one of our best friends, but this just goes to show that even our greatest friends can be vulnerable to these homegrown terrorists possessing legitimate citizenship documentation and authorized legal passports. 
   So this is where we are, and this is what's going on this hour, and I will be happy to yield back to my good friend and colleague, the chairman, once again of our Immigration Reform Caucus for additional thoughts. I proudly, by the way, serve on his executive committee of the Immigration Reform Caucus, and I yield to my friend from California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Colleagues, what Mr. Bilbray is talking about, of course, is almost unbelievable, but what he says is true. He knows of what he speaks. 
   In December of this past year, just 8 months ago, the Department of Homeland Security said that they were going to temporarily, not dismantle, thank God, but temporarily suspend the US-Visit program. I am not sure why they made that decision, maybe too much work, they don't have enough money, I don't know. But we asked them to do it in 2000, we asked them to do it again in 2001 with the PATRIOT Act. We asked them in 2002 with the Secure Border Act. We put deadlines on it. 
   I guess it's kind of like the fence bill. I know my constituents in the 11th District of Georgia know all about that. They asked me, didn't you guys, Phil, weren't you part of a group that had an amendment in the 109th Congress where when you guys were in control, when the Republicans were in control, wasn't it your amendment that was adopted that called for 700 miles of fencing along the 2,100 mile southern border where we have got some severe problems, not just people coming, seeking jobs, but potential drug lords and gang members, and, yes, terrorists carrying maybe even a nuclear weapon in a suitcase or a briefcase? 
   I said, yes, I was part of that. We did pass it. I am very proud of it. Then we came back and passed it again. They want to know why we have only got about 15 miles of the 700. It's hard to explain, and we need to have some conversations with the administration in regard to things that the Congress says need to be done, and we vote them into law, and appropriate money. Yet things either don't happen or happen far too slowly. 
   To think, though, that they just decided we are going to suspend this US-Visit, and as Mr. Bilbray, the gentleman from California, just said, this is not the time to suspend US-Visit; this is the time to ramp it up, to make sure that we have a machine that reads these passports at every port of entry. 
   Hey, if American Express can do it, it seems to me the United States of America can do it. American Express and Visa and MasterCard, they have been doing it a long time. They don't get any cash unless they know you are who you say you are. 
   This is crazy that we haven't completed this. It's just outrageous, outrageous to suspend a program like that when we need it more than ever. 
   I know my friend from California has a thought on that, because he just stood up. I look forward to your comments.

   Mr. GINGREY. How does the saying go? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I think that's exactly the point the Congressman is making in regard to the American people. 
   They are not happy about being fooled about border security and the nonbuilt fence. They are not happy about this either. They are not happy one bit about suspending this US-Visit program. 
   I have the next slide, and I think my colleagues will recognize some of these infamous characters. I want to point them out to you, though, once again. Over here, I will point to him, this gentleman right here, is named Richard Reid, but he is better known as the shoe bomber, the shoe bomber. 
   The shoe bomber flew from Paris with a passport, a citizen from a visa waiver country, got on a plane, had no intention, of course, with a visa waiver, he could stay in the United States for 90 days. He had no intention of getting to the United States. He just wanted to blow that plane to smithereens. Fortunately, we caught him, from a visa waiver program country. 
   The guy next to him, that's Moussaoui, Zacarias Moussaoui. He is known as the 20th hijacker. He was from Morocco, a French citizen from Morocco, living in France. He flew from London to Chicago and then, as we all remember in the 9/11 report, in particular, this guy, this terrorist with a passport, a legal passport, then enrolled in flight school in Oklahoma City. 
   Thank goodness that we had very attentive FBI agents who recognized that here was someone that was in this country under the visa waiver program who overstayed his visa. Well, not really a visa, but he overstayed the 90 days, and, fortunately, we caught him. He was the 20th hijacker. 
   To my near side are the photographs of the Fort Dix Six. These are the so-called pizza delivery guys who were going on the military base at Fort Dix, New Jersey. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that represent New Jersey understand the potential horror that these guys, these guys, these terrorists that were here with a passport from a visa waiver country were about to inflict on one of our major military installations. 
   Well, what I want to talk about now is what I plan to do about this problem with the visa program, not to expand it. The gentleman from California is absolutely right. The other Chamber,  there are Members in this 9/11 bill that we passed back in January, and it's about to go to conference, the Senate version being a little different than the House version, there were some Senators that wanted to expand the visa waiver program, not limit it to the 27, but to expand it far beyond that. 
   As my colleague pointed out, his Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, said maybe we ought not to do that yet. Well, I do commend her. I join him in commending her for that. 
   But I want to go a step further. What I want to do, and this is called for in my legislation, H.R. 1342, H.R., House of Representatives bill, 1342, the Secure Entry Act, it's time to suspend this program. It's not time to suspend US-Visit. It's not time to expand the U.S. visa waiver program, as Representative Bilbray and Senator Feinstein so well know. 
   We need to suspend this program and say to those countries, the 27 or any others that we expand to, I am not opposed in the future to expand it if they have those biometric machine-readable passports, and they have done the due diligence before they have given those passports, just like you would with a visa. If somebody is going to come over here for two or three years to study or something, they have to answer something like 40 different questions and all these background checks. 
   Not so with a passport. Getting a passport is about like getting a driver's license or a bank credit card or something. It's just a question or two. What's your name, where do you live, give us a photo. 
   We are not going to be safe with this program, this program that was initiated, I said at the outset of the hour, back in the mid-1980s to promote tourism, friendship and cultural exchange and to promote international trade and business. The Statue of Liberty says it all. But we are living in a different time now.     
   We are living in a time that we are not safe with this program. 15 million, I mentioned this earlier, Mr. Speaker, in the hour. 15 million people used this program in the last year that we were counting, 2005. It is probably more than that now. Certainly if we expand it, it will be more than that. So I introduced H.R. 1342, the Secure Entry Act, and this would suspend not end, not end. And I want to say to the ambassadors from the State Departments for these other countries, I have talked to them. They say, well, you are going to hurt tourism. Well, tourism is great, but you tell it to the families of the 9/11 victims, the over 3,000 that are no longer with us. We can do this. 
   But it seems like in this body and in any situation where you have to accomplish things, people for some reason want to wait until the 11th hour and they won't do it and they will procrastinate and they will drag their feet. It's too much trouble, don't have personnel, don't have the money. Well, you have got to make them do it. And you say, we will suspend the program and you can come to this country only if you have a visa, not with a passport, until you have done what we have our laws require you to do. That is it. That is the bill. And I think when you consider the safety of our people, it is not too much to ask. 
   We have another. This was someone that came in 1993. I am going back now a little bit. Remember, my colleagues, the first attack on the World Trade Center? They didn't bring it down, but they came close. They came very close, killed a few people, caused a lot of damage. And we treated it as some criminal act, not as an act of terrorism which is what it clearly was. Well, one of those characters we were able to catch, Ahmed Ajaj. And the slide, if you look closely says, ``On September 1, 1992, Ahmed Ajaj fraudulently presented a Swedish, and, yes, my colleagues they are one of the 27 visa waiver countries, presented a Swedish passport without a visa for INS inspection when he arrived at JFK Airport in New York on a flight from Pakistan. Thank goodness, on secondary inspection Ajaj's luggage was searched revealing six bomb making manuals, six as if one wouldn't do, videotapes calling for terrorism against Americans, multiple fake passports, maybe some of those stolen visa waiver passports that we are not keeping up with, and a cheat sheet on how to lie to United States immigration inspectors. They are good at that, these people. Fortunately, Ajaj was arrested for passport fraud, and he was serving, long since over, with a 6-month sentence at the time that his fellow conspirators, his co-conspirators attacked the World Trade Center February 26, 1993. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to show another slide, and this is from the Associated Press dated July 13, 2007, 3 days ago. And here is what the Associated Press said: ``Al Qaeda is stepping up its efforts to sneak terror operatives into the United States and has acquired most of the capabilities it needs to strike here, according to a new U.S. intelligence assessment. The group will bolster its efforts to position operatives inside the United States borders. U.S. officials have expressed concern about the ease with which people can enter the United States through Europe,'' that is where most of these visa waiver countries are, in the continent of Europe, ``because of a program that allows most Europeans to enter without visas.'' 
   That is where we are, Mr. Speaker. That is exactly why I am here tonight. That is why the chairman of the bipartisan House Immigration Reform Caucus is with me during this hour. It is that important. It is that important. And we deeply appreciate you listening to us because it is not all about, as we talked about at the top of the hour, this bill that just went crashing down in flames. Because I think, and many of my colleagues feel, and fortunately the Senate rejected anything that looked like amnesty, we have got to secure those borders first and foremost, and that was what everybody has said. Well, maybe, a sigh of relief certainly from Georgians. But this is a different issue but equally important. This is what you call internal security. Not necessarily just securing the southern border, but who do you let in, and under what terms do you let them in, and where are they going? Are they going to do what they say they are going to do, or are they who they say they are? And if they overstay, even if they are legitimate, who is going to round them up? 15 million of them. 15 million in 2005, maybe more now. 
   Listen to this, Mr. Speaker, some of the participating countries, and I would like my colleagues to pay attention. The 27, I may not mention them all, are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Monaco, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. I left out a few, but you get the picture. You get the picture. I think there is something like 43 countries in Europe. Most of them, 27 at least, are part of this visa waiver program. 
   We are getting close to the hour that we need to wrap up, but before I do that I want to yield back to my friend from California, who is really a stalwart on immigration reform because he knows the problems that it has created if we don't do the due diligence that the American people have elected us to do. And he knows what has happened and the havoc that it has created in his State, our most populous State, the State of California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I heard all during the fall campaign from the Democratic side of the aisle, the new majority, how they were going to fully implement, fully implement, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and talk about how the then Republican majority failed miserably, and the 9/11 Commission gave the Republicans failing grades, failing grades for passing 39 out of 41 recommendations by the bipartisan commission.     
   Now, when I do the math on that, that is 95 percent. I do not know about your school, Mr. Speaker, but at Georgia Tech, 95 percent was a solid A. 
   But the point I want to make is that in no way, shape, or form is the new majority coming forward with full implementation of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. And I hope the media and I hope the 9/11 families do not give you a pass on this. 
   When you look at those 41 recommendations, a couple that we were not able to pass, that we did not pass, and I think we probably should have, one of them was especially in regard to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, having that as a balanced committee, almost like the House Committee on Standards of Official Behavior, the ethics committee, where you have an equal balance between the two sides, the commission has called for a one-vote margin, a one-person margin for the majority. You have structured that committee with a 12-9 majority for the Democrats. 
   Also, the commission has called for open disclosure, Mr. Speaker, in regard to the funding for intelligence, that every Member of this body should have an opportunity to see what each of 15 agencies, not just the CIA but all those agencies embedded within the Department of Defense and under the control of the Deputy Secretary of Intelligence within the Department, we need to know what that spending is. So let us tell the truth and be honest with the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, a little earlier, the distinguished majority leader, who I have great respect for, and I know you have great respect for Mr. Hoyer, said that the Democratic co-Chair of the 9/11 Commission, Mr. Hamilton, said: ``If H.R. 1 is implemented and fully funded, the American people will be safer.'' No, duh. But at what cost? 
   And, Mr. Speaker, what the former Republican majority has done in regard to container security initiatives, we screen every container.

   Captain Clayton was a classmate of my daughter, Laura Neil. She remembers his strength of character. Others have remembered his strength of faith. Indeed, Captain Clayton leaves behind a legacy of living by the highest moral principles. 
   Before enlisting in the Army, Captain Clayton was known as a standout defensive end on the football team at Marietta High School and a skilled Army ROTC member at Fort Valley State University in Georgia. 
   Captain Clayton leaves behind his parents, Reverend Hayes and Marlena Clayton, his brothers Eric and Michael, his loving wife Army First Lieutenant Monica Clayton, and a precious 4-month-old son, Hayes, III, who proudly carries on his father's name. 
   Mr. Speaker, my prayers go out to his family and my deepest gratitude goes out for his selfless and deep sacrifice for our Nation. I ask you to join me in honoring the distinguished memory of Captain Hayes Clayton.

   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, we hear from the other side that we are here eight, 10, 12 times for the children. And certainly we are. On both sides of the aisle, we are here for the children. But we are here for the needy children. And that's what we did a month ago when enacting in almost unanimous fashion Senate bill 2499, which expands this SCHIP program for 18 months and not only expands it but increases the spending almost 20 percent, some 800 million additional dollars to cover, yes, these children that President Bush said he was determined to cover. 
   But what the Democratic majority wants to do is increase this program by 140 percent, cover an additional 4 million children on top of the 6 million that are already covered. And as my colleague Representative Deal of Georgia pointed out, of those 4 million, 2 million would be children who are already covered by private health insurance. 
   One of my other colleagues on the other side of the aisle stood up and said shouldn't we provide health insurance for the children of hardworking Americans? Well, no, not if they're making $75,000 a year. 
   We are going to come back to this floor in the next week or two with a $150 billion economic stimulus package to get us out of a recession. We need the money for that. So we don't want to be squandering money to provide health insurance for those who could afford to do it for themselves. I think the program that we have enacted in a bipartisan way said it all, and if we wanted to have this override of the President's veto of this bloated program that the Democrats proffered, increasing the spending by $35 billion just so you can cover 4 million additional children, half of whom do not need that government help, then we should have had that override vote a month ago. 
   The reason we are doing it today is for political reasons in anticipation of embarrassing the President prior to the State of the Union Address next week. It's pure and simple politics. Reject this vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding and I thank Ms. S&#225;nchez and Mr. Lipinski as well, and I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 916 honoring the contributions of Catholic schools across the country, for the upcoming commemoration of National Catholic Schools Week from January 27 to February 2. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a graduate of Catholic elementary and high schools, Sacred Heart Academy and Aquinas High School in Augusta, Georgia, I am keenly aware of the contributions that they provide to the 2.3 million students across this country they teach every year. These include 1,176 students at three Catholic schools in my district, the 11th of Georgia: St. Catherine of Siena in Kennesaw, Georgia; St. Joseph's in my hometown of Marietta, Georgia; and St. Mary's in Floyd County, Rome, Georgia. 
   Not only do Catholic schools, like Sacred Heart and Aquinas, provide a strong and competitive academic environment, they also teach moral and ethical standards, skills for living and self esteem, and a Christian integration of spirit, mind, and body in each of their students.     
   Upon graduating from Aquinas, I thought that the Catholic school curriculum would be what best prepared me for my future. But, Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I was wrong. While the strenuous academics at Sacred Heart and Aquinas did lay the foundation for success at Georgia Tech and the Medical College of Georgia, it was the faith and ethical standards taught at these schools that truly prepared me for life's struggles. 
   Mr. Speaker, while opening and running my medical practice, the respect for life at Sacred Heart and Aquinas led me to value and care for life at all stages from conception on. And now that I have left my medical career to serve as Member of this great body, I find my lessons from these Catholic schools more valuable than ever on a daily basis. 
   We are all confronted with difficult questions that affect millions of lives. If it were not for the moral standards and the faith in God taught at Sacred Heart and Aquinas, I do not believe that I could properly represent the people of northwest Georgia. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools in northwest Georgia and all across our great country provide an incredible valuable service to our education system and truly prepare their students for a bright future. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, support H. Res. 916. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire from my colleague how many more speakers he has remaining.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, I proudly rise to honor a Georgia native, Lieutenant General David Poythress, who has served the State of Georgia as our adjutant general since 1999. 
   Two weeks ago, I attended the change of command ceremony for General Poythress as he stepped down from his post as commander of the Georgia National Guard. 
   General Poythress's long and distinguished military career began at Emory University in Atlanta, where in 1967 he received his law degree, and he graduated as a distinguished military graduate of the Emory ROTC program. 
   After graduation, Mr. Speaker, General Poythress served 4 years on active duty with the United States Air Force  as a judge advocate officer, including 1 year as chief of military justice at Da Nang Air Force Base in Vietnam. 
   Upon returning to civilian life, General Poythress remained in the Air Force Reserve, serving as a judge advocate officer in various positions of increasing responsibility. In 1991, General Poythress returned to active duty to oversee the reserve legal officers during Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1994, and to major general in July of 1999. 
   It was in 1999 that General Poythress took over as the adjutant general of the State of Georgia, where he has commanded 12,000 personnel of the Georgia Army National Guard, the Georgia Air National Guard, and the Georgia State Defense Force now for nearly a decade. 
   Mr. Speaker, in 2006, General Poythress became the first adjutant general in Georgia's 273-year history to wear a third star as a lieutenant general. And for the past 8 years, General Poythress has led Georgia's Guard through some historic changes, and our men and women have performed admirably under his leadership. 
   Not only has General Poythress made a major impact on our Nation's military, but he has also been an irreplaceable asset, Mr. Speaker, to the State of Georgia. General Poythress spent much of his civilian career in public service to the citizens of our great State. He served first as deputy state revenue commissioner, then secretary of the State of Georgia, and finally, commissioner of labor in Georgia. Needless to say, General Poythress's retirement will leave huge shoes to fill in the State of Georgia. 
   Over the past several years, Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed getting to know General Poythress and his lovely wife, Elizabeth, as personal friends, and I appreciate their singular dedication to our Guardsmen. 
   Last year, Mr. Speaker, I even had the opportunity to travel to Iraq with the general, and we met with Georgia's 48th Brigade Combat Team. I know it must have been a joy for General Poythress to see his troops and General Rhodheaver serving our Nation so honorably, but also a painful time, as he remembered the 26 fallen soldiers from the 48th who were lost in some of the most dangerous combat in the Sunni Triangle outside of the city of Baghdad. 
   Through all of the struggles, including the difficult task of assisting Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, General Poythress has led Georgia's Guard with the strength of a commander and the heart, Mr. Speaker, of a public servant. 
   And so I ask my colleagues tonight, join me in honoring Lieutenant General David Poythress for his dedicated service to defending the State of Georgia and the United States of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 1086, recognizing National Nurses Week, which is May 6 through May 12 of this year. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson)--Nurse Johnson--for advancing this legislation to help educate the American people about the critical role that nurses play in health care delivery. 
   With May 12 being the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing, there is not a more appropriate time to celebrate the work done by nurses. As an OB-GYN physician for almost 30 years, I was fortunate to work with intelligent, hardworking, compassionate nurses, and they were indeed a cornerstone of the high quality health care we provided. 
   Madam Speaker, nurses are on the front lines of health care delivery not only here at home but also in Iraq and Afghanistan. Therefore, because we are relying on our nurses so heavily and because we currently are experiencing a shortage of nurses, it is critical to support nurse training programs. That is why I recently joined with a number of my colleagues in supporting title VIII funding to provide loans and grants to our Nation's nursing students. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the goals of National Nurses Week.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND SCHIP EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. And I stand today in full support of this 18-month extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program, and also the 6-month mitigation of the payment cut to our physicians under Medicare. 
   But, Madam Speaker, let me say in regard to that 6-month mitigation, we have done this the whole time that I've been in this Congress, the past 5 years, with a Band-Aid. We're literally doing it this time with a spot Band-Aid, and first thing you know we're going to do a 3-month mitigation and a month-to-month mitigation. It's time to end this flawed sustainable growth rate, just like it's time to end the alternative minimum tax that was not indexed for inflation. They're both flawed, and we need to strike both of them dead permanently. 
   In regard to the Children's Health Insurance Program, Madam Speaker, the distinguished chairman of the Democratic Conference spoke a little earlier, talking about certain children are going to lose their coverage during this 18-month extension. Well, certain children should lose their coverage if their  families make up to 300 percent of the Federal poverty level, which is about $65,000 a year, and it crowds out those children from needy families who are not being covered. 
   So this extension, I want to commend my colleague from Georgia, Nathan Deal, and Ranking Member Barton. This is their bill, and this is exactly what we need to do. We need to make sure we have 90 percent coverage saturation and those children up to 250 percent of the poverty level before we consider anything else. I support this extension.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and this issue is so important, H.R. 1216, and I certainly rise to support it. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Barton from Texas and Chairman Dingell, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Rush and others for bringing it forward. 
   Madam Speaker, when I was in the Georgia general assembly serving in the State senate several years back, I became so involved in teen driving issues. I was an OB/GYN physician, and some of the youngsters that I had delivered, all of the sudden, they were 15, 16 years old, and some of them killed tragically in automobile accidents just simply because they weren't safe. They didn't have the proper training, and so these issues are so hugely important. 
   I became aware of this bill when a couple from my district came to me in Washington several months ago, and their son, their 4-year-old son, had been tragically killed by a vehicle backing over him. And you know, you can't bring these lives back, of course we can't, but this kind of legislation and bringing this kind of safety to help prevent maybe my grandchildren, somebody else's child from going through a tragic situation like that, from which the family never recovers. 
   So, again, to be here today to offer a few words of support for H.R. 1216, the things like automatic power window reversal, rearward visibility, this bill addresses safety risks which have already resulted in the deaths of so many children in this country. So we can't bring them back, but we can help protect our young people in the future, and I strongly support it.

   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also want to thank Chairman Filner and Mr. Buyer, Senators Isakson and Chambliss, but also my Democratic colleagues. The chairman mentioned those, John Lewis, Hank Johnson, David Scott and others, but Tom Price and I introduced this bill, H.R. 4143, many months ago, but we had unanimous support of the Georgia delegation on both sides of the aisle, and as we should, Madam Speaker, because this is the VA's number one priority for authorization in fiscal year 2008 veterans budget. So I am very pleased. 
   I know this is the 11th hour, but thank goodness, because of the leadership on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies, this is coming to fruition. 
   As Chairman Filner pointed out, there are ADA requirement issues. There are patient privacy issues. There are female veterans issues. So this is a hugely important project, and I thank my colleagues for making this happen.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION FINANCING -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank you, and I'm proud to be on the floor this afternoon to talk about some issues that are very important to me and I think very important to most Members of this body and certainly to the American public. 
   Just a few minutes ago, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), a very well, well respected, fine Member of this body, did a 5-minute talking about the problem with Presidential election financing. And I think her comments, Mr. Speaker, were so compelling that indeed people, our guests in the gallery, when she completed her remarks, broke out in spontaneous applause. Maybe they knew that they shouldn't, or maybe they didn't know, but, you know, they were responding to something that they heard that they liked. And certainly, I can understand that. Folks do that every now and then. I almost felt like applauding Ms. Kaptur as well because she was speaking the truth and bringing our attention to a real problem. 
   I used to enjoy so much going around the district, Mr. Speaker, and talking to school children, whether they were at the elementary, middle or high school level, and saying to them, of course, they'd always ask, Well, Congressman Gingrey, what's your favorite issue or what is your favorite thing that you do as a Member of Congress? And I would say to them, what I'm doing right now; what I'm doing right now, speaking to young people to try to inspire them. And heretofore I would say to them, the great, one of the great things about our country is anybody in America can grow up to be President. It doesn't matter who you are or what your background. Anybody in this great country of the United States of America can grow up to be President. 
   Sadly, today, that's probably not true, and I think that's what Ms. Kaptur was trying to point out. There's just something wrong in River City with all these hundreds of millions of dollars that have to be raised for a candidate of either party, the two major political parties, to have a chance to, yes, be grown up now and have an opportunity to become President. There are many people that are very qualified, I think, that would make a great President, man or woman, white or black, it doesn't matter where you come from, your meager beginnings possibly. But you don't have that chance because of what she was pointing out. 
   And by the way, Mr. Speaker, I want to digress just for a moment. Speaking of young people, I don't think we take enough time to thank our young men and women, our young students, our pages that work in this body and in the other body, in the House and the Senate, on behalf of Members of Congress. And usually the pages are here at the request of a Member. And this young man that's here on the floor tonight put these posters up for me and made sure that I've got a cup of water in case my mouth gets a little dry, as we continue to speak over these next 30 to 45 minutes. I think we just owe them a lot of thanks. What they do is much more, of course, than these tasks. And this young man, Edward White, Mr. Speaker, is from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm from the metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia area. I represent northwest Georgia. He's here through Congressman JOHN LEWIS, the dean of the Georgia delegation, his office. And I just want to take an opportunity to thank him and all the young men and women that help us so much and don't get as much credit as they should.     
   But my purpose of this hour was to bring to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, another issue which has gotten completely out of control. And, yes, it has to do with spending, kind of on the theme that Ms. Kaptur brought to us in regard to Presidential elections, and that is the issue of earmarks. 
   Now, the general public, I think, is fed up with so-called earmark abuse. Sometimes we euphemistically will refer to those as ``Member initiatives.'' Some people, of course, don't like that term and they will call it ``pork.'' But the situation is getting completely out of hand, and that's what I want to talk about primarily in the next 30 minutes or so, Mr. Speaker. 
   We can solve this problem. We have got a problem, and it is not unique to the Republican Party. It is not unique to the Democratic Party. I know some of my colleagues, hopefully, who are watching us during this time and maybe the general public is aware of an article just this past week. And I hold up the magazine, Mr. Speaker, it is known as ``CQ Weekly.'' This magazine comes out every week. I know that it's difficult for Members in the back rows of the Chamber to see the magazine that I'm holding up. Maybe the cameras can focus in on that. But basically the title of this article, and there are several articles written about the problem, is ``Playing the Earmark Game.'' ``Playing the Earmark Game.'' 
   Let me reference here in just a second my first slide, this poster to my left, to show you what I'm talking about. 
   Now, what is an earmark? Well, an earmark is when a Member of a congressional district sees a need among those 670,000 people that he or she represents. Possibly a school system or a county commissioner or just an individual, or maybe it's a Head Start program, has brought an issue to that Member, Mr. Speaker, and says, We have a great need, Congressman or Congresswoman, in our district. You represent us. We voted for you. We have great confidence in you. But our community has a desperate need, and I want you to ask the Federal Government to try to help us in the funding process. 
   Well, when the Member looks at that and decides that that is a very worthwhile project and then sort of applies  to the appropriators, that's called an earmark. And it could be a very, very good, worthy project. It could be a sewer project, to help a community to redevelop to get themselves back on their feet, and that is an earmark, but that's not bad. And that is when I would say this is a Member initiative and it is an appropriate thing to do. 
   But, unfortunately, as this magazine so clearly points out, this process is ripe with the potential for abuse. Just like Ms. Kaptur was talking about in regard to the financing of Presidential elections and that money chase. It is absolutely ripe, this earmarking opportunity or Member initiative, it is so ripe for abuse. 
   And let me ask my colleagues to reflect on this first chart, this first slide, for just a minute. And this is from the Citizens Against Government Waste, a watchdog group. Thank God for watchdog groups. Citizens Against Government Waste calls this slide pork barrel spending. Pork barrel spending or earmarks or Member initiatives, if you like. Pork barrel spending, 1995 to 2007, this year. 
   My colleagues and Mr. Speaker, this is the total amount for the House and the Senate, 535 Members. The total amount in 1995 was $10 billion. You can say that that is a very small percentage of the overall world of discretionary spending or the total budget, which includes, of course, Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and all the entitlement spending, mandatory spending. But $10 billion out of the discretionary amount. Well, over these 12 years, Mr. Speaker, that amount has grown until the year 2006 to $29 billion. In 2007 it drops down a little bit, but that was an anomaly because we only passed four of the 12 spending bills, and the rest of them had no earmarks in them when they bundled. But this trend is a steep slope upward, and it is getting worse and worse, both in total amount and in the percentage of all the discretionary spending that Members of Congress have an opportunity to control. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, this chart points it out very clearly that this spending for earmarks is becoming what I would call runaway spending, totally out of control. And, again, the CQ Weekly does such a wonderful job of explaining why this process can be so bad. It can be good, and I think, and I will talk about that a little later in the hour, with meaningful legislation that, hopefully, Members on both sides of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, the majority party and the minority party, can look at this and say, you know, Congressman Gingrey, you are absolutely right. We're getting sick and tired of picking up the newspaper almost weekly and seeing yet another Member of this august body who has this tremendous privilege, Mr. Speaker, to represent 670,000 for the House Members and an entire State for the Senators. What a privilege. What an honor. But you pick up that newspaper, and the names are people where you say, That's one of our best Members. That is a guy or that is a lady that I have known for the last 5 or 6 years, and whether she be a Republican or a Democrat, and you think, I just can't believe this. I can't believe that that Member would be doing anything that potentially is dishonest. 
   Now, sometimes these newspaper articles are not a court of law and you have to take some of that with a grain of salt. But I am telling you, when you look into that, Mr. Speaker, and you read and you kind of connect the dots, and they are fairly easy to connect, you start thinking if it looks like a duck and it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it may well be a duck. So we have got a problem. We have a problem that we can correct, and I think I have got a solution. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, one of the solutions that Members have talked about, and the gentleman from Arizona in particular, Representative JEFF FLAKE, one of my colleagues, has talked about this, about why don't we just absolutely eliminate, totally eliminate, all earmarks? In fact, I have got another slide, and I think I will reference that in just a second because this is certainly the appropriate time. Another Member on the majority side of the aisle has virtually said the same thing. Let me show you a quote, as we put up that second slide. 
   Colleagues, I want you to look at this poster, this second slide, if you will. I referenced Mr. Flake of Arizona, but here is another Member. And I will read it for you because it is very difficult to see in the back of the Chamber, and I understand that. The printing is small. And here is what it says, and this was a quote from last year in the Wall Street Journal, in fact: 
   ``If she were to become Speaker in the next Congress, Pelosi said she would press to severely reduce earmarks.'' 
   And then here's the quote: 
   ``Personally, myself, I'd get rid of all of them.'' Then the quote begins again. She says, ``None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism the public has, and the fiscal responsibility of it.'' 
   Now, I want to repeat this. Mr. Speaker, bear with me because I think this definitely needs repeating because it is really what Ms. Kaptur said just a few minutes ago in regard to the Presidential fundraising activities, and she got, I guess, what you would call a 
   standing ovation for her remarks. 
   ``Pelosi said she would press to severely reduce earmarks. `Personally, myself, I'd get rid of all of them. None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism the public has, and the fiscal irresponsibility of it.''' Virtually the same thing that my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Flake) has said in this body, Mr. Speaker, on numerous occasions. 
   And yet, Speaker Pelosi is on track this year to take home $100 million, more than 1 percent of all the House earmarks. And I am not standing here, Mr. Speaker, suggesting that those Member initiatives on behalf of the Speaker or anybody else, any other Member of this body, is for anything but the most worthy projects in her district, and I'm sure that that is the case. I am sure that every one of those Member requests on behalf of Speaker Pelosi would pass anybody's smell test and would survive any kind of challenge to strike them if a Member wanted to do that on this floor, and a Member can do that and then we have a fair and open vote on it. No, I am not suggesting any such thing, and I have great respect for the Speaker. 
   But as this article points out so clearly, everybody in this process of being able to get earmarks for their district, all Members are not treated equally. I can't remember the exact quote from ``Animal Farm,'' but you know what I am referring to. All Members definitely are not treated equally. That $29 billion worth of earmarks, it's not divided equally. If you look at it and you look at it very carefully, as CQ Weekly has done, and nobody in this Chamber, I think, Mr. Speaker, can deny this, you will see that members of the Appropriations Committee, that is about 65, it is a very selective committee. Most Members want to get on that very powerful committee. They do a lot of great work and it is a nice position to be in. But when you look at each Member, as they have done in CQ Weekly, and you see the discrepancy where some Members may get an opportunity to bring home $6 or $7 million to their district and other Members get an opportunity to bring home $180 million to their district or $100 million to their district, and as you look at it very carefully, it would seem that the members of the Appropriations Committee certainly get favored treatment. The members of the leadership certainly get favored treatment. Members that have been here for a long time who maybe are committee chairmen or chairwomen get favored treatment. And the last favored group, Mr. Speaker, are those Members who are representing districts where it is very competitive and they won by a very narrow margin, maybe literally by the skin of their teeth, and they are up for another re-election where it is going to be really tough.     
   So no matter which party is in control, Republicans do this, the Democrats do this, you let that Member get more opportunities, a bigger bite of the apple, if you will, to give the impression to the folks back home that they've elected the right person; we've got a Member who really can deliver this pork back home. They might rail against everybody else's pork, but that which is brought home by their Member, Mr. Speaker, is welcomed. So this is the way this process goes. 
   On the other hand, a rank-and-file Member, let's say a Member of what we might refer to pejoratively as the ``obscure caucus,'' who represents a district where they are absolutely having  no challenge, no difficulty getting re-elected, maybe their district is inner city and it's been gerrymandered and drawn for them so that no Member of the other party has any opportunity to win that congressional seat. So they're in what we call, and we all know this, my colleagues, they're in what we call a ``safe district.'' They don't have to worry about re-election. Hopefully, they're doing constituent services and they're representing their people well in the way they vote, but they really don't have to worry about a political challenge. 
   So when you look in this magazine, and you look at this article in regard to the fairness issue, you find that they are the ones that get the least amount. And yet in many instances, Mr. Speaker, they are representing districts, maybe an inner-city district, a poor district, a district that has a very poor tax base, it has a decaying infrastructure, it doesn't have a good water and sewage system in a certain part of the district, and they are the ones that need help more than anybody. And yet the way this game is played up here, they're at the back of the line in regard to what they can bring home to their district. I think many times Members don't complain about that because they're afraid if they complain, they'll get nothing. You know, it's a little dangerous to complain. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I come here this hour and talk about this, yeah, with a little bit of trepidation. Have I, as Congressman Gingrey, who represents the 11th Congressional District of northwest Georgia, have I ever asked for a Member initiative? Absolutely. And I've been able to deliver on occasion, not always; most of these requests are turned back. But if it really has merit, yes, I have. And I hope, as I spend this time on the floor talking about this issue that's so problematic, that there won't be any reprisals or repercussions because of that. Because I'm trying to do it, Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan way with a spirit of cooperation and wanting to do as Ms. Kaptur was wanting to do in regard to Presidential election financing, do what's right for this Congress, do what's right for this body. 
   So here is my proposal: we have introduced legislation, and it's called the Earmark Reform Act of 2007, H.R. 3738. We just introduced it today; we had a press conference on it today. I was very, very pleased to be joined with two of my colleagues at the press conference, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mr. Hensarling of Texas, and my good friend and classmate, the gentleman from New Jersey, Representative Scott Garrett. 
   And here is what I would do, Mr. Speaker: I would immediately say to the American public, we are going to slash these so-called ``earmarks'' in half for the next fiscal year. We're going to drop the number down from $29 billion to $14.5 billion. And then we're going to simply divide that number by the total membership of the Congress, the House and the Senate, and that's 535 Members, 435 here, 100 in the Senate. And when you do that division, you come up with a number of $27 million. 
   And you would say to each Member, Mr. Speaker, in this bill, you would say, you have an opportunity to look in your district, and if you want to ask for and receive money from the John Q. Public hardworking taxpayer to fund this project in your district, you're going to be limited to this amount in the first year of this legislation to $27 million. That means the most powerful Member of this body, the most powerful Member of leadership, the most senior Member of this body is not going to be able to get $180 million worth of earmarks while the Members who represent districts that are most in need end up with maybe 3 or $4 million. Each Member has an opportunity, then, to ask for and receive the exact same amount. Because, after all, Mr. Speaker, think about it, we represent 670,000 people, approximately, each Member. You know, they have the same need. And if we're going to do Member initiatives, it ought to be fair and evenly balanced, and that's basically what this bill does. 
   You know, if a Member like Mr. Flake or like Ms. Pelosi, as she was quoted in the Wall Street Journal last year, decides, you know, I don't like this process, I think it's inherently wrong, and it has the potential for massive abuse, and as she says, None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism the public has for them, and the fiscal irresponsibility, then if Mr. Flake or Ms. Pelosi said, you know, I don't want any earmarks for my district, let them apply for grants through the normal process, I will help them, my office will help them, Mr. Speaker, and try to show them how to write a grant if they don't know how to do it, but I'm not going to specifically ask for any earmarks, then that amount, if it's one Member, $27 million, Mr. Speaker, what we would do is subtract that amount from the 302 Allocation of Discretionary Spending. 
   So you would spend $27 million less during that fiscal year because that Member said, you know what, I agree with Ms. Pelosi and I agree with Mr. Flake and several other Members of this body that it's wrong; it has too much potential for corruption. And if we have enough Members, let's say you had 10 Members say that, then you're talking about $270 million. People could say, well, Congressman Gingrey, you know that's a very small portion of the budget; it's just a drop in the ocean. Well, $270 million in my district is much more, Mr. Speaker, than a little drop in the bucket. It's real money. 
   And so, this idea, then, of, first of all, in my bill, immediately cutting this number, that number of $29 million in half, and then just say let's give every Member the same opportunity, the fairness issue, and also let each Member who is philosophically opposed to earmarks, give them back to the taxpayer, what a breath of fresh air, I think. And then in subsequent years what we would do on this bill, Mr. Speaker, is we would say that you can only earmark 1 percent of total discretionary spending. 
   So that would drop that number $14.5 billion down to $10 billion. And when you make that division, you're not talking about $27 million per Member, maybe you're only talking about $20 million. And eventually, it may be that the Members of this body, Mr. Speaker, will come to the conclusion, as Ms. Pelosi did and as Mr. Flake has done consistently, and he has, indeed, put his money where his mouth is, that maybe more and more Members, my colleagues, will say, you know, we don't really need this earmarking business. We let people apply for grants and let projects get funded on their merit, and Members then don't get tempted to have someone come to them and say, you know, I know you're a powerful Member, and we've got this little project back home, wherever it is, in whomever's district in whatever State, and, oh, by the way Congressman, what can we do for you? Can we have a little fund-raiser for you? I've got some people back in the district that would love to help you, know you're doing a great job for us, and you just get back to us and let us know what you want us to do for you; but keep this project in mind, it really means a lot to us. And that project may be $2 million, it may be $5 million, it may be a $25 million project. So that's how this happens, Mr. Speaker. I think Members just sort of fall into the trap of all of that. 
   What I am trying to do is two things. I'm trying to save money for the taxpayer of this great country and stop this runaway spending and cut down these budget deficits and reduce this national debt, which is approaching $9 trillion; but I'm also trying to keep my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from becoming corrupted because of a corrupt system. 
   And that's really what it's all about. That's why I wanted to not rush out of here on the last vote and catch the first plane back to good ole Georgia, which I'm looking forward to doing maybe tomorrow; but I felt like it was important enough to come to the floor and to say to all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that I see a better way. And I think we can do this in a bipartisan fashion. 
   And I will say this, Mr. Speaker, if we can't do it in a bipartisan fashion, this Member, this Republican Member, and hopefully his colleagues on this side of the aisle, would make a pledge to the American people that, you know, we got your message loud and clear in November of 2006. We understand why we're no longer in the majority, because we lost our fiscal discipline; but we're going to get it back, and we're going to start with this. 
   And this is not a baby step; this is a giant step. If you feel like maybe the  better approach would be to totally eliminate earmarks, well, maybe we will get there. Maybe Members will see that this can work and it will work. 
   And so, Mr. Speaker, again, the opportunity to be here on the floor to talk to my colleagues, I'm sure I would have some other speakers if it were not for the fact that we had our last vote an hour and a half ago and Members needed to get home to their district, and work hard, and I understand that. But there are a lot of Members that feel very strongly about this. 
   We have, I think, 25 cosponsors of the legislation, again, H.R. 3738, the Earmark Reform Act of 2007. It's an issue, Mr. Speaker, that's not going away. And I wouldn't be a bit surprised if next week and the next week and the next week we don't hear about more and more Members whose action in regard to earmarks is a little questionable. And, you know, when you start connecting the dots, in some cases it can become very, very questionable. 
   So let's try to do the right thing. I'm going to appeal to Members on both sides of the aisle to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3738, which immediately cuts the total amount of earmark spending in half, and it makes sure that no one Member, no matter what party, majority or minority, no matter what committee, committee chairman or ranking member, no matter how threatened a Member might be politically that you want to shore up with these little trinkets of goodies, that's not right, that's not the right way. And if we can't do it the right way, then I would join Mr. Flake in saying, Let's get rid of all earmarks. 
   In the meantime, I think this is not a baby step, as I pointed out, indeed, a giant step in the right direction. And if we can't do it right with that, then the next step should be, I think, total elimination. 
   I thank the Speaker and I thank my leadership for giving me this opportunity to do this hour. I thank my colleagues for listening, for being here, and to try to understand that this is a Member who is not overly partisan, who has friends on both sides of the aisle, that wants to help all of the Members, but ultimately to get back to helping the American taxpayer and to restore fiscal responsibility in this place. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I was listening to my good friend and colleague from New York who just spoke about the debt that we built up under the Republican leadership; I think he mentioned the number $3 trillion. And I don't think that's admirable on our part. 
   I want to say that I think most Members know that I'm a big fan of country music and one of my favorite singers is Randy Travis, and one of my favorite songs is ``Diggin Up Bones.'' The American people don't want us to be digging up bones and saying, well, you did this, or he hit me back first. I think what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to remember, the fact that we are now in the minority is not so much about the miscreant action of a couple of Members on our side who violated the public trust or the difficult slog in Iraq. That slog has been difficult. But more importantly, it's this debt that has been built up, this fiscal irresponsibility. 
   This Republican Study Committee, the majority of the minority, and I'm proud of my Members on this side of the aisle that said enough is enough, the American people want us to stop spending their money. 
   I support this amendment, a 1 percent cut across the board. It's not specifically so much about this particular appropriations bill, but it's about all of them. We have got to stop this nonsense spending once and for all. This is the time to draw the line in the sand, just like our colleague from Colorado, the esteemed Representative Mr. Hefley, did every year, 1 percent across-the-board cut. I'm embarrassed that I didn't vote for all those amendments, but I strongly support my colleague from Georgia in this amendment. 
   And as my other colleague from Georgia said, to spend just $1 billion, you could spend $1 a second for the next 31 years to get to this expenditure of $1 billion. 
   Support the amendment.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague Mr. Lewis for yielding. 
   Former Member Jack Flynt served in this body for 24 years. It has been mentioned that he served on the Appropriations Committee. Some could say that he is neither a Democrat nor a Republican but an appropriator. But Jack Flynt was a boll weevil Democrat. If he were here today, he would be a staunch member of the Blue Dogs, I feel confident. 
   When I was running in this district originally, that area was in my district and many people said to me, You need to know Jack Flynt. I am disappointed, Mr. Chairman, that I never did get to know him. But in every instance the word about Jack Flynt was he was a gentleman. 
   And he and his wife of 65 years, Patricia of Griffin, Georgia, they have three children: Susan Flynt Stirn of Arlington County; John J. Flynt III of Augusta, Georgia, my hometown; and Crisp B. Flynt of Griffin; four grandchildren and two great grandchildren. 
   I am humbled to have an opportunity to just say a few words about a great Member of this body and to pay respect to him and offer our condolences to his entire family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2268, the Mother's Day Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. First, I would like to thank Representative Capito for authoring this legislation before us today. 
   H.R. 2268 would instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint and issue $1 coins in recognition of the 100th anniversary of President Wilson's proclamation designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. 
   As an original cosponsor of this bill, I would like to take this opportunity to thank mothers across this nation for what they have done, do, and will do to keep our families and our country, strong. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to take the personal privilege of recognizing my mother, Mrs. Helen Gingrey. Ninety years young, my mother instilled in me the very values and work ethic that prepared me to serve in these hallowed halls. 
   Her example testifies to the fact that we owe so very much to our mothers, to our fathers, to all those who cleared the way and smoothed the paths for us to succeed and realize our potential. We should honor their work not just in word but in deed--by ensuring a smoother, clearer path for the next generation--for our children and our grandchildren. 
   And so, I call upon my colleagues to demonstrate their appreciation for mothers everywhere by supporting this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3229, and would like to commend my good friend from Georgia, Congressman Lynn Westmoreland, for offering it. 
   The bill before us today will allow coins to be issued in support of the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center during the year 2012. The coins will be emblematic of the courage, pride, sacrifice, sense of duty, and history of the infantry, and the proceeds received from issuance of the coin will be used to establish an endowment to support the maintenance of the National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the House Armed Services Committee who previously had Ft. Benning--the Home of the Infantry--in my district, I have long supported the efforts of the National Infantry Foundation to establish the new National Infantry Museum and wholeheartedly support the issuance of this coin in support of the museum. 
   The National Infantry Museum and Soldier Center at Patriot Park will honor the 233-year heritage of the Army's largest branch, the infantry. This museum will be instrumental in helping to educate future generations about the vital role of the infantry in the history of our Nation. Furthermore, this building will honor the men and women who serve in and support the infantry, and preserve the infantry's legacy of service. 
   This legacy of service is indeed quite remarkable, Mr. Speaker. The first successful and systematic training of the U.S. infantry can be tracked back to Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, in 1778. It was not until 1826 that a formal post for infantry training was established, and over the course of history, the Infantry School has existed at the Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, Ft. Leavenworth in Kansas, in Monterrey, California, at Ft. Sill in Oklahoma, and at Fort Benning--the ``Home of the Infantry''--since 1918. Through the years the Infantry School at Ft. Benning has gradually emerged as the most influential infantry center in the modern world. The school has either trained in its officer courses or honed in its command structure some of the Nation's most prominent military figures, including five-star generals Omar Bradley, Dwight Eisenhower, and George Marshall, as well as George Patton and Colin Powell. And, Mr. Speaker, over the course of American history, nearly 80 percent of all servicemen and women who have died serving our Nation were part of the infantry. 
   This museum has one mission, Mr. Speaker: to honor the infantryman and his more than two centuries of proud service to our great Nation. This coin will support this mission. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. And I appreciate my colleague from Michigan--both of my colleagues from Michigan--and my colleague from Georgia. We've got a number of other Members here as well tonight. 
   But this issue that Mr. Upton is talking about is Section 526, Section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. Now, this is the bill, Mr. Speaker, that the Democratic majority passed back in February of 2007 that had in it this Section 526. It basically said this, my colleagues--and I hope that you all will listen very carefully to this because it's so crucial. Section 526 will not allow, it prohibits any agency of the Federal Government, our Federal Government, including our Department of Defense and including NASA, from utilizing any fuel source other than conventional fuel if it results in one nanogram increase in carbon footprint.     
   I am not talking about tonnage of CO  
   2. I am talking about any increase. So what my good friend from Michigan was talking about in regard to shale, s-h-a-l-e, shale is a solid product. It is a granular product. And we have, as FRED UPTON pointed out, Mr. Speaker, an abundance of that product out in the West. There are about five States. And I think Mr. Upton said that it is estimated that you can get something like one and a half trillion, with a T,  one and a half trillion barrels of petroleum from that source. 
   But this section 526 that the Democratic majority put in their ``no energy bill'' back in February of 2007 means that we can't utilize that. We can't get that source increase of supply so that the prices will go down. And the reason I am so outraged about that, Mr. Speaker, is that tomorrow, on the floor, we will be doing the rule on the NASA reauthorization bill of 2008, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Well their price of fuel in the last 5 years, my colleagues, has gone up 400 percent from something like $4.5 million to $18.3 million. That is what NASA is having to pay on an annual basis for jet fuel. 
   And yet they are the very agency of the Federal Government that is doing research. A lot of the research that NASA has done, we all know, we have utilized in the private sector. There are many things. I can name several. But they are doing research on shale. They are doing research on tar sands. They are doing research on coal to liquid and carbon sequestration and sharing that information with the Department of Defense and the Department of the Air Force, which could save us a tremendous amount of money. 
   So I yield back to my colleague for a colloquy on this issue because it is so important and so timely.

   Mr. GINGREY. Reclaiming your time. I am sure the pages don't remember the movie ``Giant,'' but we all do, and how that oil just came bubbling up out of the ground. I believe that was in Texas. It may have been Oklahoma. 
   In any regard, what the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) is saying is that these tar sands and shale, shale has to be mined. And then you have to go through a process, as he is saying, and you have to extract. And it is a little bit more difficult. 
   Again, we're about to reauthorize NASA in the next day or two. They are doing research on that very process now where they can get that petroleum, and I said to you 1.5 trillion barrels probably from the shale in our West, western part of the United States, and Mr. Upton pointed out that these tar sands in Canada, it is estimated that it is probably another 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum that we can get from that. And they are producing it in Canada. And they are selling it to somebody. And yet we can't utilize it. It absolutely makes no sense. As my colleague from Georgia said earlier, I think he used the word ``idiotic,'' ``insanity'' or ``crazy.'' He is right on all three points. But I will yield back to my colleague.

   Mr. GINGREY. If my colleague from Michigan will yield, the whole issue here is when the Democrats passed this Energy Independence and Security Act some 17 months ago, the price of regular gasoline, as all my colleagues know, was about $2.60 a gallon. Now, if Speaker Pelosi, at that particular time, or Leader Hoyer felt that the price of gasoline at the pump was going to drop $1.50, then maybe I could understand their emphasis on protecting the environment from any iota increase in carbon dioxide footprint or greenhouse gases. 
   But what has happened with their ``no energy plan,'' unfortunately the price of gasoline has gone up about $1.55 a gallon, and here we are looking at $4, $4 and a nickel now, and so we have to ask ourselves, what is the crisis? Is the crisis global warming? Or is the crisis bankruptcy of our country because of the price of energy? And people can't afford to buy gasoline. They can't afford to buy food. We are losing jobs to other countries. I think it is time to say to our majority party, for goodness' sakes, at least make in order the Gingrey amendment which would allow the administrator of NASA to have a waiver of section 526 and utilize some of these sources that Mr. Upton and Mr. Broun and others are talking about, getting that shale oil product from Canada. It just flows right down the pipeline. It is an easy flow, easy obtaining it. There is not a lot of hard work. It is the same thing with tar sands. And let NASA continue to do their research. Share it with the Department of Defense. 
   And I will make this one point to the gentleman from Michigan who is controlling the time, and then I will yield back so that others can weigh in, but do you know that in the year 2008 the Department of Defense is going to spend an additional, a delta, of $9 billion on fuel because of price of gasoline right now? And I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I know that as we go through our time in the Congress, each of us wants to be remembered for some signature accomplishment, and Madam Speaker, I want to commend the gentlewoman from New Mexico. I would say that maybe she's got many signature issues that she brought before the membership of this body, but certainly this issue of intelligence and national security is a signature issue. I commend her for her will and determination in trying to explain to her colleagues on both sides of the aisle an issue that may be somewhat difficult to understand. 
   There is a lot of arcaneness about this issue when you try to get into the weeds of it. So it's important to have Members like Representative HEATHER WILSON and PETER HOEKSTRA, ranking member on the House Select Committee on Intelligence, to help frame this issue for us.     
   But I think it's important to understand, as my neighbor, my colleague and friend from Oregon, Representative Walden, just pointed out, the bottom line, when you cut right to the chase, is that last Thursday we left this place  and went home for our district work period during the Presidents Day recess without addressing this issue and we took a break. Maybe some Members were even out of the country. I know, Madam Speaker, I stayed in my district the whole time hoping, literally hoping every day that I would get that call to come back to Washington to fix this because, as my colleagues have pointed out, this is just so important to let something like this lapse. 
   I would like to have our colleague leading the hour, Representative Wilson, maybe explain to the membership here so they can get a better understanding of why we need to modernize this 30-year-old FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, passed in 1978, why it is so important to be able to bring it into the 21st century. And maybe she could explain to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle the importance of data mining, of being able to get the cooperation of telecommunication companies, if she has not already done that, why it is important to get that information and look at patterns of communication so that we can understand what these terrorists and what these foreign intelligence agents are doing, and why it's such a tremendous threat to this country. 
   I yield back to my colleague. And I will remain here during this hour and hopefully engage her in more colloquy, and with the gentleman from Oregon, but I would like to hear some discussion on that.

   Mr. GINGREY. And I appreciate my colleague from Pennsylvania bringing that out. In fact, I will use some of the quotes. And I think this is important that my colleagues understand this, Madam Speaker, because this was a decision that the Democratic leadership made, almost 9 days ago now, to leave this place without reauthorizing and giving that liability protection to the telecommunications industry that is so important and that has made this program work ever since 9/11. This is basically what the majority leader of this House said, and I quote from Representative STENY HOYER: ``I don't think anything is going to erode.'' And that's basically what he said when he left here. But the truth is, and my colleague from Pennsylvania alluded to comments made by the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, J. Rockefeller, the Democrat from West Virginia, and basically he said, clearly, what people have to understand around here that the quality of the intelligence that we are going to be receiving is going to be degraded, it is going to be degraded, it is already going to be degraded. And he said that on the Senate floor on Valentine's Day, 2/14. 
   Here is what 21 Blue Dog House Democrats said when they wrote a letter to Speaker Pelosi: ``We have it within our ability to replace the expiring Protect America Act by passing strong, bipartisan FISA modernization legislation that can be signed into law, and we should do so.'' 
   And then finally, as we have said here several times tonight, Madam Speaker, Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, after all, it was the Democratic majority that wanted a Director of National Intelligence, it was the 9/11 families that wanted a Director of National Intelligence. And here he says to us: ``Some have claimed that expiration of the Protect America Act would not significantly affect our operations. Such claims are not supported by the facts. Without the act in place, vital programs would be plunged into uncertainty and delay, and capabilities would continue to decline.'' 
   I yield back to my colleague from New Mexico, but it's clear, it's so clear.

   Mr. GINGREY. I appreciate so much the gentlewoman's yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I think one of the most important aspects of this hour, and I know we are running short on time and I want to yield back to the gentlewoman from New Mexico, but one of the most important things for people to understand, Members of this body on both sides of the aisle, is the telecommunications companies voluntarily but yet under the law, under the PATRIOT Act, were required to provide information of their records, their phone records, under the threat of criminal and civil penalties from our own Justice Department. So that's why it's so important that they have retroactive immunity in regard to this issue. And these records are so important, and I will quickly say this, what people are doing today that's part of the modernization, they are not using hard lines. My colleague from Pennsylvania held up those two cell phones. They're buying these throw-away $49.95 cell phones and burn cards, and the only way you can develop a pattern is if our intelligence experts have access to the records of the telecommunications companies so they can look at it and develop a pattern. So that's why that's so important.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise on National Health Care Decisions Day in support of health organizations all over the country who are educating the public about what it means to have an advance directive, or a living will. 
   Mr. Speaker, advance directives allow individuals to maintain control of their health care decisions even at the end of their lives, regardless of the circumstances that they may face at that time. It is crucial for individuals to understand the options that presently exist so that they may convey their end-of-life medical wishes accurately and effectively. Accordingly, I have introduced a resolution, H. Con. Res 323, supporting the goals of the National Health Care Decisions Day, which has garnered broad bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill does not express what those end-of-life medical decisions should be, rather, it simply encourages Americans to educate themselves about these very difficult issues and to talk about them with their loved ones. 
   I want to thank the more than 100 Members of Congress who have already joined me in cosponsoring this resolution. And of course I look forward to it being considered on the floor very soon. And I encourage all Americans to set aside time to have what may very well be one of the most important conversations a family can have.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman, my good friend from Texas. 
   It is indeed an honor to be a part of this special leadership hour to share a little time with my colleagues, of course, Judge Carter leading the hour; Chris Shays, the gentleman from Connecticut, 18 trips to the Middle East, to some extent in harm's way. 
   I saw a couple of years ago, maybe it was 3 years ago, just happened to be channel surfing, watching C-SPAN. I guess I am an insomniac. There was Chris Shays having a town hall meeting talking to his constituents from Connecticut and taking some tough, the tough questions about this situation in the Middle East and why it was important and why he supported it. He outlined tonight the fact that he doesn't look at these things through rose-colored glasses. He understands that mistakes were made. We all do, but the mission is the mission. 
   He went on and talked about this surge and why it's so important that every Member on both sides of the aisle give it a chance to work. Judge Carter said the same thing, pointed out that this surge of 30,000 troops wasn't even complete until the beginning of July. Yet, many of our colleagues, unfortunately, it seemed like most of them on the other side of the aisle, wanted to declare that the new way forward was a failure before it even started, before it had even begun. 
   I remember back when I first came, I had the honor to come to this body with some of my colleagues that are here tonight on the floor, and people saying, well, you know, this mistake, the big mistake is we didn't put enough troops on the ground. I guess that's what General Shinseki had recommended. My Democrat colleagues kept pounding away, well, we didn't have enough troops. 
   Then when the President, based really on the report of the Iraq Study Group, two of the most distinguished public servants in the Federal Government that any of us know, James Baker, Lee Hamilton, a Republican and a Democrat, came and said, you know, we need a surge of troops, that's exactly what the President did. And then my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle, most of them, not all, said, too little, too late. 
   How do you satisfy some folks? I listened very carefully, of course, to my good friend and colleague, a freshman, but he seemed so much more experienced, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David Davis), talking about if we lose, they win. He is absolutely right. That just is so simple but yet so profound, and I really compliment the gentleman from Tennessee making his first trip and having that insight, that wisdom we all pray for. That's what we need for us to win. 
   Indeed, this is tough; it's not easy. But I heard some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle during the 5-minute remarks tonight, I heard the gentlelady from California say it was unconscionable that the President is playing politics with the war in Iraq;  yet she, as a cofounder of the Out of Iraq Caucus, and many of her colleagues voted in favor before the August recess of every one of these, let's see if we can tie General Petraeus' hands behind his back. 
   So, surely they don't want us to do poorly in Iraq. Surely not. I don't suggest that. But I just remind them that this Commander in Chief, I may not agree with him on every single thing. I think the issue of stem cell research is something I support him on. Some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle do not. His thoughts about a comprehensive immigration reform that includes what I think is amnesty, I don't support him on. Some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle do. But I can I think in the final analysis, this President, it may take 25 years, it may take 50 years, but I believe people will look back and say thank God that this man was in this place at this time after 9/11 and had the courage to stand up to finally say, you know, double-dog daring and triple-dog daring doesn't work. 
   Mr. Davis talked about the marine barracks and the USS Cole and the hostages in Iran for the 400 and something days, the 52 hostages. This President, this Commander in Chief had the courage to stand strong. 
   Now, my colleague just mentioned I had gotten back from Iraq, my fourth trip. I will probably never catch Mr. Shays. But each and every trip, honestly, I think I learn more and more. I want my colleagues to understand that. These trips, I hope the American people will listen. These trips are bipartisan. We go and, you know, we hear the facts. And the old saying, you are entitled to your own opinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. 
   But I feel very strongly that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker are going to come back and come to us as required by law, which we insisted on September 15, at least by that date, maybe a little bit before that date, and give us an accurate, fair, balanced report. 
   They are not going to try to paint this picture too bright. They are going to be accurate. I have said all along, we need to wait for that report before we all try to become 535 commanders in chief, many of us, including myself, who are not even veterans. 
   So I was very encouraged, I said to my colleague, Representative Carter, on my trip, I think the troops are strong, absolutely. As Representative Shays said, they get weary, the families get weary. The American public is a little impatient. I understand that. War fatigue does set in. But this is not the time to give up. This is the time to be tough, stand strong and give victory a chance, because Mr. Davis said, if we don't, they win. The consequences of that are unfathomable. 
   As I conclude my remarks, I also want to say to a group of marines from my district, NAS Atlanta, deployed this morning, some of them for the third time. This is the ``Red Dogs'' HMLA-773, a squadron of 255 marines. They are helicopter guys, Mr. Speaker, and they are light attack helicopters. They are going to be in a situation there at the al Assad Air Base. The President just made the trip over Labor Day weekend to meet with the troops. That's where they are going. 
   I saw them with their families, with their wives, with their little infant children. In one case, a little baby 2 weeks old was there in his mother's arms. There were cousins, there were aunts, there were uncles, and there were brothers and sisters and grandparents. It humbled me to stand among these heroes as I talked with them and told them how much, how deeply I think Members on both sides of the aisle appreciate their dedicated service to this country. 
   I wish them Godspeed and hope they will come back 
   safe and sound to their loved ones. 
   But not one of them wavered, even though this may have been their second or third deployment. They are still strong, and that's the same thing that I saw when I went to Iraq on this recent trip. 
   God bless them. Let's hang in there for a little while longer. Then we are going to hear from General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker on September 15, and it will be an encouraging bit of news.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (GREEN CHEMISTRY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, as a proud sponsor of this legislation, I rise to support H.R. 2850, the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007. 
   I want to thank my colleague on the Science Committee, Dr. Baird. I thank him for his kind comments. And certainly I want to thank our chairman, Bart Gordon, the ranking member, Mr. Hall of Texas, and all of the members of the Science Committee and staff. Both majority and minority have worked hard to bring this important bipartisan legislation through committee and to the House floor today. 
   This legislation has passed the House in the 108th and 109th Congresses, and I hope that the third Congress will truly be the charm and we will see H.R. 2850 quickly passed by both Chambers and signed by the President. 
   Mr. Speaker, chemists can design chemicals to be safe, just as they can design them to have other properties like color and texture. As chemists design products and the processes by which those products are manufactured, they can and should factor in the possible creation of any hazardous by-products. 
   This technique of considering not only the process by which chemicals are produced, but also the environment in which they are created, is the basic definition of green chemistry. It is the method of designing chemical products and processes that at the very least reduce, and at the very best eliminate, the use or generation of hazardous substances. 
   Mr. Speaker, the basic idea is this: Preventing pollution and hazardous waste from the start of a design process is far preferable to cleaning up pollution and waste at a later date. Additionally, the innovation created by this enhanced research will subsequently spur economic growth as developing new products and processes is an integral component of many industries, from fabrics to fuel cells, as an example. 
   Green chemistry doesn't just help protect our environment, it also protects our workers. The conditions under which chemicals are created and used can present many risks to those who work on their production. But if companies utilize green chemistry, the materials they use will be as benign as possible, vastly improving employee conditions. 
   Unfortunately, despite all of the promise of green chemistry, the Federal Government invests very little in this area. H.R. 2850 works to remedy this by promoting greater Federal investment in, and coordination of, this important research area. It does so by establishing a program that coordinates Federal green chemistry research and development activities within the National Science Foundation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, and the Department of Energy. 
   Make no mistake, greater Federal attention will encourage universities and academic institutions around this country to train future workers in this exciting technology. H.R. 2850 will achieve this by supporting research and development grants to partnerships between universities, industry and nonprofit organizations. It will also promote education through curriculum development and fellowships that will collect and disseminate information about green chemistry. 
   In past years, many industries, from chemical companies and pharmaceutical corporations, to carpet manufacturers and biotechnology businesses, have all endorsed H.R. 2850, showing a broad range of support for the merits of this legislation. 
   This bill is nearly identical to the version passed in the 109th Congress. The companies and corporations that have voiced their strong support for this bill realize that the advancement of green chemistry is positive for not only their businesses, but also our country's environment, our economy and our Nation's citizens. 
   The American Chemical Society, a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress, stated in support of H.R. 2850, ``Green chemistry means continuously improving process safety and resource efficiency leading to reduced cost, waste and environmental impact. It is the ultimate proof that environmental and economic benefit in chemistry can be optimized simultaneously.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and green chemistry promises a ton of pollution prevention. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (HONORING DR. JOHN FREIHAUT -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to honor a great friend and a colleague in the medical profession, Dr. John Freihaut, who passed away just before Congress broke for the August recess. 
   In addition to caring for the oral health of thousands of 11th District residents through his 27 years of private practice in Marietta, Georgia, the heart of my district, Dr. Freihaut held numerous positions in organized dentistry. Dr. Freihaut was a dedicated member of the 2007 Board of Directors of the American Dental Association's Political Action Committee where he insisted on attending meetings throughout his fight with cancer. 
   John also served as the president of the Georgia Dental Association from 2001 to 2002 and of the Georgia Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons between 1996 and 1998. Dr. Freihaut was named the Northwestern District Dental Society's Dentist of the Year in 2005. It was on these committees where Dr. Freihaut created his legacy. 
   Mr. Speaker, fighting for patients' rights in both State and Federal Government, John's dedication to his profession was unparalleled. During his life, John was one of the single-most significant advocates for the dental profession in the State of Georgia. In a State which has had one dentist and three physician Members of Congress, as well, of course, as our friend, the late Representative Dr. Charlie Norwood, and a recent American Dental Association president, John was still known as the State's dental expert and relied upon as an adviser to us all. I know that I sought John's expertise on several occasions throughout the years as I tried to make the best decisions for patients in the State of Georgia. 
   Mr. Speaker, John was passionate about his family, his profession, and his responsibilities in life. 
   Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers go out to Dr. John Freihaut's family, and my thanks go to my friend, John, for his 25 years of dedication to improving the quality of health care in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (SUPER BOWL COMMERCIAL -- (House of Representatives - February 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn an unconscionable commercial from last night's Super Bowl. Some ads were good, some ads were bad; but this one was very ugly. For those who missed it, an antiwar political action committee ran an ad claiming, and this is a direct quote: ``If you support escalation, you don't support the troops.'' 
   Well, Mr. Speaker, that couldn't be farther from the truth. Supporting additional troops in Iraq is supporting one final surge to push the Iraqi people over the threshold of violence and deliver the best shot for a more stable Middle East. 
   Let me assure you that the veterans in this commercial do not speak for the veterans in my district, nor do they speak for the soldiers that I visited in Iraq or Walter Reed, nor do they speak for our military commanders. But, Mr. Speaker, what disturbs me most about this commercial is that it wasn't just broadcast to those of us watching the game from the comfort of our living rooms and our homes. It was broadcast to the troops watching the game in Iraq. 
   Our troops should know that the United States military strategy will not be determined by political groups buying air time during the Super Bowl. I support victory in Iraq, and this final surge may be our best last chance to achieve it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, there is no Federal agency that has risen to the challenge of innovation over the last 50 years like NASA. When the Soviets put a man into orbit, NASA put men on the moon. We, as a Nation, are today the fortunate heirs of NASA's legacy: conviction, resolve, and achievement. As a Congress, we owe it to NASA to create an environment that promotes creativity rather than one that prevents innovation. 
   Unfortunately, I deeply regret this House has not fully empowered the men and women of NASA to meet the challenges of our Nation in the 21st century. Instead of providing it the tools needed to thrive in energy innovation, the Democratic majority chose to handcuff NASA when it enacted section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   Section 526 placed an artificial limitation on the ability of Federal agencies, including NASA, to utilize alternative fuel sources for their energy needs; even if they could be safely developed within the United States. These domestic energy sources would reduce the cost of fuel and save the American taxpayers billions of dollars. 
   While families across the Nation pay higher and higher prices for their own fuel needs at the pump, section 526 ensures that they will also bear the full cost of the Federal Government's fuel needs, no matter how high they may go. That, Mr. Speaker, is an inconvenient truth that even politicians turned documentary filmmakers can understand. 
   This motion to recommit will provide a waiver for NASA from this misguided provision. It will also foster the American innovative and competitive spirit by putting in place prizes for the private sector to work with domestic sources of energy that are readily available--coal, oil shale, tar sands, and biomass--to develop liquid fuels that will reduce costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, today nearly a year and a half after Speaker Pelosi promised the American people a ``common-sense plan'' to bring down gas prices, the price of a gallon of gasoline is $4.08. This marks an increase of $1.75 since the beginning of the 110th Congress, a nearly 75 percent increase since the Democrats took control. Indeed, a Pelosi premium that is wrecking this economy. 
   Since we are the people's House, one might presume that the Democrats would listen to the American people. However, the 20 percent of Americans who favor suing our way to lower gas prices have trumped the nearly 60 percent of Americans who favor domestic drilling. Perhaps this is motivated out of a deference to the trial lawyers and environmental extremist groups who are, shall we say, ``closely tied to the Democratic Caucus.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this same establishment is preventing us today from extracting oil shale in the western United States in which an estimated 1.2 trillion barrels of petroleum is trapped in porous shale rock, of which 70 percent is on public Federal land. That is exactly where it is going to stay, trapped as long as section 526 remains intact. 
   Whatever action this Congress does take, a repeal of section 526 is in order--or at the very least a waiver, grant a waiver as this motion to recommit proposes--so we do not hinder progress at the very agency that has been on the cutting edge of technology for these last 50 years. But time after time, in the committee rooms of the House, in the Rules Committee and on the floor of this body, my Democratic colleagues have refused to address section 526 in any meaningful way. 
   And let me point out, Mr. Speaker, the Lampson amendment does virtually nothing. It only allows us to continue importing oil from Canada, our largest source of imported oil because it might contain just a little trace of petroleum that was obtained from tar sands. That's all that does. 
   If this Congress insists on sacrificing American competitiveness and innovation on the altar of environmental extremism, then it will be one small step for NASA, but one giant leap for Greenpeace. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is about more than the pain at the pump. It is also about the spirit of discovery and innovation that is the backbone of our great Nation. The decisions we make today will not only impact this generation, but generations to come. We can either provide American engineers and innovators the tools they need to realize limitless opportunities for the American people, or this majority can continue to put up arbitrary roadblocks that stymie their potential.  
   Now, while I believe that many on the other side have good intentions, I cannot sit idly by while the Democratic Leadership seems to care more about a carbon footprint than an American footprint on Mars. I cannot sit idly by while this Majority continues to say ``no'' to American entrepreneurship in energy exploration. I cannot sit idly by while this Majority seems content to blame the President or the previous Republican Congress. 
   Blaming the past while ignoring the future is not leadership; that's not why the American people award Majority status to one party or another. 
   The American people awarded you the leadership reins to solve the problems our country faces on a daily basis, and nothing is more important than our energy independence. I therefore challenge the Democrats and all of my colleagues to start solving the biggest problem facing our country today, energy independence, by supporting this Motion to Recommit with its instructions to relieve NASA of the shackles of section 526.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2317, LOBBYING TRANSPARENCY ACT OF 2007 AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2316, HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my friend and former chairman, Mr. Dreier, for yielding. 
   I rise in strong opposition to this rule to H.R. 2316. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act I am not opposed to. It's the rule that I am opposed to. When you have 48 amendments and five of them are made in order, this is not open government. This is not open process. 
   I want to particularly, to my colleagues, mention the fact that I had one of those 43 amendments which were not made in order. And I think if we really wanted meaningful reform in an open government, that this amendment clearly would have been made in order, we would have had an opportunity on the floor of this House to debate it. 
   No, it's not in the Senate version. If it doesn't get in the House version, then, clearly, it's not going to come out of conference. 
   What this amendment basically says is that Members, either Republicans or Democrats, House or Senate, in a leadership position that formed these things known as leadership PACs, cannot convert that money at any time, but especially when they leave this place, to their personal use. 
   Now we did that, or a former Congress, I think, back in the early 1990s, said Members cannot retire from this body and go home with seven figures worth of money in their campaign accounts. For those who are not paying attention, seven figures is over $1 million. 
   A lot of Members, back then in the early 1990s, decided since they were not going to be able to do that after a date certain, they retired so they could go home and spend that money and buy a new vacation home or fancy automobile or whatever. 
   Since then, what's happened is Members have formed these leadership PACs. It's not just leadership Members; in fact, any Member can form a leadership PAC. So I am not saying that the money that they use out of those PACs is improperly or dishonestly spent, but the temptation is there. 
   I want to give you an example of just one. I have 10 listed in my official remarks. I am not here to embarrass anybody. But there was one PAC called Searchlight PAC that, in 2006, raised $2 million. Do you know how much of that money was spent on helping another Member run for a Federal office in that particular PAC's party? $300,000. That means $1.7 million of that PAC's money was spent in some personal way. I don't know if it was dishonest, but we have to stop this sort of thing. 
   Really, I am shocked that this amendment was not made in order. Listen to this letter that was sent to Speaker Hastert last year when my former Chairman DREIER worked on lobbying ethics reform. Here is the letter. ``The House of Representatives is supposed to be a marketplace of ideas, and any debate in open government must not restrict the discussion of serious proposals ..... I am calling on you to use your authority as Speaker to direct the Rules Committee to report an unrestricted rule on lobby reform.'' Signed then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. 
   Ms. Pelosi obviously has changed her mind this time around. This rule says loud and clear that this House no longer is a marketplace for ideas; there is no room in this House for full and unrestricted debate on open government. That's why I am standing in opposition, not to the bill, but to the rule. We could have made this bill so much better if we had allowed these amendments, such as mine, to be made in order. 
   I ask my colleagues, as former Chairman DREIER said, to oppose this rule.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (AMERICA'S FAILED ECONOMIC AND ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding time. 
   I wanted to, first off, say that I am a very proud cosponsor of the legislation introduced by Mr. Hensarling from Texas and by Mr. Conaway also from Texas, H.R. 5656, which he referred to at the outset of this hour. 
   I want to talk specifically about that particular bill because it's so important, but before I get into the discussion about 5656, I want to make sure that we put it into perspective in regard to the discussion tonight. 
   We first heard from our colleague from North Carolina, Ms. Foxx, who was talking for 5 minutes about the issue of supply and demand. She was saying that that is a basic economic principle, and I think we all know that. As she pointed out, Mr. Speaker, our Democratic colleagues cannot legislate away the basic principle of supply and demand. 
   So what we're talking about and will talk about during this hour is, I guess, the opportunity lost if we continue this folly of not going after petroleum products in our own country. We call it and we refer to it, of course, as domestic production. A lot of the focus is on ANWR--that frozen tundra on the North Slope of Alaska, that very small area where we know, as the geologists have already told us, there are something like 10 billion barrels of petroleum. At full production, we would be producing 1.5 million barrels of additional domestic oil every day from that one source. 
   That is a small amount compared to what is available if we were not handcuffing ourselves off of our coasts--off both our east coast and our west coast--and off the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico in what is known as OCS, or the Outer Continental Shelf. There are literally trillions of cubic feet of natural gas there which is part of our, the United States', territorial waters on the Outer Continental Shelf for which we could be drilling. There are tens of billions of gallons of petroleum. Yet the Democratic majority, Mr. Speaker, continues to prohibit, continues a moratorium which has existed since, I think, maybe, back to 1990. 
   Today, what we're talking about, of course, is the price of a gallon of regular gasoline. In the year and a half since the Democrats assumed the majority of not only this House but also the majority of the United States Senate, the price of a gallon of gasoline has gone from $2.60 to $4.08. Mr. Hensarling, of course, pointed that out very well at the beginning of this hour. 
   I want to ask my colleagues to just take a look at this one poster that I want to show you. I think it's very important. I think it's very instructive. This basically is the courtesy of Representative John Peterson from Pennsylvania, who is retiring this year. He is a great Republican Member of this body who has spoken so well on this issue of giving us the opportunity to go after that natural gas and oil in the Outer Continental Shelf off of our coastline. 
   On this poster, it shows here that, off the Pacific coast, the amount of oil in the Outer Continental Shelf is 10 billion barrels. The amount of natural gas is estimated to be 18 trillion cubic feet. That's off the Pacific coast. Off of the Atlantic coast, the amount of oil is 2.3 billion barrels, and the amount of gas is 28 trillion cubic feet. The eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico is also off limits: Oil, 3.58 billions of gallons. Natural gas, 12 trillion cubic feet. 
   Mr. Speaker, that's bad enough, but now lets get to 526. I want to just take a little time before I yield back to my colleagues, who are the real experts on this. 
   Last year, the Democratic majority passed a bill. They called it the Energy  Independence and Security Act 
   of 2007. It doesn't give us independence, and it darn sure doesn't give us security. What they did in that particular bill is they put in a section, section 526, that the Hensarling-Conaway legislation, H.R. 5656, would repeal that section 526. 
   Why is that important? 
   Well, section 526 literally prohibits our Government, any agency of our Federal Government, from contracting for any petroleum product that is not conventional fuel if that product, that nonconventional petroleum source, yields one scintilla--by the way, my colleagues, a ``scintilla'' is a very, very small amount--of an increased carbon dioxide footprint. 
   Now, ladies and gentlemen of the House, that may have made sense when the price of gasoline was $2.60 a gallon and when we had this expectation and this hope that it would drop down to $1.50, but on June 24, 2008, when the price of gasoline has now gone up 75 percent--not down--and it's $4.08 a gallon, does it make any sense to prohibit our Federal Government from contracting for other sources of petroleum? They are in this country in abundance. 
   The reason I have this poster is I want to point out to my colleagues--and it doesn't show the exact spot, but in the western States, in the Rocky Mountain States--and there are about five of them--there is this rock product called shale, S-H-A-L-E. It is estimated by the geologists, by the experts, that within that rock is 1.3 trillion barrels of petroleum. Yet our Federal Government is prohibited from mining that shale and from getting this petroleum source because it might, just might, result in a little bit more carbon dioxide. 
   To put it in perspective, Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government actually uses 380,000 barrels of refined product every day, and most of that is used by the Department of Defense, and 75 percent of their usage is by the Air Force in jet fuel. Just think about that and the cost. Well, I'm going to tell you exactly what it is. 
   For the year 2008, this year, it's estimated that our Air Force will spend an additional $9 billion on jet fuel at the cost of $135 a barrel of petroleum. Yet all of this oil and natural gas and this petroleum that we could get from shale in the Midwest, in the Rocky Mountain States, sits there, and there it remains trapped in rock because of this senseless section 526 that the Democrats passed last year in their energy bill, in their so-called Energy Independence and Security Act. 
   It is time, as Mr. Hensarling, as Mr. Conaway and as the many other cosponsors, including myself, have said, to say, look, that doesn't make any sense today. We're all concerned about global warming--of course we are--and about the environment and about clean air, but we're not going to die tomorrow from that. We are about to starve to death, and this country is about to go bankrupt when people can't get to work and when they can't get to the grocery store. When they get to the grocery store, they can't afford to buy food because of this senseless ethanol conversion from corn to ethanol. That's a whole different issue. I'm just here tonight to weigh in with my colleagues. I thank them for giving me the time. 
   I sit on two committees--on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Science and Technology Committee. This year, of course, we reauthorized the National Defense Act of 2009, and we reauthorized the NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Act. Both of these agencies of the Federal Government utilize a lot of jet fuel. I tried to take the Hensarling-Conaway bill and make it as an amendment to strike that section or at least to grant a waiver from that restriction of 526. 
   This Democratic leadership refused to even make those bills in order so that the men and women, the commonsense men and women on both sides of the aisle in this Chamber, would have an opportunity to vote up or down in these trying economic times when we're losing jobs and when people can't even afford to go to work. 
   So I thank the gentleman for letting me join with the Texas delegation, if you will--my three classmates--who know so much about this issue and about the many other issues of supply and demand as Ms. Foxx said earlier. So I look forward to the rest of the hour. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, as we begin debate on the FY2008 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill, I want to highlight the National Textile Center (NTC). The NTC is a 15-year-old grant program that supports research at nine member universities, including Georgia Tech, and is the main source of innovation for U.S. textile, fiber and apparel industries. In Georgia, the textile, fiber and apparel industry is the state's largest manufacturing employer with annual payroll of $500 million. It is imperative that this industry continue to benefit from the infusion of new ideas and talent that is the basis of the programs of the National Textile Center. National Textile Center projects in Georgia have lead to improving Georgia industry processes including new approaches to carpet recycling and new environmentally friendly approaches to dyes and bleaches that lower costs, increase competitiveness, and improve the local plant environmental impact. Outside of helping the textile industry respond to rapidly changing market demands, the NTC has also inspired and trained highly skilled talent for the U.S. textile industry and created educational opportunities in science, engineering, and technology for U.S. citizens and permanent residents from K-12 through the doctoral level. 
   Mr. Chairman, the National Textile Center has clearly been an excellent steward of past funding provided by the Department of Commerce. With this in mind, I ask Chairman MOLLOHAN, Ranking Member FRELINGHUYSEN, and my colleagues in both bodies to preserve current funding and remember the importance of this program during the Conference process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, while I see good reforms and programs in this farm bill, I also see onerous provisions such as a massive tax increase on foreign companies who are providing good jobs here in the United States, and Davis-Bacon restrictions on biofuel production plants that drive up costs far beyond any included incentive grants. 
   In 2003, a constituent of Georgia's 11th District named Greg Hopkins took a big risk and decided to construct and operate a biofuel production plant called U.S. Biofuels in Rome, Georgia. He found a market demand, and that is the reason for his plant. But in order to make a profit, Greg has to minimize costs wherever possible. If the United States is serious about moving our country to alternative fuels, we don't need restrictions like Davis-Bacon prevailing wages. 
   It is clear to me that the Democratic leadership of the 110th Congress is more interested in doing favors for deep-pocketed labor union supporters than protecting domestic biofuel producers, and I must oppose this rule and the underlying bill.

   Mr. GINGREY. Will the gentleman from Illinois yield on that point for a second? It is my understanding, and correct me if I am wrong, that in this country there are known resources, veins of coal in the amount of 1.5 trillion tons, and it is suspected that there may be that much more that is not for sure. But 1.5 trillion tons of coal. And I think we utilize about 22 billion tons a year in this electricity generation. So I just want to make the point that there is so much more of this resource, whether it is in West Virginia or Kentucky or in Illinois, and to not utilize it, as the gentleman says, makes no sense at all.

   Mr. GINGREY. This really gives me an opportunity to segue into what the gentleman from Illinois was just talking about in regard to the American Energy Act and, of course, he started his discussion about coal liquefaction and some of the many things we can do as part of that bill, a comprehensive approach. 
   But in concluding his remarks, he talked about the fact that we have this resource of natural gas and petroleum off the coast of our country, both east and west coast, Outer Continental Shelf, eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico, that 10 billion barrels of fuel is estimated in ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve. 
   I took an opportunity, Mr. Speaker, today to write a letter, an e-mail, to my constituents in the 11th District of Georgia, northwest Georgia, both the Republicans and Democrats. Now, I won my last election with about 71 percent of the votes. So it's a highly Republican district. But listen to what I said to them and the response that they gave. 
   ``For months now I have spoken on the House floor almost daily in a concerted effort to convince the Democratic leadership to bring forward legislation that would allow us to drill here and drill now so that we could all pay less at the pump. Last week, I joined my House Republican colleagues to introduce the American Energy Act, a comprehensive bill which would increase our domestic energy supply while also harnessing renewable and alternative energy technologies and improving conservation and efficiency. However, as Congress prepares to adjourn for a 5-week recess, Speaker Pelosi continues to prevent a vote on increasing the amount of domestic oil produced in this country from reaching the House floor. 
   ``As I work to represent your interest in Washington, it is vital that I know your feelings on this issue. Would you take a moment to quickly answer the survey question on the right of this page so that I can take your opinions to Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership and let them know how you feel about this crucial issue. 
   ``Sincerely, Phil Gingrey.'' 
   Here is the question: Do you think Congress should adjourn for a 5-week recess even if no vote is taken to allow offshore drilling on our Outer Continental Shelf for oil and natural gas? 
   Mr. Speaker, so far, with several hundred responses already in, the results are overwhelming: 94 percent do not support Congress adjourning for recess without legislation that would allow increased drilling. 94 percent. 
   Now, as I say, I won my last election with 71 percent. This tells you that a lot of good, red-blooded, conservative, hardworking Democrats in my district feel the exact same way we do tonight, Mr. Speaker, as we do this hour in this colloquy. And I know that there are a lot of my colleagues on this floor, Mr. Speaker--and you do, too, I would imagine, who, given the opportunity to have a bill to vote to increase our domestic source and end our dependency on these foreign countries that hate us, would gladly vote. And maybe they will stay here with us come Thursday or come Friday, a sit-in, and say, ``We are not going home until we have a bill to vote on.'' 
   With that, I yield back to my colleague from Texas who is managing the time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety Awareness Month: As a cosponsor of this thoughtful resolution, I would like to commend my colleague from the House Armed Services Committee--Admiral Sestak of Pennsylvania--for his leadership on this important issue. 
   National Campus Safety Awareness Month--first established in September 2005--works to both heighten awareness and to improve the overall safety on our college and university campuses. H. Res. 1288 supports the goals of this initiative and encourages all institutions of higher learning to participate in this very worthy endeavor. 
   Mr. Speaker, despite the work that has been accomplished to increase campus safety at colleges and universities across the country, college students are still very susceptible to criminal acts. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, colleges and universities reported 37 homicides, 8,114 forcible-sex offenses, 8,923 aggravated assaults, and 3,071 cases of arson.  
   I applaud the work being done by organizations like Security On Campus (SOC) that are dedicated to using educational programming to teach students how to handle the potential dangers of their surroundings. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Res. 1288.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I thank my leadership for allowing me to lead the time during this next hour. And my intention, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, is to talk about something that is hugely important in this town, in this body, and across this country, and, of course, that is the issue of earmarks. 
   But, Madam Speaker, before I get to that, I couldn't help but hear my colleagues on the other side, the freshmen Democrats, who just spoke about the SCHIP program. I will say this, Madam Speaker: they spoke well. They spoke in a very articulate manner. I commend them for their sense of presence in this body. They are all doing a great job. 
   But, Madam Speaker, talking about overstating and being over the top on some of the comments that were made that I just heard over this last hour listening to my colleagues, it's amazing. 
   The gentleman from Minnesota was critical of the President, overstating the issue of the SCHIP program in regard to covering children from families up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty level. I don't necessarily argue with the gentleman over that point. But then the doctor from Wisconsin went on to make a comment, and I think I am accurate in quoting him. He suggested that the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, went to Iraq over lies. Then he went on to say that the country needs more than a President who refuses to obey the rule of law. 
   Now, you talk about overstatements and embellishing and really getting entirely off the subject. So I just want to remind my colleagues, let's do indeed stick to the facts. 
   The facts, Madam Speaker, in regard to the State of Wisconsin, my good friend, the good doctor, the allergist from Wisconsin, I would quickly point out to him that in his State, he showed that picture, that kind of heart-rendering, tugging-at-your-heart-strings picture of the mother and child, the mom, Wendy, and the child, Cassidy, and sort of making his point that we need to expand this SCHIP coverage by 140 percent to cover 6.4 million children that we are covering under the current program, but to increase that to over 10 million children. 
   Well, not only that, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, but the gentleman from Wisconsin, in his State 66 percent of the people that are covered under the SCHIP program are the Wendys, not the Cassidys. Mom and dad that have maybe one child that are in that income bracket, 100 to, I think, in Wisconsin it goes up to 180 percent of the Federal poverty level. Not only are the children covered but the parents are covered as well such that in that State, 66 percent of the total people covered are adults, not children at all. And Wisconsin is not the most egregious State, Madam Speaker. There are a number of others. 
   The State of Minnesota, the gentleman from Minnesota was leading the time. I think probably 70 percent in Minnesota are adults. 
   And if my colleagues want to come down, I will yield to them if they want to dispute those figures and we will talk about it. I would be proud to have them interrupt me and get in a colloquy, in fact, about this. 
   So I am here tonight during this Special Hour, Madam Speaker, to talk about earmark reform, and we will get to that. But I think this is just really  important because this is a historic vote tomorrow. This is a historic vote. And colleagues on both sides of the aisle will have an opportunity to say do we want to reauthorize a good program, you might say even a Republican program with Senators like Senator Hatch back in 1997 when this program was started. Not an entitlement program, Madam Speaker, no. Not an entitlement program. A block grant lasting 10 years, spending about $1 billion a year on the program to cover 6 million children. And, yes, we Republicans, we fiscal conservatives, and the President of the United States have a compassion, and we understand that Biblical phrase ``suffer the little children'' that the Speaker likes to use over and over again in trying to make her point. 
   But we want to make sure that we cover those children that have the greatest need, those children between 100 and 200 percent of the Federal poverty level. And there are almost 750,000 to 1 million of those kids, those children, in those families who have fallen through the cracks. The States have not done a good enough job of finding them. 
   Madam Speaker, I am very, very proud of my State of Georgia. I represent the northwest part of that State, District 11. We have lots of children in this program. In fact, in Georgia we are covering about 280,000 children. And we still are missing a few. But they are not children and families making 300 percent of the Federal poverty level. That's $63,000 a year. And if you allow that, as this new Democratic expansion does, as a matter of routine, and then you also say not only do the children, each child in that family, one, two, five, whatever, but their parents also get coverage, well, that's why I'm just trying to make this point. 
   I love my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. These four freshmen Democrats are outstanding Members, and they speak very well, as I said. They just speak facts that are not factual and they embellish their points, and I think that the truth needs to be told on this. 
   The truth is that we in the minority now, we want to expand this program. We voted for the continuing resolution so that it did not expire. We will vote to sustain the President's veto tomorrow because we don't need to raise the spending, Madam Speaker, on this bill 140 percent and cover 4 million additional children. 
   I think it was Mr. Walz from Minnesota who had this nice poster showing the amount of money that we spend every day, every month in Iraq trying to defeat this Islamic extremism, to fight this global war on terror, and saying that, well, you know, if we had 37 days' worth of spending in Iraq and Afghanistan that we could use on this SCHIP program, we could cover 10 million additional children, give them health care, dental care, Cadillac coverage. Well, he is right about that. There is no doubt we could. And what good would that health care coverage for those children do if some Osama bin Laden look-alike came into this country and blew them to smithereens? 
   So let's get our priorities straight here, my colleagues. Let's get our priorities straight. We need to protect the children. We need to protect the adults. We need to protect hardworking men and women in this country and not let 3,700 of them be slaughtered in a 20-minute period of time, in the blink of an eye, because we were not willing to defend this country against global terrorism and Islamofascism. 
   So this is not a matter of either/or here. And, again, numbers are great. You use your statistics and you make your points. But I hope, my colleagues and Madam Speaker, that I have made my point well in regard to priorities. So let's get this real. Let's sit down with the Democratic leadership. The President I know will do that after we sustain his veto. 
   Hopefully, there will be some Republicans, Madam Speaker, at the table. Our colleagues keep talking about the bipartisan bill and they keep saying Senator Grassley and Senator Hatch. Well, okay, Senators Grassley and Hatch. But we have got, I think, 47 other Republican Senators in the other body. And, yes, they may have a few Republicans on this side who they have scared into supporting this massive expansion. 
   But we don't need to do that. The President can sit down with, hopefully, our leadership, both Democratic and Republican. Minority rights here. Let Mr. Boehner in the room. Let Mr. Barton in. Let Mr. Deal in. Let our ranking members from the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. McCrery, let them in the room too and sit down with the President, with Democratic leadership, with the Senate, with the Republican Senators. I'm sure they will be there. 
   And say, look, we made a proposal. Initially, the President said we are going to expand this program 20 percent. You say it's not enough. All right. Well, let's get to the table. Let's leave our guns at the door, if you will, Madam Speaker. And maybe it does need to be a 35 percent increase, possibly even 40 percent. That would increase this program over a 5-year period of time by $10 billion. But not $35 billion when what you cover in those additional 4 million children are those whose families are making a pretty darn good income at $63,000 a year and they are already on a health insurance program, a private health insurance program. But, Madam Speaker, wouldn't you, if you got the opportunity to drop your private coverage for your kids and those monthly premiums, say, Manna from heaven, we're now going to get on the government public trough? Wonderful. Wonderful.     
   And I go back to that, talking a little bit in response to, again, my physician colleague, I think most of my colleagues know that that was my profession, too, before coming to this body. But the doctor from Wisconsin was showing those pictures, that picture, again, of Wendy and Cassidy. Well, Wendy, if she needs public coverage for her health care, should get it under the Medicaid program. But guess what? The State has to pay more under the Medicaid program, significantly more, probably, I would guess that that's absolutely true in Wisconsin, than on this SCHIP program. So it's a better deal, obviously, to cover her under SCHIP than under Medicaid if she had a waiver, if Wisconsin had a waiver, could cover her income level. You see my colleagues, you get it? This is simply a matter of fact, the truth. Maybe sometimes the truth hurts, but connect the dots here, connect the dots. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't think the Democratic leadership wanted to give the President a bill that he could sign because there's a lot of politics in all of this. And there is always, well, you know, ``these cruel Republicans.'' These cold-hearted, they don't care about the children. They don't care about the veterans. They don't care about the hardworking men and women of this country, so let's stick it to the rich.'' And of course the rich is anybody making more than $75,000 a year. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it wasn't my intention to talk about this, but I think you can see, my colleagues, that the previous hour kind of stirred me up a little bit, and I wanted to get the facts out there. Because this is a historic vote tomorrow, and I plan to vote to sustain the President's veto. 
   Mr. Speaker, my main purpose tonight in this hour, and I think some of my colleagues will be joining me a little bit later in the hour, is to talk about something that I can talk about in a very, very bipartisan way, and that is, the need for earmark reform. This problem with earmarks, a lot of people say that's the reason, that's part of the reason. Maybe there are two or three things that you can point to, I won't spell them out. I think most people understand that we lost our majority. ``We,'' I'm talking about now the Republican Caucus. We had the majority in this House for 12 years, and in November of 2006, obviously, we lost it. And a lot of people would say, the political pundits and folks back in my district, the Republican base, you guys, why in the world did you not rein in spending? You know, you had an opportunity, you had a Republican President, you had control of both the House and the Senate. Of course, control of the Senate, I think the Democrats are finding out right now that control of the Senate by two votes doesn't get you very far, and of course that was certainly a problem for us in the majority. But it is without question, in my mind, that this prolific spending really caused us some serious problems at the ballot box. And some of it has to do with these so-called ``Member initiatives,'' earmarks, a lot of people just flat out call it ``pork.''  
   So, I think it's a problem. Clearly, it's a problem. The American public perceives it to be a problem; therefore, it is a problem. And if you ask people in red States or blue States, they'll tell you the same thing: It's not right. 
   Now, there are Members who will stand up here and very staunchly defend Member initiatives. They will make the argument that, well, each Member, 435 of us, 100 in the other body, knows our people, knows our State, knows our district, understands what the needs are. People come to us, whether it's a school or county or city government or an individual entrepreneur that's got a new product that can save the lives of our soldiers injured on the battlefield, and that's a good thing, that's an appropriate thing for us to point out. Maybe the departments that we fund in this $933 billion discretionary spending pot that we divide up among all these different agencies and departments of Federal Government, that they can't know, they can't get into each and every State, although they may have regional offices. So, it's good, it's good that Members, Mr. Speaker, are able to bring that to the attention of the appropriators and make a request and get what's called by the general public and by the watchdog groups ``earmarks'' or ``pork.'' We like to refer to them as ``Member-directed initiatives.'' 
   And I'm a little bit torn about it. I do believe that Member initiatives can be a very good thing if Members do the right thing and there is no quid pro quo in regard to trying to grant a favor, if you will, for a constituent for a worthwhile, needy project that would ultimately help everybody, not just a very narrow group of people. 
   But this system, Mr. Speaker, has really gone amuck. Now, I've only been here 5 years; I'm in my third term. Have I asked for Member initiatives for the 11th District of Georgia? Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. Indeed, I have done that. I have learned how to do it, not nearly as successfully as some of my colleagues. Some people are absolute experts at it, but we all kind of learn the process. It's not part of our orientation, by the way. If it was such a good thing, it seems like they would include it in the orientation manual for new Members. But you just kind of learn this on the slide. You know, you talk to your senior colleagues who have been around here for a while and you find out how the system works. And so, you do. And I like to feel that I can shine the light of day, Mr. Speaker, on every single one of those Member initiatives that I've asked for; certainly not gotten them all. In fact, the ones that I have been granted, usually it's far less than the request. So, we've been doing this for a long time and we've talked about reforming it for a long time. 
   When we were in the majority, Mr. Speaker, and I say ``we.'' You and I are Members of this body proudly, but I'm talking about ``we'' the Republican Members. When we were in the majority, I think we finally recognized that something needed to be done and we tried to put some sunshine on the process. And we said, look, at the very least, let's make sure that when Members put these projects, these earmark projects in a bill, not just the appropriations bill, but also an authorizing bill, or maybe a narrowly drawn tax bill, all those tax bills, of course, originate in the House through the Ways and Means Committee, but if it's a tax advantage that affects just a handful of people, that's kind of a special deal, that's a special favor, and that has to be justified. 
   So, we recommended in our ethics reform package in the 109th Congress, let's make sure that all of those Member initiatives are written in the bill and in the bill's report. And it specifically says who the Member was making the request, from what State, what the project is, how much money is going to be spent. And that particular earmark could be challenged by another Member. Another Member, during an appropriations vote and discussion, a Member could stand up and say, ``I have an amendment to strike such and such an earmark.'' I would hope that Members would do that in a bipartisan way and that Democrats wouldn't just attack Republican earmarks and Republicans attack Democratic earmarks. If you're truly sincere about the process, you would look at it without any view of whether the earmark has an ``R'' or a ``D'' behind it, Mr. Speaker, and you would challenge it on its merits and then would have an up-or-down vote. That's good, that's a good thing. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, when the new majority took over, that language in earmark reform was changed such that it's not required that the light of day shine on earmarks and authorizing bills or tax bills, just in the appropriations process. But that's not enough, that's not enough. 
   In the next few minutes I want to talk about something that I have introduced, a bill that I think would take us a lot further down the road toward, if you will, Mr. Speaker, cleaning up this process. 
   Now, I'm going to ask our good, young page who is here tonight, as they always are, working hard for us late at night, to bring the easel up. I've got about three posters, and I want to share some quotes with you. But while he's doing that, Mr. Speaker, I see that one of my colleagues, my classmate from the great State of New Jersey, I believe that's the Garden State if I'm correct, is with us on the floor. And the gentleman I'm talking about, Representative Scott Garrett, is also my colleague on the Republican Study Committee, and I thank him for joining me tonight. 
   At this time, I would like to yield time to Mr. Garrett.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (SCHIP AND EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. I hope he will be able to stay with us throughout the hour because I do want to segue back and forth with him as we delve more deeply into this issue. But at this point I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle tonight, focus on these three charts, posters, if you will, that I've got because I think this is so telling in regard to why I said, at the outset, when we started talking about this problem, that this is bipartisan. This is a bipartisan problem. It needs a bipartisan solution. 
   When we were in the majority, maybe doing the exact same thing, business as usual in regard to what the gentleman from New Jersey just pointed out, and in the way these earmarks are handed out with sort of, first, if you are one of the fortunate 65 that sit on the Appropriations Committee, whether you are in the minority or the majority, especially if you are in the majority, you get a much, much, much, much bigger bite at the apple, the earmark apple, than some rank-and-file Member on either side of the aisle that is part of the ``obscure caucus'' that sometimes we refer to. That is not right. That is absolutely not right. 
   Listen to what Ms. Pelosi, the minority leader in the 109th Congress, said, and I think she was absolutely dead on right when she said it. Here is the quote, Mr. Speaker, ``If you are going to have earmarks and you are going to have transparency, you have to do it in the appropriations bill and in the tax bill, and in the authorizing bill. I would put that in writing.'' That is a quote from the gentlewoman, the distinguished current Speaker, then minority leader from California, Speaker Pelosi, minority leader at that time. She made that statement in September of 2006, exactly September 7. I guess campaign season. That was a good thing to say. 
   I think the public paid attention to it. I think it might have helped the Democrats regain the majority as they now enjoy in the 110th. I don't know what has happened with the Speaker. Right now, the minority leader, JOHN BOEHNER, the gentleman from Ohio who has been in this body since, well, I don't know when. He is still a young man. But he has never asked for an earmark. Do you think it is because Ohio or his district doesn't have the need? No. I think he thinks or he feels there's too much temptation for quid pro quo and corruption and he works very diligently to try to get through the regular process of applying for grants and helping his district know how to do that, that that is the better way. 
   Well, he has dropped a bill in this Congress, in the House, to do exactly what we tried to do under the Republican leadership, Mr. Speaker, in the 109th, do exactly what Madam Speaker Pelosi said on September 7, 2006. Do you know where that bill is? It is buried. It could have a hearing. It could be brought to this floor. Gosh, we could do it this Friday. That was another pledge that the Democrats made, Mr. Speaker, that we were going to work 5-day weeks and I bet you we will be leaving here on Thursday night. Heck, we could bring this bill up. The leadership just has to agree to do it, and we could be voting on this very issue on Friday. But, no, it is buried. It hasn't seen the light of day. So we Republicans, maybe hopefully some like-minded, good Democrats, maybe the Blue Dog Coalition, maybe the Congressional Black Caucus who is sick and tired of getting the short end of the stick in regard to this earmark process would sign that discharge petition and let us get 218 signatures so that we can immediately bring that bill that Ms. Pelosi recommended to the floor. That seems pretty straightforward to me. Let's do what she asked us to do. 
   Mr. Speaker, the next line is another quote from our now current Speaker, and she said this, if she were to become Speaker in the next Congress, Pelosi said she would press to severely reduce earmarks. And this is a quote. That was what the reporter wrote in the Wall Street Journal. But this is a quote that the current Speaker gave to him. ``Personally, myself, I would get rid of all of them,'' she says. ``None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism the public has and the fiscal irresponsibility of it.'' That was in the Wall Street Journal. 
   Yet, Speaker Pelosi, she herself is on track to take home $100 million this year in the earmark member initiative category. 
   That just astounds me. That just astounds me. What she said here, my colleagues, is so true. ``None of them is worth the skepticism, the cynicism, the public has.'' Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my colleagues to pay attention to an article that was written today, USA Today, quick read, easy read, Wednesday, October 17, front page, should have been above the fold, below the fold, but here is the byline on this article, my colleagues: Timing of Gifts Stirs Earmark Debate. And then the subtitle: Donations Made After Funding Added to the Bill. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to read the first paragraph. The article is short, but I am not going to read the entire article. But this is what it says in the first paragraph: 
   ``Days after a Senate committee approved $1 million for a Woodstock, New York, concert museum, the project's Republican billionaire backer and his family contributed $29,200 to help the  Democrats who requested the money, Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer.'' A $29,200 contribution from this billionaire and his family. Within the limits? Sure, within the legal limits. I am sure it probably was him, his wife and his kids, adult children who are permitted to make contributions. Maybe Senators Clinton and Schumer have leadership PACs and they can get $5,000 a chunk to those PACs. 
   Then the article goes on and says: 
   ``It's neither illegal nor unusual for contributors to benefit from congressionally directed spending known as earmarks, but the timing of the June donations is grist for critics who see a link between legislative pet projects and campaign money.'' 
   Now, I am going to tell you, I don't want to say that that is the proof of the pudding, but it is mighty suspicious. And I don't think it passes the smell test. 
   I am not being overly critical of these two Senators. The problem is on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers. What really called my attention to it, Mr. Speaker, was an article about a month ago in CQ Weekly in the title, the front page, Playing the Earmark Game and How It is Done, and how certain Members get, as I pointed out earlier, a much, much bigger bite at the apple. I will tell you, my colleagues, you know this. I hope the American public knows it. It is going to be members of the Appropriations Committee. It is going to be the party leaders, possibly on both sides of the aisle, or it is going to be Members who have had a tough election in a very competitive district, and we run it every 2 years and they are going to have a tough reelect, be they Republicans or Democrats, and, therefore, those Members are going to be granted a lot more. Mr. Garrett talked about the average of $8 million. Maybe those are the ones that get $25 million worth of a bite at the apple so they can appear to be doing more for their district. They are a great Member, so let's reelect them. They are bringing home the pork. They are bringing home the bacon. 
   But you know what happens with that process, Mr. Speaker, and there are several articles in this magazine. This one is titled, Gaps Along Racial Lines. What happens to Members of this body who may be from minority majority districts or Latino districts or inner city districts and they easily get elected. They are very popular in their district. So they don't need any shoring up to get reelected. So they get maybe $1 million instead of $8 million, and somebody else, some powerful Member gets $180 million for their district. That is flat wrong. Because, Mr. Speaker, those Members that I just described, whether they are members of the Congressional Black Caucus or the Latino caucus or they represent a rural district in Georgia, they have 670,000 people that they represent, and they have poor towns and poor counties and poor school systems that need the money, that need the project, and they don't get it. It goes to the fat cats. That is just flat wrong. 
   We are going to try to change that. Some Members think that the solution to this problem, Mr. Speaker, is a nuclear option, and that would be to totally eliminate all earmarks tomorrow. No more earmark Member initiatives and we stop all this temptation that any Member could fall prey to, any Member, including myself.     
   So I can concur and understand that feeling that we might need to completely, totally stop the earmark process. But then, again, many Members have pointed out to me that, you know, Congressman, we don't mind putting our earmarks out there for the light of day, we don't mind them being challenged, but don't take them away from us, because we are doing it right. Don't ruin a process that could be good because there are a few rotten eggs in the basket. I understand that argument as well. 
   My proposed legislation, and I appreciate Mr. Garrett from New Jersey still being with me because I want to yield some time to him and get into a colloquy about the bill, Mr. Speaker, but what it does is this. It says, look, in 2006, the high water mark of earmarks, when $29 billion worth of discretionary spending, about 3 percent of the overall discretionary spending was earmarked by House and Senate Members, well, let's do this in my bill. It says to cut that amount by 50 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is also almost a Pelosi quote. What was called for by the Democrats when they were in the minority trying to seek the majority, let's cut these earmarks by 50 percent in one fell swoop. So that is what my bill does; it cuts that $29 billion to $14 billion. Then you do a little arithmetic, not calculus, but a little bit of arithmetic, and you divide 535 into that $14 billion number and you come up with a figure of $27 million. The bill says no Member, no Member from Pennsylvania, no Member from California, no powerful Democrat, no powerful ranking member, no appropriator, nobody who needs help propping up them for the next election, nobody can get more than $27 million worth of earmarks for their district. 
   Now that doesn't mean they have to take them. If Members like Mr. Garrett and Mr. Flake and Mr. Boehner and Mr. Hensarling and a total of 12 Republicans stand strong on principle and say that earmarking is wrong and I want to say that my $27 million should go back to the taxpayer and subtract that number from the 302(A) allocation, as we call it, that is some real money. The first thing you know, you might have 100 Members doing that, or 300 Members on both sides of the aisle saying ``I want to end this process.'' That opportunity is there. The money wouldn't be spent by somebody else. 
   Mr. Speaker, but, on the other hand, if a Member had something that they felt very strongly about, whether it was a road project or repairing a bridge infrastructure, obviously the State of Minnesota knows what I am talking about, or widening a port so that these large container ships can come in that are now going to be able to come in through the Panama Canal, there's merit. So a lot of Members would say, you know, I really need this. Maybe one year $15 million; possibly the next year, the max; maybe the next year nothing, in which case the taxpayer would benefit from that as well. That is what this bill is all about. It's about putting some fairness, restoring some integrity to the process, and also controlling spending. 
   Mr. Speaker, my thinking on this is really twofold, controlling spending, and also ending this climate, if you will, of corruption, where Members on both sides of the aisle, and I don't think there is a Member of this body that comes here without a great deal of integrity and honesty. I don't believe they could look people in the eye in their district and get elected. It is hard to get elected to the Congress, to the House or the Senate. I think people come here with good character. But I think, unfortunately, the process will adversely affect a few. We can name some bodies that are littered and strewn about this place, that actually some of them are now spending time in the Crossbar Hotel, as my dad used to say. 
   So this bill, I think, would help. It would be a great start; not just a little move, but a fairly draconian move. A lot of Members are not going to like it. I have already begun to accumulate cosponsors, and every day we get several more, and hopefully this is something that we can accomplish. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield back to my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) at this time for further commentary.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. And we should go further. But I would tell my colleague, Mr. Speaker, that in a way it is analogous, and forgive me for using medical analogies, but I spent 31 years of my adult life doing that, of trying to wean someone off heroin, a drug addict. Mr. Speaker, you can't do that cold turkey. It would kill the drug addict, so they go through a detoxification process, if you will, and that is not a pretty thing to see. Then they are gradually weaned off and switched over to a drug called methadone. It is a heroin-like substance, an analog. It can take sometimes a couple of years, even when a drug addict is cooperating and wants to be cured of their addiction. 
   I think I am not overstating it. I don't think I am embellishing here when I say this Member-initiative earmark process has become an addiction. I truly believe it has. And it is tough. So to cut it in half in one fell swoop and put caps on it, and, as Mr. Garrett, the gentleman from New Jersey pointed out, shine the light of day on it so that you can see it and you can find it, obey not only the letter of the law, but, for goodness' sake, obey the spirit of the law and not make it difficult for watchdog groups or other Members or John Q. Public to look in the Congressional Record or read these bills and find out what is in there. 
   So there is no question that Mr. Garrett is right, that after we get this done, go through the detoxification process, if you will, we will then try to wean this body off of this process, because I think we ultimately need to do that. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As we talked about earlier in the hour, as we are approaching the culmination of our time, this earmark that is described in the USA Today on the front page talks about $1 million for some Woodstock museum. 
   Some of us who grew up in the deep south who remember reading about Woodstock and seeing the video clips were somewhat appalled about what went on there, Mr. Speaker, so I am sure that that would be an earmark that Mr. Flake or Mr. Hensarling or Mr. Garrett or myself would like to stand up and say, I don't care if it is to some billionaire Republican making the request, and then the next day writing a check in the aggregate of $29,200 to the two Senators from New York. Maybe that is within the legal rights to do that, but it sure doesn't pass the smell test. 
   That is where we are. I have talked to my colleagues about, well, how could we possibly take this a step further, those colleagues who really agree with me that this process is totally out of hand, and maybe phase out earmarks over a 3- or 4-year period of time.     
   Obviously another way to approach it would be to say drop a bill that says we totally eliminate, or drop a bill that says we are going to have a 1- or 2-year moratorium. I could support either one of those. 
   But if Members still feel very strongly that a Member-directed initiative done correctly have merit and value, then the bill, I think, I am presenting will put some fairness into the process. 
   I yield to my friend.

   Mr. GINGREY. The gentleman is exactly right. The Speaker could say forget about Minority Leader BOEHNER's discharge petition, we are going to bring it up under regular order. We are going to do the right thing. We are going to do what I, Madam Speaker, said she would do in September of 2006. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight and I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett) for taking this hour and to say to colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I think most of my colleagues would agree, even though I had to rebut the four outstanding freshmen Democrats that had the previous hour regarding the SCHIP program. 
   I think most of my colleagues would agree that I am not a real partisan Member, and I enjoy comity. That is the way I think it should be. But we have a problem here in River City, whether it is Republican leadership or Democratic leaders. 
   Mr. Speaker, I truly believe that the party, if it becomes partisan, the party that will take hold of this idea and pledge to the American people that we are going to do something about it once and for all, and as Mr. Flake has said to me often, it is one thing to air out our laundry, but we need to clean it. We don't need to just air it, we need to clean it up. I agree with him completely. Again, I think the party that will adopt that or fight for it is the party that either deserves to keep their majority or regain their majority.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor) to H.R. 547. I also rise to support H.R. 547, Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. It is a good bill. And I am on the Science Committee, and it did pass by unanimous consent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I was also at the hearing this morning that lasted 3 hours on the Science Committee with my chairman, the gentleman from Tennessee. And we were honored to have the Speaker of the House of Representatives testify before that committee. Well, this is a historic opportunity. She was received with a great deal of respect and certainly respect by me. 
   She testified; I don't disagree with any of her testimony. She talked about global warming and the concern that she has for our young children and the environmental debt that has to be paid at some point in the future. Unfortunately, her schedule did not permit time to take questions, maybe a couple, from the Members of the Science Committee. Maybe one question that should have been asked if we had that opportunity is how about the economic debt that we would have to pay if we do something draconian when all these other countries, especially countries like China and India, are totally ignoring it, and they are going to continue to pollute the environment. 
   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, that the gentleman from Virginia brings is about the concern with continuing to produce carbon dioxide, and yes, polluting the environment, and jet fuel is a big problem, a big contributor to that. I commend the chairman for accepting the amendment, and I think we should do that unanimously. Maybe the Speaker would like to come down on the floor and take as much time as she would like and talk about her support for this. But the Speaker has made a mistake in requesting a jet plane far beyond what the previous Speaker had. 
   I don't disagree that she should have the same security as the previous Speaker; we are not arguing that point. Mistakes can be made like Tunagate; the Speaker may not have known about that. And she was smart enough to call a press conference and say we are going to correct that, she should be smart enough to hold a press conference and correct this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I do rise in strong opposition to this bill, H.R. 415, a bill to designate parts of the lower Taunton River in Massachusetts as part of the National Wild and Scenic River system, especially, Mr. Chairman, in a time when American families are paying $4.11 for a gallon of gasoline. 
   The gentleman, the author of the bill that just spoke and his colleagues from the Bay State, I will give them the fact that they want to do things for the lower Taunton and the citizens of their district that live on either side of that river. But this really, in my opinion, doesn't quite pass the smell test.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Reclaiming my time, basically in response to my friend from Massachusetts, it is the same response that my colleague from Utah made in reference to the gentleman from Washington State when this same argument came up during the discussion of the rule. 
   But as the gentleman from Utah points out, the whole purpose of this act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, was not for redevelopment. And I heard the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) just talk about tearing down a highway, an elevated highway to make this area more scenic. I would like my colleagues to focus in on this poster of the lower Taunton River and see how unscenic it is. It may be wild, but it is certainly not scenic. 
   This act was never designed for redevelopment and for tearing down bridges and highways. This is not the time to do that. Clearly, this is not a wild and scenic river and doesn't meet that designation. 
   I would like to continue, Mr. Chairman, and say that when the Natural Resources Committee held hearings on this bill, representatives from the National Park Service testified that this area would be the most industrialized river ever to be given this designation. 
   Along the shoreline of the Taunton River, you can find a hair salon, a shipyard, a port area, and yes, even a McDonald's. Now, Mr. Chairman, I don't know about you, but I don't see anything that is scenic about this industrialized area. 
   Furthermore, as a result of this designation, this Congress would prevent future development along the river and would therefore prohibit the proposed use of the Taunton River as a terminal for liquefied natural gas storage and distribution facility. 
   Again I reference this poster, right here, this is 73 acres of that proposed LNG facility that I am talking about. When brought online, this facility would have the capacity to provide the needed heating oil for up to 35 percent of all New England households. Let me repeat that, the needed heating for up to 35 percent of all New England households. 
   It seems to me that this majority seems perfectly content to continue with flawed energy policy that prevents a major liquefied natural gas plant from being brought online, inevitably forcing them to later expand the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP, to make up for New England's lost home heating ability. At a time when the domestic supply of energy sources is the most important issue in this country, the Democratic majority would rather stymie the growth of supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, for months Democratic leaders have tried to dictate military strategy by press release with little regard for the service men and women putting their lives on the line every day. 
   Perhaps my colleagues on the other side of the aisle did not realize that the privileges of the majority come with an actual responsibility to govern. Let me say to them, the time for tantrums is over. At long last, we are presented with an opportunity to vote yes or no on abandoning our mission in Iraq. But let's not mistake this newfound direction for some kind of profile in courage. 
   After months of factual disarray, the Democratic Party has not suddenly found its spine; it has simply realized that the liberal agents who drive this majority, MoveOn.org, the labor unions, they have run out of patience. And it is them that demand a vote on abandoning our mission and abandoning it ASAP. Sadly, the Democrats have little concern for the demands of our military or for its waning patience for the funding that they so desperately need. 
   More than 3 months, Mr. Speaker, have passed since the President requested emergency funding for our troops. Over the past 94 days, the Democrats have succeeded only in putting politics over policy and trying to substitute their judgment for that of the combatant commanders. For the past 94 days, they have chosen to beat their chest at press conferences, and yes, on this floor, rather than finding ways to actually get our troops the funding that they need to achieve victory. 
   But, astoundingly, over the past 94 days, Democrats have never once grasped the consequences of resigning ourselves to defeat in Iraq. The void created by our departure would be filled by religious extremists and terrorists. Iran's path to develop nuclear weapons would be cleared. Violence in Iraq would grow exponentially. Shiite death squads and al Qaeda terrorists would further destabilize the democratically elected government. Another rogue regime could take root, leading to genocide. The terrorists, freshly emboldened by our surrender, would then be able to export terrorism around the world. 
   Today, each of us has a critical decision to make: Do we stand by the side of victory or on the side of defeat? Do we stand with our troops or with those who would want to abandon them? Do we rise to the challenge of fostering freedom, or do we capitulate to the political pressure of special interests? The choice, Mr. Speaker, is ours. For the sake of our soldiers and our Nation. I implore my colleagues to choose wisely.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (21ST CENTURY COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to support H.R. 2272, the 21st Century Competitiveness Act, and I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding. I want to thank my chairman on the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, Mr. David Wu of Oregon. 
   This legislation we are voting on today is a combination of bills which the House has already overwhelmingly passed, reauthorization bills for both the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as bills to promote science, technology, engineering and math, what we refer to as STEM education in our country. 
   Last year, with the American Competitiveness Initiative, President Bush laid out a vision to maintain America's edge in the global marketplace. These goals were spurred by a report issued by the National Academies, and it was entitled, as the gentleman from Florida said, ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' 
   This report looked at ways in which the Federal Government could enhance our country's science and technology enterprise so that we can continue to compete and prosper globally. 
   The Commission made a variety of recommendations. Some of them include reforming K-12 education, as well as expanding and strengthening the basic research and science and engineering conducted in America. This comprehensive innovation bill addresses these concerns, and it helps to fulfill this vision. That's why I am proud, proud, to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 2272. 
   One provision in this legislation reauthorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, an agency in the Department of Commerce, as one of the three agencies  highlighted by the President's American Competitiveness Initiative, and it falls under the jurisdiction of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee of which, as I said at the outset, I am a proud member. 
   The NIST employees play a critical role in NIST research, which enables cutting-edge technologies to make the leap from a basic research situation into successful commercial products. This is accomplished at NIST by conducting research that supports United States technology infrastructure by developing the tools to measure, to evaluate, and standardize processes and products in almost all industrial sectors, bullet-proof vests all the way to nanotechnology. 
   From rewarding younger students for continuing their work in the fields of science and engineering, to increasing the amount of grants available to teachers and students who pursue continuing education in the STEM, science, technology, engineering, math fields, to providing financial aid to students who make a commitment that after college they will teach, working to ensure that we have a strong United States manufacturing base, H.R. 2272 takes many important and critical first steps toward keeping America competitive. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again want to underline my wholehearted support for the 21st Century Competitiveness Act, and I urge all my colleagues, as I know they will, to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (WAIVING REQUIREMENT OF CLAUSE 6(a) OF RULE XIII WITH RESPECT TO CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN RESOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank my former chairman of the Rules Committee, the ranking member from California, and also I want to thank the current chairwoman of the Rules Committee for her courtesy in granting our side an additional 5 minutes. 
   I rise, Madam Speaker, in opposition to the same-day rule, but primarily in opposition to the underlying legislation, H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act. 
   This bill gives a bailout. I don't know any other way to put it. You can euphemistically say it is a ``rescue package'' or whatever, but it's a bailout. It is a bailout for one particular industry, albeit a very important industry, lots of jobs. 
   But in my district, the 11th of Georgia, we have a lot of textile manufacturing, and they desperately need help. There was language in the Colombian Free Trade Agreement that helped the textile industry in northwest Georgia. But the Democratic majority, this majority, will not allow that bill, that trade agreement, bilateral trade agreement to pass. And you know why, Madam Speaker? Because Big Labor opposes it. 
   In this situation that we are dealing with now, Big Labor is the entity that gains the most from this, and yet they are the ones that, in my opinion, Madam Speaker, are wrecking the automobile industry in the United States. When their average cost per hour is $77 when the foreign manufacturers that employ the United States productive workers can do it for $45 an hour, there is something wrong with that. 
   The solution to this problem is a structured bankruptcy just like Delta went through in my State of Georgia. It was painful, yes, but they are flying and are regaining profitability. I would trust a bankruptcy judge, a Federal bankruptcy judge under chapter 11, more than I would trust a czarina or czar doing it by the Federal Government. 
   I think clearly that is what they ought to do, restructure under Federal bankruptcy chapter 11, lower those costs, renegotiate those contracts and deal with the creditors to take less than 100 percent of the debt. Then, if it doesn't work, the automobile manufacturers can come back to Congress and ask for some additional help. That would make sense. But right now, the thing for them to do is to restructure under chapter 11. 
   By the way, Madam Speaker, when they do that, management as well as labor needs to take a haircut, a significant haircut, in fact maybe even a flattop or a buzz.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act. 
   This bipartisan bill was reported unanimously by the Armed Services Committee, and I am a proud, proud cosponsor, along with my friend, distinguished chairman, Mr. Skelton, and my good friend, ranking member, Mr. Hunter. 
   Mr. Chairman, we are debating this bill today because all of us here, Democrats and Republicans, want to ensure our soldiers are receiving the high quality care for which our military is known. 
   Indeed, Mr. Chairman, as a physician, I can tell you that access to care is critical to the health and well-being of our military, active, reserve and veteran. While it was a condition of some housing facilities at Walter Reed that led us to examine our military health care system, the fundamental problems with military medical care cannot be fixed with paint, putty and plaster. 
   I am relieved to know the run-down rooms have been refurbished, but I am proud that this bill starts addressing the system's fundamental problem of  overcrowding, delayed paperwork and a shortage of human capital to oversee soldiers' continuing health care and quality of life needs. 
   Soldiers I met on a recent visit to Walter Reed were frustrated with lost medical records, dupes to forms, paperwork that took a week to make it from one office to another. This system greatly delays our soldiers' ability to meet with their doctors and to eventually, Mr. Chairman, be discharged.     
   In fact, the average stay at Walter Reed is 350 days, and many of those days are spent as an outpatient assigned to the medical hold unit waiting for the paper trail to catch up with patient care. 
   This legislation starts addressing these problems by giving soldiers a louder voice in their medical care. It increases the personnel assigned to each servicemember and his or her family so that our soldiers have advocates helping them set appointments and understand the prescribed course of their care. As a physician, I know that caseload greatly affects the personal attention delivered to each patient. More staff means more time for each soldier and their individual needs. 
   Mr. Chairman, another problem facing our military health system is the difficulty personnel face when they are transitioning from active duty to the retired status, and I am pleased that this legislation includes a pilot program to examine this critical need. A fully electronic and integrated records system would allow the Department of Defense and the VA to share information in a timely fashion. 
   I would also encourage the Department of Defense to automate all in-patient health records. We know that in the private sector switching from paper files to electronic medical records cuts down on medical errors, saves time, and saves money. Our military should fully realize these benefits as well. 
   Mr. Chairman, I think it is important to recognize that the Wounded Warrior Act fixes a process that isn't serving the best interest of our warfighters or our military medical personnel. Our military doctors and nurses are an invaluable resource for their expertise, bravery, and dedication. We want to make sure that the system benefits these heroes as well. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act represents a significant step toward ensuring our soldiers and veterans are treated with the dignity and respect that they have earned and fully deserve, and I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this great piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, at the risk of being labeled the skunk at the annual fragrance picnic, I do rise today in opposition to this structured rule. 
   I know compromises have been made to improve the underlying legislation, but I think there is plenty of room for additional improvement. Just because we have a good program, to increase the spending from $15 billion to $50 billion, I wonder if there is justification for that. 
   But here we are again, Mr. Speaker, considering a rule that restricts debate on another Republican-created program for which the Democratic majority is now proposing a massive expansion. 
   We already have more than our share of entitlement programs right here in the United States. And to me, it now appears the majority is on the verge of using taxpayer dollars to create a global entitlement program. Remember, Mr. Speaker, PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was created back in 2003 to provide emergency relief for AIDS. 
   I will certainly say as a physician, that of course I am encouraged by the increased desire in the bill to also help fight against tuberculosis and malaria. However, Mr. Speaker, we should not devise a plan to treat these diseases without defining how to actually buy sufficient medications to provide the necessary care. The majority said that a treatment floor was not included in this bill as it was in the original legislation because the cost of medications have decreased. That may be true, yet while it has more than tripled the price tag for the PEPFAR expansion as I said in this bill, it has not tripled the number of people that it plans to reach with medication. So if the cost of medications have gone down, I think they have and the majority states they have, shouldn't the massive increase in the cost of this program be matched by a proportionate increase in the people that we target through the program? 
   Mr. Speaker, I was at the Rules Committee yesterday. I offered an amendment to just simply say keep that floor of 55 percent of the money going to treat the patient. The Rules Committee, unfortunately, did not make that in order. 
   Since the majority is not allowing adequate input on this legislation, particularly from the minority, I would urge my fellow Members to vote against this rule, give us a chance to go back and make some of the needed changes in an otherwise good bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Children's Health Insurance Program, but not this program and not this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have spent 26 years of my life as an OB-GYN physician delivering over 5,000 babies. I have a number of reasons to be in opposition to this bill and this rule, but not the least of which is the way the Democratic majority pays for this, how they raise the $71 billion that they are required to in their PAYGO rules. And, Mr. Speaker, that is this cigarette tax of 61 cents a pack. If you crunch those numbers to raise $71 billion to pay for this massive expansion so that Democrats can now cover an additional 4 million children under this program when there are only about 750,000 out there in the 100-200 percent Federal poverty level of not being covered, it makes really no sense. And to pay for it, they would have to have 22 million additional men, women, and, yes, maybe even some of those children I delivered take up the smoking habit. So what kind of sense does that make here? We are trying to provide health insurance for children, but we can only do it if we can encourage 22 million of their grandparents, parents, and, indeed, yes, some of these very children I delivered to take up the smoking habit. 
   It's like the Pied Piper, maybe being Ms. Pelosi, walking along heading for a cliff smoking cigarettes and all these adults right behind her smoking cigarettes and behind them these little children, and they are headed for that cliff, Mr. Speaker. 
   This is a terrible bill. I am totally opposed to it. I am not opposed to expanding the program to cover the uninsured that are eligible or even increasing a bit, as the President has said he is willing to increase maybe $10 billion for this program, but I am opposed to the bill. It's wrong. 
   Let's vote against the rule and against the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in strong opposition to both this restrictive rule and the underlying bill brought forward today by the Democratic majority. 
   As a former chairman of the Marietta City School Board in my district, I strongly believe that there needs to be more of an emphasis on public school construction but at the State and local level. However, H.R. 3021, the 21st Century Green High-Performing Public School Facilities Act, sends the wrong message of how the Federal Government should be involved in local education decisions. 
   With limited exception in the 1930s and 1940s, the Federal Government has rightly left the responsibility of public school construction up to the State and local governments. State and local governments know the construction needs in schools much better than bureaucrats in Washington. And the Federal Government has promoted the autonomy and flexibility of local control over education in this matter. However, this bill would negate much of this work and would only expand the size and scope of the Federal Government, as my good friend from Delaware, Mr. Castle, just pointed out. 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3021 would cost $20 billion over 5 years for a brand new Federal program to compete for the already precious Federal assistance dollars for education. Currently these funds are focused on the curriculum needs of States through our title I grants to provide assistance to low-income and disadvantaged students, as well as funding for the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, for special education. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can remember when I was on the Education and Workforce Committee in the 108th Congress when we were in the majority. There was this outcry constantly from the Democrats about not funding fully to the 40 percent level of IDEA, and of course the trajectory of spending in the Bush administration under Republican majority was a geometric progression. We spent much more money than the Democrats have spent in the previous 10 or 12 years when they were in control. 
   But now we're going to take this money that should be spent on these programs like title I and IDEA and create a whole new program. It makes no sense. If enacted, it will create abundant squeeze, make it less likely the Federal Government will be able to fulfill financial commitments that have already been made for student achievement. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to continue promoting local control over education decisions while providing Federal assistance for student achievements. The best and most immediate way that we can do that is by defeating the previous question and the rule for H.R. 3021. For these reasons, I ask that all of my colleagues oppose the rule and the underlying legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5940, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008. 
   Nanotechnology represents the future of science and information technology. These scientific methods have already been responsible for a number of products that are used every day in our country, like car parts, cosmetics, and first aid dressings. 
   The future of nanotechnology holds a world of possibilities for a number of fields including health care, which, Mr. Speaker, is incredibly important to me as a physician member of this House. 
   The National Nanotechnology Initiative is a multi-agency Federal program aimed at accelerating the discovery, the development, and deployment of nanometer scale science, engineering, and technology. Since its implementation in 2003, NNI represents the Federal Government's commitment to harnessing and developing the world's most cutting edge technology to help keep our country competitive in a technologically based global economy. H.R. 5940 is a bill that builds on the successful aspects of the NNI by making some improvements and modifications while keeping much of the initiative intact. This legislation acknowledges and addresses the need for enhanced research and education in the field of nanotechnology, and it is in line with President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that this legislation moved through the  Science and Technology Committee in a bipartisan manner so typical of our members. Unfortunately, that bipartisan spirit does not apply to the most important issue facing the American people today, and that is the price they are paying at the pump for gasoline. 
   Mr. Speaker, here we are 16 months after the vaunted promise of a commonsense plan to reduce energy prices by Speaker Pelosi, yet gas prices are now surpassing $4 a gallon with no end in sight. At this point, I am not holding my breath for this commonsense plan Speaker Pelosi promised over 2 years ago. I only know the result of the plan, an increase of $1.60 per gallon for regular gasoline. However, Mr. Speaker, I do hope that Democrats will begin working with Republicans much like they did on this bill, H.R. 5940, on our common sense plan for energy. 
   The Republican proposal, H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act sponsored by my good friend Mr. Thornberry of Texas, will allow us to explore domestic sources of energy and will reduce the amount that we all pay at the pump. It is time for the Democrats to get serious about reducing gas prices. I call on them to join the efforts of House Republicans. Let's enact real solutions that will provide relief for our taxpayers. 
   Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I am very supportive of H.R. 5940 and the possibility that nanotechnology has for the future of science. I urge all my colleagues to support its passage.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, my friend from Minnesota, not just Representative John Kline, but Colonel John Kline of the United States Marine Corps. Representative Kline, you mentioned a number of great leaders. I consider you among them. 
   It is fitting that we do this during this hour tonight to pay a special tribute to General Peter Pace and General Petraeus, Admiral Fallon and General Odierno, all of those you have mentioned. This is our chain of command. These are the brave men and women that we talk about, as you just referenced, when we go to those service academy days and we look at those youngsters in the 10th or 11th grade and they are with their parents and thinking about a service academy. And I am saying to them, as I am sure my colleagues tonight in this colloquy have done, you say, ``You know, young man, young lady, you could be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff or you can be the Central Commander.'' 
   It is just when you look and you say that, you want to feel that they know that they are going to be respected, and that Members of Congress are not going to denigrate them in a public way. 
   I think that is a very, very disappointing thing that has been occurring, Mr. Speaker. In fact, a Member recently was quoted as saying that this Member felt that General Pace was guilty of dereliction of duty because of his support for the Bush's Iraq policy. 
   Now, President Bush, like him or not, is the Commander in Chief, and if General Pace did not support the Commander in Chief, then that, I think, Colonel Kline, you can explain it better than I can, you talk about a dereliction of duty, but I am proud to be here tonight. 
   I thank the gentleman for giving me a little bit of time. I know we have other Members who are colleagues on the Armed Services Committee. We have already heard from a couple of them who are veterans and who have sons that are serving. I wish I could say that I was a veteran. 
   So I am very proud of my colleagues. I am proud of these leaders of our military. Especially I want to say to General Pace, Mr. Speaker, you know, one of my 
   favorite country songs by Garth Brooks is ``Some of God's Greatest Gifts Are Unanswered Prayers.'' If the General was praying to get reconfirmed as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, maybe this will be God's answer to him: ``General, you have served 40 years. You are a four-star general. You have done a great job for this country, and we salute you.'' Tonight I want to salute General Peter Pace. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Minnesota.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (HIGHLIGHTING THE COBB COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the exemplary important work of the Cobb County Sheriff's Office. This Georgia agency has been screening County Jail inmates to identify and deport illegal immigrants. This is a hugely important effort. After these criminals serve their time, we need to deport them. 
   Many jailed illegal immigrants are incarcerated for crimes like rape, armed robbery and drug trafficking. We want to do more than simply get these criminals off our streets. We want, Mr. Speaker, to get them out of our country. 
   Six deputies with the Cobb County Sheriff's Office recently underwent specialized training with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to identify illegal immigrants in our jails. Cobb County is the first department in Georgia and indeed one of the first in the Nation to work with ICE on this initiative. They are setting a fine example for communities across America, and our cities will undoubtedly benefit from the widespread adoption of this program. 
   After all, our State and local law enforcement officials are our first responders in the fight against illegal immigration. They play a critical role in stopping criminal aliens from harming our citizens. 
   Here's how this new program works. Local law enforcement officials travel to Herndon, Virginia, to train with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
   They get experience in immigration law, criminal law, document examination, alien processing, and cross-cultural communication. 
   These trained deputies then return home to their communities where they work with ICE agents to identify illegal immigrants in local jails by comparing fingerprints with ICE and FBI databases and interviewing prisoners. 
   The program may be new but it is already working. In the Cobb County jail alone, which holds nearly 2,200 inmates, law enforcement officials have identified 63 people of interest to Federal immigration authorities. That is 63 rapists, robbers, and drug lords that we can get off of our streets and out of our country. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know local law enforcement officials are often our front line of defense when it comes to identifying and removing illegal immigrants from our communities. As we look for solutions to the current illegal immigration crisis, we must empower our State and local officials and help them coordinate with Federal agents. And that is why I proudly supported an amendment last week to the Homeland Security appropriations bill. We passed that on the floor to support this new and promising ICE program so that we don't just provide funding to communities located within 100 miles of the southern border; otherwise Cobb County, Georgia won't have qualified. 
   Last summer I examined border security efforts along the United States-Mexican border, and during that trip I observed our Border Patrol agents loading up buses and planes with criminal illegal immigrants being deported back to their home countries. Now Cobb County is playing a vital role in this process, and I am incredibly proud of their efforts. The sheriff's office is helping rid our society of dangerous criminals who have no business being here in the United States. 
   Especially, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Cobb County Sheriff Neil Warren, Cobb County Police Chief George Hatfield, and the six Cobb deputies who went through the specialized training: Paul Harrison, Claudia Cross, Marco Cabrera, Olanda Palmer, and Paul Diaz. Their effort to uphold the rule of law is commendable, and I urge more local agencies to consider participating in this critical program.  
   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking the Cobb County sheriff's office for its commitment to getting dangerous, criminal, illegal immigrants out of our community.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4. It is unbelievable, in fact, that the Democrats would bring this bill to the floor. They were not part of the solution when we passed the prescription drug act, that they failed to pass for 25 years. I can understand them wanting to get on to a rising stock, but, Mr. Speaker, I will tell you this: they are betting on the last 10 percent. 
   Hanging this albatross around Medicare part D that has been so successful is going to drag it to the bottom, and it is going to hurt our seniors. It is going to hurt my mom. Seniors are saving an average of $1,100 per month because of competition in the marketplace. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, this week, the Democratic majority has trampled on the rights of the minority with these four bills, allowing us no opportunity for amendment. But, do you know what? I think on this particular bill, they have done us a favor. The way they have done us a favor is they have not allowed us to bring forth an amendment, trying to put lipstick on this legislative pig, and that is a favor to us. That is a political win for the Republican Party, but unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, it is a loss for our seniors. 
   We need to kill this sucker dead.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. Last year, the new prescription drug plan, Medicare Part D, was implemented and seniors in our country had access to drug coverage for the first time. 
   In its first year, the Part D program enjoyed lowered than expected cost, high enrollment numbers and an overwhelming vote of satisfaction from America's seniors. To me, Mr. Speaker, that is the definition of success. 
   Let me underscore the specific statistics that back up these statements, because in the course of the debate proponents of this government price control bill have misconstrued and misrepresented the realities of the Part D program. 
   First of all, in 2006 Part D cost $26 billion less than expected and over the next 10 years it is projected to cost 21 percent less than earlier forecasts. Mr. Speaker that represents a savings of over $200 billion to the American taxpayer--a savings Mr. Speaker, in a government program! Which leads to another important aspect of the Part D program, competition. 
   When Congress created this new prescription drug benefit, it was designed to use the power of competition to deliver low prices to America's seniors. For instance, Medicare beneficiaries were expected to pay an average monthly premium of $37. However in 2006, because of the fierce competition among plan providers to provide this benefit to our seniors, the average monthly premium shrunk to $24. 
   Seniors are overwhelmingly satisfied with their Part D plan. In a Kaiser Family Foundation survey, 81 percent of enrolled seniors are satisfied with their Medicare drug plan and only 4 percent are dissatisfied. In fact, a recent J.D. Power and Associates survey found seniors are more satisfied with their Medicare drug plan than with their auto insurance, home mortgage and cable service. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, that leads us to a very obvious question. Why are we debating a major change to this successful and popular program? The answer is quite obvious, but extremely disappointing. It is politics. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle spent a lot of time over the past few years throwing bricks at the ``Republican Part D Plan.'' And they didn't stop last year when the surveys and statistics were pouring in at how much this program was saving our seniors. And, Mr. Speaker, when it became obvious that the program was both successful and popular, the Democrats started touting the sound bite that Medicare needed the power of government negotiations to deliver even more savings to seniors. It seemed they wanted to capitalize on the very popularity they were undermining just a few months earlier. 
   Unfortunately, for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that political rhetoric has proven difficult to turn into sound policy. The reason is very simple. The Part D program is successful because the government has remained out of the negotiation process and private companies have fought hard to earn the right to service America's seniors. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office affirmed this in a letter to Senator Frist in 2004, and again this week to Chairman RANGEL. CBO states and I quote, ``We estimate that striking. that provision (the non-interference provision) would have a negligible effect on federal spending because CBO estimates that substantial savings will be obtained by the private plans and that the Secretary would not be able to negotiate prices that further reduce federal spending to a significant degree.'' 
   If my Democratic friends are only using this debate to score a few cheap political points, they should be ashamed of themselves, considering the only people that will pay for this maneuver are our struggling seniors.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, this is a hugely important issue. I know all Members are listening intently, and I hope the American public is listening. I want to remind them what a few of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle had to say. 
   One of their Members earlier in the debate basically said there was a philosophic, fundamental difference between them and us. They believe that government should control health care; we believe that the private sector should do it. Amen. The private sector should do it. 
   Another of their Members stood up and said he couldn't believe that the current Secretary of HHS doesn't want to have the requirement of negotiated price controls. Well, I will tell you why he doesn't, because he is not a typical bureaucrat. He believes, as Ronald Reagan believed, that you need to step out of the way; government needs to get out of our lives and not be in our medicine cabinet. 
   Finally, the gentlelady from Nevada said if she were a betting woman, she would bet that these price negotiations would lower the price even further. Well, I want to say to her that she is betting on the last 10 percent, Mr. Speaker. This is a wonderful program, it is working well, and she is about to hang an albatross around the neck of the program and hurt our needy seniors, including my mom. 
   Vote ``no'' on this piece of bad legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise not in opposition to the bill. I think there are some good things in the bill. I was a former member of the Education and Workforce Committee. I know our ranking member, Mr. McKeon, is a supporter of the bill. I rise in strong opposition to this rule, Mr. Speaker. 
   The gentlewoman on the Rules Committee on the majority side, the gentlewoman from Ohio, has mentioned a couple of things in her remarks, talking about what we Republicans did when we controlled this body and, indeed, the Rules Committee and how restrictive we may have been. But what I want to remind her is that I sat on that Rules Committee during that time, and I can remember the comments that were made from the minority, the then Democratic minority, that if they had an opportunity to control this place, then rules would be open and fair and people would be treated fair so that each Member would have an opportunity. They didn't say, Well, when we get the majority, we're going to stick it to you just like you've stuck it to us. So I think they should live by what they said they would do. 
   And the other thing I want to point out to the gentlewoman from Ohio is that she talked about the bipartisanship on this bill, a 45-0 vote. Well, 45 Members of this body is 10 percent, and 90 percent of us don't get an opportunity to speak on the bill and to offer what I think are very good amendments. Now, 47 were submitted; 27 were made in order. But how many Republican amendments? It was 4 out of 27. 
   Mine wasn't one of them, and I had a very good amendment, Mr. Speaker. This is the only opportunity I get to  talk about it. It's a bipartisan amendment. 
   Basically, Mr. Speaker, this amendment deals with FERPA, the Family Education Privacy Rights Act of 1974. The tragedy at Virginia Tech where we lost so many lives was, I think, because colleges and universities misinterpret that law. And my amendment would simply say that if a parent lists a child, a student, on their tax return as a dependent, even though they might be over age 18 or maybe they are a junior and age 20, but if they are a dependent as verified by the tax return, then those parents should have access to academic records, disciplinary records, drinking on campus, whatever. And many of us, I'm sure, have had college students where because of FERPA we never could find out how our youngsters were doing until they were in dire trouble, maybe flunking out of school or having a substance abuse problem. I commend Representative Tim Murphy for his work in regard to mental health issues along this same line. But this was a very good amendment, Mr. Speaker, and one that I would think Democrats would want to join Republicans and vice versa and have unanimous support of that. 
   So I am very disappointed. I am very disappointed not only for myself but for the American people, my constituents, students, and parents all across this country. 
   So, again, it's not the bill that I am opposed to. I am opposed to this restrictive rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my former chairman of the Rules Committee, the gentleman from California, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this rule and condemn the underlying bill, hastily leaving Iraq without any clear exit strategy. 
   Mr. Speaker, the timing of this legislation should raise some serious questions for the American people. It comes at a critical point in the global war on terror, a point at which our efforts should be focused on defeating terrorism inflicted by Islamic jihadists, not usurping the power of our military commanders, as this bill clearly does. 
   Today's debate comes on the heels of an intelligence analysis stating al Qaeda has regrouped to a level not seen since 9/11 with a greater ability to strike inside the United States. It comes in the immediate aftermath of the Muslim extremist attacks in London and Glasgow. In sum, it comes at a time when our decisions must be based  on strategic interests and not political grandstanding. 
   However, Mr. Speaker, this bill is not designed to help us fight terrorism to secure the United States' interests. In fact, its timing has nothing to do with national security at all. 
   Today, the Democratic leaderships want us to vote on a change of course before we have had the opportunity to fully analyze the President's interim report on our strategy in Iraq, and well ahead of the much anticipated September report to be delivered by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. 
   So why are we debating this now? Curiously, it comes at a time when this Democratic Congress has an approval rating as low as 14 percent. That's right, Mr. Speaker, their approval is at an all-time low. Their base, the extremist left, is very angry. They are angry at the Democrats' Out of Iraq Caucus because they failed to deliver. Indeed, Cindy Sheehan, their poster child, has now announced her candidacy against Speaker Pelosi. 
   So what do the Democrats do? They take another shot at Old Faithful. When all else fails, when they can't get anything accomplished, when all they can deliver to the American public is the most closed Congress in history, they engage in another round of political theater engineered to do nothing but grab a few headlines and appease that liberal base. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's not waste the time of this body by debating vague bills with absolutely no chance of becoming law. Let's instead examine the upcoming September report from our top military commanders and then, yes, then make informed decisions on the best path forward. 
   My friend, the distinguished chairwoman of the Rules Committee, the gentlewoman from New York, stated in her opening remarks that if we wait until September, as I suggest, 200 more troops would be lost and the lives of 200 families would be changed forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me remind my colleagues that within a 20-minute period of time on September 11, 2001, 3,000 lives were lost, some of our brightest and best; and, indeed, the lives of 3,000 families were changed forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and to oppose the irresponsible underlying bill.

   I apologize to the Johnson family of Armuchee, Georgia, who sacrificed their son, Justin. I apologize to the Saylor family from Bremen, Georgia, who gave up their son, Paul. I apologize to the Clayton family of Marietta, who misses dearly their son, Captain Hayes Clayton. To Carey and Sally Brown, of Atlanta, I apologize to you for the loss of your son, Tyler. From my wife's hometown of Newnan, Georgia, I express my regret to Robert Stokely for the death of his son, Mike. Finally, I apologize to the widow of Jack Hensley from Marietta, a beheaded contract worker. 
   Mr. Speaker, what an appalling thing to do to these families, whose sons gave the last full measure of devotion defending liberty and fighting the terrorist Islamic extremists, to pull the rug out from under them and say: We are not going to give victory a chance. We are not even willing to wait until September. I think that it is appalling. I am ashamed of the Democratic leadership. I apologize to these families from my district who have given so much.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding. He would make a great Commander in Chief. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to salute my close friend and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman IKE SKELTON. I hold him in the highest regard and I admire him dearly, though I must oppose his bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. This bill does not seek to clarify our objectives or a path to victory. It does not offer an alternative to the current plan being implemented by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker. 
   Nowhere to be found are any new ideas or solutions or any talk of curbing violence or compelling political reconciliation. Why? Because there is no pressure on the Democrats to put forth any meaningful ideas. They know that this bill is dead on arrival. The President has vowed to veto it, and rightly so. This is a defeatist measure that serves only to placate the Democrats' liberal base. 
   Mr. Speaker, a few things about this plan immediately jump out to me. According to this legislation, a date certain withdrawal is to commence 120 days after the enactment of this bill. So why then does the bill wait another 2 months before asking the President to formulate a strategy? It is like asking a quarterback to throw Brother Ben passes until the offensive coordinator can come up with a game plan. 
   Essentially, this bill says that after our troops have packed their bags and have begun to come home, or maybe to deploy to Okinawa per the Murtha plan, then we will receive this master plan detailing how to provide for the security interests in Iraq. 
   As a physician, that is akin to calling a patient in for surgery before you have done the exam, yanking somebody's heart out before you have inspected the coronaries. In short, Mr. Speaker, it is a recipe for disaster. 
   Mr. Speaker, the last troop surge deployed just 3 weeks ago, hardly a significant time period for us to be here today judging the plan. However, I do believe Congress should engage in an ongoing, rational dialogue outlining the expectations of both our troops and the Iraqi Government and the security forces. Nobody is here suggesting that we shouldn't. And we will do it in September when we get the Petraeus report based on that report. But, Mr. Speaker, we cannot capitulate to extremist views and sinister plans, which is what this bill would do by sending a message to the terrorists that capitulation begins in 120 days. 
   I urge my colleagues, oppose this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, I have been working on legislation to temporarily suspend the Visa Waiver Program until our ports of entry are secure with the technology outlined and required by the 2001 PATRIOT Act and the Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. 
   For those who don't know, the Visa Waiver Program was established back in 1986 as a temporary program allowing tourists or short-term business visitors to enter the United States for 90 days or less without obtaining a visa. The program was later made permanent by Congress, and it currently includes 27 countries. 
   The problem with this system is that terrorists are not limited by borders, nationality or even ethnicity. A terrorist with a French passport can be just as dangerous as one from Iran. In short, we need to make sure everyone who enters this country is appropriately screened. 
   This conference report will expand the Visa Waiver Program simply at the discretion of the Secretary of State. 
   Many of us read in the news this summer that the failed London and Glasgow bombings are linked to homegrown British terrorists with ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. I don't doubt that the United Kingdom is one of our closest allies, but this goes to show that even our greatest friends can be vulnerable to homegrown terrorists possessing legitimate citizenship documentation and authorized legal passports. 
   Giving terrorists a free pass of any type into our country only welcomes more strikes on our homeland, and it strengthens these organizations, these terrorist organizations right here in the United States. We cannot afford additional visa waiver countries and provide more opportunities for terrorists to breach a loophole in our security. 
   How much time does our Nation have before immigration, customs enforcement, our air marshals, the TSA, Transportation Security Administration, misses the next Richard Reid. 
   In closing, this conference report will not secure our Homeland Security if it expands the opportunity for terrorists to travel to the United States. As a Member of the House Senate Conference Committee, I would not sign a report with language expanding this program. 
   I urge my colleagues, vote down the rule and the underlying legislation. Let's send it back to the conference and secure our Homeland Security.

   I am compassionate and I care about the farmers in my district, but I must vote ``no'' and I must vote ``no'' for two reasons, one of which the gentleman from Tennessee just outlined. The bill calls for a massive tax increase on foreign companies that are doing business in this country. And in the State of Georgia, that is 176,000 jobs, 59,000 of them in the manufacturing sector. The gentleman from Tennessee has a better idea, and I plan to support his amendment. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage requirement absolutely hurts innovative businesses, like U.S. Biofuels in Rome, Georgia, that want to convert chicken fat and soy beans to biofuel; and yet these prevailing wages take away all incentive for that. 
   We kill jobs in this country with this farm bill, and I reluctantly must vote ``no'' and ask my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (ROE V. WADE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this hour and for allowing me to be with him tonight and for giving me this time. 
   I think my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, know that my prior career, my profession before becoming a Member of Congress 5 1/2 years ago was I practiced medicine, and not just as a medical doctor, but as an OB/GYN specialist. In that specialty for 26 years, I delivered over 5,200 babies during that time. I am very proud to say that I performed no abortions. But I think it is important for our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and for men and women across this country to understand how this Roe v. Wade came about 35 years ago in 1973. 
   Prior to that, abortion in many States was illegal. It could not be performed. In some instances, yes, it was true that women would have what is known as a criminal abortion done, and sometimes with very devastating consequences to the woman. If the abortion was done by a doctor with skills, surgical skills, there probably were no complications, other than destroying that human life, that little human life. But if the abortion was performed in an unprofessional, botched manner, then the life not only of the fetus but also of the woman was at stake. 
   When I was an intern at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, back in those days in the late 1960s, 1969, 1970, yes, there occasionally was a patient on the ward suffering from septic shock. And in one instance I very vividly remember that that patient, that mother who had had an abortion done and the complications thereof, infection set in and she died. And these cases were presented across the country to the Supreme Court eventually, basically, in Roe v. Wade. And then all of a sudden the Supreme Court said that no State, no State could proscribe abortion. 
   That is what we got to in 1973. And since that time, of course, as my colleague from Michigan just mentioned, something like 48 million lives have been destroyed in the abortion process, in that so-called safe, legal process, where the procedures are done by licensed physicians, and they are done under certain circumstances, maybe in a hospital with anesthesia, and it is very safe and that no mothers die. 
   Well, some mothers do die. But without question, some 48 million little children, potential Members of Congress in fact, lost their lives by this abortion procedure. And that is why I am so proud to be here tonight to join with my colleagues, with the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Smith, Mr. Franks, Mr. Davis, Mr. Walberg, Mr. Lamborn and others to talk about this issue.     
   Each of us will have a little bit of time. But I am very grateful to be  standing here tonight to know that today on the Mall, right here at the Capitol, we had so many come. I don't know how many thousands of families came. We had something like 12 or 14 Members of Congress speak on behalf of life, the life of the infant, the life of the fetus. This is a very proud day, and it is a very proud evening too for us to stand here for the sanctity of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to focus on a couple of charts that I have got. The first one, if my colleagues will look, basically says this. This is a quote from a very important person, and I will mention her in just a minute. ``Abortion, at any point, was wrong. It was so clear. Painfully clear.'' That ends the quote. This is from Norma McCorvey, better known as Jane Roe from Roe v. Wade. In other words, she was the plaintiff. 
   Mrs. McCorvey wanted to have an abortion in a State that didn't allow it, so she was the plaintiff. This quote is taken from her book, ``Won by Love'' by Norma McCorvey, and she is now a pro-life advocate. She didn't have that abortion, because by the time Roe v. Wade was passed, she had gone on and had that little girl, who is in her mid-thirties now. Mrs. McCorvey, Norma, is also the proud grandmother of two children. Thank God that she didn't have that abortion. 
   Listen to what Susan B. Anthony, this is way long, many years ago, in another century, said even before this issue came up. ``Abortion is a reflection of our society's failure to meet the needs of women. We are dedicated to systematically eliminating the root causes that drive women to abortion.'' That is a quote from Susan B. Anthony. 
   What I want to point out is that many States now, many States, including my own State of Georgia, I am very proud that we have passed, as this poster shows, a ``woman's right to know law,'' required not just in Georgia, but in 23 States, that women who seek abortions be fully informed about relevant issues such as, the first bullet point, medical risk of abortion; the possible detrimental psychological effects of an abortion; a father's legal responsibility in State laws for paternal child support; and medical assistance benefits may be available to prenatal care, childbirth, and neonatal care. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, that we just in the last month reauthorized for an additional 18 months, does include prenatal care so that women are not forced for financial reasons to terminate a pregnancy. So this is really what Susan B. Anthony was talking about so many years ago. 
   What we are seeing as a result of that, in my last chart that I want to present, is that over these 35 years, we are seeing a gradual and actually dramatic drop in the number of abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. Those women who are most fertile, that peaked at 29 per 1,000 women that age back in 1979. Now the latest statistics in 2005, that number has dropped down to something like 19.4. So we are making great progress. 
   The point that I want to make in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, is we don't need to continue to destroy life. We need to inform women. We need to inform women of their choices, the alternatives to destroying a human life, which in almost every instance they are opposed to. But they are uninformed, they are frightened, they are scared, they are concerned about raising a child as a single parent. But if they are given the opportunity maybe to place that child for adoption, if they know there is financial help available, if they know that there are counselors who want to work with them that help them if they decide to have their baby and be a single parent, if that is the case, these are the things that we need to be concentrating on, Mr. Speaker. 
   So as I conclude, I just want to say to the gentleman from Arizona, I thank him for giving all of us an opportunity tonight to speak on this hugely important issue. Let's stand for the rights of the unborn. Let's not be so concerned about some person who is already here, man or woman, about their property rights guaranteed under the 14th Amendment. Let's think about what we said in our Declaration of Independence and think about unalienable rights, such as the right to life. Let's think about what is in the Charter of the United Nations, that every member nation is bound to abide by, and that is the sanctity of life. And, last but not least, what God says in both the New and the Old Testament, thou shalt not kill; you shall not take another's life. That is why we stand here tonight, to bring that to our Members. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Arizona, and thank him for allowing me to be part of this.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (MINE COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise also in support of H.R. 3877, the Mine Communications Technology Innovation Act. 
   First, I want to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Gordon, Ranking Member Hall, and all of the members of the Science Committee and the staff who worked so hard to bring this important bipartisan legislation through our committee and to the House floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, every Member of the House hopes to avoid another catastrophe such as the Sago Mine explosion in West Virginia in 2006 or the disaster at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah this past August. And I certainly want to commend my colleague, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Matheson), for introducing H.R. 3877 to address one of the major obstacles to miner safety, and that is, our inability, as he just pointed out, to track miners underground and to communicate with them in the event of such an emergency. 
   Under the 2006 MINER Act, the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, and the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety, NIOSH, receive significant funding to lead an interagency program to develop communication, tracking, oxygen supply and refuge systems for mines. To date, this program has invested over $23 million, and it is steadily progressing towards installation of new, safer communication systems by the year 2009. 
   As NIOSH and MSHA continue to advance research and development in this area, there was clear bipartisan agreement within the Science Committee that the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, could enhance these efforts by fostering standards for communication equipment in mines and development of those systems through the creation of best practices, measurement services, and research evaluation.     
   NIST has long been a leader in communications research technology and has the equipment, and it has the expertise to characterize the mine environment and determine what techniques are best suited for these very difficult situations and conditions. 
   This bill is the product of bipartisan work in the Science Committee, and it creates a basic framework to ensure that the government's research agency works cooperatively, effectively and quickly to improve mine and miner safety. 
   The world-renowned capabilities of NIST laboratories and the years of study and experience at NIOSH and MSHA can significantly improve implementation of emergency communications and tracking systems in our mines. Improvement in these systems will substantially increase rescuers' ability to find and free miners in the event of a mine catastrophe, as we just outlined, that occurred recently in West Virginia and the great State of Utah. 
   H.R. 3877 would significantly contribute to the health and the safety of miners by uniting the communications and standards experience of NIST with the ongoing research and the mine environment experience at NIOSH and MSHA. 
   I want to applaud my colleague, Mr. Matheson, for addressing this issue that he knows so well that is of such utmost importance to his constituents in Utah, as well as mining communities across this country. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. It will make significant advancements in miner safety. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I thank my colleagues on the Republican side and our leadership for giving me the opportunity to be on the floor tonight to talk to all of our colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, about one of the most pressing issues facing this country in a long, long time. And of course the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) just spent her 5-minute discussion talking about the very same thing. But we are blessed to have an hour worth of time tonight, as we have done on several nights for the last I would say 3 or 4 weeks talking about this one huge problem, Mr. Speaker. 
   And I have a number of my colleagues who have joined me tonight to help in this discussion of this energy crisis which is so important that the Nation is now facing. We have a Member who I will yield to subsequently who wants to talk about something very unique, a new bill, something that he has thought of that I think is very, very interesting, intriguing, and I want my colleagues to hear about that. 
   But let me start the hour, Mr. Speaker, by giving our colleagues a little quiz. This is not a pop quiz. Well, maybe in a way it is, but it is not a difficult pop quiz. In fact, it is the easiest type question, the kind I always enjoyed when in school, it is multiple choice. It is a multiple-choice question. So I want to ask the cameras to sort of hone in on this first slide that I have to my left. This is the question. It is simple. It is straightforward. 
   How do we bring down the price of oil? 
   Now I have listed about six possible answers. I could have listed eight or ten. Let's start with A, open up oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Now that oil and natural gas has been closed to us, has been locked up since the mid-seventies when a moratorium was placed. Thank goodness President Bush just recently, in the last 2 weeks, lifted the executive order and now Congress certainly could pass a law and allow us to do that. 
   So, A, I am sure for many of our colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle, A, would be their choice as the best answer. 
   The second answer, B, build new oil refineries. Well, you mean we haven't? No. No, my colleagues, we have not built a new oil refinery in this country probably in 25 years. We have expanded a bit along the gulf coast where most of the refineries currently exist. And, of course, they are right in hurricane alley, and we know what happened during Hurricane Katrina when a lot of refineries were shut down and we had a real crisis because of that. 
   So darn right, B would be a good answer, build new oil refineries. 
   And C, commercially develop renewable energy resources. What do we mean by renewable energy resources? Well, I think the main two that come right to mind are wind and solar. Wind and solar. Wind and sun. 
   There are some parts of the energy where there is a lot of energy produced by wind and sun. The North Sea, the northern part of Germany, Hamburg; in the Netherlands. I have been to both of those countries and seen these huge turbines, wind farms, and some are out in the ocean. You can't see them, they are a long way from shore, but this constant wind source in the North Sea is a good source of renewable energy. 
   Solar panels, I would say, work real good in the equator in the temperate zones, but they may not work so well in certain parts of our country. But without question, C is a good response to how do we bring down the price of oil, commercially develop renewable energy resources. We are doing that. In fact, we have tax credits to incentivize that. I have recently supported a bill by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Bartlett), to renew those tax credits for renewable to stimulate that industry. These tax credits expire, I think, in about a month, so it is very important that we do renew that. 
   Right now only 1 to 2 percent of the energy, the electricity in this country is generated from these renewable sources. It ought to be 6 to 8, maybe 10 percent; and hopefully eventually it will. So C is a pretty darn good answer. 
   The fourth choice, D, commission new nuclear power plants. Well, you know, some of our colleagues may say you mean we haven't? We don't? We have got over 100 nuclear power plants in this country, some in the southeast. The gentleman from Tennessee is with us tonight, and there are some in Tennessee. And there certainly are some in my home State of Georgia. I worked at a nuclear power plant in South Carolina when I was a co-op student at Georgia Tech. But we have not licensed, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not licensed a nuclear plant in about 30 years. 
   The Three Mile Island scare, there was no loss of life, maybe that had something to do with it. But nuclear power today is safe. It is efficient. It is clean; and yes, it is expensive. And maybe that is part of the reason why we haven't gone nuclear in a more meaningful way. Right now I think probably 12 percent of our power in this country is generated by nuclear power. 
   But when you are paying $140 a barrel for oil, petroleum products, all of a sudden nuclear power would be a bargain. And we have a couple of power plants in the State of Georgia. Plant Vogtle has two and is asking to bring online two more. We need to streamline that. 
   There are countries, France in particular, 85 percent of their electric power, their electricity, is generated by nuclear power. In fact, they even have to sell some of that to their  neighbor Germany who doesn't allow nuclear power. 
   The Scandinavian countries, Sweden, they have nuclear power generation almost exclusively, and they have a good way of getting rid of the nuclear waste, of burying it deep in bedrock. We have the same capability right here in the United States out in Nevada where we have spent billions of dollars developing Yucca Mountain, but yet politicians, very powerful politicians from the State of Nevada, I won't mention names, but they are blocking that. 
   So without question, D, commission new nuclear power plants, would be a darn good answer. 
   The next choice is E, promote conservation. 
   Now look, who could disagree with that answer? There are 85 million barrels of oil, petroleum, produced in this world every day; 85 million barrels. The United States of America utilizes 22 million barrels a day. We are about 5 percent of the world's population, and we are utilizing about 25 percent of the world production of crude oil. So there is something wrong with that math, no question about it. That calculus just doesn't add up. So we certainly need to conserve. We need to ride in high-occupancy vehicle lanes on our interstates. We need to probably, slowly but surely, go to smaller automobiles that are more fuel efficient.     
   We need to go to these fluorescent-type light bulbs. I mean there are so many things that we can do. Yes, we need to tighten our belt; so that answer is not a bad answer. 
   And I said that we could have put some other things in there. ``Sue OPEC,'' I don't think that would be a very good answer, but I have heard people say that. ``Sue OPEC and Venezuela'' I have heard. And the Democratic majority, Mr. Speaker, has legislation and they want to say, well, we need to stop all the speculating and the hedging and unless you are actually taking possession of the oil, that contract, and you really are buying it for the oil company or for the airlines or for the Air Force, you shouldn't play in that market. I don't know if that's a problem. It may be a little small part of the problem. I could have added that as a possible answer. 
   But the last choice is choice F, and that choice is ``all of the above.'' And I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I think F is the right answer. And I believe that the 5,000 or so people that were chatting with me last night from Harris, Polk, and Carroll Counties of the 11th Congressional District in Georgia told me very clearly that that's the choice that they would take. And I believe that a fifth grade geography class would make the choice, that they would say just what the Republican minority has been saying to our brothers and sisters across the aisle for the last month or 6 weeks, that we need to do all of these things. There is not one silver bullet. You can't solve this problem with the snap of your fingers and sue Big Oil and windfall profit taxes and releasing a few million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. You might affect the price for a few days, but it would go right back up. No, we need to look at this not only in the short term but in the long term. If we had done this back in the 1970s, we wouldn't be in this crisis that we are in today. But we went back to sleep is what we did. Shame on us for that, and doubly shame on us if we do it today. 
   People are suffering, Mr. Speaker. People are suffering severely. And we are about to leave this body. Ms. Foxx was talking about 9 days. Well, really we're talking about 4 or 5 legislative days and we are out of here for recess or vacation or whatever you want to call it. Every August, that's traditional. But in a situation like this, I tell you what, I would be proud to sit right here on this floor Friday and Saturday and Sunday waiting for this body to act and not adjourn until we get something done. Because if we are away from here for a month and nothing is done, when we come back, the kids are back in school, and you know how they're going to get there? They're going to walk or they're going to be riding their bicycles out on these busy highways because those yellow buses are not going to be on the road because these school systems are not going to be able to afford the diesel fuel to put in those buses. 
   So this is serious stuff, Mr. Speaker, and I think my colleagues understand that. I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand it. And what they don't understand and what my constituents don't understand is why the leadership, the people that bring the bills to the floor, those that have the control that say which bills are voted on and when, why they can't understand it. 
   Well, in this hour we will get into all of that, but I have got a couple of my colleagues on the floor with me, and I want to give them an opportunity because they have got some very interesting things to say. But I have got one more chart, Mr. Speaker, that I want to show before I yield to my colleagues. 
   This chart, and of course I have already given the answer away, the answer F, ``all of the above.'' And, of course, it shows this big huge oil rig way out, 150 miles in the Gulf of Mexico. We ought to be doing that off the East Coast and off the West Coast, of course with the States' consent and with their ability to share in the revenue. And the Federal part of that revenue could be used to continue to push and promote alternative energy sources like that wind and solar we were talking about earlier, coal liquefaction, mining shale, doing a lot of things that will make us energy independent and will increase our domestic production. 
   And, of course, there are some other pictures on this slide as I refer back to it. These are some of the wind farms. That's exactly what they look like in the Netherlands and in other places that I've seen them. This, of course, is a nuclear power plant. 
   The drilling in ANWR, I put that there just to point out what a small area it is, Mr. Speaker. The light green on the darker green is 2,000 acres in an area of 19 million, and 2,000 acres in an area of 19 million is like a postage stamp on a football field. And it's Coastal Plain, tundra, frozen most of the year. It's 70 miles from the Alaskan pipeline. It's 10 billion barrels of oil, and if you're pumping it, it's probably 1.5 million barrels a day. That increases our domestic production 15 to 20 percent, just that one site. So, obviously, we need to do all of these things if we are going to solve the problem. 
   And before I go any further, though, as I said at the outset, Mr. Speaker, one of our Members had a very interesting thought. He wants to spend a little time discussing it and making sure our colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand it. He's a long-term Member. He knows about oil. He knows about energy. He's a great Texan. He is the ranking member of the Science Committee. I am proud at this time to yield to my good friend and colleague from Texas, the Honorable Ralph Hall.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas. He did not disappoint. I think that his explanation was exactly what I anticipated. 
   And I want to, before I yield to my good friend and colleague from Tennessee, I wanted to point out, reference back to Representative Hall's poster in regard to the map. And he pointed out, of course, that this whole area, the refuge area, 9 million acres, refuge area, no development allowed. That is this orange area. 
   And then also, in the yellow area, wilderness area, another 8 million acres, no development allowed. 
   And then this Coastal Plain area on the very top, the north slope, that area was reserved by our own President Jimmy Carter, from my State of Georgia, who fully intended that, eventually, that oil exploration could be allowed in that area that Representative Hall was talking about, and not the whole area, but this small, I mean, it is about 1.5 million acres and we are talking about 2,000 acres. So clearly that was the intent, as he pointed out, back in 1980. 
   So I love this slide and I love his idea. I think it is intriguing. 
   And with that I want to yield now to my good friend from Chattanooga, the Honorable Zach Wamp.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. He is always very, very thoughtful, and his presentation is so clear. Hopefully, all of my colleagues can understand the message that we are presenting tonight. That is, really, as we go back, thinking about the initial little quiz, the little pop quiz, multiple choice, it's all of the above. It's all of the above. That is what Representative Zach Wamp from Chattanooga, who is a member of the Appropriations Committee and who understands this issue, is explaining to our colleagues and to anybody else who might be listening tonight. This is important stuff, and it is critical. It is critical that we do something about it. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, I have in my hand--and this is awfully small, but  maybe the camera can focus in on it. This just shows you a number of bills that have been introduced by the Republican minority starting the week of June the 9th: 
   H.R. 3089, the No More Excuses Energy Act of 2007: No action on that bill. We have a discharge petition. Almost every Republican has signed that discharge petition, but we need 218 of our colleagues. That means some of our Democrat colleagues need to sign these bills as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, thank you. Of course. 
   The next bill, H.R. 2279, was introduced the week of June the 16th. This bill, the title of it, is Expand American Refining Capacity on Closed Military Installations. Mr. Speaker, as you know, there has been no action on that bill. Right over here to my right, at the desk, is a discharge petition. We've got Republican votes. We're awfully close, Mr. Speaker. We need 218, but so far, no action. 
   Basically, this bill just says in the BRAC process, where we have a number of closed military installations, we have that government land, and if that community wants to have a refinery placed there, then we can do it. It's a very simple bill. As I said at the outset, we desperately need to expand existing refineries and bring more online. 
   Now, in the week of June the 23rd, H.R. 5656: Repeal the Ban on Acquiring Alternative Fuels. It reduces the price of gasoline by allowing the Federal Government to procure advanced alternative fuels derived from diverse sources like oil shale, tar sands and coal-to-liquid technology. 
   I want to spend an extra amount of time, my colleagues and Mr. Speaker, discussing that particular bill because that was a provision--section 526, I believe--in the Democrats' energy bill of 2007. The energy bill, I think, is called the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. 
   Now, this section 526 basically says that no agency of the Federal Government can enter into a contract to purchase any nontraditional fuel if the result of processing that fuel or of burning that fuel is an increase of one scintilla--a scintilla, my colleagues, is a very small amount, indeed, a nanogram, an infinitesimal increase--in the carbon dioxide footprint. 
   So that means that domestic sources that are not traditional bubble-up petroleum that are easily obtained cannot be utilized, and that is a tragedy. That is a tragedy for this country when the Department of Defense, one agency of the Federal Government, is spending in the year 2008 an extra $9 billion on fuel. Now, this is not the total amount they're spending. This is just the delta because of $145 a barrel on petroleum and what it costs eventually to produce jet fuel. 
   Yet we have in this country, in the Rocky Mountain States, in three or four States out in the Rocky Mountain area, a product called shale. It's a rock, and it's embedded with petroleum, and it can be mined on the surface. People get concerned, I guess, sometimes about the environmental effects of mining, but if we didn't mine in this world, there would be no highways; there would be no aggregate to produce concrete and asphalt. Indeed, there would be no diamonds, no copper. 
   Mining shale has the potential in this country of producing 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum, 1.5 trillion barrels of petroleum, Mr. Speaker. Yes, it's a little more difficult to get it, and possibly, it does yield a scintilla increase in the carbon dioxide footprint, but when we're in a crisis like we are in today in this country and when people are suffering, I'll guarantee you the citizens of the 11th District of Georgia--of northwest Georgia in the nine counties that I represent--and probably my 434 colleagues in this body on both sides of the aisle and their constituents will tell you the same thing: 
   We're worried about the carbon footprint; we want a clean environment, and we know that that's important to our future, and we're going to work toward that. 
   Guess what the number one priority is today. That is bringing down the price of gasoline because we can't eat and because we can't get our kids to school. We can't get to work. This is something that you would think, Mr. Speaker, the leadership of this body could clearly see when everybody else in this country can see it. 
   I could give you some statistics about polling. We all look at polls particularly in this big election year. According to a CNN poll, 73 percent of Americans favor more exploration of deep ocean energy resources far off of American shores. In a Reuters-Zogby poll just this past June, 75 percent of Americans support drilling for oil off the shores of the United States while 59 percent support drilling in ANWR. 
   We have heard this. This is an undeniable fact. I mean I know people can have their own opinions, but they cannot have their own facts. The fact is we're the only developed country in the world that has not taken advantage of exploring for oil and natural gas off of our Continental Shelf. It makes no sense. In fact, right now, Cuba and China are talking about exploring for oil and natural gas off of the coast of Cuba, 45 miles from our coast, and it's perfectly legal; they can do that. Yet we're sitting on our hands. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 
   Well, I've got a number of other bills, Mr. Speaker, that are sitting over there with those discharge petitions that are just waiting for a few Democratic signatures. I wonder of the conservative members, particularly of the Democratic Conference and of the Blue Dogs, where their signatures are. It's amazing to me that they don't go to their leadership and say, ``You know, you're killing us. We're on the verge of committing political suicide. We've got to do something.'' 
   If I cared only about the politics of it, I probably wouldn't say a word. I would let them continue this folly of their leadership and hope that the political consequences in November would be advantageous to my Republican Party, and we'd regain the majority, and we'd elect President McCain. I hope that happens. 
   What's more important right now is that we come together in a bipartisan way and that we do the right thing for the American people and then let the politics take care of themselves and let the chips fall where they may, and they will. 
   As we get toward the close of the hour, in the remaining few minutes, I want to talk about a bill that was introduced just yesterday by the leader of my party, by the minority leader, John Boehner, the gentleman from Ohio. What Mr. Boehner did is he took all of these bills that our colleagues have introduced over the last 6 or 8 weeks, and he put them together into one bill, the American Energy Act.     
   We had a press conference today on the West steps of the Capitol, and Chairman Boehner, Leader Boehner, and our leadership and a number of Members who actually went up to--Mr. Hall said earlier he had not seen the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and wondered how many Members had. Just this past weekend, Leader Boehner and 10 freshman members of the Republican Conference went, and with their very own eyes, they saw this area. 
   They also went out to Golden, Colorado, to see where all the research that's being done on renewable fuel and coal-to-liquid. We have something like 1.5 trillion tons of coal in this country, and we use a lot of it, a lot of it to fire our electricity plants. But we could convert so much of that excess coal to petroleum, coal liquefaction, and we could do it in a clean and environmentally friendly way. 
   So Leader Boehner introduced the American Energy Act, and as I said earlier, remember the multiple choice question, an all-of-the-above approach to energy independence: increase the supply American made energy in environmentally friendly and sound ways; promote alternative and renewable energy technology; improve energy conservation and efficiency. That's the approach that Leader Boehner and the Republican minority is asking our colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to get on board with us for the American people. 
   And under the bullet point of increasing the supply of American-made energy--we talked about it tonight--open the Outer Continental Shelf, provide an additional 3 million barrels of oil per day, as well as 76 trillion--yes, that's with a T--76 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; open the Arctic National  Wildlife Refuge, an additional 1.5 million barrels a day; and reduce bureaucratic red tape to construct new oil refineries; and increase the supply of gas at the pump, increase the supply of American-made energy; promote alternative and renewable energy technologies. 
   As I said, repeal that idiotic section 526 prohibition on government purchases of alternative energy and promote coal-to-liquid technology, shale mining, tar sand production. A lot of the oil that we get from Canada already comes from tar sand, but yet we can't get it right here in the United States of America. It's insanity. 
   Establish a renewable energy trust fund using the revenues generated by exploration in the OCS and ANWR. What Mr. Hall and Representative Wamp were both talking about is when these States share in the revenue, if they allow this drilling off of their coast, 25, 50, 100 miles out to sea, then the Federal Government also shares in royalties. That money could be spent on research and development for alternative fuels. 
   Permanently extend tax credits for alternative energy production: wind, solar, hydrogen, biomass. We talked about that earlier. 
   And eliminate, of course, barriers to the expansion of nuclear power production, which we also discussed. 
   And then the final chart, improve energy conservation and efficiency. There are a number of things on this chart. I could talk about them real quickly: provide tax incentives for businesses and families that purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles; provide a monetary prize for being the first to develop an economically feasible superfuel-efficient vehicle--John McCain is for that--provide tax incentives for businesses and homeowners who improve their energy efficiency. 
   So, in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the opportunity, as I say to be here tonight, to talk about these issues, has been a privilege. It indeed has been a privilege, and I want to say to my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, that we Republicans care about the environment. We care about conservation. We want to reduce greenhouse gases for sure. Some of us believe that there's scientific evidence there that suggests that global warming is a real thing and it's caused by too much greenhouse gas production. But we can take care of that problem without breaking this country, if we do it in the right way. 
   Right now, first and foremost, it is time to lower the price of gasoline at the pump. We can do it by drilling here, drilling now, and saving money for the American people. We're sent here to represent them. We're not doing a very good job of it. No wonder our approval rating is 9 percent. That's shameful. 
   Let's stay here through the August recess. You know, if it's a week, if it's two weeks, whatever, let's get this job done for the American people.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I want to say that I, Doctor, Representative Phil Gingrey as a pro-life OB-GYN, in the interest of full disclosure, I want to say that I'm very supportive of family planning, but not family planning that includes defin ition of abortion as part of family planning. 
   In the Lowey amendment, which I'm opposed to, I'm not questioning her integrity or intent in what she says in explanation, but I think it's a very confusing amendment. And when we just heard the two Democratic Members engaging in a colloquy with the chairwoman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) and the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), as they said that they were very much in favor of the Mexico City policy and wanted to make sure th at no money would be spent, and I think the chairlady tried to explain that. 
   But then just a second ago, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Jackson), stood up to ask our ranking member if there was anything in the Lowey amendment that spoke to the issue of funding. 
   But I would say to the gentleman, Mr. Chairman, and my colleagues, funding versus commodity. If you tell me that you're going to give me $75, that's funding, I guess. If you're going to say, no, I'm not going to give you $75, I'm going to give you a tank of gas, it's the same value. 
   And I think as the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) was explaining earlier with his poster, that you ultimately take money away from the countries that need it. And we don't want to do that. 
   If you really want to make sure that we don't export abortion to another country, then we're going to have an amendment coming up momentarily, the Stupak-Chris Smith amendment, that strikes the language and restores the Mexico City policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by both the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. STUPAK and the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. SMITH. 
   This amendment would simply reaffirm our country's long standing commitment to not using federal taxpayer money to fund or support abortions. More specifically, this amendment would preserve the decades-old, internationally agreed upon Mexico City Policy that defends the sanctity of life by preventing taxpayer dollars from funding overseas family planning organizations that promote or perform abortions. 
   Mr. Chairman, while many Americans may disagree on the issue of abortion, a vast majority of them do not believe that abortions should be publicly funded. This Mexico City Policy significantly prevents the exploitation of developing nations where some non-governmental organizations aggressively advocate the use of abortion as birth control--birth control, Mr. Chairman. The tactics of these NGOs are simply and utterly unconscionable, and I know Americans don't want their tax dollars funding these activities. 
   Now, opponents of the amendment have tried to assert that it would take away funding from international family planning. Quite to the contrary, this Amendment does not take one single cent from these activities, but rather maintains the current policy preventing Federal funding of foreign abortions. We must remain resolute in the preservation of this policy. 
   Having practiced as a pro-life OB-GYN for nearly 30 years, I firmly believe that we have an obligation to protect life at each and every stage--and this obligation does not just apply to unborn Americans. 
   Any human life--regardless of geography, regardless of circumstance--has the right to exist. Foreign abortions are just as tragic as abortions here at home. 
   We should not and we cannot allow the Mexico City Policy to be abandoned. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support Stupak/Smith.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Chairman, I believe our Nation needs to secure its points of entry, and specifically I believe that we should prevent additional countries from joining the United States visa waiver program until we have technical and human resources to secure our points of entry. I do not believe our Nation can afford to allow more visitors in the United States without screening them prior to arrival. 
   This amendment would prevent funds from being used to negotiate additional visa waiver countries. The State Department should not be using funds to negotiate new visa waivers until the machine-readable and tamper-resistant biometric identification standards that were mandated by the U.S. PATRIOT Act as a cornerstone of the entry-exit system are fully operational. We refer to that, Mr. Chairman, as the US-VISIT program. There are currently 27 visa waiver countries, and I believe it is too risky to negotiate additional countries without first having our security screening system in place. 
   Mr. Chairman, we cannot afford to provide more opportunities for terrorists to breach a loophole in our security. How much time does our Nation have before ICE, the Immigration Customs Enforcement, the air marshals or the TSA, Transportation Security Administration, misses the next Richard Reid? 
   For example, Habib Zacarias Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, a name we all know very well, actually used his French passport, without a U.S. visa, on February 23, 2001. He flew from London to Chicago and on to Oklahoma City, where he began the flight training at an aviation school. 
   Fortunately, on August 16, 2001, INS arrested Moussaoui because he had remained in the United States well beyond the 90 days that were allowed under the visa waiver program entrants and he was in violation of the requirement that visa waiver program travelers enter for business or tourism. Had INS and law enforcement not been literally on top of their game, Mr. Speaker, Moussaoui could have been a part of the 9/11 attacks. That was his intent. We stopped him, but he was here on a visa waiver. 
   A more recent example can be summarized in a June 18, just this month, 2007, ABC News reported about suicide bombers who were sent to the United States and Europe after being trained in Afghanistan. The story references this recent terrorist video where the Taliban military commander, Mansoor Dadullah, is found saying in this video, ``These Americans, Canadians, British and Germans, come here to Afghanistan from faraway places.'' This story further confirms, Mr. Speaker, what we already know: Terrorist forces are recruiting from the Western World, the same countries who are established members of our visa waiver program. 
   I feel that we cannot continue a loophole that allows homegrown European terrorists access to the United States. 
   Mr. Chairman, the visa waiver program was only designed to be a temporary program for a small and select group of nations, starting with the U.K., Japan and France. Now, 27 countries participate in the visa waiver program, believe me, enough to keep ICE and TSA exceedingly busy. Do we really need to fund efforts to add a 28th and 29th country to their list of responsibilities? 
   I just don't want to see our Nation attacked because we couldn't carry through with our commitment to security first. I ask my colleagues, please, support this commonsense Gingrey amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of the full committee for yielding, and I certainly appreciate his willingness to understand the necessity of the amendment. Indeed, I appreciate it and will agree to that, and hope the administration will follow through on the amendment. I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank you and I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. 
   Yes, Mr. Chairman, there is a security fence around Fort Benning, but I would not describe the home of the Infantry as a fortress by any stretch of the imagination, as my colleague just referred. 
   Mr. Chairman, here we go again. Once more, my good friend, and he is my good friend, from Massachusetts has so confused the record that it's really tough to know where to begin. But let me try. 
   He argues that we need to shut down WHINSEC because nearly 30 years ago, several graduates of a different program, the School of the Americas, were found to have committed atrocities in their home countries, a tenuous conclusion indeed. I wonder if he would argue that we should shut down Harvard because the Unabomber actually took some classes there. Mr. Chairman, of course he wouldn't. Because my friend knows that when a student does something awful years after graduating, you can't reasonably hold the school accountable. And to do so would let one man's action deny thousands more the opportunity to grow and to learn. Essentially it would be throwing the baby out with the bath water. 
   So let's set the record straight, Mr. Chairman. Over 60,000 members of Latin American security forces have trained at WHINSEC and its predecessor since the inception of the school; 99.99 percent have served their countries with honor and distinction. This is the fact. 
   In order to ensure that known human rights offenders are not attending WHINSEC, potential participants undergo background checks by the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and the Department of State, not vetted by WHINSEC.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute on our side and the proponents' side so the gentleman can conclude his thoughts and we can have our last speaker. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Georgia? 
   There was no objection.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, what is truly disingenuous is that nobody here tonight speaking against WHINSEC, to my knowledge, has ever taken the time to visit the school. 
   The gentleman, the author of the amendment, my good friend, talked about transparency. It's not because folks have not been invited. WHINSEC is so proud of its operation and record on human rights that it maintains an open-door policy. And Mr. Chairman, that would be true even for the School of the Americas Watch Group. They are welcome at any time to come in and look and talk to Colonel Perez, the director of the school, and look at the curriculum. Any Member of this body can show up unannounced to see for themselves what's being taught at WHINSEC. 
   Those of us who've taken the time to visit understand the critical importance of engaging the leaders and the law enforcement personnel of our closest neighbors while spreading democracy and respect for human rights. We understand that unlike its predecessor, the School of the Americas, WHINSEC has a substantial human rights component that goes well beyond the training required by law. 
   In fact, at a recent HASC hearing, Admiral Stavridis, the Commander of Southern Command, referred to WHINSEC as the military's crown jewel for human rights training. 
   Mr. Chairman, as we've made clear, those who advocate cutting funding for WHINSEC do so in the absence of fact. WHINSEC has a spotless human rights record and a tremendous record of success in the Western Hemisphere. 
   I urge all my colleagues, please vote ``no'' on the McGovern amendment.

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, once you sift through the mountain of misinformation presented on the floor tonight, it's clear that those who advocate cutting funding from WHINSEC do so, as I say, in the absence of fact. WHINSEC is not the School of the  Americas. WHINSEC has a spotless human rights record and is exceeding in helping the United States develop critical relationships with our closer neighbors. 
   Mr. Chairman, in fact, it is time to let the School of the Americas go, and to give WHINSEC a chance. 
   And so I urge all my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I notice as I walk down the halls of the House office buildings these easels and these poster boards, I have been seeing those for last 3 or 4 years, talking about the national debt and what percentage of it is attributed to every man, woman and child in this country. I think that national debt is something like $8.77 trillion now. It is $29,000 for each man, woman and child. 
   Well, the Democrats have come with these 11 spending bills, Mr. Chairman, to increase that spending an additional $23 billion. If my math is correct, then that raises the amount of debt for every man, woman and child in this country from $29,000 to $30,000. 
   But wait just a second, Mr. Chairman. The way they are going to avert that is, you guessed it, raising taxes. They are going to put the largest tax increase in United States history on the backs of the American people. That is why the gentleman from Ohio has such a good amendment, to just simply say, let's go back to 2007 levels. 
   Our hardworking men and women in this country, many of them, if not most of them, during this past year probably got no raise. Their cost of living went up. It didn't go down. So they are in a negative situation. 
   Let's not make the matter worse by putting additional tax burden on the backs of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. GINGREY. (RECOGNIZING ESTABLISHMENT OF HUNTERS FOR THE HUNGRY PROGRAMS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GINGREY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Peterson and Ranking Member Goodlatte, my good friend from California (Mr. Cardoza), my classmate, and all the members on the Agriculture Committee for bringing this resolution to the floor today during the inaugural Congressional Sportsmen's Week. 
   I also want to thank the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, under the leadership of co-chairs RON KIND of Wisconsin and PAUL RYAN of Wisconsin, during this Congress. This bipartisan organization, comprised of close to 300 Members of the House and Senate, focuses on protecting the interests of our Nation's sportsmen. As a proud member of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, I know that it works diligently for our sportsmen who have historically shaped the character and the quality of America's cultural heritage, natural resources and economic vitality. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Goodlatte said, I first introduced the Hunters for the Hungry resolution in the 108th Congress to bring attention to an often overlooked group, our Nation's hunters, who help feed thousands of homeless and hungry people each year. The purpose of this resolution is to praise the work of Hunters for Hungry programs across our country. These programs provide a unique way in which to address our Nation's hunger problem. 
   Although these organizations are called by different names across the country, Hunters for the Hungry organizations show the humanitarian and the kindhearted spirit of our Nation's hunting community. These programs are volunteer and cooperative efforts among hunters, sportsmen's associations, meat processors, State meat inspectors and hunger relief organizations. 
   Over the past 3 years, these programs have brought hundreds of thousands of pounds of excess venison to homeless shelters, soup kitchens and food banks. Each year, donations have multiplied, and many programs now cannot even cover the costs of processing, packaging, storing and distributing the abundant supply of donated venison. 
   Hunters for the Hungry organizations serve as a great example of how our Nation can address issues like hunger without government intervention. These organizations receive no Federal funds, and they operate from donations and volunteer service. We must raise the awareness of these organizations so they can have the resources and the volunteers to serve America's underprivileged. 
   One such organization, Mr. Speaker, in my district is Pure Cuts Deer Processing in Floyd County. Nick Ballinger operates this volunteer effort, and it feeds thousands of hungry people in northwest Georgia. He's always open to both financial contributions and venison donations so that he can expand the organization and feed more people annually. Nick is just one of many kindhearted hunters who donate their time and money for those in need. 
   Mr. Speaker, I once again ask the House to speak in one voice of gratitude and urge passage of the Hunters for the Hungry resolution to honor this great community service.
