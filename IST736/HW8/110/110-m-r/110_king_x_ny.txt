<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2761, TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE REVISION AND EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   I rise in strong support of the underlying legislation and certainly with very strong questions and reservations about the rule. Like Mr. Ackerman, I certainly came to the floor intending to oppose the rule. I will study the letter which Mr. Ackerman obtained from the majority leader. I agree with Mr. Sessions that this is a very uncertain way to proceed, relying on a promise from a letter. Not that I, in any way, question the intent to follow through on the promise, but again, how that could be interpreted, what the final language will be, does raise serious issues. 
   Having said that, I commend Mr. Ackerman for his efforts. I do believe it is important that this process continue to go forward. 
   The reason I support the underlying legislation, Mr. Speaker, is that this is not a New York issue, even though it is often focused that way because of the fact that there have been two major terrorist attacks on New York City, but it truly is a national issue. I want to commend Chairman Frank for his efforts at the committee level. I also want to emphasize that this was a bipartisan vote which voted this bill out of committee. I particularly appreciate  the fact that, in the committee, an amendment was offered by myself and Mr. Ackerman which extends TRIA 15 years, passed by a bipartisan vote. 
   I know that, certainly on my side of the aisle, a number of Members are concerned about the reason that the 15-year term is essential. The fact is that any significant project is going to be of 15 years' duration. Both the preliminary work and the construction itself is going to go to 15 years. The insurance money, for instance, in New York, where they are attempting to rebuild Ground Zero, would not be available at this time unless TRIA is extended. And also the insurers have the certainty that TRIA will be there for the 15 years, for the duration of the project. 
   I have to emphasize that there will be not one nickel spent of this money unless New York or Chicago or Los Angeles or any other city in the country is attacked by terrorists. So if any city were attacked, we know the government would step in. Why not have that precaution now? Why not give the insurers the certainty, and the municipalities the certainty, so they can go forward with this development? Otherwise, we are allowing the terrorists to set the terms and conditions. We are letting them determine what is going to be built and not rebuilt. If this 15-year extension does not go forward, if TRIA is not extended, the reality is that there will not be a rebuilding of Ground Zero. If Ground Zero is not rebuilt, then this is a magnificent victory for a horrible, horrible force, Islamic terrorism. So we should be the ones determining what our economic security is and what our homeland security is. Passage of TRIA is an essential component of that. 
   As the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and its ranking member, Mr. Speaker, I am very much aware how New York and other cities in other parts of our country are in the crosshairs of Islamic terrorism. We know that attacks are inevitable. Whether or not they are successful is another story, but certainly attempted attacks are inevitable. I believe it is essential that no matter what part of the country you are from, you have the assurance that if, God forbid, you are attacked, that there will be insurance in place for you to rebuild. Because otherwise, you are not going to find insurers stepping forward. Places like New York, which was attacked, will not receive insurance that it needs to go forward. And the terrorists will have scored and attained not just the victory they attained on September 11 where almost 3,000 people were murdered, but they will have the additional victory in that the area that they attacked will not be rebuilt. 
   It could be New York. As I said, it was New York in 1993. It was New York in 2001. It could be any one of a number of other cities in the future. So let us protect ourselves in the ultimate essence of homeland security and have a complete component of security, and TRIA is essential to that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the underlying legislation. I look forward to examining the letter which Mr. Ackerman procured and see what that signifies for the future. But the reality is that we have to have the absolute assurance. We cannot be relying on a vote sometime in the future. The government itself could be attacked. The Capitol may not be here. There may not be a quorum of Members attainable. We have to have that absolute assurance in place now. 
   With that, again, I thank Chairman Frank. I thank, certainly, Mr. Sessions for his courtesy. I thank Mr. Ackerman for his efforts. I also thank Ranking Member Bachus for his cooperation and courtesy throughout this hearing.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand today in support of H. Con. Res. 200. Let me thank at the outset Mr. Smith for the work he has done for so many years for the cause of human rights in so many countries, often at great risk to himself. I thank him for that, and we all admire him for his tenacity. I have a special regard for the chairman of the committee, Mr. Lantos, who is cosponsoring this resolution with me and has been such an outspoken advocate of freedom and human rights in Burma for so many years. Even when it is not on the television screens and the eyes of the world are not watching, Mr. Lantos has been there, dedicating himself to this issue; and I have been privileged to be able to work with him on this. 
   Madam Speaker, as terrible as the atrocities have been in Burma over the past 6 to 7 weeks, the fact is this is unfortunately merely an extension of the  type of tyrannical behavior which has characterized the junta in Burma for almost two decades now. This is a junta which tramples upon human rights. They use rape and torture and murder as an instrument of policy. 
   When we see the hundreds of innocent, freedom-loving people who have been murdered over the past several weeks, who have been tortured and arrested and abused, when we see the innocent Buddhist monks who have been shot down, when we see that communication into and out of Burma has been shut off by the junta, we can only assume the worst. 
   That is why it is incumbent upon the international community to speak with one voice, as we are speaking with one voice here in Congress. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue, or majority or minority issue. It is a world issue, an issue of human rights. For all of these years Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been in prison or under house arrest and now imprisoned again, she has become a symbol of that fight. When we talk about symbols, often we forget these are real human beings who are paying the price for being symbols of freedom and justice and who are willing to put their lives and their freedom on the line. 
   That is why this resolution calls for her release and the release of all of the political prisoners and an end to the repressive actions of the Burmese junta. In saying this, as Mr. Lantos and Mr. Smith have said, yes, the United States has been at the forefront of this. But it is so important for neighboring countries now to step forward, especially China and India. 
   When we think of China, which is going to be hosting the Olympic Games and is trying to clean up its image in the eyes of the world, is attempting to project itself as a true country on the world scene, the fact is if China continues in any way to support Burma, to be silent in the face of what the junta is doing, it really puts a cloud and a tarnish over whatever image China is attempting to establish for itself. And that will be kept in mind by world governments as we approach the Olympic Games next year. So it is essential that China step forward and work with the world community, work with the United States, work with the United Nations, work with countries in the region to put pressure on the junta in Burma to ease, stop and, end its oppressive tactics. 
   As Mr. Lantos said, we are also sending a very clear signal to the military leaders, the officers, in Burma who are part of this junta, telling them that the world will hold them responsible for what they do. The world will hold them accountable. 
   As Mr. Lantos knows better than anyone in this House, we saw what happened when military leaders in Germany felt they could go forward and do what they were ordered to do and carry out those atrocities against innocent people. Nuremburg showed that is not a permissible defense. Similarly, it will not be a permissible and acceptable defense for the military leaders in Burma who continue to carry out these atrocities. They just can't say, We were following orders. 
   So our message to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is that we stand with you. Our message to the Buddhist monks is we stand with you. Our message to the oppressed people of Burma is that we stand with you. And our message to the Government of China is we are watching what you are going to do as far as putting pressure on the junta. And our message to the military leaders in Burma is the world is watching you and will hold you accountable and will know what you did. You will face justice when this is over, depending on whether you did the right or you continued to carry out the atrocities ordered upon you. 
   So with that, I strongly urge the adoption of H. Con. Res. 200. I applaud the fact that the House of Representatives is speaking with one voice. We have put partisanship aside. We stand as one and have put differences aside. I thank Mr. Lantos and Mr. Smith for the leadership they have shown over the years. I urge adoption of the concurrent resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (RECOGNIZING THE STRONG ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 295, a resolution recognizing the strong alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States and expressing appreciation to the Republic of Korea for its efforts in the Global War on Terror. As the sponsor of this resolution, I join with over 35 of my colleagues in urging the House to pass this resolution today. 
   For almost six decades, the United States and the Republic of Korea have maintained a strong alliance that rests on a shared commitment to peace, democracy, and freedom not only on the Korean peninsula but throughout Asia and the rest of the world. The nearly 30,000 American soldiers who remain stationed in the Republic of Korea are a testament to this relationship. 
   Since September 11, 2001 we have seen this bond further strengthened as Korea has joined with the United States and other coalition nations in supporting the Global War on Terror both militarily and financially. Korean President Roh truly understands this grave threat and the need for it to be confronted. Presently, the Republic of Korea has the third largest coalition contingent of forces in Iraq. Korea also has troops deployed in Afghanistan and has generously pledged $460,000,000 toward reconstruction and stabilization efforts in post-war Iraq.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF PRIME MINISTER TONY BLAIR -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding, and thank him for the service he has rendered to this body in the 6 brief months he's been here. He is certainly following well in the tradition of his father, who is a long-time friend of mine. 
   Let me also say how gratifying it is to be on the floor and have the manager of this bill which pertains to Tony Blair being managed by the distinguished Ambassador Watson, who does such an outstanding job as cochair of the United States-United Kingdom Congressional Caucus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today in support of this resolution. I was especially privileged to introduce it because as Tony Blair exits from the Office of Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he takes with him the admiration and the best wishes of all freedom-loving people throughout the world. 
   No one certainly has been a closer ally to the United States than Prime Minister Tony Blair. No one personifies the close links between the United States and Great Britain than Tony Blair; certainly follows in the tradition of Winston Churchill, who did more than anyone until his time to cement that relationship, and Tony Blair has even advanced it more. Whether it was President Clinton or President Bush, Tony Blair always stood as our strongest ally in Bosnia, in Kosovo, in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the international war against terrorism, and standing up for democratic principles and values. 
   And certainly as a New Yorker, I will always remember the fact that he was the first foreign leader to come to New York, to come to Ground Zero to meet with the firefighters and meet with the police officers and express the solidarity of the British people toward the people of New York, and of course, to the people of the United States, and to all peoples who were opposed to international terrorism. And then, as Ambassador Watson mentioned, the fact that he was here in the House Chamber on September 20, 2001 when President Bush addressed the American people also showed his absolute commitment to the United States and to the war against terrorism. 
   As an Irish American, I have been involved for many years in the quest for a peaceful solution to the struggle in Northern Ireland. And depending on which historian you're talking to or which analyst you're talking to, this is a struggle that went back 800 years, 300 years, 80 years, 35 years. It really doesn't matter what timeline we're using, the reality is it was a seemingly unending struggle which was going to go on and on and on. And then the stars were properly aligned and Tony Blair became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Bertie Ahern became the Prime Minister of Ireland, and President Clinton committed himself to using the good offices of the United States as an honest broker to try to bring about a peaceful resolution in the north of Ireland. And through incredible hard work and perseverance and dedication, it worked. And not only did Tony Blair deal with Prime Minister Ahern and President Clinton, what he did even took more courage, and that was to reach out to historic enemies, if you will, of the British Government. He reached out to people such as Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness and Sinn  Fein, and he brought them to the negotiating table and sat down with them and worked with them. And he had them to 10 Downing Street and he broke down centuries of division and hatred. And at the same time, he worked with those on the other side, strongly on the other side, not just David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party, but also Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist Party. 
   And the Good Friday Agreement would not have been possible in April of 1998 without Tony Blair, but also the Good Friday Agreement went on for almost 9 years afterwards until it was finally brought to its ultimate fruition earlier this month. And it was done because Tony Blair never yielded. There were so many times between April of 1998 and May or June of this year that that agreement could have fallen apart, that it could have splintered, that it could have shattered if Tony Blair was not willing to take that extra step, and he did that. 
   And during this entire time that he was bringing peace to Northern Ireland and standing with us as our strongest ally, also Britain itself was under attack. And as Mr. Bilirakis and Ambassador Watson mentioned, on July 7, 2005, when the London underground was attacked by terrorists causing large scale carnage and loss of life, and Tony Blair again stood strong and stood firm. 
   So, this is a moment where it's seldom that we see giants in history, and it's important, I think, that we not wait 50 years or 100 years or several centuries to acknowledge them, but to acknowledge them in their own time as being prophets with honor. 
   So I, again, say I've had the privilege a number of times of being with Tony Blair. I was with him with President Clinton in Washington and in Belfast and Armagh City in Northern Ireland, and just last month, again, at the British Embassy. He certainly is a man of stature, he's a man of achievement and he's a man of courage. 
   I am proud to support this resolution, and I urge its adoption.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (RECOGNIZING THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   I thank Chairman Carney for helping to bring this matter to the House floor today, and I rise in strong support of H.  Res. 1038 because we do owe a tremendous debt of gratitude and thanks to all of the employees of the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Mr. Speaker, you and I come from adjoining districts in New York. Probably between our districts we lost well over 200 people on September 11. And I think any of us on September 12 and September 13 anticipated there would have to be another successful attack on our country in the not-too-distant future. Well, the fact is, we have now gone 6 1/2 years without an attack. 
   During 5 of those years, the Department of Homeland Security has been up and operational. And it was really a tribute to the men and women who comprise the formerly separate 22 agencies who came together to be combined into this one department for what they have been able to do and what they have been able to achieve. It is no accident, it is not luck we haven't been attacked. It is for a number of reasons, but among the very prime reasons is the tremendous effort by all these men and women. And doing that was not easy because they each came from different cultures and traditions. They had different types of training and a different type of emphasis. They had a tough enough job before September 11. But now added to that was the new dimension of homeland security. And they had to do what they were doing at a different level, and they combined their efforts with employees from other agencies who were trained differently, who had a different way of looking at things, and they had to learn to speak and think as one. And they have done it. They have done a terrific job. 
   I believe it was last year we held hearings on how far the department has come. And yes, it is easy to be a critic. It is easy to stand back and say this should be done better and that should be done better. But the consensus of the testimony we had from experts was that the Department of Homeland Security is further along in its progress than the Defense Department was after a comparable period of time after it was formed over 60 years ago. So it is important to keep that in mind, and also to keep in mind that their work is a 24/7 job, that at any given time, there are active threats against the United States or active plots against the United States, and there is no simple easy way to stop it. And there are many ways. We have to fight it overseas. We have to fight it at the national level making sure that all intelligence is coordinated. But no one is more central to that than the Department of Homeland Security because they have to coordinate the national and international intelligence and then also make sure it gets down to the local levels, to make sure that the local police, the State police and the local law enforcements throughout the country are apprised of what could be happening, what might be happening, and also to absorb information that is sent back up from the local governments to the Department of Homeland Security. 
   So I commend them. I think it is too easy to take shots. And we see it in Presidential debates, we see people who take random shots at the people in this department, and it is so unfair because they are literally on the firing lines for us. They are on the front lines for us. In many ways, they are doing it anonymously because obviously their successes cannot be recorded. They are not publicized. How do you prove an attack didn't happen that was actually going to happen and didn't? And those that we do know about often can't be spoken about. But they are there. They are doing it. And in addition to that, they have the added responsibility from Congress because of the events of September 11 and having to do much more as far as border security and illegal immigration is concerned. So there is just a myriad of responsibilities that have been thrust upon them in addition to all they have been doing before, and they are doing it first class. 
   It is important for us in the Congress to live up to that same level, that same standard, that these employees are setting. It's important for us to get our act coordinated in the Congress, to make sure that jurisdiction is consolidated as much as possible so that we can speak with one voice, not to take partisan advantage, not to be allowing jurisdictional disputes between and among committees to impede the job that we should be doing. We can take a lesson from those employees out there who have put aside their prerogatives, put aside their own petty interests for the common good. 
   So I commend all the employees of the Department of Homeland Security on the fifth anniversary. Thanks for keeping us safe. Thanks for doing what you are doing. And I believe we can speak for all Members of this House that we will continue to do what we have to do to make sure that you get the tools to do your job and also get the support that you so richly deserve from all of us, and most important, from your fellow Americans whom you have done so much to protect. 
   I urge the adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the opportunity to take part in this debate, which as my friend from New York (Mr. Rangel) said, isn't this a historic debate? It is part of our job. It is our obligation. It is a legal obligation; it is a moral obligation to be heard on this most pressing issue of our time. 
   I would also add at the outset, when we have talked about those who died in Iraq, and all of us go to the wakes of those who were killed in our district. Just the other day, if we are talking about the quality of the type of person, where they come from and who was killed in Iraq, there was a young man who was actually in what used to be the heart of my district, very affluent area, Manhasset. He was a graduate of Duke University, all-American Lacrosse player, was offered a scholarship to law school, but he turned it down to go in as an enlisted man, as an Army Ranger. 
   He served two tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he was killed on his third tour of Iraq. His family was proud of what he did, what he accomplished, what he stood for. I think it doesn't really add to the level of debate to somehow be suggesting that those who go to Iraq because they cannot be anywhere else or somehow it is all driven by economic need, he was a young man with everything in front of him. 
   He had all the opportunity in the world, and he went, and he joined the Army, went in as an enlisted man, died as a sergeant, and he was on his third tour in Iraq. So I think it is important to put that in the Record. Also, I know there are any number of Members in this body who have had members of their families serving in Iraq. 
   I think if we are going to talk about the gentleman from New York who wants to bring back the draft, we can have that in a separate debate. But I don't think it should be part of this debate. 
   Now, when this debate was actually scheduled, I actually thought it would  serve a constructive purpose. But as I look at the resolutions being offered, if I could really, I guess, quote from Senator Lieberman of Connecticut, rather than a resolution, it is really a resolution of irresolution. 
   It is inherently contradictory, because it pledges support to the troops but also at the same time washes its hands of what the troops are attempting to do. I have heard speaker after speaker get up here today and say the new policy cannot work. The new policy is more of the same. This is the President's policy. He hasn't gotten the message from the American people. 
   Well the fact is, this policy is strongly supported by the new commander in Iraq, General Petraeus. As was pointed out, the Senate unanimously approved the appointment of General Petraeus by a vote of 81-0. Now, for people to come here today and say this is an inherently flawed policy, this is a policy that cannot work, this is a policy that is doomed to failure, to me, after General Petraeus has said that he believes the policy can work, that he supports the policy, is to attack directly either the credibility or the competency of General Petraeus, and that is a terrible message to be sending to our troops. 
   Actions do have consequences. I don't doubt the good faith of anyone on either side of the aisle when it comes to supporting the troops. The fact is, often you have to think beyond what the actual words are saying and realize the consequences those words have. For instance, my good friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, who I have actually traveled to Iraq with in 2003, where we met with General Petraeus and others in Mosul and with others and troops in Baghdad, he said that Iraq is a mess, and we have to end the nightmare. 
   Does anyone really think by Americans pulling out the nightmare is going to end, that the Middle East will become stable if we leave? Certainly al Qaeda doesn't believe that. Certainly the mullahs in Iran don't believe that. And also our allies don't believe that. 
   Again, what are the consequences of our actions? Are we saying just draw down for the sake of drawing down? I heard the distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives say our goal is to get our troops home. 
   Well, I would say our goal should be to have our troops come home after we have achieved a goal, a goal of at least a stable Iraq, an Iraq which is able to protect its borders against Iran, and an Iraq which is able to prevent al Qaeda from setting up a privileged sanctuary in Iraq, and an Iraq which is able to create a situation in the north where the Kurds and the Turks are not fighting with one another. 
   So these are all serious issues that have to be addressed. I regret to say this resolution does not address it in any way. If anything, it is a serious step backward. 
   Now, also we have heard that we have to listen to the polls. We have to listen to what public opinion has to be at any particular time. Well, if anyone wants to go back and look at the polls, in 1952, President Truman's popularity rating was 22 percent. War in Korea was amazingly unpopular, and yet today he is acknowledged as one of our greatest Presidents, and the war in Korea is looked upon as an absolutely indispensable step in the defeat of communism, because they drew the line in Asia at the 38th parallel. 
   I know my good friend Mr. Rangel served in Korea, he was wounded in Korea, and he performed valiantly in Korea. That war now is looked upon as one of the linchpins of the Cold War strategy, which, again, brought down the Communist menace.     
   Also I tried to research this. I am not aware of any time in the entire history of our country where the United States Congress has adopted a resolution questioning a particular battlefield strategy. 
   Like him or not, and I certainly support him, but the President is our Commander in Chief. I said the same thing when President Clinton was our Commander in Chief, and I was serving in this body at that time when there was tremendous criticism directed at him. 
   But the fact is, the President, no matter where he or she happens to be from, is the Commander in Chief. And we are at war. It was a war that was authorized by this Congress. And we should not be, I do not believe, setting the precedent of adopting resolutions questioning specific strategies. 
   Should we have adopted a resolution in the winter of 1944, 1945, questioning President Roosevelt's strategy in allowing the intelligence failures that brought about the Battle of the Bulge? We can go step by step. Certainly President Lincoln, during the Civil War when strategies were changed throughout the war and finally resulted in a victory. 
   Also we have to realize that the war in Iraq is part of an overall war against Islamic terrorism. As the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, as ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, certainly we see that this is an enemy which is overseas and it is here. It is an enemy which is plotting every day to find ways to attack us. 
   I know later the distinguished ranking member of the Intelligence Committee will also speak to this part of the issue. But the fact is, we do not live in vacuums. We cannot isolate battlefields and silos and say this is Iraq, this is Afghanistan, and this is the Twin Towers. 
   The fact is, we are talking about actions having consequences. And I have been very critical of the Republican Party for 1983 when I believe we precipitously withdrew from Beirut. That had consequences. I was in this body when we precipitously withdrew from Somalia. I was also in this body when the Twin Towers were attacked the first time in 1993 and we took no action, or Khobar Towers when a constituent of mine was killed in 1996. We took no action. 
   The USS Cole in 2000 when we took no action. In 1998 the attacks on the African embassies, where we took very limited action. All of those had consequences. In fact, now we see after September 11, 2001, we find the historical record where Osama bin Laden said that when we saw that the United States was willing to withdraw from Somalia, how that emboldened Islamic terrorists throughout the world, how that showed them that we did not have the staying power, we did not have the guts to stick it out. 
   Listen, those who are really putting it on the line, those who have the guts are the men and women of the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan. But also we as elected officials have to show some courage and not just give in to the zeitgeists, not just give in to the latest public opinion poll or to the latest election, because quite frankly we were not elected to win elections; we were elected to show leadership and to do what has to be done. 
   When future generations look back at this, will they really say that we helped the struggle against Islamic terrorism by pulling out of Iraq, by not continuing that fight? Does anyone really think that that will not embolden al Qaeda, that that will not embolden Iran? Can anyone honestly say that? 
   And so I believe that what disappoints me about this debate and this resolution is we are treating Iraq almost like it is a pinpoint. It is one issue standing by itself, and it is not. It is part of a mosaic; it is part of a worldwide struggle. As someone who lost more than 100 friends, neighbors, constituents on September 11, I have seen firsthand the evils of Islamic terrorism. 
   As ranking member on the Homeland Security Committee, I know how there are forces in this country who would take action against us. I know the connections between forces in this country and forces overseas. It is no secret. It should not cause us any confusion as to why al Qaeda wants us to lose in Iraq. 
   It should not cause us any confusion as to why al Qaeda encourages the enemy against us in Iraq, and in fact has al Qaeda in Iraq itself fighting against us. 
   So now we come to the question of, with our troops committed there, with this being an absolutely essential part of the war against terrorism, what do we do? I agree that there is a consensus that the current policy has not been successful. There have been successes, but the policy itself has not been fully successful. 
   That is true in almost every war in which America has been engaged. It was certainly true during World War II, it was certainly true during Korea, and even take a war like Kosovo, which is  probably almost as antiseptic as a war could be, even though every war when anyone's life is on the line is brutal and deadly. 
   But from a strategic point of view, we are talking about it should have been a simple war. We ended up bombing a Chinese embassy in Belgrade. So, I mean, mistakes are made. And for us to say because mistakes are made we should redeploy our troops, which really is a euphemism for withdrawal. 
   We are sending signals to the world. We are sending signals to our troops, we are sending signals to our allies, we are sending signals to our enemies. On the one hand if we are unanimously confirming General Petraeus who supports this policy, and on the other hand we are saying we know the policy cannot work and we are actually going for the first time in American history going on record opposing a particular strategic policy, then I would say, where are we getting this from? 
   People say that this is just the same policy as we have had all along. General Petraeus says it is not. And I do not believe it is. Can I guarantee the new policy will work? No, I cannot. But I have met with generals, I have met with military experts, and they give good reasons why it can work. And there are people of very good faith on the other side who say it will not work. 
   But as I look at this, our commander, who is looked upon as the expert in counterinsurgency, who is the general who has certainly achieved the most in Iraq, and anyone who has been to Mosul knows the job that he achieved there, if he says this policy should work, and can work, then I believe we have the moral obligation, we have the legal obligation, and we have the obligation to history and for our children and grandchildren that we not undercut General Petraeus, that we not tell our troops we do not have faith in their ability to carry out the mission which General Petraeus says can be carried out, and we do not embolden our enemies by saying just wait this out a few months, wait it out a few months and you will get it, wait us out a few months and we will pull out like we did in Beirut or Somalia. 
   We cannot allow that message to be sent. The burden is on us. And if we fail in this mission, and the mission I believe of standing with our troops, standing with our commander in the field, and standing with the policy that the overwhelming majority of Congress voted for in 2003, and also the pledge that all of us made on September 11, 2001, then we will have failed in our obligations as Members of the United States Congress and failed in our obligation to our oath of office to do what has to be done, which should be done, which is essential if we are going to win the war against Islamic terrorism.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (TERRORISM RISK INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding. And let me at the outset thank him for the courtesy that he has shown me throughout this process. There were several differences that he and I had regarding what the exact nature of the legislation should be, but that never in any way interfered with either our professional or personal relationship. And I want to thank him for that, for his patience, and for the effort he has put in to bring about this final product. 
   I also want to thank Chairman Frank for, again, being totally bipartisan in trying to move this legislation forward and for always having an open door, and certainly, in my own case, allowing me to be part of the process from the start. Mr. Ackerman has been a stalwart fighter in this issue. And let me identify with certainly the points that Mr. Ackerman was making on this issue. 
   Also, let me thank Adam Paulson on my staff for putting in an extreme amount of time on this, on an issue that can be very mind-bending at times and at the same time is extremely, extremely vital for the rebuilding not just of New York City but for the protection of our entire Nation. 
   So let me say at the outset I support the legislation, and I will vote for it. I am glad that it is moving forward. I am glad we have the 7-year extension. It is certainly far better than what was being spoken of last year, which was either a phasing out all together or perhaps a 2-year extension. 
   Having said that, I agree with Mr. Ackerman that I wish this were for a 15-year term rather than 7, and I wish that the reset provision had not been taken out by the Senate. The 15-year provision in particular I fought for in the committee. It was a hard-fought battle. The vote was 39-30, but everything was on the table. We had the vote. If we had lost it, we would have lost it; but the fact is, we won it. And when the bill itself came to the House floor, it passed by an overwhelming vote. 
   I am not trying to impose our rules on theirs, but I really wish on an issue of this magnitude the Senate would have allowed that full breadth of democracy to play itself out to allow the people to be heard on this issue. Because, as Mr. Ackerman said, this is not a New York issue. It is an American issue; it is a national issue. It is an issue of national security and homeland security. And by making this 7 years rather than 15 years, by eliminating the reset provision, we have put New York in a weakened position, or certainly in not as strong a position as it should be. And by doing that, we are basically telling the terrorists that we will not give the same level of support that we should be giving. We are in effect allowing them to pick the playing field here. And we have to keep in mind that, yes, it was New York on September 11. It could be any other city or State at any time in the future. And as the former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, as the ranking member of the Homeland Security, Mr. Speaker, I do receive regular briefings. I know how real these threats are. I also know that, no matter what analysis is used, New York is clearly number one on the target list of the Islamic terrorists. 
   So this legislation is vital, and it was so important that the other provisions,  the reset and the 15-year time period, be included. They were not. Having said that, this is still significant that we are going forward today. And I would hope that we can revisit it in the future, but again it is important that we pass this before it expires on December 31. It is important, again, for the people of New York, but also for the people of America. And if the rebuilding is to go forward, it is going to be difficult because certain provisions have been eliminated, but, again, we will find a way to go forward. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Frank, Mr. Bachus, Mr. Ackerman, all the members of the New York delegation and most of the members of the New Jersey and Connecticut delegations who stood together. Again, somewhat of a victory today, but let's work together in the future to have a total victory that we need, not as New Yorkers but as Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (AMERICA'S BEAUTIFUL NATIONAL PARKS QUARTER DOLLAR COIN ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of America's Beautiful National Parks Quarter Dollar Coin Act (H.R. 6184) introduced by the Gentleman from Delaware. It's a good bill and a good follow-up to his 50-State quarter bill we have all enjoyed. However, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a point in the process of supporting this bill. 
   The idea of following the State quarters by honoring national parks is a very good idea, and I salute Mr. Castle and his co-sponsors, Mrs. Maloney and Mr. Gutierrez. I even want to suggest a place in my district as the one for the back of the New York quarter--the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, the beautiful summer home of former President Theodore Roosevelt, in Oyster Bay. 
   But that brings me to the point I'd like to make Mr. Speaker. Teddy Roosevelt, as the bill itself notes, is known as the first great champion of the country's National Parks, and in my view, the front of this new coin should bear the image of Teddy Roosevelt. 
   I, of course, mean no disrespect to George Washington. He was the Father of our Country, and his image has appropriately been on the one-dollar bill and the quarter. But I think, as a recent editorial in Coin World magazine pointed out, that it's about time we honor Teddy Roosevelt by placing his image on U.S. currency--after all, he's the only one of our four great Presidents honored on Mount Rushmore, who does not appear on a U.S. coin or banknote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not mean to criticize this legislation, and I intend to vote for it enthusiastically. But I hope all Members will think about the fact that without Teddy Roosevelt's championing of the ideas of conservation and National Parks, we would still have national parks, but the commitment to them would not have been as great, or so early. So, I hope the sponsors of this bill will work with me to help find a place somewhere in the U.S. system of money for the image of the great Rough Rider on a coin or banknote. 
   With that I urge adoption of the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims and heroes on the seventh anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As someone who lost more than 150 friends, neighbors, and constituents on September 11, my heart goes out to the families who lost loved ones. September 11th will forever remain a day of great tragedy for the United States, but it is also one of great triumph, as Americans came together and demonstrated extraordinary heroism, courage, and unity. 
   We commend the first responders who served on that tragic day and during the many difficult days thereafter. And, we honor those who gave their lives in responding so heroically. 
   September 11 served as a wake up call for our Nation. In the seven years that have followed, Congress and the Administration have worked with, and on behalf of, law enforcement, first responders, and the Intelligence Community to better secure the United States. Passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the PATRIOT Act, the SAFE Port Act, the Secure Fence Act, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, and the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 provided the Department of Homeland Security and the Intelligence Community with the tools they need to secure our Nation. 
   It is no accident that we have not been attacked since September 11. This is due to a number of reasons, including the dedicated efforts of the employees of the Department of Homeland Security, many of whom serve in the New York metropolitan area. 
   Make no mistake; we are more secure than we were on September 11, but more needs to be done. We will never forget the lessons of September 11th, and we will continue to work to secure the United States against radical Islamic terrorists who want to do us harm.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GRANT A POSTHUMOUS PARDON TO JOHN ARTHUR ``JACK'' JOHNSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 214, a resolution granting a posthumous pardon to John Arthur ``Jack'' Johnson for his 1913 racially motivated conviction. On September 17, 2007, I introduced this resolution with Congressman Jesse Jackson, and I join today with 40 of my cosponsoring colleagues in urging the House to pass this resolution today. 
   Jack Johnson became the first black World Heavyweight Boxing Champion in 1908 after defeating Tommy Burns in Australia and kept the title until 1915. He was a flamboyant and controversial figure in American history who paved the way for African-American athletes to participate and succeed in racially integrated professional sports in the United States. 
   Prompted by his success in the boxing ring and his relationship with a white woman, Jack Johnson was wronged by a racially motivated conviction under the Mann Act. He was convicted in 1913 after fleeing to Canada, Europe and South America and served one year in prison. Being convicted ruined his career and wrongly destroyed his reputation. 
   Because of this, we believe the President should grant a posthumous pardon to Jack Johnson to clear his name and recognize his athletic and cultural contributions to society. I am proud to have sponsored this resolution on his behalf 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of this important legislation, H. Res. 991, honoring New York's famed 69th Infantry Regiment for its dedication and valorous service in the war against terror, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The Fighting 69th has been engaged in the war against terrorism since the very onset of the war, having been deployed to secure Ground Zero in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   The 69th was deployed to Iraq in ``Operation Wolfhound'' and served with great distinction, defending the city of Al Taji, protecting Iraq's first free elections and, most significantly, securing ``Route Irish'' which had been the most dangerous travel route in Baghdad. Tragically the 69th had 19 troops killed in ``Operation Wolfhound'' and 78 wounded. At no time, however, did the Fighting 69th ever waver in its mission. The Fighting 69th is now being deployed to Afghanistan where it will once more take the fight to our enemy. 
   Having served in the Fighting 69th and being an active member of the 69th Infantry Veterans' Corps, I take particular pride in this regiment's achievements. 
   The Fighting 69th has served in five wars and six of its members have been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Its courageous service in Iraq and Afghanistan is adding new chapters to the regiment's historic and noble history. 
   I urge adoption of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, at the outset let me commend Chairman Price and Ranking Member Rogers for the outstanding job, I believe, and the effort they put into putting this legislation together. And I commend them on an issue which is so vital to our Nation, homeland security. 
   My amendment would restore $40 million to the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, DNDO, specifically relating to the Securing the Cities Initiative and the Radiation Portal Monitor program. 
   Mr. McCaul, as the cosponsor of the amendment, will address himself in a few moments to the Radiation Portal Monitor program. I'm going to stress the STC. 
   Mr. Chairman, intelligence and recent terrorist attacks overseas have led to the conclusion that the next attack against our cities may very well come from outside the city, from suburban areas. And certainly, in New York City, it's been concluded that the STC is the only program which is dedicated to protecting cities against this threat. 
   Specifically, the STC program involves a ring of radiological detectors on highways, bridges, tunnels and waterways leading into cities. Indeed, the police commissioner of New York, Commissioner Kelly, has said that this program is our best last defense to keep a nuclear or dirty bomb from being detonated within cities. 
   So this should be a bipartisan matter. While it directly affects New York at this moment, this is a pilot program which will affect the entire Nation. 
   There's already been two full exercises run. I was present at one of them last week, seeing how effective it was. It involves 90 counties, three States, numerous cities and many agencies. And it, to me, serves no purpose at all to be taking, in effect, $20 million out of a valuable program, a program which very well could end up saving thousands and thousands of lives. And I say that as someone who came from a district that lost well over 100 people on September 11 and certainly doesn't want to go through that again. 
   This is a very effective, meaningful program, and I would, again, implore the House to restore this money, $40 million, to the DNDO.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. I thank the Speaker for his recognition and for his usual courtesy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in opposition to the resolution. I have listened as carefully as I can for the past day and a half of debate, and it becomes clearer and clearer to me that those who were supporting this resolution, for whatever reason, are unwilling to accept the consequences of the words of this resolution, unwilling to accept the consequences of what could happen by the adoption of this resolution. 
   Yes, the resolution is meaningless. Yes, the resolution has no legal impact, but it does send a terrible message. It sends a terrible message to the world that the United States is losing a sense of resolution, if you will. It also sends a very cruel message, I believe, to the troops in the field, because while the resolution goes out of the way to say it supports the troops, at the very same time it is necessarily undermining the newly appointed commander of those troops. We hear from speaker after speaker who was speaking in support of the resolution that this is more of the same staying the course, this is a policy that cannot work. 
   But yet the newly designated commander, General Petraeus, who was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate, is one of the architects of this policy. General Petraeus has stated that this policy can work, that he believes it will work. 
   Those of us who have been to Iraq and seen the outstanding work that General Petraeus has done, the 101st Airborne, we realize how committed he is. To me it sends such a mixed message to, on the one hand, have him unanimously confirmed as the new commander in the field, and yet at the same time to be attacking his credibility or his competency. 
   You can't have it both ways. You can't say he is the best man for the job, we have faith in him, and yet say the policy is wrong and it cannot work, and he says it will work and he is the architect of that policy. Think of the message we are sending to the troops. Think of the message we are sending to our allies in our region. Probably most importantly, think of the message we are sending to the enemy of the region. 
   I just heard the previous gentleman say that those of us who oppose the resolution want to stay the course. I would say that those who are supporting the resolution are the ones who want to stay the course. This is a significant new policy. General Petraeus has said it is a new policy, and it is a new policy. 
   The gentleman also said that we don't really have to worry about Iraq becoming a haven for terrorists because terrorists can attack us anywhere. He basically said you can do it from an apartment in Hamburg. 
   I would suggest that if the proponents of the resolution cannot appreciate the distinction between a hotel room in Hamburg and a sovereign state such as Iraq being occupied by terrorists, then they don't realize the impact that Afghanistan had, the fact that the Taliban allowed al Qaeda to have a sanctuary in Afghanistan, how it gave them a strong base of operations to carry out and plot the attacks of September 11. 
   Now, truly there are terrorists everywhere, Islamist terrorists throughout the world. They are certainly throughout the Middle East, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, they are here in the United States, we know that, in Canada. But the fact is you try to take as many sanctuaries away from them if possible. 
   Iraq, if we did leave Iraq, and that, I believe, has to be the necessary outcome, the only logical conclusion of where this resolution will ultimately lead us, then we have a situation where we are talking about confronting Iran. Well, the Shiites in Iran will certainly have enormous influence in Iraq. Al Qaeda will have a sanctuary among the Sunnis in Iraq, and then we will have the situation in the north between the Kurds and the Turks. So the fact is no one more than those of us who oppose the resolution realize this is not the only battlefield, but it is a main battlefield. 
   Certainly al Qaeda believes it is important. That is why we have al Qaeda in Iraq. That is why al Qaeda has been carrying out attacks, that is why al Qaeda was there. That is why we are engaging in Anbar province. By the way, of the 21,000 additional troops, at least 4,000 will be directly confronting al Qaeda in Anbar province. 
   These are all the issues I feel have not been in any way adequately or sufficiently addressed by the supporters of the resolution. Again, at a time when we have General Petraeus embarking on what I believe is a key turning point in the war, it is really irresponsible to even be considering voting for this resolution. 
   Now, another point, I know many speakers on my side want to be heard during the time that I will be controlling, but we, I think, have to address the issue of should Congress be getting involved in making strategic battlefield decisions. 
   I have researched this. I have not found one instance during the history of our country where the United States Congress has injected itself into battlefield decisions. 
   I was just thinking suppose we did this during World War II, and we had this situation with a small island in the Pacific, Iwo Jima, where almost 7,000 people were killed in less than 6 weeks, almost 26,000 casualties. If we had 24-hour cable news, if we had a sense of disunity in the country, we would be bringing a resolution in the second or third week of the battle saying we already lost 2, 3, 4,000 troops, this one island, how can we have 10 to 15,000 casualties just in the first 2, 3 weeks. 
   But the fact is we have allowed the President, as Commander in Chief, and that is his constitutional responsibility. We voted for the war in the House. We voted for the war in the Senate. Once we do that, the Commander in Chief, I believe, strongly believe, has the constitutional authority and the right to be deciding exactly the tactical and strategic decisions. 
   If the Members of Congress want to cut off funding for the war, the fact is some of them may, then the fact is they should say that, not be coming in through the backdoor. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to realize the consequences of their action. You know, I spoke on the House floor yesterday, and after I was finished the speaker who followed me said I wish that the opponents of the resolution would just stick to the resolution itself. 
   I am more than willing to debate the resolution. I believe I have. The fact is I can see why they don't want to look at the consequences beyond the narrow language of that resolution, because it will have horrific consequences for the United States. Actions have consequences, words have consequences, and the words of this resolution will have terrible consequences for the United States, terrible consequences for all of us who oppose Islamic terrorism, and terrible consequences for our allies in the region and with whom we need support in the future. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

His family more than ever supports the effort in Iraq, and you can find families on all sides. 
   I think it is wrong to somehow suggest that those who died, somehow the families want us to vote for this resolution or against it. We can find sufficient numbers on both sides.

Mr. Speaker, I would say to my good friend from New York, the message this resolution sends to the troops in the field is that the resolution challenges and opposes the mission that their group commander is asking them to carry out, and to me that has to undermine their morale.

   Mr. KING of New York. Reclaiming my time, the reason I am saying that is, you are opposing the 21,000 troop increase, and that is the policy of General Petraeus, who is the new commander in the field. That is the policy he is asking his troops to carry out, and you are opposing the very policy the new commander says can work and will work.

I know I have visited Iraq a number of times. I visit Reserves, National Guard, regular troops, active duty, and I have never seen morale higher in any Armed Forces. 
   I speak with troops when they come home to my district. I go to the wakes and funerals of those who die from my district. And I think we can pick and choose as to what we say. I would say the overwhelming majority I have spoken to do support and know exactly why they are there. 
   But again, I just lost a constituent the other day. His family certainly is honored by his service. It was his third tour. He went back for a third tour. So he certainly understood what was going on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this resolution and in strong support of our troops and their mission. 
   This resolution is wrong in every respect. It is wrong constitutionally. Never before in our history has Congress attempted to control or restrict battlefield decisions. It is wrong as a matter of policy, and it will come back to haunt us for years to come. 
   Madam Speaker, wars must not be waged according to opinion polls or applause meters. For instance, just look at the battle of Iwo Jima, an island in the Pacific where in less than 6 weeks, more than twice as many Americans were killed as have been killed throughout the entire Iraq war, and yet Congress didn't jump in to question the policies of the President. 
   And look at the Korean War. There was no declaration of war. The United States and the overwhelming majority of coalition troops in the field, 36,000 Americans were killed and another 8,000 were missing. More than 70 percent of the American people opposed President Truman and his handling of the war. Yet today, President Truman is honored as one of our greatest Presidents, and the Korean War is looked upon as a key turning point in our struggle against communism. 
   Madam Speaker, Iraq cannot be looked upon or looked at in a vacuum. This war in Iraq is an absolutely essential component of the war against Islamic terrorism which must be fought in many places throughout the world, including right here at home. 
   As a Member of Congress who lost upwards of 150 friends, neighbors, and constituents on September 11, 2001, I have seen firsthand how evil this enemy can be. And al Qaeda itself has said that Iraq is a major battleground in this war. 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot allow ourselves to do anything which would undermine our troops who are the frontline soldiers in this war against Islamic terrorism. 
   I know that the resolution expresses support for the troops, but talk is cheap and actions have consequences. You cannot support the troops if you are undermining their mission and challenging their commander in the field. And that is what this resolution does. 
   Speaker after speaker in support of the resolution has said that the new policy in Iraq will not work. But General Petraeus, who is the author of this policy and who has just been unanimously confirmed by the Senate, has said this policy can work and that his troops can carry it out. By opposing this new policy, the supporters of the resolution are clearly undermining a new commander in Iraq at such a vital time in the conduct of this war. 
   As the national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said earlier this week, ``When military decisions are second-guessed by opinion polls or overruled by politicians, it is the common soldier and their families who pay the price. The VFW is very concerned with the tone and timing of this debate. We need to send the message to our troops that America wants them to succeed in Iraq by giving the buildup a chance to succeed.'' 
   Madam Speaker, what makes this worse is that we know today's resolution is only the first step to prevent General Petraeus and his troops from carrying out their mission. The Democratic leadership has admitted, indeed proudly acknowledged, that it is their goal to impose as many conditions as they can to prevent General Petraeus from getting the troops and the reinforcements he needs to win this war. 
   Madam Speaker, never in our history have the Speaker of the House or the House Appropriations Committee attempted to superimpose their policies on troop training or troop leave, and override the Commander in Chief and the commander in the field. 
   Madam Speaker, this is not the time for sunshine soldiers or summertime patriots. It is time for Members of this body to show at least a small percentage of the courage shown every day by our troops in Iraq. 
   If you want to cut off the funding for our troops who will be in the line of fire, don't be cute, don't try to sneak it through the back door. Have the guts to do it directly. 
   Madam Speaker, this debate is not about this President or this Congress or the next election. It is about our survival as a Nation and our survival as a civilization. Vote for our troops and against this misguided and dangerous resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (WAKEFIELD ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise as a strong supporter of H.R. 2464, the Wakefield Act, which will reauthorize the Emergency Medical Services for Children program for an additional 4 years. 
   Since the program began in 1984, EMSC grants have helped all 50 States to better prepare their health systems to treat children in an emergency. The EMSC program has improved the availability of child-appropriate equipment in ambulances and emergency departments, supported hundreds of programs to prevent injuries, and provided thousands of hours of training to EMTs, paramedics, and other emergency medical care providers. 
   In my home State of New York, EMSC funds are going toward the development of a statewide, standardized system that recognizes hospitals capable of managing pediatric emergencies, both trauma and medical. This will enhance the State's ability to transfer injured children to the hospital best suited to their treatment. New York is also utilizing EMSC funds to ensure that all ambulances have the essential pediatric equipment and supplies for prehospital pediatric emergency care. 
   Across the country, EMSC is enabling State and local emergency care providers to better treat children. The projects funded under EMSC are vital for the safety and well-being of America's children and have saved countless lives throughout the program's existence. During a time when a terrorist attack or natural disaster may occur at any moment, it is essential that we ensure that we are adequately prepared to care for every infant, toddler, and child in an emergency situation. 
   I would like to thank Representative Matheson for his hard work and continued leadership on this issue, and I urge you to support the Wakefield Act.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1401, RAIL AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for yielding. And I stand here today, first, to commend the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Thompson, for the bipartisanship he has shown, the level of  cooperation he has demonstrated in bringing this bill through the committee process and to the House floor today. This was work that was begun in the last Congress, and now it has been brought to its fruition, and I commend the gentleman for that. 
   As Mr. Diaz-Balart indicated, there were serious rail attacks in Britain in 2005, in Spain in 2004 and, of course, in India. And there is no doubt that terrorists certainly would be considering to use rail and transit as a base for future attacks here in this country. So this legislation is needed. It is constructive and on balance, it is very positive. For instance, it authorized the use of VIPER teams. It does base funding on threat and risk. And it addresses very, very key areas of vulnerability. 
   Having said that, I wish the same spirit of bipartisanship that had prevailed at the committee level had prevailed in the Rules Committee, because there are a number of amendments which were not ruled in order. In fact, there was no amendment ruled in order which was offered by a member of the Homeland Security Committee, specifically, an amendment by Mr. Daniel E. Lungren, which would have, I believe, addressed deficiencies in the whistleblower language which would have protected classified national security information. 
   The amendment by Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite, who will be speaking on it herself in a few moments, would have certainly prevented the disclosure of sensitive security information on Freedom of Information requests, and two amendments by Mr. Dent as far as screening travelers entering the U.S. and interdicting terrorists at the border. All four of these amendments would have been very constructive. I supported them strongly. At the very least, they deserved a full debate here on the House floor today. So for that reason I will oppose the rule. 
   Having said that, I do support the underlying legislation, and I do commend Chairman Thompson for his efforts and certainly subcommittee ranking member and former chairman, Mr. Daniel E. Lungren, for the efforts that he put into this in the previous Congress. 
   This is legislation whose time has come. Unfortunately, it was not allowed the opportunity to even be better than it is. 
   So having said, while I support the underlying legislation, I must reluctantly oppose the rule today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   At the outset, let me thank Chairman Thompson not only for his work on this bill in particular but for the spirit of cooperation that prevailed throughout this entire period leading up to today. 
   I also want to commend Mr. Lungren, who was chairman of the subcommittee in the previous Congress which did much of the groundwork for this legislation and for the dedication that he has shown and continued in his efforts as subcommittee ranking member. 
   Mr. Thompson had pledged, upon becoming chairman of the full committee, that will be a main priority for him, and he has delivered. There are certain parts of the bill that I would have problems with. But having said that, I certainly commend him for the effort he has put into this and, again, for level of cooperation not only between him and me but between other members of the committee, between majority staff and the minority staff. 
   Mr. Chairman, September 11 changed all our worlds, and we have attempted in various ways to meet the threat that is presented to us by international Islamic terrorism. Much work has been done at the airports. Last year, we adopted very extensive and expansive port security legislation, chemical plant security legislation. 
   Some strides have been made towards rail and transit security. But today's bill, today's legislation is very much needed to take a more significant step down that road. 
   We saw from the attacks on March 11, 2004, in Madrid; the attacks of July 7 in London in 2005; and the attacks in India on commuter lines, that terrorists certainly are targeting our rail and transit for terrorist attack, one of the reasons being that it is so much more difficult to secure transit than it is airports. 
   Certainly, looking at it very parochially, from my own perspective in New York, the New York City subway system, it has more than 400 subway stations. It has over 1,500 exits and entrances to those stations. In addition to that, we have many, many tens of thousands of commuters coming in from the suburbs of Long Island, upstate New York and New Jersey every day. 
   It is not just a New York issue, by any means. This is an issue which affects rail and transit throughout the country, but it is an issue that must be addressed. 
   We have to look at the possibility that the next terrorist attack, like London, Madrid and India, will be launched from the suburbs. It is not just the inner city subways, big city commuter systems, but it is all of them. All of them have to be protected to the extent that we can. 
   We also have to support those systems which we believe can work, such as the VIPER system, which I believe is essential. 
   We have to have training for the security personnel. I wish that the legislation had also provided that the funding could go directly to the police, who provide security. It won't be you will have to go through the intermediary carriers, which I think is not a step in the right direction, but I also understand the realities of what has to be done. I think that certainly the police and the transit workers are the front line of defense when it comes to securing our mass transit, and it is essential that they receive the training that they need. 
   It is also essential that there be capital improvements, that, for instance, the tunnels leading into main terminals be reinforced, that the escape precautions be improved upon, that the first responders have access to tunnels and terminals in times of terrorist attack. 
   So these are all issues which I believe are addressed to a significant extent in the legislation. 
   As we said during the previous debate on the rule, there are parts of the legislation, though, which would have been very, very essential, I think, to have had amendments ruled in order. Mr. Lungren, I am sure, will be addressing some of these issues, but I am concerned about the whole issue on the whistleblowers as to what we do to protect national security secrets and top secret materials and why the government will be, in effect, precluded from asserting the State secret defense. That is, to me, a very, very significant issue, and it is one where I believe the legislation does not give us adequate protection. 
   Also, on the issue of Freedom of Information, which Ms. Ginny Brown-Waite will discuss as to how we can protect top secret and classified information, all of this to me is important. 
   But, having said that, this legislation is a very, very significant step forward. It is a major step forward, and it is an area where, again, we realize in a bipartisan way that more had to be done. While significant, more has to be done in the future, because we have an enemy which is constantly adapting, an enemy which is vicious and deadly. As has been proven on 9/11, they can use any number of means at their disposal. 
   We have to think outside the box. We have to try to anticipate what they are going to do. If, God forbid, there is an attack, we want to make sure our people are able to respond as quickly and as effectively as possible. I believe that this legislation addresses much of that. 
   I want to thank the chairman for, again, the open-mindedness that he has had on this in accepting many of our suggestions and also negotiating and working with us and, again, just developing and showing a spirit of bipartisanship, which I think is really essential. 
   Homeland Security should not be a partisan issue. We will and we do have  honest differences, but I think the overwhelming majority of the issues affecting Homeland Security can and should be addressed in a bipartisan way. 
   On those issues that we cannot resolve, we can have honest, intelligent differences on them without in any way questioning the motives of either side and also realizing that sometimes very pragmatic decisions have to be made. We can't allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. 
   I thank Chairman Thompson. I certainly thank Ranking Member Lungren both for his efforts in the last Congress and in this Congress for all that he has done and also the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee). 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, let me again commend Chairman Thompson for his very high level of cooperation, for the dedication he has shown to this, and again thank Mr. Lungren, the ranking member of the subcommittee, for his efforts in the previous Congress and this Congress, and also the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) for her efforts. 
   Mr. Chairman, the country was caught unaware on September 11. We could perhaps say that we did not anticipate the ferocity of the attack or the nature of the attack or the nature of our enemy, but we no longer have that excuse. September 11 certainly made us fully aware of how deadly our enemy is. Since then, whether it be intelligence reports or whether it be the attacks in London, Madrid or Mumbai, we realize also that mass transit is a favorite target of Islamic terrorists. 
   So we have no excuses. We have to move forward, and that is what this legislation does. It sets a coordinated national policy toward dealing with attacks on our public transportation system. It coordinates at the national level with the State and local officials what has to be done. It provides a level of training to our transit workers and to our police. 
   As I mentioned before, in New York, as Ms. Clarke knows well, there are more than 5 million riders on our mass transit system every day. 
   As the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) mentioned, he and I and a number of other members of the committee last year visited London and we visited Madrid. We saw the extent of the carnage and the destruction that was caused. We full well realize that the next terrorist attack may very well be launched from the suburbs. It could be brought in on a commuter train to our cities. The subway systems themselves, the mass transit systems themselves are extremely vulnerable to attack. 
   We can never be 100 percent secure. We can probably never reach the same level of protection on a subway system or mass transit system, for instance, that we can at our airports.     
   We do a great deal. And that is what this bill does, it moves us forward. It provides levels of protection that we do not currently have. And it is going to be an ongoing work in progress. It is going to be something that requires our continued dedication, our continued effort. It is going to require continued bipartisan effort, bipartisan support. 
   So I look forward to working with the chairman at least for the next 21 months in his role as chairman and, whatever happens after that, continue to work with him. Because this is, again, an issue, it is a threat that goes far beyond any type of partisan divide. It is something that should bring us all together as Americans. There is so much that we have in common where our values and principles are shared, are in common that, as Democrats and Republicans and, most importantly, as Americans, we can work together. This bill goes very far in that direction. 
   Again, I commend the chairman. I commend all of the members of the committee on both sides for their efforts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute; and I reluctantly oppose the manager's amendment. 
   The first basic reason is, when the original legislation was passed out of our committee, we would have had funding going directly to police agencies, the police departments who actually do security work. Now the money will have to go through the carriers, and the police will have to seek reimbursement from them. This is an added level of bureaucracy we don't need. It will impede a well-coordinated and structured security response. For that reason alone, I have to oppose it. 
   Also, by having a bifurcated rent distribution system between DOT and DHS, to me this goes against the letter and the spirit of the 9/11 Commission. For those basic reasons, I reluctantly oppose the manager's amendment.

   Having said that, as this legislation goes forward, I would just ask the gentleman to work with us as it goes to conference in the event that after speaking with the Secretary and the Department that they do consider this a burden and perhaps refine it.

   There is nobody on our committee who is more dedicated to this issue than Mr. Rogers. There is also no one in the Congress who I know that is more dedicated to contracting out than Mr. Rogers, his dedication on this issue and the fact that we have to realize that it is more important to know the value of something rather than just the price. The fact is, this is a situation where both the price and the value call for us to go forward with this program. This is an issue of Homeland Security. We can trivialize it. We can have some fun with it. But the fact is it is a very, very important issue. So I ask for defeat of the amendment.

   Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, all our lives changed on September 11. The government tried to react the best that it could; all levels of government have tried to come forward. But one of the most important things we have done is ask our local citizens, to ask the average person to do what they can to avoid a terrorist attack. We have asked them, for instance, there are signs at trains and subways and means of transportation all over the country which say, if you see something, say something. 
   Yet we saw the incident this past November in Minnesota where passengers on a US Airways flight reported what they saw as suspicious activity. That resulted in six imams being removed from the plane. Now, that is a matter that is going to be in litigation between US Airways and those six imams. 
   But what is absolutely disgraceful is to find out that lawyers are coming forward and advocacy groups are coming forward to represent those imams and suing, attempting to find the identity of those passengers, those citizens who acted in good faith, who responded to their government and reported what they deemed to be suspicious activity. 
   Madam Speaker, that is absolutely disgraceful. What this motion to recommit would do would be to provide immunity for any citizen, any individual that comes forward and reports suspicious activity in good faith. If they do, they will be indemnified. This is the very least we can do, to stand by good people who come forward and report suspicious activity. 
   I mean, just think if we had citizens who had seen what was happening on September 11, who saw people sitting not in their assigned seats, who had seen them being disruptive, who had seen them asking for extended seatbelts when they didn't need them and yet, somehow, those people didn't come forward because they were afraid of being sued.  
   If we are going to be serious, as a Nation, about fighting Islamic terrorism, then we have to stand by our people who come forward and report suspicious activity. So I think it is absolutely essential that this motion to recommit be passed. I can't imagine anyone being opposed to it. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce) who has been a true leader on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the new chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, for the work that he did, certainly in the  time that I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and he was the ranking member. 
   Let me also wish him the very best as he embarks on his tenure as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. And even though we certainly will have differences today and the debate will be strong at times, I want to assure him that I share the same commitment he does. I know that he shares the commitment that I have to work together in a bipartisan way on the issue of Homeland Security and throughout the next 2 years. I certainly look forward to working with him and cooperating with him in every way that I can, and I know I speak for the members of the committee on my side of the aisle. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is, to me, a very significant matter that Homeland Security is listed as the top issue. I agree that it should be. I agree that it is, and to that extent, I certainly commend the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) for bringing forth this legislation. 
   However, I am extremely disappointed in the way it is being done. And I say that not just as a matter of process or a matter of procedure, but I say that as a person who, during the 15 months that I was the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I did all I could to ensure that every piece of legislation that came through our committee was bipartisan from day one. Every piece of legislation went through a complete subcommittee hearing. The Democratic minority, at the time, were fully apprised of all that we were doing at all stages. Went to a full committee hearing, and again, everyone was apprised of all that was happening. It was an open book. And as a result of that, we passed very, very significant bipartisan legislation in the most recent Congress, the Port Security Act, chemical plant legislation, reforming and restructuring FEMA. The interoperability legislation, which was jointly sponsored and advanced by Mr. Reichert and Mr. Pascrell became part of the FEMA restructuring legislation. And I say that because it shows that, on an issue such as homeland security, we make the most progress when we work together, and that this should not be a partisan issue because terrorists don't care if you are Democrats, Republicans or Independents. If we are Americans, they want to kill us. And that has to be our guiding principle throughout this. 
   So I am disappointed today that such a piece of legislation, which attempts to deal with such a vital issue in such an all-encompassing way is going to be done without any benefit at all of going through the committee, having committee hearings, getting testimony, of reaching out. We, as Republicans, had no say whatsoever in this legislation. 
   Again, I emphasize, I can speak for the Homeland Security Committee. That never happened during the 15 months that I was the chairman, nor do I believe it ever happened under my predecessor, Mr. Cox. 
   Now, as far as the legislation today, as I said, parts of it are disappointing. And I guess this even goes back to last week. If there is one issue, one recommendation that the Homeland Security Committee made was that we should centralize as much jurisdiction as possible in one committee, rather than have such a multiplicity of committees and subcommittees in both Houses requiring the Secretary and the assistants and the undersecretaries to come up to the Hill to be testifying, and also to get a much more coordinated policy. Nothing was done on that whatsoever. 
   Now, the chairman pointed out that perhaps Republicans could have done this in the past. Well, the fact is, this is a work in progress. It was the Republican majority which set up and established, first as a select committee for 2 years and then as a permanent committee since January of 2005, the Committee on Homeland Security. I know in my conversations with the leadership, it was certainly the intention to centralize it more. Would they have? I believe they would have. If not, I certainly would have fought to have it done because one thing I think the former ranking member and the current chairman and I would agree on, we saw last year what happened when you had legislation going from one committee to the other, one committee trying to grab a small part of it and slowing down the process. 
   Also, we found out how nuanced and how complicated these issues are, and that very few of us ended up where we began. We saw, as the debate went forward, as the hearings went forward, as the expert witnesses came in, just how intricate these issues were and how vital they were and how important it was not to jump ahead. 
   Now, the chairman mentioned, for instance, scanning 100 percent of cargo within 3 years or most of it done within 3 years. Now, on its face, that sounds very good. It is a good sound bite. It is good for a 100-hour scenario. But the fact is, we held extensive hearings on that. The fact is that the legislation that was arrived at between the House and the Senate, seeing the complexity of it, and realizing that there is no technology in place right now that could bring that about, has set up pilot projects around the world, and we will get a report back on those projects with a sense of urgency and a need to implement whatever can be implemented. But to set forth a 100-percent standard when there is no evidence now that that can be achieved during that time period, to me, gives a false hope to the American people, and it is playing, to me, it is trivializing what should be the most important issue that confronts the Nation today. 
   Now, also, on that and to show that our constructive criticism of this issue is not done in a partisan way, the Washington Post today had an editorial extremely critical of that provision in particular and the process in general. 
   So with that I look forward to the debate today. As I said, I have real problems with the process. I have certain specific problems with parts of the legislation. But that can be all brought out in the debate today. Unfortunately, there won't be an opportunity to offer amendments on it. As I said, there were no committee hearings. But it is going to be a long 2 years, long in the sense that we have a long period in which to get a lot done. But, on the other hand, I assure Mr. Thompson that once we get this behind us, I look forward to working with him in as bipartisan a way as possible. And with the respect I have for him, I think, at the end of that long 2 years, the American people will see that we have achieved quite a bit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said at the outset of the debate, I commend the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) on his elevation to the position of chairman. He is an outstanding Member of this House, and I look forward to working with him in a bipartisan manner throughout the next 2 years. 
   I must say, however, that I am deeply disappointed in the manner in which this bill was brought to the floor today and, indeed, with many of the provisions that are in this bill. I say that as someone who lost more than 150 friends, neighbors and constituents on September 11th, who has a number of staff members working for me who lost relatives on September 11th, so no issue is more important to me than getting homeland security right and making it work. 
   But during the previous 2 years, certainly during the 15 months that I was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, it was bipartisan. Every bill that came to the floor went through subcommittee and went through the full committee. Port security legislation, FEMA restructuring, chemical plant security bill, all went through the subcommittee, full committee and were adopted by this House and were signed into law. 
   In addition to that, we had the risk-based funding bill which went through the committee and again passed on the House floor. It was blocked in the Senate. But the fact is, we got results, and we got them in a bipartisan basis. No bill came to the floor without full bipartisan cooperation from day one. 
   Now, unfortunately, for whatever reason, as part of the 100 hours show, the leadership refuses to allow any bipartisan input, no committee involvement at all, no subcommittee involvement and no amendments. And in doing that, it is not just a shot at us. We can survive that. We will be back in 2 years. But what I am concerned about is, what this does for the next 2 years and what it does to the Homeland Security Committee, because the 9/11 Commission specifically stated that a committee should be given primary jurisdiction. That should be the Homeland Security Committee.     
   The Democrats could have taken care of that in their rules package. They refused to do it. So the most important recommendation of the 9/11 Commission is not being enacted today. It is not being done at all. In fact, they are weakening the committee by bypassing the committee process. 
   I will use as one example what happens when a bill is rushed to the floor without the proper deliberative process. We talk about 100 percent scanning of all cargo coming into our ports. The fact is in the port security bill, which passed the House, passed the Senate and was enacted into law, we set up pilot projects around the world to find a scanning process that works. 
   The fact is there is no current technology that works at 100 percent. We don't have it. We want to find what works the best. Nowhere in the 9/11 Commission report do they call for 100 percent scanning. All of us want to have it. The fact is we are not going to be able to scan 11 million containers coming into our shores. 
   Now, last year when this was first raised by the Democratic Party, the Washington Post said it is a terrible idea. It is a slogan, not a solution. We hope lawmakers resist the temptation to use it in the election season to come. 
   Now, the Washington Post is not exactly an advocate of the Republican Party. Today in their editorial, they talk about what a tough job it is to bring about homeland security. They say it will not be done by wasting money on the kind of political shenanigans written into the sprawling Democratic bill introduced on the House floor today. 
   The Democrats don't offer a realistic cost estimate for the mandate they will propose, but the cost to the government and the economy is sure to be in the tens of billions of dollars and quite possibly hundreds of billions annually. 
   Luckily, the Senate will give more thought to its homeland security bill, the Washington Post says, but House Democrats can figure those odds as well as anyone, but why not score some easy political points in your first 100 hours. 
   Well, the fact is you shouldn't be scoring political points on the issue of homeland security. That is too important an issue to be trivialized the way you are doing it here today. Now I will, in the end, I will vote for this bill despite its faults, because I want to send a bipartisan message that the House stands behind homeland security. 
   But I will hope that in the future, we will have a Homeland Security Committee which is empowered the way it should be by the Democratic leadership, that a Homeland Security Committee, which I know the chairman wants to do, will work in a bipartisan way so we can address the scourge of Islamic terrorism as Republicans and Democrats and Americans and not having something rammed through to score cheap political points in the 100-hour circus. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me thank the gentleman from Mississippi, Chairman Thompson, for his cooperation, not just in the previous Congress on putting this legislation together, but also today in his generosity in allowing me to go forward on it. To me, this is typical and symbolic of the bipartisanship which he has brought to the committee both as ranking member and now as chairman. I thank him for that. And more than his personal kindness and generosity, let me also say that it is so vitally important that on issues such as this that there be bipartisan cooperation working across the aisle because all of our lives changed on September 11. All of us realized we had to change the way we did business, whether it was creating the Department of Homeland Security, whether it was creating the law enforcement agencies at all levels of government to cooperate, whether it meant adopting specific legislation on chemical plants or port security, or any of the other areas included within the umbrella of Homeland Security. 
   But it also requires us to establish firmer relationships with our allies, finding areas of common ground among us and our allies, and that is what H.R. 884 will do. H.R. 884 is the Promoting Antiterrorism Cooperation through Technology and Science Act, PACTS. 
   It is an effort by us to have our Department of Homeland Security and our government work with our allies and friends around the world to find common ways to confront terrorism, to use technology to confront terrorism, and it does that initially by establishing the International Cooperation Programs Office within the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security. 
   It also authorizes $25 million a year in fiscal years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. So $25 million for each of the next four fiscal years. It specifies by name Great Britain, Singapore, Israel, Canada, and Australia as countries that we should especially work more closely with to exchange technology and research, and to work together on a common effort at the government level, at the university level, private foundations, to put aside any technical differences that may separate us, to try to work through any legal impediments there may be to the type of cooperation that we believe is absolutely essential. 
   This legislation did pass our committee in the last Congress and passed the House. Unfortunately, it was blocked in the Senate. We certainly hope that under the leadership of Chairman Thompson it will again pass the House this year, and hopefully the Senate will do the right thing this year and we can get this legislation to the President's desk. 
   The war on terrorism will involve many of us for many years. The more allies and partners and friends we can have working with us, the more we can share our expertise and technology that make us stronger and make the enemy weaker. 
   I urge the adoption of H.R. 884 and thank the gentleman from Mississippi for his cooperation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I also want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman RUSH and, of course, Congresswoman Schakowsky for the tremendous leadership that she has shown on this issue, working in a truly bipartisan fashion and, most importantly, getting the job done. I just want to thank her for that. 
   I also want to acknowledge Senator Clinton and Senator Sununu, who are also pursuing this legislation in the United States Senate. 
   But most importantly, I want to thank Dr. Greg Gulbransen and his wife Leslie Gulbransen for coming to me almost 5 years ago after the tragic death of their son who was killed when the family car backed over him. I can't imagine a more horrific circumstance for a family to go through, for parents to go through. And yet Dr. Gulbransen and Mrs. Gulbransen, they took this tragedy and opportunity to save the lives of other children throughout the Nation, and they have been steadfast and they've been unyielding in their support of this legislation. And as Congresswoman Schakowsky said, so many other parents have gone through the agony of appearing at news conferences, of coming forward and lending their support and their own terrible, terrible experience to advancing this legislation. 
   So my heart goes out to them, but most importantly, today I thank them for the efforts which they have given. Cameron Gulbransen was a young man in my district who was tragically killed 5 years ago, and as Congresswoman Schakowsky said, every year we have more than 200 children killed, 200 children killed despite the best effort of their friends, of their neighbors. We're not talking about negligence here. We're not talking about people who are at all uncaring. We're talking about people who took every possible safety measure, and yet in spite of that, these tragedies occurred. 
   So I'm not going to go through all the detail of the bill. I just want to again thank Congresswoman Schakowsky for her effort, thank Ranking Member Barton for extending me this time today, and most importantly, thanking Dr. Gulbransen and Mrs. Gulbransen for, again, their unyielding courage, for their dedication, and also the people on my staff who worked on this bill. 
   And again, this is a great day for the children of America, a great day for the parents of America, and it's a day that all of us will look back on with pride and, most importantly, with thanks and gratitude for the lives that will be saved because of that. 
   And with that, Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (PROHIBITING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN DEFAMATION JUDGMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 6146, legislation that will prohibit the recognition and enforcement of foreign defamation judgments based upon a publication that concerns a public figure or a matter of public concern. This bill, like legislation (Free Speech Protection Act) that I introduced earlier this year attempts to deal with the issue of ``libel tourism'' that threatens not only Americans' First Amendment freedom of speech but also their ability to inform the general public about existential threats; namely, who are the terrorists and who are their supporters. As the Ranking Member on the House Committee on Homeland Security I am regularly briefed on dangers to the homeland and know how grave these threats are. We cannot allow foreigners the opportunity to muzzle Americans for speaking the truth about these dangers! 
   Libel tourism is a recent phenomenon in which certain individuals are obstructing the free expression rights of Americans (and the vital interest of the American people) by seeking out foreign jurisdictions (``libel shopping'') that do not provide the full extent of free-speech protection that is enshrined in our First Amendment. Some of these actions are intended not only to suppress the free speech rights of journalists and others but also to intimidate publishers and other organizations from disseminating or supporting their work. 
   Unlike in the United States where the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to show that the publication was not only false but also malicious, in countries such as the United Kingdom it is the reverse: The defendant is required to appear in court and prove what he has written was 100 percent factual. And some of the ``tourists'' claims of jurisdiction are tenuous at best. In many cases, not only are none of the individuals (author, litigant, or publisher) associated with the case living in the venue of jurisdiction, but neither are the books  published there. These ``tourists'' stretch the law by claiming a handful of copies of the book were purchased over the internet in that country. The author must then hire an attorney, travel to the foreign country, and defend himself or likely face a default judgment against him. Consequences include (but are not limited to) fines, public apologies, pulping of books, and the removal of them from bookstores and libraries. 
   We cannot change nor would we want to change other countries' (libel) laws. We must respect their rule of law as they ought to respect ours. However, we cannot allow foreign citizens to exploit these courts to shield personal reputations when it directly contradicts Americans' First Amendment protected speech, especially when the subject matter is of such grave importance as terrorism and those who finance it. We rely on a variety of sources for 
   intelligence and we cannot allow foreign litigants and foreign courts to tell us who can write and who can publish what. That is a dangerous path we do not want to follow. 
   Furthermore, the governments and courts of some foreign countries have failed to curtail this practice, permitting lawsuits filed by persons who are often not citizens of those countries, under circumstances where there is often little or no basis for jurisdiction over the Americans against whom such suits are brought. 
   Some of the plaintiffs bringing such suits are intentionally and strategically refraining from filing their suits in the United States, even though the speech at issue was published in the United States, to avoid the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence and frustrate the protections it affords Americans. 
   But this issue is also very troubling for the authors, journalists, and even publishers who attempt to write on these subjects. Already we have seen examples of authors having difficulty getting their articles or books published because of publishing houses' fear of being sued overseas. Some companies have even gone as far as to pay large settlements to avoid having to go to court. So not only are authors being injured for the works they have previously written but they and their publishers are being intimidated from writing future works on these important topics. The free expression and publication by journalists, academics, commentators, experts, and others of the information they uncover and develop through research and study is essential to the formation of sound public policy and thus to the security of Americans. 
   The Americans against whom such suits are brought must consequently endure the prohibitive expense, inconvenience, and anxiety attendant to being sued in foreign courts for conduct that is protected by the First Amendment, or decline to answer such suits and risk the entry of costly default judgments that may be executed in countries other than the United States where those individuals travel or own property. 
   In turn, the American people are suffering concrete and profound harm because they, their representatives, and other government policy-makers rely on the free expression of information, ideas and opinions developed by responsible journalists, academics, commentators, experts, and others for the formulation of sound public policy, including national security policy. 
   Having said that, the United States respects the sovereign right of other countries to enact their own laws regarding speech, and seeks only to protect the First Amendment rights of Americans in connection with speech that occurs, in whole or part, in the United States. 
   That is why earlier this year I introduced the Free Speech Protection Act, H.R. 5814, to defend U.S. persons who are sued for defamation in foreign courts. This legislation allows U.S. persons to bring a Federal cause of action against any person bringing a foreign libel suit if the writing does not constitute defamation under U.S. law. It would also bar enforcement of foreign libel judgments and provide other appropriate injunctive relief by U.S. courts if a cause of action is established. H.R. 5814 would award damages to the U.S. person who brought the action in the amount of the foreign judgment, the costs related to the foreign lawsuit, and the harm caused due to the decreased opportunities to publish, conduct research, or generate funding. Furthermore, it 
   would award treble damages if the person bringing the foreign lawsuit intentionally engaged in a scheme to suppress First Amendment rights. It allows for the expedited discovery if the court determines that the speech at issue in the foreign defamation action is protected by the First Amendment. Finally, nothing in this legislation would limit the rights of foreign litigants who bring good faith defamation actions to prevail against journalists and others who have failed to adhere to standards of professionalism by publishing false information maliciously or recklessly. The Free Speech Protection Act does, however, attempt to discourage those foreign libel suits that aim to intimidate, threaten, and restrict the freedom of speech of Americans. I am proud to have worked closely with Senators. ARLEN SPECTER and JOE LIEBERMAN who have introduced companion legislation in the Senate. 
   I support the passage of H.R. 6146, a Federal version of New York State's ``Rachel's Law,'' which will provide protection to U.S. authors, journalists, and publishers against the domestic enforcement of defamation judgments from foreign countries with less free speech protections than the U.S. The protection of free speech enshrined in the First Amendment is one of America's most cherished rights, and it is unacceptable that First Amendment rights of Americans can be potentially undermined or restricted by foreign court judgments based on lower free speech standards. 
   The impetus for a Federal ``Rachel's Law'' is the case of Dr. Rachel Ehrenfeld, a U.S. citizen and Director of the American Center for Democracy. Dr. Ehrenfeld's 2003 book, ``Funding Evil: How Terrorism is Financed and How to Stop It,'' which was published solely in the United States by a U.S. publisher, alleged that a Saudi Arabian subject and his family financially supported al Qaeda in the years preceding the attacks of September 11. He sued Dr. Ehrenfeld for libel in England though because under English law, it is not necessary for a libel plaintiff to prove falsity or actual malice as is required in the U.S. After the English court entered a judgment against Dr. Ehrenfeld, she sought to shield herself with a declaration from both Federal and State courts that her book did not create liability under American law, but jurisdictional barriers prevented both the Federal and New York State courts from acting. Reacting to this problem, the Governor of New York, on May 1, 2008, signed into law the ``Libel Terrorism Protection Act'', commonly known as ``Rachel's Law.'' 
   I support H.R. 6146 because it prohibits U.S. (domestic) courts from enforcing these outrageous defamation suits. We must stand up to the terrorists and their financers, supporters, and sympathizers. However, this bill does not go far enough nor does it resolve the problem of ``libel tourism.'' Foreign litigants will still be allowed to file these libel suits overseas without the worry of being countersued here in the U.S. If this bill passes, they will never see a dime of those hefty judgments they were awarded, but that's not what they are after in the first place. They want the default judgment. They want the publicity. They want the apology. And they want these books to disappear. But most of all they want to intimidate. They want to make sure people are afraid of writing anything about them. And it's working. Journalists are even afraid of writing about this legislation! That's their goal here. Not to collect the money. Many of them are already wealthy, and if they really cared about collecting a monetary judgment they would file these suits in the U.S. in the first place. They choose not to, however, because they know they would never win in a U.S. court. 
   Finally, I support H.R. 6146 because it is a first step in the right direction. I am a cosponsor of this bill and thank Representatives STEVE COHEN and DARRELL ISSA for introducing it. H.R. 6146 is an important and necessary part of any ``libel tourism'' bill. Unfortunately, it doesn't put an end to the problem and doesn't provide any deterrence from these suits being filed in the first place. But it is my hope that during the 111th Congress we can have hearings on this important issue and that Representatives COHEN and ISSA, along with Senators SPECTER and LIEBERMAN and I, can sit down together and craft a bill that we can all agree on and that will solve this problem once and for all.

<DOCNO>Mr. KING of New York. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. I thank the ranking member for yielding and, Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, the United States has been at war with Islamic terrorism since September 11, 2001. This is a war which threatens our survival as a civilization, and it is a war where it is essential that we maximize the use of electronic surveillance which is one of the strongest weapons in our arsenal. It is a weapon which should not be trivialized, nor should the struggle be trivialized by using such terms as ``spying'' and ``snooping.'' 
   It is important we keep in mind who the real enemy is. The real enemy is al Qaeda and Islamic terrorism, not the men and women of our own government who are working so hard to protect us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Protect America Act, which was passed less than 3 months ago, updated FISA and struck the appropriate balance between protecting our citizens from terrorist attacks and protecting our civil liberties.  Tragically, today's bill, the RESTORE Act, marks an undeniable retreat in the war against Islamic terrorism. It limits the type of foreign intelligence information that may be acquired and actually gives foreign targets more protections than Americans get in criminal cases here at home. 
   By sunsetting this legislation in 2 years, the RESTORE Act fails to provide permanency and guidance to the intelligence community. The RESTORE Act also fails to provide legal protection and immunity to those American companies who answered the call of this administration and also answered the call of an administration which believed that this policy was legal, and not only this administration, but high-ranking officials from previous administrations, Democrat and Republican, who believed that these policies were legal and constitutional. There was no personal gain for these companies. To allow them to be subjected to lawsuits for answering the Nation's call in time of great peril is mean-spirited, vindictive and shortsighted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge defeat of this misguided legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the defeat of this supplemental appropriation. It is wrong in so many ways. And I say that as someone who strongly believes that the war in Iraq is the central front in the war against terrorism. I say that, and I see my colleague here, Mr. Fossella, someone who lost hundreds of friends and neighbors and constituents on September 11. And I also say that as someone who says this supplemental is sending all the wrong possible signals. It is sending the wrong signal to General Petraeus. It is sending the wrong signal to our troops. And probably most importantly of all, it is sending the wrong signal to the enemy. It is telling them that we in the Congress think there should be 535 commanders in chief, 535 commanders in the field; telling the enemy that they have 60 days to create whatever chaos and carnage and confusion they can to influence the media, to influence those here in the House who are looking for an excuse to cut off funding for the troops. 
   If we have a Commander in Chief, a commander in the field, they should be given the ultimate power and authority to prosecute the war. If the Democrats want to make this their war, that is one thing, but this should be above politics. It is not a political issue. It is not something that should be gauged on public opinion polls. It should be based on what is right for America. And whether it is a Democrat President or a Republican President, the President is the Commander in Chief. 
   The United States Senate approved General Petraeus by a unanimous vote. To send him over there and then to undercut him, to cut off his legs when he is trying to carry out a policy which is showing signs of work. I am not a general. I am not the commander, but if you look at what is happening in Anbar province, what is happening in Ramadi, what is happening in parts of Baghdad, give General Petraeus the opportunity. Give our troops the opportunity. Don't be grandstanding. Don't be playing to the crowd. Don't be caving into your left wing base which is right now driving you. You have gotten yourselves into a hole, and you cannot get out of it. Our troops should be above that. 
   Have concerns for our troops, but most importantly, respect the Constitution. Allow the President and his commanders to prosecute the war. He was elected; General Petraeus was confirmed by the Senate. Everyone knew that he had to plan for a surge. To undercut him now is wrong. It is morally wrong. It is politically wrong, and it is going to bring shame on the House of Representatives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lincoln Diaz-Balart) for yielding. I thank the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) for her kind remarks. And particularly I want to thank Ranking Member Thompson, excuse me, former Ranking Member, current Chairman Thompson for the outstanding job I believe he is doing as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and certainly for the level of bipartisanship which he has demonstrated. 
   Having said that, I have to reluctantly but strongly urge defeat of the rule today. The reason I say that, Mr. Speaker, is that the bill which did pass through the Homeland Security Committee under Chairman Thompson's leadership, passed by a vote of 26-0, was a truly bipartisan effort. There was cooperation from all sides, and we came together to fashion what I believe was a very constructive and significant piece of legislation in an area which obviously is of vital importance to our Nation. 
   The Department of Homeland Security has been in existence now only several years. It is in its fourth year. We are talking about 22 different Departments and agencies, 180,000 employees. And it is making progress, but much more has to be done. And to address it, we have to do it in a bipartisan way. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that comes to the floor today has been either stripped or dramatically modified up to 50 percent of the original provisions. And some of these are very significant provisions, probably none more significant than just the sense of Congress, which was so strongly recommended by the 9/11 Commission, saying that the Committee on Homeland Security should be the focal point of legislative activity regarding the Department of Homeland Security, rather than having offices and officials of the Department having to testify before 84 or 86 or 88 various committees and subcommittees of the House.  
   Also, a number of significant provisions in addition to that that were taken out, for instance, an increase in funding for the Secret Service; prohibiting grants to universities that bar Coast Guard recruiters; and, as Mr. Diaz-Balart pointed out, a very significant legislation which, by the way, came from Congressman DeFazio, which would codify the existing lobbying ban on Department of Homeland Security officials to ensure accountability. And we can go down the list of so many, I believe, significant provisions that were taken out. 
   Now, the reason for this, I understand where Chairman Thompson is coming from. There was resistance from other committees. But I believe we should have withstood that resistance. 
   For instance, in the prior Congress when we did pass port security legislation, when we did pass legislation restructuring FEMA, when we did pass legislation involving chemical plant security, we met that same resistance from other committees.     
   But we stood up to it, and we were largely successful. And we did it by working through the leadership to not just back away from these confrontations, but I believe that when we do it so quickly and we do back away, we really weaken the status of the committee. Not that we are looking to build turf, not that it is a power grab, but, again, following the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, if there is one committee which should have primary jurisdiction on homeland security matters, it is the Committee on Homeland Security. 
   Also, there were amendments proposed that were rejected by the Rules Committee: Congressman Dent's amendment on the Automated Targeting System, which was strongly supported by the 9/11 Commission; Congressman Shays' proposed amendment involving cooperation with Interpol, very important, that was also disallowed; Congressman Dave Davis, his amendment to expand the 287(g) program, which would provide funding for local law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws; and Congressman Poe's amendment regarding appropriate procedures for Customs and Border Protection agents. 
   So these are a number of very solid amendments that were disallowed. We come here today with a bill which is really barely half of what it was when it left the committee. So I am strongly urging a ``no'' vote on the rule. 
   In no way is this a reflection on my good friend Chairman Thompson. And after we go through today and maybe even tomorrow, I pledge to him we will continue to work in a bipartisan way. But I really hope that the leadership of the other side would realize the significance of the Committee on Homeland Security and not just give in to various barons throughout the House who are trying to just hold on to their own turf and their own power.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, I recognize myself for as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, at the outset, let me express my deep admiration for Chairman Thompson and for the bipartisan spirit he has shown in his running of the committee, both as chairman and during the previous 2 years as ranking member. 
   This is one committee of the House which I believe functions very affirmatively in a bipartisan manner because, as Chairman Thompson has said, that when the terrorists come, they don't care whether you are Democrat or Republican, they want to kill all of us. That's why I commend him again for the spirit of bipartisanship. 
   It was that spirit of bipartisanship that resulted in H.R. 1684 being passed out of committee by a unanimous 26-0 vote. It was a bipartisan effort, there was hard work on both sides, there was compromise on both sides, innovations on both sides. We came together, I believe, with a very strong package. 
   I am, however, very concerned about the manager's amendment, which is going to be coming up for a vote today, because of the 86 provisions in the bill, 42, 49.8 percent, of the provisions of the bill have either been eliminated or changed dramatically. 
   Some of the key ones on the issue of interoperability, in our legislation, the committee legislation, we provided that $1 billion in grants for interoperability could be used for training exercise, for training as well as for the purchase of hardware. This was demanded, strongly requested by local law enforcement, local law authorities. It is essential to interoperability. Yet that has been stricken from the legislation.     
   On the ``sense of Congress'' language which has been so strongly recommended by the 9/11 Commission, that the Committee on Homeland Security be the focal point for oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and for being the central committee on the issue of homeland security, just the ``sense of Congress'' language was eliminated from the bill. We go down the list, as far as authorization for Secret Service, especially considering the increased amount which will be necessary in this year to protect Presidential candidates. So many other amendments, so much other language, even, for instance, on the issue of employees who leave the Department, lobbying restrictions, which quite honestly was proposed by a Democratic Congressman, Mr. DeFazio, that has been stricken out. 
   Now, I realize what has happened here; I went through this during the time that I was chairman, but I think we approached it a little differently. There are other committees which are objecting to the jurisdiction of Homeland Security. There are others which are defying the wish of the 9/11 Commission, which is to have power vested in the Committee on Homeland Security. And, unfortunately, it appeased it at every juncture where objection was raised; those provisions were taken out. 
   Now, in the last Congress, we adopted the Port Security Bill. That was a long, hard fight. We had jurisdictional battles with other committees; but we stayed with it, and the final package tremendously increased the position of the Committee on Homeland Security and resulted in very strong legislation. On the restructuring of FEMA, that also caused severe conflicts with other committees of jurisdiction. We stayed with it, and the final product enhanced the position of the Committee on Homeland Security. On the issue of chemical plants security, similarly, there were severe conflicts with other committees. We worked with the leadership at the time, Speaker Hastert and Majority Leader BOEHNER, and that resulted also in ultimate legislation which significantly enhanced the jurisdiction of the Committee on Homeland Security. 
   By acquiescing so quickly to the objections or the positions of other committees, I think we have weakened our committee. And that to me is not a turf battle or not a power struggle; the issue of life and death is too important for that. But the fact is, we did not stand firm in fighting for jurisdiction of the committee. 
   I know the chairman has mentioned that there was not an authorization bill passed by the House last year. I agree with that. We did pass one out of committee, there was one passed in 2005. The Senate has never passed an authorization bill. 
   I made the judgment last year that we had an opportunity, a window of opportunity to pass significant legislation which could be brought to the House floor, which could be brought to  the Senate floor, and which could pass, and that was port security, chemical plants and FEMA restructuring, and we did that. As far as this year now, we do have the H.R. 1, which still has not moved; it hasn't even gone to conference yet, and we have this legislation today, which was a fine product of the committee, but unfortunately, it has been dramatically weakened with, I must say, no input at all from the Republican side. And considering the extent to which Chairman Thompson does reach out at the committee level and there is such a bipartisan level of cooperation at the committee level, I would have hoped that we would have at least had something to say when it went to the Rules Committee when the manager's amendment was being constructed. Instead, this was done totally behind closed doors, totally to the exclusion of any Republican input. Again, perhaps it would be fine if we were an adversarial type committee, but we are not. This is a collegial committee. It is a bipartisan committee, and everything we do, every word of every provision both during the time when Chairman Cox was chairman, when I was chairman and certainly now under Chairman Thompson, it has been bipartisan. I regret that has not been the situation in bringing the legislation before the House today. So I will be later urging a vote against the manager's amendment. 
   But I again want to express my regard for Chairman Thompson, and hope that when this is over, when this is resolved today or tomorrow or whenever the final vote comes, we can go forward from there and work in a bipartisan way at the committee level the way we have done for the last 3 1/2 years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

And would just add that this was genuinely bipartisan, and it did increase spending by $2.1 billion more than the President of our party was recommending, and yet we as Republicans did that because we wanted to act in a bipartisan way, which makes the fact that we were shut out of the manager's amendment much more painful.

   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Chairman, as we leave general debate and begin to debate the amendments, I would again say I commend the gentleman from Mississippi, the chairman, for the bill that was put forth in the committee which came out of the committee. 
   I am, again, disappointed by the product that came here today. I understand the realities of politics and the realities of governing, but I just wish we could have made more of an effort to move the committee product further along, rather than make the concessions that were made. There are just so many important matters that were either dramatically revised or eliminated, which weakens the thrust of where we're going. 
   We will be debating amendments for the next several hours. The debate will be in good faith, just as our efforts on the committee are in good faith, but I just wish the leadership of the House would do more to improve and to enhance and to further the position of the Homeland Security Committee so we can do the job that we have been chartered to do and we can do the job the 9/11 Commission wants us to do, to do the job that the 9/11 families want us to do, and do the job that the memory of those who were murdered on 9/11 really command that we do. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to the upcoming debate. I am disappointed in the product that is before us. Having said that, I remain enthusiastic about the job that we as a committee can do under the chairmanship of Chairman Thompson and with the strong cooperation from the minority on the committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time

   Mr. KING of New York. I recognize myself for as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I understand the chairman's dilemma. The bottom line is we did pass a very strong bill out of committee. And let's just again delineate some of those provisions which were unanimously agreed to and have been agreed to: Language on maritime alien smuggling; language which would have monitored the activities of foreign students and visitors; biometric identification of illegal aliens; expanding the use of interoperability grants, which is so much needed by our local law enforcement and first responders; authorizing the Secret Service and its functions; increasing the authorizations of the Secret Service to provide security to Presidential candidates; prohibiting grants to universities which bar Coast Guard recruiters. It eliminated a report on Secret Service training facilities. And, as Mr. McCaul said before, it eliminated the provision providing for a National Bio and Agro Defense facility. 
   Also, more significantly, if we go to the heart of the 9/11 Commission, it eliminated the language calling for a sense of Congress that the homeland security be in fact the focal point and the central point when it comes to legislation on homeland security and also when it comes to overseeing the Department of Homeland Security. 
   Now the chairman has gone back in history to talk about what happened in the past. The fact is, this is a growing committee, and we all have to make decisions. We have to make value-based decisions. We have to make prudent decisions. 
   I was the chairman last year; and I did not go for an authorization bill  early on in the year because I thought it was important, in establishing the jurisdiction of the committee, that we go forward and adopt the most far-reaching port security bill ever enacted and, in doing so, confronting jurisdictional impediments thrown at us by other committees. 
   We did that. It was a long, hard fight. It began early spring and wasn't concluded until September, but we did conclude it. And not only did we enact solid legislation, but, as importantly, we were able to establish our jurisdiction at the expense of competing committees. And I say that not as part of a turf battle, but if we are going to have real homeland security, we have to have a real Homeland Security Committee. 
   Similarly, when it came to restructuring FEMA, which was a mammoth fight here in the Congress last year, we stood strong through May and June and July and into September; and when the final product came out, it again enhanced the jurisdiction of the Homeland Security Committee. 
   Also, on the issue of chemical plant security, we fought hard on that. We fought hard for our language, and we got it in. It was part of the omnibus appropriation, and that language again established the Committee on Homeland Security as the primary committee on that issue.     
   So these were all solid steps forward made by the committee. 
   Now, I understand the chairman's dilemma. I am not here to take cheap shots. I realize how tough this can be. But my point is, when we had such a solid vote, a unanimous vote coming out of committee, I think more should have been done in resisting the efforts of the other chairmen and of the Democratic leadership to strip so many of the provisions. Almost half of the provisions have been stripped out altogether or dramatically modified. So I do see this, unfortunately, as a step backwards. Certainly not a step forward. 
   I realize the significance of getting the authorization bill done. I am not trying to minimize that. But the fact is, considering the progress we made last year in such significant areas as port security, chemical plant security and the restructuring of FEMA, we could have done better on this authorization bill this year. 
   Again, I will have to urge a ``no'' vote on this manager's amendment because of the damage which I believe it does to the Committee on Homeland Security. And also, Mr. Chairman, to send a signal, not to Chairman Thompson but to the leadership of the House, that we did come forward on our side. We were willing to stand up to the administration and increase spending by over $2 billion more than the administration requests and wants. We did that unanimously on the Republican side. We also again worked with Chairman Thompson on the language that he wanted. He worked with us. So we did make that effort at the committee level. 
   I just wish the same level of bipartisan cooperation was shown at the leadership level of the House of Representatives rather than having the minority excluded altogether, which was never done at the committee level, either under myself or now under Chairman Thompson. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I will rest on the eloquence of my previous remarks and yield back the balance of my time.

The language, which is actually my language in the bill which passed the full committee, actually would have called for the implementation and not just the sense of Congress; and this, to me, is another deficiency in the bill and that we are taking, at best, a half step forward. We could have taken the full step. 
   Having said that, I certainly agree in spirit with the amendment. Certainly this is better than nothing. And with that, I will urge the adoption of the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset, let me commend all the members of the Homeland Security Committee, especially Chairman Thompson, for the spirit of bipartisanship which did bring the floor to this moment right now, this conference report. 
   Having said that, I must take exception to a number of the statements that have been made here today, especially by the gentleman from Florida and his statements implying somehow that there has not been a significant amount of accomplishments since September 11, 2001. 
   Let me just recount some of them that were done prior to this. The enactment of the PATRIOT Act; the reauthorizing of the PATRIOT Act; the Intelligence Reform Act, which created the Director of National Intelligence; just last year, the adoption of the first-ever port security act; chemical plant security; restructuring FEMA; $1 billion for interoperability. 
   I really don't think it serves a purpose to somehow be suggesting that the Republicans, or any Member of this body for that matter, is holding back or in any way not doing all that is possible to protect our Nation against the threat of Islamic terrorism. For instance, the National Intelligence Estimate, when it was released last week, made a point of stressing that the greatly increased counterterrorism efforts over the past 5 years have constrained the ability of al Qaeda to attack the United States' homeland again and have led terrorist groups to perceive the homeland as a harder target to strike than on 9/11. These measures have helped disrupt known plots against the United States since 9/11. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I don't think it does any purpose at all to downgrade the efforts made by this Congress and this administration. This should be a bipartisan effort, and I think a lot of the rhetoric today undermines that. 
   Having said that, I will be supporting this bill because, on balance, I believe there have been significant improvements made. I hope that next year and the year after and the year after that we continue to make improvements. 
   Now, there have been some failures. One of the main requirements, main recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was that jurisdiction be consolidated in one committee. That was not done. In fact, anyone who went to the first meeting of the conference committee, it was like the Tower of Babel. We had subcommittees and committees, and ranking members and committee chairmen. I think there were about over 60 people at a conference committee when there should have been four. 
   Having said that, I believe that this is something to work toward in the future. And I would hope that the Democrats, during the time that they still retain the majority, will work to consolidate that jurisdiction. 
   But some of the positive steps, on grant reform, I certainly agree with the gentleman from Mississippi on this, and I commend him for this. We did have long, involved preconferencing negotiations. And he worked with me and Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins to come up with a grant formula which is far more based on risk than it was before. It's still not perfect, it was still a minimum that's going to be in there, but having said that, it's a significant advance over what we've had in the past, and I applaud him for that. I applaud the other members of the conference committee, and the bipartisan membership of our committee which passed similar legislation in 2005 and 2006, and now it has been brought to fruition. And I give Chairman Thompson credit for that. 
   Also, on another issue, which I'm very pleased is in this bill, and that's upon the issue of giving immunity to those who come forward and report suspicious activity. I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Pearce, the gentleman from New Mexico who is here today, who was the first to initiate this legislation. Then we passed it here on the House floor in March. And so long as we're in a partisan mood today, I point out that a majority of Democrats voted against that. And last week, a majority of Democrats voted against it in the Senate. And to me it was unfortunate that we had to have 5 or 6 days of intense negotiations before the Democratic leadership finally intervened and brought about the insertion of that language into the conference report. But it is there; it gives immunity to those people who come forward and report what they see on good faith. And we learned on September 11, if you see something, say something. 
   We know that you cannot have enough FBI agents, you cannot have enough police officers to monitor the actions of Islamic terrorists. We need the eyes and the ears of millions of good Americans, and that's what this language protects. 
   Before I slow myself down, let me just say that at the conference committee from the other side, I want to commend Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins. This was a true bicameral effort. And again, Chairman Thompson, we went through a number of, over a period of weeks, preconference negotiations, all of which were conducted in good faith. And I think the product today, again, while not perfect, is another step in the right direction, building on the steps of the previous 5 1/2 years. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KING of New York. Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H. J. Res. 93, a resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act (P.L. 108-61). I am proud to have once again introduced this legislation; this year with the gentleman from New York, Mr. Crowley. 
   In 2003 Congress passed the Burmese Freedom & Democracy Act, legislation that I co-authored with my friend, the late Tom Lantos. President Bush signed this bill into law and we have reauthorized these import restrictions every year since. The legislation bans imports from Burma and the issuance of visas to those officials affiliated with the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, the military junta that rules Burma and brutally represses its people. This law also bans U.S. financial transactions that involve individuals or entities connected with the SPDC. 
   These sanctions are critically important to keeping the pressure on the Burmese junta. The government continues to have one of the worst human rights records in the world and routinely violates the rights of Burmese citizens, including the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests and detention, torture, as well as slave and child labor. The Burmese regime has destroyed more than 3,000 ethnic villages, displaced approximately 2,000,000 Burmese people, more than 500,000 of which are internally displaced, and arrested approximately 1,300 individuals for expressing critical opinions of the government. And it continues to hold Aung San Suu Kyi, the head of the National League for Democracy and the democratically elected leader of Burma, under house arrest. 
   And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, it does. In August 2007, after the SPDC cancelled fuel subsidies resulting in skyrocketing fuel prices, student leaders, democracy leaders, and Buddhist monks marched peacefully through the streets to demand human rights, freedom, and democracy. But the military responded by attacking these protestors. Hundreds of innocent people were killed, arrested, imprisoned, or tortured as part of this violent crackdown. 
   Then in May 2008 came Cyclone Nargis. Hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens lost their lives because the government did not inform them a storm was approaching and, even worse, delayed and prevented humanitarian aid from reaching its people. 
   We must continue to stand with the Burmese people and expose the despicable and reprehensible actions of the SPDC. Sanctions are critical to putting pressure on the junta, Just last week the House passed the Burmese Democracy Promotion Act (H.R. 3890) which would ban the importation of Burmese gems into the United States and freeze the assets of Burmese political and military leaders. But we need to urge others to do the same. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, the European Union, EU, and the United Nations Security Council, UNSC, must all impose multilateral sanctions against Burma's military regime including a complete arms embargo. 
   I urge adoption of the resolution.
