<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 5140, the much needed Economic Growth Package to address troubles in the mortgage marketplace. 
   In the past year, we have witnessed significant upheaval in the U.S. housing markets. Increased delinquencies and defaults among borrowers have contributed to turmoil in the mortgage finance sector, which has affected our entire economy. Many areas of the country have been heavily impacted by the mortgage crisis, with many families facing increased payments and foreclosures. 
   Over the years, many hard-working families have been faced with a situation where they are either unable to own homes, or they are forced to resort to risky loans that might impair their ability to keep their home. This is especially true in high cost areas of the country, like California, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, where statutory loan limits have eliminated federal housing programs as an option to purchase entry-level homes. 
   Under the current loan limits, FHA products have become unavailable for homebuyers in high cost areas of the country because the maximum mortgage limit is lower than housing prices. Families who need and qualify for FHA have been unable to participate in the program due to these geographic barriers. 
   The median home prices in high cost areas, like my district in southern California, is well above the GSE conforming loan limit of $417,000. A starter home for a family in Los Angeles, for example, usually puts a buyer into the so-called ``jumbo'' loan market. Jumbo loan premiums add hundreds of dollars onto a monthly payment for a fixed rate loan. Thus, many moderate income families have been priced out of a home loan by virtue of where they live and work. 
   Housing experts predict that the number of foreclosures that have occurred over the last year may double in the next 2 years as more adjustable rate mortgages with low introductory rates reset at significantly higher levels. By increasing the conforming loan limits, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHA program will have the ability to put affordable home purchases and refinancing options within reach of more moderate-income families. 
   Chairman Frank and I have been working for many years to create affordable housing opportunities for families across the country by increasing the conforming loan limits. Many communities in America are being underserved by the GSEs and FHA, because home prices in these areas surpass the national loan limit. I am pleased we are addressing this disparity in the legislation before us today and hope that the Senate also supports this critical change. 
   In addition to providing much needed liquidity to the struggling mortgage market, increasing the conforming loan limit will make safe, conforming mortgage loans available for homebuyers across the country and reduce aggressive lending practices that have contributed to the current credit and housing crisis. 
   Foreclosure rates are rising with harmful effects for borrowers, lenders, the neighborhood, and our overall economy. As we continue to experience instability in the housing market, this important change will be essential for successful homeownership. There is no more important priority for Congress than helping to keep families in their homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support of this resolution, which expresses the commitment of Congress to fostering increased homeownership opportunities in this country. 
   Earlier this month, President Bush designated June as National Homeownership Month, as he has done for the past 6 years. 
   I introduced H. Res. 477 to complement this designation and to elevate the discussion of housing opportunities in this Nation. This resolution conveys the support of the House for the goals and ideals of National Homeownership Month and reiterates the importance of homeownership in the United States. 
   I would like to thank the leadership on both sides of the aisle for bringing this important resolution to the floor today.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to restrict funding in this bill from being used to conduct the San Gabriel River Watershed and Mountains Special Resource Study in certain cities within my Congressional district and one neighboring city. 
   The difference between my amendment and the other amendments, everybody's been trying to strike funding in somebody else's district. I'm saying, don't spend it in my district. 
   This amendment is simple. It only affects communities within my district who do not want to be subject to a Federal National Park Service study. 
   I appreciated Mr. Dicks' support of this amendment last year when the House passed it by voice vote and urge the House continued support of this amendment. 
   In 2003, Congress authorized the National Park Service Watershed and Mountains Special Resource Study to survey the San Gabriel River and its tributaries and the San Gabriel Mountains, north of and including the city of Santa Fe Springs to determine if any resources are available to National Park Service designation. 
   Let me be clear. My district is not in the San Gabriel Mountains nor does it contain tributaries, and it is not north of Santa Fe Springs. It is east of this area that is authorized to be studied. 
   I did not oppose the original authorization of this study because, according to my interpretation of the language, my district would not be affected. However, it appears that the NPS has interpreted this language too broadly. 
   I strongly believe that the inclusion of cities in my district in the NPS study went beyond the scope of the Congressional authorization. 
   Several cities have contacted me and the National Park Service in extreme opposition to their inclusion in this special resource study. I have reached out to the NPS on numerous occasions to ask them to remove these cities from the study. They have refused. 
   I come to the floor today to ask that you support efforts to ensure that cities are not forced to be part of a study that was not intended to include them. 
   This amendment does not affect any other city in the study other than those in my district (plus the City of Industry) that have asked to be excluded. If other Members want their cities to continue to be included in the study, then the amendment will not affect them. 
   The bottom line is that I represent these cities, and they have told me they do not want to be included in this study. 
   The cities in the 42nd Congressional District, which I represent, have worked hard to address the challenges associated with rapid pace of growth in our region, including finding innovative solutions to manage future development, alleviate traffic congestion and preserve open space. 
   These cities are in the best position to make decisions regarding land use within their boundaries, and I am opposed to any Federal action that may compromise the local authority in the future. 
   The results of the study could ultimately be used to compromise the ability of local governments to decide what is best for their communities. Land management responsibilities and decision making should be made at the local level where officials have a clear understanding of community needs. 
   Existing land-use management by local municipalities is preferable to Federal involvement in a rapidly growing region. 
   I urge my colleagues to support my efforts to protect the communities that I represent by removing them from this study. A vote in favor of this amendment is a vote for local control and against Federal intervention where it is not welcomed or needed. 
   Once again, I ask my colleagues to support this simple, straightforward amendment to ensure the Federal Government does not reach beyond congressional intent.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Just so that we make sure the record is straight, and I appreciate your courtesy and your time and I do understand the situation you're in. 
   When Mr. Pombo made that statement, it was accurate because he came to me and I said, is my district included in this area; and they said, no, it would not be. And based on that understanding I said, well, then, I support what she's doing because if she wants to do it in her district, I have no problem with that. Then after the fact, when the amendment came last year and we agreed to it, Mr. Pombo also said that he did not believe my district should have been in there originally. 
   But I understand your situation. I understand your courtesy, and all I can do is ask for support of my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller).

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, the Moving to Work program has enabled Public Housing Authorities, PHAs, to create jobs for residents, add affordable housing stock, and help families build savings. Such efforts have gained recognition as being very successful in serving more families and helping recipients to self-sufficiency. The innovation and flexibility of the Moving to Work program helps more families realize self-sufficiency through locally oriented programs instead of HUD's one-size-fits-all approach. 
   Despite these benefits, only 24 of the more than 3,000 PHAs in the Nation are participating in the Moving to Work program. This amendment merely clarifies existing law in order to eliminate confusion at HUD about the number of PHAs authorized to be designated as Moving to Work. Congress has authorized 32 PHAs to participate in the Moving to Work program. Despite this clear intent to have 32 PHAs be designated as Moving to Work, due to what I view as a misinterpretation at HUD, there are only 24 agencies that are currently allowed to participate in the Moving to Work program. Once PHAs leave the Moving to Work program, HUD has said that no new agencies can be selected to fill their vacancies. 
   This simple and straightforward amendment would clarify Congress's intent to require HUD to implement Moving to Work at its fully authorized level. The amendment directs the Secretary of HUD to promptly approve new PHAs to participate in the Moving to Work program whenever the number of agencies is less than the total number and level we have authorized at 32. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Does the chairman plan on opposing this amendment?

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I ask to engage the chairman of Transportation and HUD in another colloquy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have serious concerns about the administration's proposal to increase the Federal Housing Administration's multifamily mortgage insurance premium by 35 percent for fiscal year 2008. 
   The administration proposed a similar increase last year, and rescinded it after hearing from Members of Congress and those in the industry most affected. I believe we again do not have sufficient information about the impact of this proposal on affordable rental housing for American workforces. 
   The chairman of the Financial Services Committee Mr. Frank and I are currently circulating a letter to HUD among our colleagues opposing the increase in the premium. As of Monday, we have 106 Members of Congress on record opposing the increase. A similar letter sent to HUD was recently signed by 38 Senators. 
   We believe an increase in the premium will impact the communities where housing would be built as well as tenants in those projects. HUD needs to perform a full assessment of the likely impact of such a premium increase on the volume of multifamily rental housing development, and the consequential effects of higher financing costs on rents to be borne by moderate-income residents. 
   This thorough assessment of the potential adverse effects of the proposed premium increase needs to be submitted to the appropriate congressional committees, giving Congress the opportunity to evaluate the proposal. This would need to happen before allowing the increase to go into effect by simple notice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to prevent HUD from implementing a new rule that will effectively close homeownership opportunity to many American families. 
   In today's housing market, one of the primary barriers to achieving the dream of homeownership is the lack of accumulated wealth and disposable income. Fortunately, some nonprofit organizations have developed programs to provide down payments to qualifying families. Such programs empower individuals and families who lack the necessary funds for down payment and other related costs, but can afford the monthly mortgage payment to become homeowners. 
   These down payment assistance programs have proven successful in expanding ownership opportunity to low- and moderate-income families. In the past, HUD has permitted the use of these programs in conjunction with FHA-insured loans. Recently, however, HUD issued a proposed rule that would effectively eliminate seller-funded down payment assistance programs. 
   I am very concerned about the impact of this proposed rule on homeownership in this country. Rather than going too far, I believe we should develop reasonable and fair criteria by which these programs can continue to operate while also protecting the FHA insurance fund. If there are legitimate problems that have been identified by HUD, then let's work together to fix the problems. 
   The amendment I offer today with Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee Chairman Waters and Mr. Al Green of Texas would prohibit funds from being used to implement this proposed rule. It would give Congress time to work with HUD to preserve down payment assistance programs while imposing strong regulations and oversight. This amendment will would allow us to put the control in place that will weed out the bad actors, while still allowing those who help millions become homeowners to continue their good work. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to preserve homeownership opportunities for all Americans. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I respect my good friend's argument on behalf of Treasury and HUD; however, I want to remind my colleagues that it has been just a few years ago that Treasury and HUD came to us and asked us to implement the American Dream Down Payment Assistance Act, which means the Federal Government will give individuals the down payment and closing cost money necessary to be able to own a home that otherwise they would never be able to own a home where they can make the payment. 
   The argument made to us is the private sector is doing it. We can implement upon what the private sector is doing, and with the government's participation, we can put even more people into homes.     
   Now, if we have a problem as some say with appraisals that are not being factual enough, then let's implement the same underwriting criteria that FHA will use on zero downpayment and FHA uses on the American Dream Downpayment Act. If you can come up with a reasonable appraisal to give Federal dollars to somebody to buy a home, why can you not come up with the same criteria for a reasonable appraisal to help the private sector put people into homes? 
   Mr. Green made a very good point. We put a million people into homes with the Downpayment Assistance Program provided by the private sector, and the argument made in committee was 15 percent of these loans that were made are troubled. Now, that does not mean that 15 percent are being foreclosed upon. That means 15 percent might have missed a payment at one point in time or had some other problem at some other point in time. 
   But on the other side, you have 850,000 people, families who own a home today, who built up equity they would not have otherwise have had renting a home and now have a home that had it not been for the private sector would have been renting an apartment or be in section 8 or in government housing. 
   If that 15 percent relates to 4 or 5 percent in foreclosures, and if that 4 or 5 percent has something to do with underwriting standards being used that do not meet the criteria they should meet, or if appraisals are being implemented that do not meet the criteria they should meet, let's get together as a Congress first in committee, let's deal with the problems and rewrite the law and bring it before this House and debate it, and let's make sure that the bad apples and those that my friend said are practicing scam practices are eliminated. 
   But to think that we are going to eliminate the possibility in the next 4 or 5 years for a million families to own a home, or have them come to the Federal Government and ask for a downpayment when they could also go to the private sector and ask for a downpayment, it seems some way disingenuous and unrealistic for us to do that. If there is a problem, let's fix it. If FHA can offer a zero downpayment loan under given underwriting criteria, and we use the same underwriting criteria for a downpayment assistance loan and the person owes $200,000 with zero downpayment and $194,000 with the downpayment assistance, they are better off with the program. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Gary G. Miller). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to say I absolutely support free market principles. I have no interest in bailing out Wall Street. I think that we need to reduce the size of government, and I believe that government intervention should not occur. 
   But this is not a normal situation. I have not seen anything like this. I wasn't around during the Great Depression, but having read about it, I have not seen anything like this in our financial services industry since then. 
   Banks are not lending to banks, and if banks don't lend to banks, the access to credit in the private sector really is going to dry up, because if they won't lend to each other, they are not going to want to lend to the private sector. 
   Small businesses in this country are starting to hurt now. I spoke to a friend I have known for over 30 years who is a contractor who works for a very large company, and the company doesn't know right now, the employees, that many are going to get laid off, because their lines of credit have been dramatically reduced, and without credit in this country, it is going to have an impact on businesses, and if businesses are impacted, they are not the bad people, they are the ones who provide jobs in this country. 
   This bill, I will say, is not perfect, but there are not many options we have today, and the last thing we can afford to do is do nothing and let the system start to crumble. 
   Small people, I say ``small'' because they are not business people, they are trying to work for a living, and I take the word ``small'' back, average people out there who are just working for a living and trying to make ends meet, supporting their families and paying their bills, they are the ones that are going to get hurt. This is not to bail out a bunch of fat cats on Wall Street. The people who made their money two or three years ago, they made their money. You can't impact that. We can change things in the future to change the law to make sure people are protected and their investments are protected and people don't take advantage of the system, and that has to happen. 
   Now, this bill has grown in size, but much of it has to do with tax extenders. It is not pork. When you are talking about allowing child tax credits to continue, like we have in the past, the alternative minimum tax patch to continue, research and development tax credit, teacher expense deductions, those things have been added to this bill and the bill has absolutely grown in size. 
   But let's not lose the focus on what we are trying to do here today. The thing we are trying to do is stabilize the economy, not bail out individual businesses; make sure the economy can continue to run, people can work and businesses can operate. That is why I am rising in support of this bill and ask for an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 1199, a resolution congratulating the Orange County Water District on its 75th anniversary. The Orange County Water District and its employees have effectively delivered innovative groundwater management, water quality, water efficiency, and environmental programs which will reduce our region's dependence on imported water. 
   We all know that with increased demand, decreased availability of imported water, and higher water quality requirements, future water supplies will become even more limited and expensive. If we want to sustain southern California's economic growth and provide for a rapidly increasing population, we must ensure efficient and reliable access to water resources and pursue a modernized sanitation infrastructure. The Orange County Water District recognized that we needed a reliable source of quality water and has pursued multi-pronged strategies for capturing and recycling water that would otherwise flow downstream to the ocean. 
   The first initiative involves a series of agreements between the Orange County Water District, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to allow the District to conserve water behind Prado Dam. This water, which would otherwise flow downstream to the ocean, is captured to recharge the local aquifer. In addition, the Orange County Water District has partnered with the Orange County Sanitation District in the development of the groundwater replenishment system. This system will take highly treated sewer water and treat it above and beyond existing drinking water standards by undergoing an advanced purification process that includes two membrane filtration and treatment by ultraviolet light and hydrogen peroxide. Once purified, the water will be sent to groundwater recharge facilities or injection wells. This project is a model of self-reliance and should be replicated throughout water districts around southern California. 
   The Orange County Water District is working to ensure water reliability for generations to come. This is a comforting thought to businesses as well as residents interested in moving to Orange County. Their efforts will allow our economy to grow without being restrained by potential water shortages. 
   I congratulate the Orange County Water District for their 75 years of service to the region and I am proud of the Federal, State, and local agencies that have worked together to serve the community and address the region's growing water needs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, as Chairman Frank said, I have yet to talk to a Member who wants to have to vote on this today. This is probably the toughest vote any of us have taken since we have been in Congress. And if you just solely rely on the telephone calls we are getting from home and listen to people who really don't understand the complexity of our marketplace and what we are trying to deal with here, the easiest vote for you to make would be a ``no'' vote today. But you have to go beyond that. You have to say what happens to the family next week who wants to buy a house and they can't get a loan? What happens to the family next week who wants to get a car loan and they can't get a car loan? Or they want to send their kids to the university and they go to get a student loan, and there are no loans available? 
   And right now when the marketplace is running as it is, people say, well,  that is not likely to happen. But if you look at the systemic problem we have in the marketplace, there is a probability that it could happen. 
   Now we can roll dice today. We can say, let's not vote, and let's hope everything goes okay. And for Members, it's a very difficult situation. They say, if I vote for this bill and the bill passes and the marketplace does not crash and it continues and it improves, people are going to be mad at me because I voted to continue the process they think is bad. If you vote ``no'' on this bill and we have a crash in the marketplace and illiquidity occurs and people go to get loans, the businessman who normally relies on his loans to make payroll, he goes to the bank and the bank says, like the bank said to McDonald's, we will no longer fund expansion of McDonald's, which is the largest fast-food chain in the United States, when that occurs, then the Member has to say, what is the consequence to voting ``no'' for this bill? So it's almost a catch-22. You're darned if you do, and you're darned if you don't. 
   There are some things in this bill that I think should have happened earlier. We are having mark-to-market that deals specifically with assets banks have to hold that are devalued. Chairman Bernanke said last week, accounting rules require banks to value many assets at something close to very low fire-sale prices rather than at hold-to-maturity prices, which is not unreasonable in its given face of illiquidity. Banks are forced today to write down the value of the assets they have and set huge reserves aside for losses they have already taken. 
   The bad thing about this, I put language into the housing bill in April as an amendment. It came out of this House and went to the Senate. When the bill came back from the Senate, that language mysteriously disappeared. We could have done that then and perhaps not be quite in the situation we're in today. 
   The subprime marketplace that people are angry about today, the subprime marketplace is a good marketplace. But when you mix predatory lending in the market, it's bad. When you make loans to people when a trigger kicks in in the interest rate that they cannot make, you have committed a predatory loan. We should have defined that in law 4 or 5 years ago. But we did not. 
   If you look at the rates of interest today, they have been held down so low that the euro in recent years has increased in value dramatically, and the result of commodity prices in the U.S. is that oil, grain, coal, metal, and currency premiums are basically suffering a 20 to 30 percent hit. 
   If you look at the marketplace today, the declining home prices we've had out there today, and the subprime loans that they're going to be buying, they are going to be buying them at 40 percent of market value. And if you look at what is happening on the prime loans, which are good loans, they are only worth 90 percent of market value. 
   Members today need to look at what we're doing. Are we going to change the market or are we going to let the market continue to decline and roll dice and say perhaps nothing will happen? I think there is something we need to do in the coming months that really bothers me that is not in this bill. I think we need to look at public-private partnerships involving local communities, investors, in these assets we buy and basically maximizing the benefit and the value of these assets. If we involve the local people in what we're doing here, they will put their assets with the assets of the Federal Government, increasing the benefit to the marketplace and ensuring that the yield to these investments will produce a profit. What we don't want to have happen is like what happened during the savings and loan debacle where assets were bought by the Federal Government, dumped on the marketplace at low prices, calling the market to continually decline farther than it had currently done, and end up with a worse problem than we face. 
   Members need to look at what we're doing today. Some Members have worked very, very hard to come up with a compromise package that we believe is not pleasing either side. The Democrats are not happy. The Republicans are not happy. But it is something that is going to work. We need to look at that. We need to weigh our conscience for what is best for our community and what is best for our country. And we need to vote what is right for this Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I rise in strong support of this bill. I'd like to commend Chairman Barney Frank and Ranking Member Bachus and Subcommittee Chairman Maxine Waters and Ranking Member Judy Biggert for their hard work. This has been a long time coming. 
   If you watch what the Federal Reserve is doing today, they're injecting short-term dollars into the marketplace trying to stabilize the marketplace. But what the marketplace and housing needs today is long-term dollars and revenues to ensure that people can own a home and get a long-term loan and pay that back. 
   When I talk to brokers and lenders in my district, it is clear that the FHA program as currently structured has not kept pace. In the past, moderate-income home buyers who could not qualify for conventional loans because of high loan to value ratios or high payment to income ratios could still achieve the dream of homeownership through the FHA program. 
   Today, the FHA program is no longer a useful product to home buyers. Instead, working families are faced with a situation where they are either unable to own a home, or they're forced to resort to a risky loan product that might make their ability to keep the home difficult. 
   With all this occurring in the subprime market, FHA reform is more critical today than ever. The need for this legislation is immediate. 
   Many times exotic products such as interest-only loans, negative amortizations are the only options available to working families to achieve homeownership. This is because the FHA program became virtually irrelevant for many home buyers. 
   Not only can the bill before us today provide a viable alternative for families seeking to purchase a home, but it can also help families facing uncertainty about being able to keep their current home. 
   The bottom line is to make the FHA program a viable mortgage option, we must ensure that the program's products are available across the country and they meet the needs of borrowers. This includes not only eliminating the geographic barriers to utilization of the program in high-cost areas, but also facilitating the purchase of entry-level homes, including condos and manufactured housing. 
   These forms of housing are an affordable option for entry-level home buyers, and they should be included under this program if we truly want to help families climb the first rung on the ladder of homeownership. 
   In addition to reforming what can be purchased under the program, we must also improve the competitiveness of the FHA product among the mortgage options available. In other words, we must address the problems in FHA programs that cause it not to be utilized when it is an available mortgage product for the potential home buyer. 
   The answer is that the program in flexibility and burdensome processes have left many in the industry hesitant or, in the case of mortgage brokers, unable to offer FHA products. 
   The legislation before us today includes a number of reforms to make the FHA program relevant in today's marketplace. For example, today's mortgage brokers originate the majority of mortgage loans and, therefore, provide HUD with the most available and efficient distribution channel to bring the FHA loan products to the marketplace. 
   While mortgage brokers originate the majority of loans, many are not able to offer FHA products because of the cost-prohibitive and time-consuming financial audit and net worth requirements. This effectively leaves subprime loan products as the only option for many borrowers who would otherwise qualify for an FHA. 
   Now, let me say the subprime market is extremely beneficial and it needs to be relevant. But today you have many predators in that marketplace that are making loans to people that they know they cannot repay. The bill before us today includes language to replace FHA's net worth and audit requirement with a surety bond to allow more mortgage brokers to offer FHA products. This will ensure that the home buyers are given the option of a FHA product when they seek the services of a mortgage broker. 
   I would like to say a word about the affordable housing fund included in this bill. While I opposed a similar fund when it was attached to the GSE reform bill, I want my colleagues to know that I support this fund because an amendment I offered at the markup was accepted by Chairman Frank to essentially say, and these are arguments that have been made against this, that the HUD must ensure that FHA insurance premiums are, one, as low as possible; two, that the insurance fund is solvent; and, three, that any FHA needs are met before excess dollars are sent to the housing fund. Virtually it says that FHA has the dollars, they will use the dollars, and when it's not needed, then those dollars will be forwarded to the fund.     
   After that I firmly believe that the FHA funds should be dedicated to housing. We do this for the highway fund when we charge a gas tax. Those taxes are dedicated to repairing our roads and highways in this country. We should do this with the FHA too. The FHA money we are talking about is money that currently is going to the treasury. 
   Now more than ever Congress must pass FHA legislation so that we can remove the impediments to the utilization of the FHA and ensure that it once again helps working families across the country so that they have an opportunity to achieve and maintain homeownership. This is an important reform that will help many families avoid foreclosures. 
   Most of the people, and I would say, all the organizations in the industry who are looking to help people who are in trouble today support this bill. They also support the GSE reform bill that we put forward because it does one thing: It provides long-term stability and liquidity to the marketplace. The goal of this bill is to ease the burdensome problems people are facing today. They are looking at losing their homes. We are saying let's provide long-term liquidity and help them maintain their homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I'm rising asking for strong support of this amendment, so it's not really in opposition to the amendment. 
   This bill, and this amendment, particularly, is to encourage the FHA program and products and make sure they're available across this country to help working families to achieve and maintain homeownership through the FHA program. 
   The bill we are considering here today reforms the FHA single-family mortgage insurance program so that we can reach working families it was created to serve. I don't think there is any question that the FHA program, as currently structured, has not kept pace. 
   Today, FHA is no longer a useful product to prospective home buyers. The problem is that statutory limitations preclude the FHA from adopting a rapidly changing marketplace that we experience today. 
   As the private sector mortgage markets become more efficient, the FHA program's inflexible rules and requirements left it virtually irrelevant as a financing option. Under the current limitations, FHA products are not available for home buyers in high-cost areas of the country because the maximum loan limits are so much lower than the median home prices in that area. 
   We did something very similar to this when we did the GSE in the high-cost areas. And the only people arguing against raising this conforming loan limit to high-cost areas were those whose home median prices fell far lower than the median amount they were able to loan on. If your median home area is 200,000 and it isn't 435, you don't care. But in California and other areas, it is quite the opposite. 
   Now California's drop in FHA volumes have been nothing short of stunning. In 2000, FHA insured 109,074 mortgages in California, but last year it only insured 5,137. In my district, FHA insured 7,000 mortgages in 2000 and only 80 mortgages in 2005. These figures represent a 99 percent drop in what FHA is able to loan in these high-cost areas. That in and of itself states that there is a huge problem that this amendment is trying to cover and create the shortfall that currently exists in the program. Arguably, working families in high-cost areas of the country are just the kind of underserved populations the FHA program was originally intended to serve. 
   If we want to ensure that FHA is relevant for all those who need it, we must reform the program so it is available to low- and moderate-income families across the country, even those in high-cost areas. 
   On August 31, the President announced his goal to help an estimated 240,000 families avoid foreclosures by enhancing the FHA program. Under the President's plan, FHA will allow families with strong credit histories who have been making timely mortgage payments before their loan reset, but are now in default, to qualify for refinancing. Unfortunately, without an increase in the loan limits, this program will not help families in high-cost areas. 
   This amendment, supported by Mr. Frank, Mr. Cardoza and myself, would make sure that families can refinance in the FHA products by raising the FHA single-family loan limits in each local area to the lower of 125 percent of the area median home price, or 175 percent of the national GSE conforming loan amendments. 
   The amendment also gives HUD authority to raise these loan limit amounts by up to $100,000 ``if market conditions warrant.'' 
   The NAHB, National Association of Home Builders, has written a very strong letter in support of what we are trying to do. Many builders are selling homes today, and the problem they have is the person buying their home cannot find financing to sell their home. And this will help those people who are looking for financing and dealing with liquidity shortages in the marketplace. 
   The National Association of Realtors has also written a very strong letter supporting what we're trying to do today. The problem they're facing today with people in the mortgage bracket that we're trying to deal with in this amendment, this will go a long way to providing liquidity and competition in the marketplace to ensure that American home buyers and families have the best and most opportunities that can be achieved through the marketplace through this amendment. So this is a very good amendment, and I would ask for an ``aye'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 1852, the Expanding American Homeownership Act of 2007. 
   My amendment would allow qualified down payment assistance providers to participate in the FHA program if certain conditions are satisfied to ensure that the down payment assistance program is legitimate and that the gift that is provided to the homeowner and the home buyer is truly a gift. 
   One of the primary barriers for many Americans to achieving the dream of homeownership is the lack of accumulated wealth and disposable income required to come up with the down payment and closing costs needed to purchase a home. While they can afford monthly payments, some families have not been able to accumulate enough to cover down payment and closing costs. 
   Fortunately, some charitable organizations have developed programs to help provide down payments to families that would qualify for the mortgage for the FHA program but for the lack of cash for a down payment. These down payment assistance programs have been successful in expanding homeownership opportunity for millions of families. The private sector has been working without government intervention to assist individuals and families who lack the necessary funds for down payments and other related costs become home buyers. In fact, Congress looked at the success of these  programs when it created the American Dream Downpayment Act, a government program passed in 2003 to provide up to $10,000 in down payment and closing cost assistance to first-time home buyers. 
   Similarly, H.R. 1852, the bill you are reviewing today, authorizes HUD to allow zero down payment FHA loans for home buyers who could not otherwise make the down payment required under the FHA rule. 
   In the past, HUD has permitted the use of charitable down payment assistance programs in conjunction with FHA insured loans. Recently, however, HUD issued a proposed rule that would effectively eliminate many legitimate down payment assistance providers from assisting in FHA programs. 
   We are hearing that just last week HUD sent a rule over to OMB for final approval. I am very concerned about the impact of this proposed rule on homeownership in our country. 
   Rather than going too far by eliminating all down payment assistance providers, all that is really needed is a reasonable and fair criteria by which these programs can continue to operate while also protecting the FHA insurance fund. If there are legitimate problems that have been identified by HUD, then we should absolutely fix these problems. In fact, the full House has agreed that we should strengthen the rules for down payment assistance providers rather than eliminate them completely from the FHA program. 
   In July, the House unanimously passed an amendment I offered with Housing and Community Opportunity Subcommittee Chairman Waters and Representative Al Green to the Transportation-HUD appropriations bill, which prohibited HUD from taking any action to issue its final rule or otherwise implement all or any part of the proposed rule. 
   The amendment prevented HUD from finalizing or implementing the rule to end participation of down payment assistance providers in the FHA program. Our argument, then, was that HUD's proposal was too harsh a step and we would work to include language in the FHA bill to fix the problems that HUD has identified with some down payment assistance providers. 
   This is what my amendment before you today seeks to do. The amendment I offer today is a followup on our work during the THUD bill to put the brakes on the HUD rule and instead address the problem HUD has identified with certain down payment assistance providers. This amendment would put the controls in place to weed out the bad actors while allowing those who help millions become homeowners continue to do the good work they are doing. Unlike the HUD rule, my amendment would preserve the down payment assistance programs' participation in FHA while ensuring they are legitimate and helpful to the home buyers. 
   As you know, H.R. 1582 already includes language to end the practice of inflated appraisals, which was a key argument HUD used against the down payment assistance programs. My amendment builds on this provision and says that down payment assistance providers may participate in FHA so long as the down payment they are offering is truly a gift; in other words, that it reduces the amount owed on the home. My amendment also imposes a net worth requirement on such providers to alleviate the quality and quantity involved within the activity. This provision specifically responds to HUD's complaints regarding the plethora of small, fly-by-night operators that open up and that close down on a regular basis to avoid regulatory scrutiny. Many of these groups are starting business one day, getting involved in things they should not, and closing down immediately. 
   These three improvements to the current situation, number one, prohibiting inflated appraisals; two, ensuring DPA providers offer an actual gift; and three, imposing a net worth requirement, will weed out the bad actors while not prohibiting all down payment assistance providers from participating in FHA, as the HUD proposal would have done. 
   With limited resources at the Federal level, Congress viewed the American Dream Downpayment Act as a complement, rather than a replacement, to the tremendous work down payment assistance providers were already doing to help build communities. There are simply not enough resources at the Federal level to do this alone. 
   To address HUD's concerns, we should implement the same underwriting criteria that would be used on the new zero down payment program within FHA and what HUD already uses on the American Dream Downpayment Act. 
   If we have come up with a reasonable system of underwriting to give Federal dollars to assist a family in buying a home, then we can certainly use the same criteria to allow the private sector to put forth people and moneys in these programs to allow people to own their homes. 
   If FHA can offer a zero down payment loan under a given underwriting criteria, as proposed by this bill, then the private sector down payment assistance programs should also certainly be subject to this same criteria. 
   To eliminate the possibility for a million families to own a home through down payment assistance providers but allow them to use the Federal Government for a down payment grant seems contradictory. If it works for the Federal program, then it should work for the private sector alternative, as well. 
   My amendment addresses the problems with certain down payment assistance providers that HUD has identified. Rather than eliminating all providers, as the HUD rule attempts to do, it puts the protections in place to ensure the home buyers are getting a legitimate helping hand from these charitable entities. 
   Madam Chairman, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Chairman, I want to thank Maxine Waters for her kind comments. I remember when we were debating the American Dream Down Payment Assistance Act, and we used the private sector down payment assistance program as the tool and the argument to expand upon and have government also get involved. These private sector groups have put over 1 million people in homes that could not otherwise be in homes. 
   This continues a program that has worked very well and eliminates the bad actors that HUD is talking about. I think if this is implemented, this bill will be a very strong bill, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. 
   A lot of people are losing their home in this country. In fact, in California, 500 families or more lose their home every day. And that not only hurts them, but the neighbors around them. Because of foreclosure, their home value drops weekly. 
   I don't support government bailouts. I consider this bill we're dealing with here far from a government bailout. If you look at the situation people are in today, people are suffering from shrinking paychecks, other things go wrong in their life. But this loan is the most expensive FHA loan you will get. 
   Normally, a person can go to get an FHA loan, put 3 percent down, and the government will basically be guaranteeing 97 percent financing. Under this loan, the lender has to be willing to take 85 percent of current market value. Let me explain that so it makes it understandable to most people. 
   Let's say you bought a house for $580,000. The first trustee gets $5,000, but current market value is $400,000 for that house. The people are upside down, they can't make the payment, it is going into foreclosure. The lender has an opportunity to allow another lender to buy them out with an FHA loan guarantee, and they're willing to take $340,000 for a loan they have that the market today is $400,000, and the new loan against that house will be $360,000. Now, that sounds really good. And we say the person is going to make a lot of money, it's a bailout. But this is really more like a joint venture. And I don't think CBO even scores this portion. If you sell the home the first year, we either get 3 percent of the loan amount or 100 percent of the profit on the home, whichever is greater. If they sell the second year, we either get  3 percent, or 80 percent of the profit, whichever is greater. The third year, 60 percent. And if you hold it for 30 years and you sell that home, FHA gets 50 percent of the profit on that home. 
   Now, I don't know how most people look at it, but that's the worst FHA loan you can get. It's not a bailout, but it's enabling a person who's losing their home and a lender who says, well, if I foreclose it on $400,000, I might get $380,000, $390,000. And what does that do to a neighborhood? That home that originally sold for $580,000, now the market value for that home in that neighborhood is now $380,000, $390,000 or $400,000. 
   This is more like a refi. It doesn't impact the value of the homes in the community. It basically helps a person get in position where they can retain ownership of their hone. And they're not going to make a windfall profit for it. 
   I would like to thank the chairman for introducing language in this bill that I worked on for 5 years, and that's raising conforming home limits in high-cost areas. Basically, Freddie and Fannie and FHA, in high-cost areas, you can borrow a maximum of a $730,000 loan from them today. The biggest problem we've had in the marketplace in recent years is people have been forced into jumbo loans. If you look at a GSE loan, that's Freddie and Fannie, compared to a jumbo loan today, you can generally save about 100 basis points in interest rates. That's a huge amount of payment a person can save each year, enable a person to be able to put away money in the future for house payments if times get tough and basically own their own home. 
   Some people have said they don't trust the Refinance Program Oversight Board because they don't have any idea what the Board is going to implement as far as criteria to qualify for this loan. I have a problem believing that we can't trust the Secretary of Treasury, the Secretary of HUD and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to come up with criteria based on income, assets, liability, payment history, other criteria, debt-to-income ratio. If we can't trust those three individuals to come up with a reasonable criteria under which this loan is made, I think we're in trouble in this country. 
   The problem some people have is FHA exists. FHA loans are made today, and FHA is guaranteeing, through insurance premiums, these loans. Now, a normal FHA insured premium costs a borrower .55 percent per year, about half a percent. Under this new program, they have to pay 1.5 percent per year to FHA to underwrite this guarantee. That's far from a giveaway. I can't see anything in this FHA loan that's a giveaway. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. (CIVIL WAR BATTLEFIELD PRESERVATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to express the importance of H.R. 2933, a bill to reauthorize the Civil War Battlefields Preservation Program. I would like to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young of the Committee on Natural Resources for shepherding this bill through their committee. Additionally, Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, Public Lands must be recognized for their work preserving the American landscape for generations of future citizens to enjoy. Additionally, I would like to particularly thank everyone at the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Trust, especially their President, James Lighthizer, for all the work they have done bringing attention and awareness to the need for preservation. Without the Trust, hundreds of acres of land would likely be lost forever. 
   Preservation of our Nation's Civil War Battlefields is an issue that I hold close to my heart and fresh in my mind. Without a physical link to the past, we are left with only a passing glimpse of who we are as a Nation. 
   Our historic battlefields provide outdoor classrooms for visitors to recreate the history of heroes from generations come and gone. In 1993, the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission, a blue-ribbon panel was created by Congress to investigate the status of America's battlefields. The Commission reported that 384 Civil War battlefields were considered high priority and were in serious danger of destruction. The report concluded that almost 20 percent of the Civil War battlefields were lost or fragmented, 17 percent in poor condition, and 60 percent to have been lost or in imminent danger of being fragmented and lost as coherent historic sites. Congress recognized the need to safeguard the only living link to the ``War Between the States'' and in fiscal year 1999 a preservation program was financed for the first time. 
   In 2002, I authored the bill that created the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program. To date, this program has helped save more than 15,000 acres in 14 States. The American Battlefield Protection Program, an arm of the National Park Service, manages and competitively awards the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Program grants. Furthermore, this legislation will facilitate the creation of partnerships at the State and local level, encouraging the private sector to preserve, conserve, and enhance nationally significant Civil War battlefields. 
   The program's 50/50 matching grants formula encourages both public and private sector investment in battlefield protection. Grants are directed to State and local governments for land acquisition only and are not issued to nonprofit or private groups. Grant money cannot be used for administrative costs or overhead. 
   The grants are awarded based on five requirements: (1) The battlefield must be on the list of 384 priority sites determined by the Civil War Sites Advisory Commission; (2) The land must be outside the authorized boundaries of the National Park System, thus keeping the program from contributing to National Park Service maintenance costs; (3) Any land acquired with the assistance of the grant program may not be subsequently converted to a non-conservation use without the prior written permission of the Secretary of the Interior; (4) Any grant awarded must be supported by an appraisal of the property's value in accordance with federal standards for property appraisals; and (5) Any land acquired with the assistance of the grant program must be protected by a perpetual easement to ensure its preservation for future generations. 
   The effect of this program and intent of this legislation is to preserve nationally significant Civil War battlefields through conservation and purchases of those battlefields from willing sellers at fair market value. Preservation of historic battlefields involves only willing sellers when properties become available, and since only willing sellers are involved in the transaction, all private property rights are preserved. There is absolutely no eminent domain authority associated with this program. Willing sellers are compensated at fair-market value and the program allows preservation groups to compete with developers to buy land. 
   Among the sites saved as a result of this program are historic properties at: Fort Donelson, Tennessee, where the Union scored its first major victory of the war and Union General Ulysses S. Grant earned the nickname ``Unconditional Surrender''; Antietam, Maryland, where 23,000 soldiers were killed, marking the bloodiest day in American history and leading to the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation; and, Chancellorsville, Virginia, where a much smaller Confederate force defeated the larger Union force, while suffering the loss of the famed General Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson. 
   Despite the progress, we still have more to do. Many sites have only been partially preserved and those that have no opportunity for acquisition run the risk of being lost forever. Only about 20 percent of the actual battlefields upon which the Civil War was fought are currently preserved. All of the rest of that hallowed ground is either unprotected or has already been destroyed. 
   These battlefields offer a porthole to the past. The vivid imagery of an epic conflict can remind visitors of the struggles our country has gone through to preserve the banner of liberty and justice for all. Memorializing the conflict, Oliver Wendell Holmes said, ``We have shared the incommunicable experience of war. We felt, we still feel, the passion of life to its top. In our youths, our hearts were touched by fire.'' By preserving this Nation's historic Civil War Battlefields, we can give visitors a sense of what Mr. Holmes was talking about. 
   Since fiscal year 1999, Congress has appropriated $36 million to preserve Civil War Battlefields and the White House included a $4 million request for the program as part of its fiscal year 2009 budget. H.R. 2933 is a clean bill that would extend the authorization, from fiscal years 2009 through 2013 for battlefield preservation grants under the Civil War Battlefield Preservation Act of 2002. The program's necessity, and proof that the preservation of history is a bipartisan issue, is demonstrated by more than 100 cosponsors divided nearly equally between Republicans and Democrats. A companion bill, authored by Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, has already been approved by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and enjoys widespread support in that chamber. I thank the Speaker and I respectfully request and urge you to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman and Mr. Bachus for yielding me this time. 
   I know this has been an issue that they have been working on for years, the same as I have. For the last 3 years, this has been a focus for us dealing with this issue that has been impacting and in many ways very beneficial to the housing market. 
   I commend Chairman Frank and Secretary Paulson for their hard work to strike an agreement so we can move this important reform legislation forward. 
   We must provide for a strong regulator for the GSEs so that investors and the markets are assured that these companies are sound and that their investments in America's housing markets are safe. 
   This bill recognizes that strong regulation provides a means to achieve our ultimate goal of expanding supply of affordable mortgage credit throughout this Nation. 
   The goal in the process we have taken today is to preserve the mission while strengthening the authority of the regulator. We have been working on this issue for a number of years. Through this lengthy legislative process, I have asked my colleagues to be mindful that as we addressed deficiencies in GSE supervision, we must not lose sight of Congress's original intent that chartered the GSEs. The mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is to provide stability and on ongoing assistance to the secondary market for residential mortgages, and to promote access to mortgage credit and homeownership throughout the United States. 
   The bill before us today builds upon the bill that passed the House under the leadership of former Chairman Oxley in 2005. That bill passed by an overwhelming vote of 331-90. As I was looking back at the Record at that point in time, it surprised me that based on the comments made by the administration at that time, they are saying that the bill today creates a stronger regulator than the one we passed in 2005. 
   And I was surprised to read that the bill before us today, the administration, unlike the bill passed in 2005, which Treasury opposed then because it failed to provide a strong regulator that could protect the safety and soundness of the housing financial system, today the bill they say ``provides for a fully empowered, independent world-class regulator that can deal with any safety and soundness issue that might arise.'' I had no idea back at that time they opposed it; but I knew they supported it today. 
   The affordable housing fund, I vote repeatedly to strike that. I have never supported it. I didn't support it when Chairman Oxley put it in the original bill. I know many Members on my side oppose this. However, I continue to share the view of former Chairman Oxley that a stronger, more effective regulator of the housing GSEs is absolutely critical and outweighs our philosophical opposition to the fund. 
   I voted for that bill then, and I am going to vote for this bill tonight. This legislation provides for a strong regulator for the GSEs so that investors and the markets are assured that those companies are sound and an investment in the American housing markets are safe. 
   Improved regulation will provide a means to achieve our ultimate goal of expanding the supply of affordable mortgage credit across this country.  GSEs have been at the forefront of creating affordable housing opportunities for families, and we must ensure that they are successful in the future. 
   This bill does something that I am very supportive of, and I worked on for 3 or 4 years now. It deals with conforming loan limits in high-cost areas. If you happen to live in Hawaii, Alaska, Guam or the Virgin Islands, you can get a loan for 150 percent of conforming today. But if you live in a high-cost area of California or other parts of this country, you cannot. If you look at the benefit on the marketplace today, especially in California, we are having severe problems in the jumbo market area where the foreclosures and defaults are excessive, and I believe if the conforming marketplace were there today, we would have less problem than we are seeing today.     
   The foreclosure rates are out of control. If you look at the jumbo market in California, the problem we're facing is that only 18.1 percent of the jumbo loans that are made are fixed, 30-year loans; compared to conforming marketplace, 82 percent are fixed 30-year loans. In the jumbo marketplace, 34.9 percent of the jumbo loans are interest-only ARMs. 
   I thank you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I thank Mr. Hensarling for withdrawing the amendment, but I think it's only fair to place on the Record the other side of the argument. To assume there's only seven areas that benefit from this is a wrong assumption. 
   If you look at the current law, Guam, the Virgin Islands, Alaska and Hawaii all benefit from 150 percent of the amount conforming allows in the rest of this country. All we are saying in our high-cost area is saying aren't we as good as Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. 
   I have been working on this thing for 3 years, I asked that this be put in the bill. I didn't say let's do it like Alaska, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Hawaii. Let's not make it statewide. Let's go specifically to a region. You could have a situation where Brea, in Orange County, could qualify for $625,000; yet Pomona, within 8 miles, might only need $400,000. But it's easy to extract something from a bill that has no impact on you at all. 
   For example, the Dallas region that the gentleman represents, the median home price is $146,400. Yet, you can borrow $417,000 through a GSE, three times the amount of the median. 
   Yet, in Maxine Waters' district, which is four times the median, which is no fault of any of ours, it just happens to be $565,000, she can only borrow $418,000. In my part of Orange County, it's $695,000. I can only borrow $418,600. So we are saying if it is fair for other parts of the country, why isn't it far for all of the country. 
   Now had the gentleman had introduced an amendment that said, well, we think we should have fairness throughout the country, and let's limit it to the median as my amendment did, in this bill that got enacted in the bill so far, that says you can have it conforming, but it cannot exceed median. Well, the gentleman, I am sure, would have a very difficult time going home and telling his people that now they can only borrow $146,400 from Freddie and Fannie because that is the median we are willing to apply to the rest of our districts. 
   Now the argument was made in the past that while the people in these high-cost areas make more money, the median income in Dallas, Texas is $65,500; the median income L.A. County is $61,300. They make $400,000 or more a year in his district, that has a median income, median home price of $146,000. Yet in Maxine's and part of my area of L.A. county, people have to pay $565,000 for a median income home, and yet they make $4,000 less.  
   So, yes, in many cases it's easy to present something to a body and make a very good statement that you are concerned about the quality of a GSE. But let me state, based on the requirements and the restrictions placed upon the GSEs, these loans are very safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to strike the requirement that high-cost area loans be securitized. And what we have done in this bill is we have said that, in these high-cost areas, to eliminate concerns by many, we are willing to say that the GSE must securitize those loans in high-cost areas; so, therefore, they cannot keep those loans. Those loans have to be transferred to the bond market. And there is no concern nor could there ever be any risk to the GSE, because those loans are not being kept by the GSE. 
   Now, understand clearly that when a loan is made in Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and the Virgin Islands, they are not securitized, and it has not proven to be a risk or a problem so far at all. And if you look at the problems in the real estate market today, they are not in the conforming market at all; they are not even in the high-cost areas that complies with. They are in areas that are not available, such as the jumbo loan market in California and other areas. 
   I am going to withdraw this amendment, but I am making a statement that it is not fair that we try to provide fairness throughout this country, and yet in doing that we are creating a situation that is less fair to those high-cost areas than it is to the rest of the Nation. It is only fair that borrowers in high-cost areas should be able to get a loan through a GSE, that that loan be kept by a GSE, thereby reducing the cost to the person getting the loan. And the statement that there is only a statement of $25, in a high-cost area this saves a buyer $175 a month in payment or a loan through a GSE.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. (PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite word. 
   I rise in support of this amendment. The GSE regulator should have authority to limit the size and growth of a GSE portfolio, but specifically addressing safety and soundness are mission concerns with respect to the institution. This was clearly the intent of the language that was introduced within the bill, and this merely clarifies the language in this amendment. 
   This is a clarifying amendment, not a weakening of the regulator, and that needs to be clearly understood. The amendment mitigates concerns that the regulator could establish an overly broad scope in viewing possible risk to the portfolio. 
   The goal of this bill is to create a strong regulator. This bill creates that. But such an overly broad view could lead to unnecessary limits on the enterprise's portfolio activity to the detriment of the housing financing system. 
   The amendment would simply add three words, those are ``to the enterprise,'' to Factor 6 of section 115, so the language would read ``any potential risks posed to the enterprise by the nature of the portfolio holding.'' 
   Systemic risk can be considered by the regulator, it just must be in the context of safety and soundness and the mission of a GSE. The problems we are having in the housing market today are basically in the subprime and the jumbo market. The reason is because about 18.1 percent of those loans are fixed-rate, 30-year loans. If you look at the conforming marketplace, 82 percent is a fixed-rate, 30-year loan. 
   The problem in the marketplace is not GSEs in the conforming. The problem is in the subprime and jumbo. So you don't want a regulator to look at the problem in the marketplace and say let's limit the portfolio of a GSE, and restrict the only sector of the marketplace that is not having a high amount of defaults and foreclosures, to the detriment of the marketplace. 
   If you go back to the 1980s and the 1990s when this country was in a major  housing recession, if you went to a lender, it was almost impossible to get a loan if you did not comply with the conforming requirements. They would not make you a loan to build a house. And if you wanted to buy a house, it had to be based on the underwriting criteria of the conforming marketplace. Thereby, the lender could take and sell that loan off to the conforming market, which are the GSEs. 
   Lenders at that point in time were facing foreclosures and default rates and having to set aside reserves to deal with it. They did not have the assets to go make loans and hold those loans in their portfolios, because they were limited based on the defaults they currently had. But they would make loans that met the criteria of the GSEs and the conforming marketplaces. Thereby you could go get loans. 
   This amendment takes no authority out of the regulator's hands to address systemic risk related to safety and soundness or mission of the enterprise. But that is what we need to understand. If the enterprises' portfolio are properly regulated from the standpoint of safety and soundness, the issue of systemic risk becomes moot. Therefore, a broader scope of regulation of portfolios is overreaching and unnecessary in addressing this safety and soundness. 
   The House previously rejected systemic risk in an amendment in the 2005 bill by a vote of 73 to 346. At that point in the bill, in the 109th Congress, we wanted to make sure that systemic risk only applied within the GSEs, not something outside, and it was clearly defeated. We did the right thing. 
   The amendment is consistent with the agreement and with the statements by the Treasury and OFHEO and the portfolio provisions. The language is not intended in any way to weaken the agreement with the Treasury. Rather, it is an attempt to clarify the language in the bill to better reflect that agreement. 
   As an original cosponsor of this bill, I believe this amendment is consistent with our intention for the portfolio provisions. Treasury Under Secretary Robert Steel confirmed this in his testimony to the committee on March 15 in an exchange with Chairman Frank, when Chairman Frank noticed that the current language ``could go beyond the safety and soundness mission.'' 
   Chairman Frank suggested to Secretary Steel that the language should be improved to ensure that the provisions would not be used beyond the scope, and Steel agreed at that point in time. 
   Similarly, OFHEO Director Lockhart testified, ``My reading of the systemic risk is it's part of a regulator's job; it's part of safety and soundness.'' 
   Further, in a letter following the hearing, Lockhart wrote, ``We did agree that systemic risk outside of safety and soundness should not be a part of the regulator's approach.'' 
   What they are saying in our bill is that this needs to be clarified. This language does that. It is harmful to the housing markets to reduce GSE portfolios when it is absolutely unnecessary. 
   We have to look at history and this GSE market has been very good. This amendment has been supported by the National Association of Realtors, the National Association of Homebuilders, the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, the National Association of Federal Credit Unions and the Independent Community Bankers of America. 
   This is a good amendment, and I request an ``aye'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this resolution condemning the President's proposal for achieving success in Iraq and overall victory in the global war on terror. We are not formulating policy today. We are not offering the President an alternative. All this resolution is saying is that we do not support our Commander in Chief, and all it is doing is emboldening the terrorist enemies we are facing today. 
   I am the first to welcome an open discussion about our involvement in Iraq. But, without the opportunity to consider an alternative, this is not open discussion. Why isn't this an open discussion? Because although the majority party has the authority to govern, they have no plan to lead. 
   For over a year, the majority party criticized the President for not making changes in his strategy in Iraq. Well, the President has made changes, and the majority party still is not satisfied. 
   We can all agree that our progress has not been as swift and decisive as we once hoped. We all recognize that the war in Iraq has carried on longer than we wanted and consumed more resources than we expected. However, we all knew from the beginning that it would not be easy, that the war against terror would not be a quick fight. 
   But when the going gets tough, it does not mean that we should give in and come home. As we cannot and must not turn back, we need a fresh approach to move forward. The President, along with his generals on the ground, have proposed a way forward. He has put forth a strategy to suppress the sectarian violence in Iraq and allow democratic reforms to take hold and economic institutions to flourish. 
   His plan is the only plan that provides for a way forward in Iraq. For us in Congress, it is not our job to become involved in tactical decisions that will lead to success in our mission. It is our responsibility to help shape the parameters of the mission and to conduct oversight on our progress in achieving the mission. 
   Republicans in Congress have proposed setting verifiable benchmarks with which we may measure our progress in Iraq. Such benchmarks will help us hold the Iraqi regime responsible for the progress made towards democracy, stability and peace in the country. We should be discussing our responsibility as oversight today, but we are not. We are left with debate on an empty and nonbinding resolution. 
   I am a proud cosponsor of Congressman Sam Johnson's bill to ensure that funding is not cut off or restricted for members of the Armed Forces deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must support every effort in our fight against terrorists. If the majority allowed us an opportunity, I would have gladly supported a vote on that bill to reaffirm that the House will not abandon our Armed Forces under any circumstance. 
   Whether the majority would like to acknowledge it or not, the fight we are engaged in against terrorists in Iraq is not a new fight. It has been waged for a decade. We have faced terrorists in Beirut, we have faced terrorists in Saudi Arabia, and we have faced terrorists here on our own soil on September 11, 2001. 
   We have learned it is absolutely essential to confront terrorists abroad before they attack us at home. Despite what some of you may say, our withdrawal will not end the terrorist threat. After all, it is they who have declared Iraq to be the central front in the struggle. 
   We cannot withdraw. We cannot send our troops and other allies the message that we will quit when the going gets tough. Instead, we must move forward with the operations in Iraq, with the Iraqi people, to ensure that peace and stability take hold. We must change our strategy as the situation in the field dictates. To do otherwise would be foolish. 
   But by maintaining our commitment in Iraq, we preserve the prospects of peace. By withdrawing, we surrender our chances of permanent stability in the Middle East. 
   This resolution in so many words says that we cannot be successful, and we are bound to fail. I refuse to agree. I refuse to undercut the brave work of our troops by questioning their abilities and refuse to allow terrorists to flourish and our enemies be emboldened and thereby let you, the American people, down. 
   Our brave men and women risk their lives to provide peace and security here at home, and we are all proud to know such patriots. These young men and women, full of promise, voluntarily defend our Nation wherever they are called. 
   It reminds me of a young man in my district, and I presented him with his Eagle Scout awards when he was 17 years old. It was in 2003. A little less than 2 years later than that, in 2004, I attended the funeral for Lance Corporal Abraham Simpson, who made the ultimate sacrifice in Fallujah. He was just 19 years old. 
   When I went to the parents of Abraham and presented a flag that was flown over our great Nation after the funeral, it was honestly one of the most moving experiences I have had, not only in my congressional career but of my life. When I looked at Abraham's father in his car, I couldn't talk. All I could say to him was, ``I voted to send him there.'' Abraham's dad looked me square in the eye, with as serious a look as he could get, and he said, ``Congressman, it was the right vote.'' 
   Like so many families across our country, the Simpson family has made a great sacrifice for our Nation. This resolution, however, says that the world, that the men and women like Lance Corporal Simpson, gave their lives for, was worthless, that America cannot be successful in the pursuit of which they nobly sacrificed themselves. I believe that we can. I know that if we stand firm in our principles and remain true to our convictions, we can succeed. 
   For that reason, I am going to vote ``no'' on this resolution.  
   I rise today in opposition to this resolution condemning the President's proposal for achieving success in Iraq and overall victory in the Global War on Terror.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. (SANTA ANA RIVER WATER SUPPLY ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 813, the Santa Ana River Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2007, which will significantly increase Southern California's water supply. 
   The Santa Ana River Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2007 authorizes federal funding for a number of important local water projects. When complete, these projects will increase Southern California's water supply by over 37 billion gallons per year. 
   Because of dwindling supplies, increasing demands, and looming drought, Southern California communities continue to seek non-traditional methods to produce dependable water sources. I am pleased that the House has recognized the importance of addressing the chronic water shortages in Southern California by providing the funding resources necessary to help local water agencies improve water reliability and diversity. 
   H.R. 813, the Santa Ana River Water Supply Enhancement Act of 2007, will improve Southern California's water supply by developing wetlands in the Prado Basin, and expanding groundwater desalination in the Chino Basin, and constructing regional brine lines. 
   Specifically, H.R. 813 authorizes the federal government to spend $20 million to develop large-scale wetlands along the Santa Ana River in the Prado Basin, to purify the River before it replenishes Orange County's groundwater supplies. This expanded natural treatment system will provide an additional 24.5 billion gallons of water per year. 
   In addition, H.R. 813 authorizes $50 million in federal funding to expand groundwater desalination in the Chino Basin from the current 2.9 billion gallons per year to 13 billion gallons per year. This will provide a new fresh drinking water supply for Jurupa Community Services District, Santa Ana Mutual Water Company in Riverside County, and the cities of Norco, Chino, Chino Hills, and Ontario in San Bernardino County. 
   Also, the bill authorizes $40 million in federal funding to provide methods to safely and efficiently discard excess brine from nearby desalination plants by constructing a line that transports residual brine to the Pacific Ocean. This will ensure salt water does not contaminate fresh groundwater supplies. 
   If we want to sustain America's economic growth and provide for a rapidly increasing population, we must ensure our communities have efficient and reliable access to water resources. By encouraging the use of innovative technologies through water recycling and desalination, this bill ensures that more drinking water will be available across Southern California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill. As it moves forward through the legislative process, I will continue to urge for its expeditious enactment.

<DOCNO>Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. (MORTGAGE REFORM AND ANTI-PREDATORY LENDING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support, but I want to express some concerns I have with the bill. 
   I have been a long-time advocate of antipredatory legislation that will eliminate abusive lending practices while preserving and promoting access to affordable mortgage credit. I want to thank Chairman Frank for holding true to his commitment to work with me on ensuring that section 123 of the bill will continue to give consumers viable financing options that would not prevent mortgage originators from being compensated. 
   Under the new language, consumers will continue to be able to obtain and enjoy the benefits derived from having the option to choose zero points or no-cost loans by financing the fees and their costs into the rate of the loan amount. I am also pleased that the mechanism by which the mortgage originators are compensated in such cases has been unaffected. 
   According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, currently there are slightly more than 6 million nonprime loans. Of these loans, a little over 5 million, or 85 percent of these loans, are basically being paid on time. Yet, according to the MBA, under the legislation, perhaps 50 percent of the nonprime loans would not be made. This means that a significant number of consumers would not be receiving mortgage financing and millions of legitimate loans would not be obtained. 
   While there is certainly no question that nonprime borrowers have been subjected to abusive lending practices over the years, there is also no question that the vast number of borrowers who were not victims of such practices can become victimized by poorly crafted protective legislation that restricts nonprime credit availability. 
   Under this bill, it significantly expands the scope of loans that qualify as ``high-cost loans,'' or HOEPA loans. This section of the bill dramatically lowers the point fee calculations, thereby capturing a much larger number of loans than under the previous definition in current law. The expansion of HOEPA to cover the additional loans would provide access to credit to more nonprime borrowers. 
   During the markup, I attempted to amend this section to ensure that lenders would still provide and borrowers could still obtain HOEPA loans under this bill. My amendment would not have revised the substantive protection provided by HOEPA as amended. Rather, it would have limited the increase in the number of types of loans that are subject to HOEPA. 
   In addition, the provisions of title III were drafted at least a year before the drafting of titles I and II of this bill, and title III was written without the benefit of enhanced consumer protection provided to nonprime borrowers  under the other sections of the bill. I am concerned that the three titles have been joined into a single bill without the respective provisions being synchronized. 
   By expanding the scope of loans covered by HOEPA, we will further limit liquidity and drastically shrink the availability of mortgage credit. In fact, under current law, the liability and penalties extended to HOEPA loans have made creditors reluctant to make these loans.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, please let the record reflect that had I been present to vote on final passage for H.R. 7321, the Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act, I would have voted ``nay.'' This bill is a vague and ambiguous attempt to restructure the domestic auto industry and lacks the specificity necessary to protect taxpayers. This bill does nothing to guarantee that once domestic automakers receive billions of dollars in taxpayer money that they will become independent of government funding. 
   The bill was introduced after 11 a.m. on December 10, 2008. However, the House began consideration of the bill at 2:30 p.m. the very same day. It is unreasonable to expect Members of Congress to take their first vote in less than five hours after a bill has been made public. If this language would have been made available at least 24 hours before being voted upon, I would have had adequate time to travel to Washington to cast this important vote. This is not the ``open and fair government'' that Democrats have promised. 
   Other than being in Washington waiting for last-minute legislation to be introduced and voted on, Members of Congress have additional responsibilities and other obligations to their constituents that are just as important. This week, I have been in my district meeting with my constituents on various issues including ongoing international conflicts. 
   I am disappointed and appalled that Democratic leadership has treated American taxpayer money in such an irresponsible manner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1851, the Section 8 Voucher Reform Act. 
   This is something we have been working on for years, and I am pleased we have it to this point today. I commend Chairman Frank. Barney, you have been great to work with on these issues. When we express concerns, he is always willing to look at policy rather than politics. We have arrived at a bill we can all look at and say, there are things we might change, but overall, we all agree it is a good bill. 
   I would like to commend Ranking Member Bachus for all of his help and assistance. Chairman Waters, it has been fun working with you on this issue, as well as Ranking Member Biggert. 
   Working together in a bipartisan manner, we have produced a bill that will help the section 8 program better serve families and communities across the country. 
   Over the years, Congress has grappled with the skyrocketing cost of the section 8 program, which is growing so rapidly that HUD's other programs are suffering as a result. 
   It is not feasible for the Federal Government to continue increasing funds for a program without enacting meaningful reforms. 
   In the 109th Congress, I introduced legislation to improve the delivery of housing assistance to families in need by providing flexibility to local public housing authorities, PHAs, and holding them accountable for results. 
   The goal of my legislation was to ensure that PHAs would serve as many families as possible within their budget. While the bill before us today does not go as far as my proposal in injecting flexibility to PHAs in their administration of the entire section 8 program, H.R. 1851 does make a number of improvements to the section 8 program to reform the simplified regulations for local housing agencies. 
   I appreciate Chairman Frank's willingness to work with me to allow for PHA innovation on a scale he is more comfortable with. While the bill before us does not apply flexibility to the entire program, I am pleased it at least allows a permanency and expansion of the Moving To Work program, renamed in this bill as the Housing Innovation Program, HIP. 
   The Moving to Work Program has allowed a small group of PHAs to create locally based housing programs outside of HUD's one-size-fits-all regulations. The program has enabled PHAs to create jobs for residents, add affordable housing stock and help families build savings. 
   Currently, over 24 of the more than 3,000 PHAs nationwide are participating in the Moving to Work program. H.R. 1851 provides access to more agencies nationwide seeking MTW status. 
   Through the new HIP program, we will be able to take away ``best practices'' to apply to the entire section 8 program in the future. I am confident that the innovation that will be produced through the flexibility provided in the HIP will demonstrate ways to truly reform section 8 so we can serve more families efficiently and help move them to self-sufficiency. 
   The manager's amendment, which will be debated later this evening, includes language I crafted to provide PHAs with the flexibility to establish rent structures as they see best to address the needs of their communities. 
   The language gives PHAs the flexibility to select from a menu of tenant rent policies, including flat rent, rents based on income ranges, rents based on percentage of income, or other innovative rent policies. 
   HUD and many PHAs agree that the current Federal approach to tenant rent contribution is a regressive system that penalizes residents by charging higher rents for those who gain employment and income. 
   If a section 8 recipient's salary increases, so does their rent. This creates a disincentive for work. Our goal should be to provide a helping hand to those who need it but also ensure that they are on a path to self-sufficiency. Rather than providing incentives for work, the current section 8 program provides incentives for people to lie about their income or to reject opportunities to increase their income since they would be forced to pay more rent. I don't think this is a message we should be sending in this program. We should be instilling responsibility and desire to achieve in our housing assistance policy, not encouraging dishonesty and creating disincentives for success. 
   I am pleased the chairman has worked with me on language to allow PHAs the option of setting rents in innovative ways to help families achieve self-sufficiency. 
   The reality is that we face a situation of growing waiting lists for section 8 vouchers without the resources to serve everyone. The answer is not to merely throw more money into an existing regressive system in a department where there are other pressing needs that need to be met. We need to move current section 8 recipients to self-sufficiency by allowing PHAs to be innovative with the money they do have, to be efficient and help as many people in need move through the program as possible. 
   While this bill does not go as far as I think we need it to go in terms of allowing flexibility, I believe it is a step in the right direction and will make needed improvements to the section 8 program. I look forward to the debate on the amendments tonight as I believe we can continue to improve the legislation as we move forward. 
   I would like to enter into a colloquy with the chairman, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank). 
   There seems to be a misunderstanding on the part of HUD. Mr. Frank, this bill includes a revision and expansion of the Moving to Work Program, MTW, renamed the Housing Innovation Program, HIP. Under the program authority of HIP, the Secretary may designate up to 60 public housing agencies to fully participate in the program, and an additional 20 public housing agencies may participate in the program under what is called the HIP-Lite provisions. 
   Under the current MTW program, authorization has been granted for 32 public housing authorities to participate in the program. However, HUD narrowly defined the legislative authority under which they could solicit new applications. HUD decided that once PHAs leave the program, no new agencies can be selected to fill their vacancy. The result is, out of 32 authorized, only 24 agencies are currently in the program. 
   I would like to confirm that the intent of this bill is to allow HUD to solicit new applications in order to maintain the program at its fully authorized level and to give PHAs the opportunity to fill any vacancies. 
   I would like to confirm that you agree that the secretary of HUD should promptly solicit new applications from PHAs interested in participating in the HIP program whenever the number of agencies is less than the total authorized level, and that would be 60 under this bill; is that correct, sir?

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Mr. Chairman, we have been working on housing issues for several years. I think we do have a very good job in this House coming to an agreement. Moving to the Senate, for some reason, things just don't happen as they should on that side of the Capitol. 
   But we have got tremendous housing shortages in this country that we have to deal with. We have to work on HOPE VI program to be more innovative to allow the private sector to get involved. We need to be able to take and move people through the system for public housing section 8 vouchers. 
   But the area we are really hurting in in this country is the move-up marketplace for people coming out of section 8, coming out of public housing and to be able to move into a house that's affordable. We all have problems in many of our districts where our children go away to college; we know people who, when their kids come back, they can't afford to live in the communities in which they were raised. We know many people who may be a school teacher, a police officer, a fireman, who drive 2 hours back and forth to work because they can't afford to live within the community in which they work. That should be a focus of Congress. 
   We not only have to deal with the HOPE VI program, we have to deal with the public housing program, the section 8. We have to look at streamlining the system where builders and developers in this country can bring affordable housing on line and make it available for people who are moving out of government assistance into homes of their home. 
   The Moving To Work program, I think, is going to work very well. It allows people to retain some earnings, to build up the savings to be able to afford to move into a home for the first time. We have a lot of nonprofits in this country that provide down-payment assistance, programs who help people that can afford a payment but don't have the cash on hand within which to be able to put down and pay the closing costs to move into a home. 
   We have got to look at the overall industry and say, how can we be innovative? How can we be creative? And how can we help people to help themselves? Now, I am a conservative. I don't believe in government programs going on forever. But I think people come to a point in their life where they need a helping hand. 
   We need to look at ways to help them go on their open to become self-sufficient. That's what I hope we do in Congress, not only look at reforming the government programs we have here today to make them more innovative, make them work for people. In L.A. County, there is a 10-year wait for people to go on vouchers or public housing. That has to change. 
   People wait for 10 years who are just as needy or more needy sometimes than people who are receiving assistance. But we have no way of moving those people out of government programs into their own homes. 
   That's what we need to look at, streamlining, removing the red tape, fast tracking, have some nexus between the cost that's assessed against the project and the actual cost of that project. 
   I want to commend BARNEY FRANK. Over the years, he and I have worked on more legislation on housing I think than any two Members from the Republican and Democrat side together that try to create programs that work for people. Tonight's bill might not be everything they want. I know it's not  everything that MAXINE WATERS and BARNEY FRANK wants, but it was an agreement between the two of us in a bipartisan fashion, Republicans and Democrats, to come and fashion a bill that would work. 
   I think this bill has some innovation. It makes some changes, and I think it moves us in a better direction. Are we where we should be completely? No, but we are moving in a good direction. 
   I look forward to cooperation from both sides.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. I want to thank you for including my language on reform in the manager's amendment. This I believe goes a long way to create innovation in helping people gain self-sufficiency. 
   The main reason I want to speak today is because many on my side have a real problem with the requirement that language be translated into a language that anybody who might come to a HUD assistance program might require to speak, and your bill goes a long way. 
   I have consistently supported every effort to repeal President Clinton's executive order which requires any recipient of Federal funds to provide translations into any language an individual requesting service may speak; but recently, HUD has issued a requirement that says that any housing authority or PHA must provide this translation to individuals who come before them. 
   This is the Federal Government creating a mandate and requiring the private sector to pay the bill. And what you are doing I wholeheartedly support. You are saying that if the Federal Government wants to require a mandate, then they should pay the bill. It has been estimated that one of these translations can cost a section 8 individual or group or housing authority up to $10,000 for each language they want to translate the documents into, and what you are doing is absolutely correct. If we are not going to change the law, then let's not have an unfunded mandate placed on the private sector that the private sector has to pay for when HUD and the Federal Government wants to mandate it. And what you are saying is: HUD, if you want to mandate it, you pick up the bill. And I think that is very important that we do this, and I want to stand up saying I wholeheartedly support it. 
   I do not support the mandate, period, that Clinton imposed, but we are stuck with it. It is an executive order. And what you are saying is the private sector should not be suffering the burden of an unfunded mandate if the Federal Government wants to mandate it. 
   So I want to clarify for my side that what we are doing here is saying we are relieving an unfunded mandate on the private sector and placing the burden on the Federal Government, who should be responsible. And if we want to change the law, let's change the law. But until we change the law, the private sector should not suffer the burden of financing something the Federal Government is imposing on them. 
   I wholeheartedly support the manager's amendment, and I thank you for working with me on rent reform and other things.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Reclaiming my time, I think you are right. It is cheaper for us to pay for shipping than it is for them to pay for translations. Let's do it one time, ship the documents, and we deal with the problem, unless we want to change the law.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment with my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) to limit the amount of time a section 8 recipient may receive housing assistance. 
   I believe this amendment offers a reasonable approach to a very difficult issue. The intent of this amendment is not to be harsh or uncaring. If you read the amendment, you will see that we provide exemptions for the elderly, for the disabled and for hardship. 
   This amendment is an attempt to inject fairness into this program, where we are faced with the fiscal reality that we do not have the resources to provide unlimited housing assistance to all those who want to participate in the program. 
   This amendment will help those who have been waiting a long time for their turn for the helping hand. 
   When we started working on section 8 reform legislation a couple of years ago, I asked my staff to review all the casework inquiries we had received from constituents about the section 8 program. This review revealed that section 8 recipients weren't contacting me to help them with problems with their housing or HUD regulations; the constituents who had contacted my office were complaining about the fact that they had been on the section 8 waiting list for years and were just as in need as those who are receiving assistance currently. 
   According to HUD, the average length of time families spend on the waiting list for subsidized housing in the United States is more than 2 years. In cities like Los Angeles, the waiting list is approaching 10 years. 
   How can we justify a situation where one person is given unlimited Federal housing assistance, while another who might have greater need is on the waiting list and unable to participate in the program for almost 10 years? 
   The answer is not to allow this program to continue to grow out of control by providing more vouchers. Rather, we must reform the program so that participants can transition into self-sufficiency within a reasonable period of time. 
   The answer is to institute a reasonable time limit for assistance, which would give more families the ability to benefit from our Nation's temporary helping hand. 
   The amendment I offer today is based on the successful reform we made to the welfare program in 1996. Under the amendment, the maximum amount of time during which a family may receive section 8 assistance is 7 years. Time limits would not apply to elderly or disabled families. 
   In addition, there is a hardship exemption for families who need extra time due to circumstances beyond their control. 
   While some might argue that we should increase the number of section 8 vouchers that are available so we can serve all those who are on the waiting list, the practical reality is that we cannot already sustain the growth in the current section 8 program. Our aim should be not to expand the program more but instead reform it to allow it to provide assistance to more people. 
   Even with the section 8 program growing out of control, it is not helping all the people that it could. This amendment is one way to ensure that our Federal limited resources may be used to help all those who need help. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GARY G. MILLER of California. I think, Mr. Frank, you know my heart, and you and I have worked on a lot of stuff. I think Mr. Chabot and I would be willing to accept a 50-percent exemption for single mothers with multiple children who have a hardship, who are unable to move in the sector. So we are willing to cooperate. We are not trying to throw mothers with children out of the home. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman's time has expired.
