<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5818, NEIGHBORHOOD STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule that brings this bill to the floor and to this $15 billion bailout bill, and I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think up here we lose sight of how much $15 billion really is. Fifteen billion dollars would operate the entire State government of Tennessee for almost 1 year, our education, our medical care, our prisons, our roads, our parks. And Tennessee is almost dead on average, statistics-wise, in regard to all the States. 
   Over 95 percent of the people are paying their mortgages on time. Consistent with that, about 95 percent of the people who have contacted my office or spoken to me about this bill, they don't want us to bail out people who have taken out loans that they couldn't afford. But even worse than that, the $15 billion that's in this bill, even worse, we're going to pass later today a $300 billion housing bill that we really can't afford. Tomorrow we're probably going to pass a $250 billion supplemental appropriations bill. That's $565 billion in 2 days. And all three of these bills are outside the regular or don't even count the regular appropriations bills that we'll be taking up. 
   Next week, we're going to pass an almost $300 billion farm bill. A couple of weeks ago it came out that the Pentagon has had $295 billion in cost overruns on just their 72 largest weapons systems, not counting the cost overruns that would be in all the thousands of other large and medium size and small contracts. 
   Last week, we rejected an effort by the administration to save $50 billion over the next 10 years on the Medicaid rules even though payments to hospitals under the Medicaid program have gone up two to three times the rate of inflation every year for the last 15 or 20 years.

   Mr. DUNCAN. What I'm getting at, Mr. Speaker, is this: This Congress is going to go down as the most fiscally irresponsible Congress in the history of this Nation if we keep spending at this rate. No one can legitimately call themselves a fiscal conservative if they vote for all these bills. 
   David Walker, who just retired as the head of the GAO, respected by both sides, said that even worse than the $9 trillion national debt that we have is the 53 to $54 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities. It's not going to be many years, Mr. Speaker, before we're not going to be able to pay all our Social Security and veterans pensions and all the other things we promised our people if we keep spending in the reckless manner that we're doing so today and in the days ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), in his opposition to this rule. Mr. Speaker, let me read just one thing to you. Charles Krauthammer is one of our most respected syndicated columnists and television commentators. A little over 3 weeks ago he wrote this: ``Gas is $4 a gallon. Oil is $135 a barrel and rising. We import two-thirds of our oil, sending hundreds of billions of dollars to the likes of Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, and yet we voluntarily prohibit ourselves from even exploring huge resources, huge domestic reserves of petroleum and natural gas. At a time when U.S. crude oil production has fallen 40 percent in the past 25 years, 75 billion barrels of oil have been declared off limits according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
   Still quoting Mr. Krauthammer: ``That would be enough to replace every barrel of non-North American imports for 22 years. That is nearly a quarter century of energy independence.'' 
   Mr. Krauthammer ended by saying: ``The situation is absurd.'' Robert Samuelson, a couple of months ago in The Washington Post, and he is another syndicated columnist, but not a conservative or a Republican by any stretch of the imagination. He wrote this. He said, ``The truth is that we are almost powerless to influence today's prices. We are because we didn't take sensible actions 10 or 20 years ago. If we persist, we will be even worse off in a decade or two.'' 
   The first thing to do, Mr. Samuelson said: ``Start drilling.'' 
   And George Will pointed out in a recent column that when we were able to pass drilling in ANWR, 12 1/2 years ago, President Clinton vetoed it. If he hadn't vetoed it, that would have been 27 million barrels of oil, 20 million barrels of gasoline and 7 million barrels of diesel fuel coming down to this country, coming down here every day, and would have had a great, great effect on this problem. And we are certainly in a problem. 
   A couple of months ago we heard in the Highways and Transit Subcommittee that 935 trucking companies had gone out of business in the first quarter of this year. And that survey only counted trucking companies with five trucks or more. 
   A couple of weeks ago, in the Aviation Subcommittee we heard that eight airlines had gone out of business in the last year and a half. And this is a needless crisis. 
   The Minerals Management Service estimates that the quantity of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources ranges from 66 to 115 billion barrels of oil. 
   One of our leaders has described this DRILL Act as a hoax of a bill, and it is a hoax because it still leaves 85 percent, or 611 million acres of our Outer Continental Shelf off limits for oil production.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, let me close just simply by saying this. I have noticed over the years that almost all of these environmental radicals come from very wealthy or very upper income families, and perhaps they can afford 5 or $6 a gallon gasoline. But many hardworking and average Americans cannot afford this. We are sending this country into a needless economic crisis. 
   We need to start drilling in an environmentally safe way where there is oil, as the gentleman from Texas has pointed out, and not pass a hoax of a bill such as this.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Halliburton has decided to move its headquarters to Dubai. This is a company that has received over $25 billion worth  of contracts in Iraq, and this is the kind of thanks the U.S. taxpayers get. In fact, this is a real slap in the face of the U.S. taxpayers. 
   The ABC National News reported Sunday night that Halliburton has been charged by government inspectors of overcharging our government and overcharging our taxpayers to the tune of $2.7 billion. No company that commits those types of overcharges should ever get a Federal contract again. In fact, in my opinion, the U.S. Government should not give a contract to any company that cannot certify that over half of its employees are U.S. citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding me this time and for his work on this legislation and his kind comments from a few minutes ago, and I want to thank the gentleman from Connecticut who is managing the bill today. Especially I want to thank Chairman Waxman because this bill, while it has been mentioned that we passed this once before in an earlier Congress, it would not be on the floor today if it were not for the support of Chairman Waxman, and I do appreciate that very much. 
   As has already been mentioned, I introduced this bill several years ago, and in fact it was the 106th Congress when I first introduced this because I learned that some foreign governments from the Middle East were making very large contributions to the proposed library for President Clinton, and I was concerned that could lead to undue influence on the part of not only foreign governments but perhaps others. 
   Many months later after I introduced this bill, I learned that Marc Rich's ex-wife, and one of his closest friends, had made very large contributions to the Clinton library, and then President Clinton, on his last day in office, granted a pardon to Mr. Rich who had fled the country after evading $40 million in income taxes. 
   I can tell you this, in my mind, is not a partisan bill. I introduced this under a Democratic President. I reintroduced it in the 107th Congress under a Republican President. As has been noted by the gentleman from Ohio, this bill passed the House by a vote of 392-3. There was not enough interest in the Senate at that time, and so we are back here today to try to pass this bill this time to bring as, has already been said, some openness, some transparency, to shed some light on these contributions and on what would be a real potential for abuse under either a Democratic or Republican President in the future. 
   As Chairman Waxman and others have said, the price tag on these Presidential libraries has escalated just in a few years' time from $80 million to $500 million projected for this President's library, and no telling where those libraries might go in the future in regard to costs. 
   This bill does not prohibit any contributions. It allows even very, very large contributions. All it does is require reporting, quarterly reporting. 
   My original bill has been made stronger by the suggestions, by the actions by Chairman Waxman, and I support this bill. I think it is a good government bill, and I think it is one that all of our colleagues can be proud in supporting. It will certainly help to prevent some real serious potentials for abuse in the years ahead if we pass this legislation. 
   So I appreciate the support of everyone who has spoken here today, and I urge the support of all of my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (GLOBAL WARMING ALARMISTS -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, conservatives who oppose world government and massive foreign aid, such as our very unconservative war in Iraq, are sometimes called isolationists. However, anyone who makes the isolationist charge is really resorting to childish name-calling rather than a discussion on the merits. 
   Another major issue on which there is a lot of name-calling these days is the debate over global warming. Just today the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a one-sided hearing on allegations that the Bush administration is guilty of political interference in the global warming debate. The implication was that Federal scientists are being intimidated by those who are skeptical about global warming. 
   Actually, the intimidation is coming from those who believe that global warming is the biggest or one of the biggest problems we face. Global warming alarmists get very angry if anyone even dares to question their views. 
   Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT wrote a few months ago about what he called, ``the sinister side to this feeding frenzy about global warming.'' 
   Professor Lindzen said, ``Scientists who dissent from the alarmism have seen their grant funds disappear, their work derided and themselves libeled as industry stooges, scientific hacks or worse. Consequently, lies about climate change gain credence, even when they fly in the face of the science that is supposedly their basis.'' 
   Professor David Deming, a geophysicist, said, ``The media hysteria on global warming has been generated by journalists who do not understand the provisional and uncertain nature of scientific knowledge. Science changes.'' 
   And Robert Bradley, president of the Institute for Energy Research, writing in the Washington Times, said, ``The emotional politicized debate over global warming has produced a fire-ready-aim mentality, despite great and still-growing scientific uncertainty about the problem.'' 
   Mr. Bradley added, ``Still climate alarmists demand a multitude of do-somethings to address the problem they are sure exists and is solvable. No job is too big for government because they welcome bigger and bigger government. They pronounce the debate over in their favor, and call their critics names such as 'deniers,' as in Holocaust deniers. This has created a bad climate for scientific research and for policymaking. In fact, the debate is more than unsettled.'' 
   I can produce hundreds of quotes like this from experts and scientists who question or are skeptical about the wild claims from some climate change alarmists. And the charge that the Bush administration is intimidating scientists or suppressing their work seems to be coming from scientists who want more attention or publicity or who want to make themselves out to be some sort of courageous, heroic martyrs. 
   Actually the Bush administration has spent $25 billion on global warming and climate change research in the last 5 years, far more than any previous administration. Almost all global warming alarmists either work full time for the Federal Government or get Federal funding for their research. They know they are very unlikely to get more Federal money unless they say this problem is terrible and getting worse all the time. 
   There may be some global warming and some of it may be bad. In some places it may be good. However, we need to make sure we solve the problems that exist without destroying our economy, or harming humanity in the process. The worst polluters in the  world have been the Socialist and Communist countries. 
   Only free market systems generate the excess funds to do the good things for the environment that all of us want done. Anger and name-calling and biased hearings will not solve any serious or legitimate problems.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a fine group of sixth graders from my district in Tennessee. The Maryville Intermediate School Sixth Grade Wind Ensemble Band from Maryville, Tennessee, is headed to Chicago for the prestigious 2007 Midwest Clinic, an international band and orchestra concert. 
   The event is known in band and orchestra circles as one of the highest honors a musical group can receive. They were chosen to participate only after an extensive audition process in which they competed against other bands and orchestras from high schools, communities, colleges and universities and militaries from around the world. 
   This is certainly a great achievement in and of itself. But the Maryville band is special in another way; they are the first sixth grade band in the Clinic's 61-year history to be invited to participate. It is an honor that the close-knit community of Maryville can be proud of, and just another example of the incredible spirit of the people of east Tennessee. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge my colleagues to join me as I salute Maryville Intermediate School's Wind Ensemble Band and its directors, George Hayden and RoAnn Romines, on this much-deserved accomplishment. I wish them many more musical scores to come.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for giving me this time. I actually came to the floor to speak on other legislation, but when I realized that this bill was up, I wanted to at least make a couple of comments about it. 
   I have the privilege of serving as the ranking member on the Highways and Transit Subcommittee. Prior to that, or a few years ago, I served for 6 years as chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee. The statistics, or the comparison between aviation and safety on our highways, is just staggering. 
   Unfortunately, we have more people killed in 3 1/2 months on our Nation's highways than we have had killed in all U.S. aviation accidents combined since the Wright brothers' flight in 1903. But more importantly I want to commend the authors of this legislation, because we need to do everything we can to call attention to the record of teen drivers and raise the awareness of teenagers as to how dangerous our Nation's highways can be. 
   According to the most recent statistics by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, our safest drivers, contrary to what a lot of people believe, are those 75 and over. The second safest group of drivers are those 65 to 74. 
   The 75 and over age group has 2.5 accidents per 10,000 drivers. That compares to the 16-to-20 group which has 13.3 percent per 10,000 drivers. It's an amazing statistic as to how dangerous teenage driving is and how safe our older drivers are. 
   I just wanted to say that I rise in strong support of this resolution on Teen Driver Safety Week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to voice my very strong support for H.R. 3218. H.R. 3218 designates Interstate Route 395 in Baltimore, Maryland, as ``Cal Ripken Way.'' 
   Cal Ripken, Jr. is a native son of Havre de Grace, Maryland, in Harford County, about 35 miles northeast of Baltimore. Cal Ripken, also known as ``Iron Man,'' is best known for his record-shattering streak of playing 2,632 straight games for the American League's Baltimore Orioles over 17 years, from May 1982, through September 1998. An unbelievable record. He retired from Major League Baseball in October 2001, after playing 21 straight years for the Orioles, between 1981 and 2001. 
   On September 6, 1995, Cal Ripken, Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive games played, a record that had stood for 57 years. On that historic night at Camden Yards, Ripken not only broke the record but also hit a home run in the fourth inning of that game. 
   His father, Cal Ripken, Sr., was a former baseball player, coach, and scout for the Orioles. In 1987 and 1988, Cal Ripken, Sr. managed the Orioles, and both Cal Ripken, Jr. and his brother Billy played for the team that year, a first in baseball history. 
   Since leaving the game in 2001, Cal Ripken has dedicated his life and his work to youth. He established the Cal Ripken, Sr. Foundation, which uses baseball- and softball-themed programs to help instill leadership qualities, a strong work ethic, sportsmanship, and healthy habits. He also built the Ripken Youth Baseball Academy, the largest baseball academy in the United States, where thousands of young people learn the finer points of baseball and deepen their love for playing it. 
   He served as the first commissioner of the White House T-Ball initiative for President George Bush from 2001 to 2004. And on July 29, 2007, Cal Ripken was fittingly inducted into the baseball Hall of Fame. 
   When I was growing up, Madam Speaker, I served 5 1/2 years as a batboy for the Knoxville Smokies baseball team. I served other seasons as ball chaser, scoreboard operator, clubhouse boy. In my freshman year at the University of Tennessee, I served as a public address announcer. I grew up in minor league baseball. My father gave Earl Weaver his first managerial job in Knoxville, managing the Knoxville Smokies in 1956, and we became a farm club of the Baltimore Orioles. People who later played with Cal Ripken or who he knew through the Orioles like Milt Pappas, Jerry Walker, Ron Hansen, Willie Tasby, Mike Cuellar, Dave Nicholson, and many other players who later played for the Orioles played in Knoxville. 
   Baseball has meant a lot to me and my family through the years, and it is a real honor and privilege for me to stand here before you today and announce my support for this very appropriate legislation to honor a truly great American, Cal Ripken, Jr. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I urge support for this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SECURITY OVERREACTION -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, Ian Lustick, a professor of the University of Pennsylvania and research fellow at the Independent Institute in California, wrote an article in The Hill newspaper a few days ago which made a great deal of sense. He wrote this: 
   ``Nearly 7 years after September 11, 2001, what accounts for the vast discrepancy between the terrorist threat facing America and the scale of our response? Why, absent any evidence of a serious domestic terror threat, is the war on terror so enormous, so all-encompassing, and still expanding? The fundamental answer is that al Qaeda's most important accomplishment was not to hijack our planes but to hijack our political system. For a multitude of politicians, interest groups, professional associations, corporations, media organizations, universities, local and State governments, and Federal agency officials, the war on terror is now a major profit center, a funding bonanza, and a set of slogans and sound bites to be inserted into budget, project, grant, and contract proposals. 
   ``For the country as a whole, however, it has become a maelstrom of waste and worry that distracts us from more serious problems.'' 
   Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, testified before the Senate a few months ago in a way no other Cabinet member probably ever has. He  essentially said we are spending too much on security and should not let an over-exaggerated threat of terrorism ``drive us crazy,'' into bankruptcy, trying to defend against every conceivable threat. He went on to say: ``We do have limits and we do have choices to make. We don't want to break the very systems we're trying to protect. We don't want to destroy our way of life trying to save it. We don't want to undercut our economy trying to protect our economy, and we don't want to destroy our civil liberties and our freedoms in order to make ourselves safer.'' 
   Secretary Chertoff was exactly right. I believe that most Members of Congress will vote for almost anything if the word ``security'' is attached to it so that they will not be blamed if something bad happens later. We should do some things to protect against terrorism, but we should not go overboard if we still believe in things like freedom and liberty. 
   Actually, most security spending is more about money for government contractors and increased funding for government agencies than it is about any serious threat. Just 3 weeks after 9/11, when security requests for money were already pouring in, the Wall Street Journal hit the nail on the head in an editorial: 
   ``We'd like to suggest a new post-September 11 rule for Congress: Any bill with the word 'security' in it should get double the public scrutiny and maybe four times the normal wait lest all kinds of bad legislation become law under the phony guise of fighting terrorism.''     
   The Wall Street Journal was exactly right. Unfortunately, Congress has not followed this good advice. But it is just as relevant today as it was when it first written. 
   Bruce Fein was a high ranking Justice Department official during the Reagan administration. He says the Federal Government has, ``inflated the international terrorism danger in order to aggrandize executive power.'' This is true, in part. Most agencies and departments do exaggerate the threats or problems they are confronting to get more power. But they primarily do so to keep getting increased appropriations. 
   Certainly, we need to take realistic steps to fight terrorism. But if we gave the Department of Homeland Security the entire Federal budget, we still could not make everyone totally safe. In a cost benefit analysis, you fairly quickly reach a point in the terrorism threat where more spending is almost totally wasted. People are hundreds of times more likely to be killed in a wreck or die from a heart attack or cancer. We need to spend more on the greatest threats. Also, we need to make sure we do not lose our liberty in a search for an illusive security. 
   Bruce Fein wrote that if the, ``war against international terrorism is not confronted with corresponding skepticism, the Nation will have crossed the Rubicon into an endless war, a condition that Madison lamented would be the end of freedom.'' 
   Madam Speaker, to sum up, a few people are getting rich at the expense of many by claiming that they are trying to increase our security. We don't need to make our already bloated Big Brother government even bigger just because some company or some bureaucrat callously uses the word ``security'' just to get more money and power.

   Well, maybe these wealthy environmentalists can afford $5 a gallon gas, but many poor and lower income and working people are already hurting. Week before last we heard that 935 trucking companies have gone out of business in the first quarter of this year. 
   We can produce oil now in environmentally safe ways, and we don't have to produce all of our oil. But if we don't start producing a little more, and soon, we're going to become even more vulnerable to foreign oil producers, and we're going to hurt many working people in the process.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (THE WAR IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq, since its beginning, has gone against every traditional conservative position I've ever known, especially fiscal conservatism. There is nothing conservative about the war in Iraq. So it should have been no surprise when William F. Buckley, often called the ``Godfather of Conservatism,'' wrote in 2004 that if he had known in 2002 what he knew then by 2004, he would have been against the war. But listen to what he wrote in June of 2005, 2 years ago. 
   William F. Buckley. ``A respect for the power of the United States is engendered by our success in engagements in which we take part. A point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose, but misapplication of pride. It can't reasonably be disputed that if in the year ahead the situation in Iraq continues about as it has done in the past year, we will have suffered more than another 500 soldiers killed. Where there had been skepticism about our venture, there will be contempt.'' 
   That was William F. Buckley in 2005. And his main point was, quote, ``A point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose, but misapplication of pride.'' Unfortunately, we are losing our young soldiers at a much faster rate than the 500 a year that Mr. Buckley said would move the American people from skepticism to contempt; 103 U.S. soldiers killed in April alone, at least 71 more killed through May 21, including 15 this past weekend, and someone told me 8 more today. 
   Saddam Hussein was an evil man, but he had a total military budget only a  little over two-tenths of 1 percent of ours, most of which he spent protecting himself and his family and building castles. He was no threat to us whatsoever. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all respect, admire and appreciate those who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. As I said a few days ago on this floor, serving in our military is certainly the most honorable ways anyone can serve our country. I believe national defense is one of the very few legitimate functions of our national government, and certainly one of the most important. However, we need to recognize that our military has become the most gigantic bureaucracy in the history of the world, and like any huge bureaucracy, it does many good things, of course, always at huge expense to the taxpayer. And like any huge bureaucracy, our military does many things that are wasteful or inefficient. And like any huge bureaucracy, it tries to gloss over or cover up its mistakes. And like any huge bureaucracy, it always wants to expand its mission and get more and more money. 
   Counting our regular appropriations bills, plus the supplemental appropriations, we will spend more than $750 billion on our military in the next fiscal year. This is more than all the other nations of the world combined spend on their defense. 
   The GAO tells us that we presently have $50 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities, on top of our national debt of almost $9 trillion. If we are going to have any hope of paying our military pensions and Social Security and other promises to our own people, we cannot keep giving so much to the Pentagon. No matter how much we respect our military, and no matter how much we want to show our patriotism, we need to realize there is waste in all huge bureaucracies, even in the Defense Department. 
   There is a reason why we have always believed in civilian leadership of our Defense Department. The admirals and generals will always say things are going great because it is almost like saying they're doing a bad job if they say things are not doing well. And the military people know they can keep getting big increases in funding if they are involved all over the world. However, it is both unconstitutional and unaffordable, and, I might add, unconservative, for us to be the policemen of the world and carry on civilian government functions in and for other countries. 
   National defense is necessary and vital. International defense by the U.S. is unnecessary and harmful in many ways. Now we are engaged in a war in Iraq that is very unpopular with a big majority of the American people. More importantly, every poll of Iraqis themselves shows that 78 to 80 percent of them want us to leave, except in the Kurdish areas. They want our money, but they do not want us occupying Iraq. Surely we are not adopting a foreign policy that forces us on other people, one that says we are going to run Iraq even if the people there want us to leave. 
   The majority of the Iraqi Parliament has now signed a petition asking us to leave. It is sure not traditional conservatism to carry on a war in a country that did not attack us, did not even threaten to attack us, and was not even capable of attacking us. And it is sure not traditional conservatism to believe in world government, even if run by the U.S. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Bush, when he ran for office in 2000, campaigned strongly against nation building. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we have been doing in Iraq. The President, in 2000, said what we needed was a more humble foreign policy. That is what we needed then, and it is what we need now.

Today, however, I am pleased to be part of the bipartisan effort that we are discussing, the Federal Real Property Disposal Act, and am hopeful that this bill will be able to clean up the federal real property inventory. 
   I would like to thank Representative MOORE, Chairman WAXMAN and Senators Carper and COBURN for their work on this important issue. With all the talk of spending, this bill has the opportunity to bring about great savings for the American taxpayer. 
   The Government Accountability Office has listed federal real property as one of its high risk issues since 2003 due to incomplete data and the numbers of excess properties and aging facilities. 
   In 2004, President Bush issued an Executive Order to improve the management of federal real property. Since then $7 billion worth of unneeded assets and properties have been removed from the government inventory. 
   The Federal Government has a goal of disposing of $9 billion in unneeded real property by the end of fiscal year 2009. Jim Nussle, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, sent me a letter last year endorsing a bill I introduced in the House and that Senators TOM CARPER and TOM COBURN introduced in the Senate. 
   Director Nussle wrote: ``To reach this objective, I believe we must improve and streamline the current process that Federal agencies face in disposing of real property assets.'' 
   Some people never want the government to sell any property, and government at all levels continues to acquire more and more every year. But if we keep shrinking the tax base, schools and other agencies will have a much harder time in the future getting increases in their funding. 
   In June of 2007, the Office of Management and Budget reported that the Federal Government owned over 21,000 excess properties and assets with a total replacement value of nearly $18 billion. That is more than the gross domestic product of over half the countries in the world. 
   The bill that we are taking up today builds on a proposal that overwhelmingly passed the House earlier this year. 
   Under the Federal Real Property Disposal Enhancement Act, an agency would be able to retain a portion of the proceeds from a sale of a property deemed excess. This will provide agencies an incentive to get rid of unneeded properties and allow them to use the proceeds to maintain current property or prepare excess property for disposal. 
   The reporting requirements in H.R. 7217 will provide what I believe will be very useful and valuable information, not only on the numbers and values of Federal properties, but on the costs of maintaining properties, like utilities, repairs, and janitorial services. 
   Agencies spend well over $100 million dollars a year on the maintenance and upkeep of properties that are not even being used. H.R. 7217 will help agencies reduce these unnecessary costs. 
   Madam Speaker, in closing, I believe that H.R. 7217 gives additional resources to those agencies that might not otherwise be able to prepare and dispose of properties the ability to reap the benefits and apply them toward mission-critical properties. It also saves hard-earned taxpayer dollars that could definitely be used more appropriately.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF FATHERS IN THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I want to first thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me this time. I want to also commend the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre) for bringing  this resolution before us today and commend all of the cosponsors, Mr. Davis and others. 
   Mr. Speaker, some people might think this is an insignificant resolution. I think there is probably very little that we could talk about today that would be more important than fatherhood and the important role it plays in the life of this Nation. This was brought home to me most vividly in January 1981 when I became judge of the criminal court in Knox County, Tennessee, trying felony criminal cases, the murders, rapes, armed robberies, the most serious cases. I was told that first day by Gary Tullock, the chief probation counselor for east Tennessee, 16 counties in east Tennessee, that 98 percent of the defendants in felony cases came from father-absent households. I'm not sure that it is quite that high, but I know it's well over 90 percent. It's the entire crime problem. 
   I hasten to say that I know many good people have come from father-absent households, but I also know that children cannot raise themselves. And because 96 or 97 percent of the people plead guilty in criminal cases and then apply for probation, I went through over 10,000 cases in the 7 1/2 years that I served as judge. I cannot tell you how many times I read over and over and over and over again: ``Defendant's father left home to get pack of cigarettes and never came back.'' ``Defendant's father left home when defendant was 2 and never returned.'' 
   And so I can say this, that father-absent households not only are the root of our crime problem, all the things like drugs and alcohol and all of that come secondary. I know there are exceptions to everything that you say, but we need to get into the minds of our young people and teach them how important it is that fathers don't desert their children as so many millions of fathers have unfortunately over the years and have gone out of the lives of their children much to the detriment of those young people and to the detriment of this Nation. 
   I support this resolution and I commend all of those who have brought this to the floor today.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2638, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I do thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding me this time, and I want to say, first of all, that I want to commend the gentleman from Florida and also the gentlewoman from New York, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee, two of the Members in this Congress for whom I have the greatest admiration and respect, and I appreciate the fact that they are bringing this legislation to the floor under an open rule. 
   But as both the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) just expressed, there are still some concerns about this bill, number one of which is the fact that this bill is $2.1 billion over the President's request and a 13.6 percent increase over fiscal year 2007. That is more than four times the rate of inflation. With an almost $9 trillion national debt and over $50 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities, we just can't keep giving every department and agency that wants one or four or five times increase over the rate of inflation. As the ranking member, Mr. Rogers, said a few days ago, even the Department of Homeland Security should be subject to some fiscal discipline. 
   A few weeks after 9/11 when we had renamed the farm bill that year by adding the word ``security'' to the title, the Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial in October of 2001 and said: ``Any bill with the word `security' in it should get double the public scrutiny, and maybe four times the normal wait, lest all kinds of bad legislation become law.'' 
   And a few months ago, Secretary Chertoff, the Secretary of Homeland Security, testified before the Senate in a way perhaps no other Cabinet member ever had. He essentially said we are spending too much on security and we should not let overexaggerated threats of terrorism, quote, drive us crazy, into bankruptcy, trying to defend against every conceivable threat. 
   He went on to say, quote, we do have limits and we do have choices to make. We don't want to break the very systems we're trying to protect. We don't want to destroy our way of life trying to save it. We don't want to undercut our economy trying to protect our economy, and we don't want to destroy our civil liberties and our freedoms in order to make ourselves safer. 
   That is the Secretary of Homeland Security. I think, Mr. Speaker, we need to take some of those words into consideration. In a short time, later today, we are going to have several amendments to the bill that I think are worthy of consideration by all of our Members and I think should be passed. We just shouldn't blindly pass a bill and pass everything that anybody wants because they attach the word ``security'' to it.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (MONITORING DEFENSE SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, we all respect, admire and appreciate those who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. Serving in our military is certainly one of the most honorable ways anyone can serve our country. I believe national defense is one of the very few legitimate functions of our national government, and certainly one of the most important. 
   However, we also need to recognize that our military has become the most gigantic bureaucracy in the history of the world. And like any huge bureaucracy, it does many good things; of course, always at huge expense to the taxpayer. And like any huge bureaucracy, our military does many things that are wasteful or inefficient. And like any huge bureaucracy, it tries to  gloss over or cover up its mistakes. And like any huge bureaucracy, it always wants to expand its mission and get more and more money. 
   Counting our regular appropriations bills, plus the supplemental appropriations, we will spend more than $750 billion on our military in the next fiscal year. This is more than all the other nations of the world combined spend on their defense. 
   The GAO tells us that we presently have $50 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities on top of our national debt of almost $9 trillion. If we are going to have any hope of paying our military pensions and Social Security and other promises to our own people, we cannot keep giving so much to the Pentagon. 
   No matter how much we respect our military and no matter how much we want to show our patriotism, we need to realize that there is waste in all huge bureaucracies, even in the Defense Department. 
   There is a reason why we have always believed in civilian leadership of our Defense Department. The admirals and generals will always say things are going great, because it is almost like saying they are doing a bad job if they say things are not doing well and the military people know they can keep getting big increases in funding if they are involved all over the world. 
   However, it is both unconstitutional and unaffordable for us to be the policeman of the world and carry on civilian government functions in and for other countries. National defense is necessary and vital. International defense by the U.S. is unnecessary and harmful in many ways. 
   Now we are engaged in a war in Iraq that is very unpopular with a big majority of the American people. More importantly, every poll of Iraqis themselves shows that 78 to 80 percent of them want us to leave, except in the Kurdish areas. 
   They want our money, but they do not want us occupying Iraq. Surely, we are not adopting a foreign policy that forces us on other people, one that says we are going to run Iraq even if the people there want us to leave. A majority of the Iraqi Parliament has now cosponsored a bill asking us to leave. 
   It is sure not traditional conservatism to carry on a war in a country that did not attack us, did not even threaten to attack us, and was not even capable of attacking us. And it is sure not traditional conservatism to believe in world government even if run by the U.S. 
   Our war in Iraq has greatly damaged the Republican Party and conservatism in general. Even though this war has gone against every traditional conservative view, especially fiscal conservatism, it is seen by most as a conservative war. Even worse than the damage it has done to my party and a philosophy I believe in very deeply is the harm it has done to our relations with other countries, especially other countries in the Middle East. But worst of all, of course, is the fact that so many young Americans have been killed and horribly wounded in a very unnecessary war. 
   President Bush when he ran for office in 2000 campaigned strongly against nation building. Unfortunately, that is what we have been doing in Iraq. The President in 2000 said what we needed was a more humble foreign policy. That is what we needed then, and it is what we need now. 
   William F. Buckley, often called the godfather of conservatism, summed it up best in a column he wrote almost 2 years ago: ``A respect for the power of the United States is engendered by our success in engagements in which we take part. A point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose but misapplication of pride. It can't reasonably be disputed that if in the year ahead the situation in Iraq continues about as it has done in the past year, we will have suffered more than another 500 soldiers killed. Where there had been skepticism about our venture, there will be contempt.'' That was William F. Buckley in 2005, and the key point there, he said ``a point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose but misapplication of pride.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SAFE AMERICAN ROADS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to voice my support for H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007, which passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by unanimous vote, 100 percent support by both Democrats and Republicans. 
   In order to comply with NAFTA, the Department of Transportation has taken steps to fully open the Mexican border to truck traffic. To start this process, DOT has announced a cross-border demonstration program. The bill we are considering today specifies requirements that DOT must meet when implementing this program. 
   But compliance with NAFTA does not mean we have to or even that we should open the border without any scrutiny of the process. It is a priority for our committee and for this Congress to stay engaged on this issue and ensure that the border opening for trucks is handled properly with the safety of American motorists as our top priority. 
   A major theme of the bill we are considering today is constant review of the program as it is implemented by the Department of Transportation. 
   The bill requires DOT to ensure the trucks crossing into the U.S. not only understand our safety regulations for motor carriers, but that they are fully compliant with them as well. This bill also requires DOT to maintain an active review of the demonstration project. DOT must respond to the Inspector General's periodic reviews and provide comments and suggestions to make the program better. And when we mean better, we mean safer. 
   I want to say that this bill is an excellent example of bipartisanship. Concern over Mexican trucks does not fall on one side of the aisle or the other. Many Republicans and Democrats both feel strongly about this issue. It impacts the entire country. 
   Two bills were recently introduced that address this issue, one by our colleague, Mrs. Boyda from Kansas, and one by Mr. Hunter from California, on which I was an original cosponsor. While Mrs. Boyda's bill is the base bill and we certainly want to commend her, the bill we are considering today has many aspects from Mr. Hunter's bill as well, combined together to create the bill we are voting on today. I believe H.R. 1773 was made stronger by taking the best attributes from both the Boyda bill and the Hunter bill. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we need reciprocity. I said at a hearing on this legislation that we should not approve more Mexican trucking companies than American trucking companies that are approved to go into Mexico. We need reciprocity, and we need fairness for American trucking companies and American workers. Again, though, I will voice my support for this bill, H.R. 1773, and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   This bill is important for the safety of American roads, it's important to our American trucking companies, our small businesses, and to our truck drivers. It's legislation that all of our colleagues can support, and I urge our colleagues to do so.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my regret for missing several recorded votes during consideration of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2008. Unfortunately, I was called out of Washington to deliver the eulogy for a close friend of mine and my father's, Ed Bailey. Ed served the House of Representatives for 16 years as an aide to my late father, and I am honored to be making these remarks. This duty required that I leave for Knoxville prior to the final votes of Thursday, March 29, 2007. 
   I would like the RECORD to reflect that had I been in Washington, I would have supported the Republican Budget Substitute and opposed the underlying text of H. Con. Res. 99. 
   The reason for these votes is simple. I am fiscally conservative. The Democrat budget provides for tax hikes on Americans and America's businesses in order to pay for more Government spending. Also, this budget ignores the problems with our entitlement spending and defers these burdens to later generations. 
   I support the Republican budget because it continues to give American workers real tax benefits. It curbs out of control and inefficient discretionary spending. 
   The Ryan substitute also tackles the massive problem of entitlement spending and seeks to reform the Medicare and Medicaid systems. These reforms are absolutely necessary to ensure that these valuable programs are around for our children and their children.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the Chairman for revitalizing this important technical corrections bill and voice my support for H.R. 1195. I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   There were many minor errors--in policy and in Members projects--in SAFETEA-LU that need technical correction. 
   Most people may not remember, but the House and Senate actually passed a SAFETEA-LU technical corrections bill that was signed into law in October 2005. That bill was taken up with extreme urgency because it prevented the accidental shutdown of boat safety programs. 
   In the time that has passed since the October 2005 SAFETEA-LU technical corrections bill was signed into law, we have heard from DOT and various states regarding fixes to different programs and high priority projects. I believe H.R. 1195 addresses most of the areas which need correction. 
   It is important to note that this bill does not make substantial policy changes to SAFETEA-LU. Rather, this bill corrects provisions that were not ``workable'' in SAFETEA-LU. After we pass this bill, SAFETEA-LU will finally be able to accomplish what Congress voted to do 2 years ago. 
   H.R. 1195 addresses all of the true technical corrections except one. This bill does not include a correction to an error in the motor carrier title of SAFETEA-LU. 
   In SAFETEA-LU, we attempted to harmonize the definition of ``commercial motor vehicle'' with ``motor vehicle''. Unintentionally, this change removed trucks weighing 10,000 lbs or less from the truck exemption of the Fair Labor Standards Act and from DOT's safety oversight. 
   I am very concerned with this change in policy that was never negotiated for or discussed during the bill's original conference. 
   Now, small trucking business, who will have to change their business plan in order to comply with the law, are going to suffer the most. These are the small businesses who have high overhead and small profits, but are providing necessary services and products to urban areas and rural towns across the country. 
   This change is going to create great hardships on the small companies who are already in the business and most likely will inhibit others from entering the business. 
   It is disappointing this Congress has not addressed this problem, but I hope we can do so before final passage of this bill. 
   Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for revitalizing this technical correction bill and I hope all my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Carl Pope, the executive director of the Sierra Club, was quoted as saying, ``We are better off without cheap gas.'' Well, maybe the wealthy members of the Sierra Club aren't hurt by $4 gasoline and gasoline that will go much higher if we don't increase production, but many middle and lower income Americans are hurt by this, and we can't let radicals just put all types of energy production off-limits in this Nation if we are going to remain viable economically and not shut this country down from an economic standpoint. 
   This bill has been described by several people as a hoax bill. The hoax bill that we are considering now claims to lift the congressional moratorium on offshore drilling. In reality, it would keep 85 to 88 percent of offshore oil production off-limits and really allow drill only where there is very little oil and oil that is very expensive to get. 
   The hoax bill that claims to be a consumer protection act would raise taxes on oil companies by $17.7 billion. Well, who do you think pays these taxes? The consumer does, that is who. So the hoax bill protects consumers by passing on billions of new taxes to them. 
   The hoax bill allows States to opt in by allowing oil drilling, but does not allow States to share in the revenue. That is giving States no incentive to allow for this drilling. 
   The hoax bill does not even open up the 19.8 million acre Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where billions of barrels of oil could be produced. This is an area, Mr. Speaker, 36 times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where over 9 million people visit each year. Only a few hundred visit ANWR, and where they want to drill is a frozen tundra, millions of acres without a tree or bush on it. I have been there twice. They want to drill on only 2,000 or 3,000 acres out of these 19.8 million acres. 
   We passed this 12 years ago, but President Clinton vetoed it, thus stopping a million barrels a day for the U.S. every day since then. We were told then and several times since then that allowing more drilling wouldn't help immediately. But we said it would in a few years. 
   If the Republicans in Congress had their way, we never would have seen $4 a gallon gas. Now Republicans have bills that are not hoax bills and that would do something for the middle and lower income people of this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, finally, if we are ever going to lower the cost of gas and other forms of energy, we need to restore government of, by and for the people, and not government of, by and for wealthy environmentalists.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this very misnamed bill and the rule that brings it to the floor. 
   First, it claims to be a comprehensive bill, yet it has nothing about nuclear energy, clean coal or increasing refinery capacity and halts much oil shale development. Second, and more importantly, it has no reforms or limitations on lawsuits by special interests environmental groups. 
   Radical environmental groups have successfully used lawsuits, the courts and administrative procedures to stop or drastically slow down all types of energy production and have really shut down this country economically in many, many ways. They have opposed not only drilling for oil, but also digging for any coal, cutting any trees, or, heaven forbid, any new nuclear plants. They want to go to wind power, but they oppose putting up any windmills. 
   I have noticed that almost all radical environmentalists come from very wealthy or very upper-income families. Perhaps they aren't hurt by high gas prices, high utility bills, higher prices for everything made out of wood and higher prices for everything. But almost all middle- and lower-income people are hurt by these higher prices.

   Mr. DUNCAN. The trucking and railroad industries have been hit especially hard by higher diesel fuel costs. The president of Burlington Northern and Sante Fe Railroad told me his company spent $1 billion on fuel in all of 2003, and spent over $1 billion on fuel just in the first quarter of this year. All of these costs are passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. 
   The Air Transport Association says each one penny increase in jet fuel costs the aviation industry $200 million a year. Jet fuel has gone up far more than one penny, leading to much higher fares for the hundreds of millions who fly each year.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Keller), who very rightly claims east Tennessee as a home also. I am pleased to join with him. I want to commend him for his work on this legislation. I also want to especially commend the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) for their comments about this legislation. 
   I originally agreed to cosponsor H.R. 980 several years ago, several Congresses ago, at the request of firefighters and police officers from my district. I certainly am not anti-union, nor am I controlled by any union. I strongly believe, though, that no one should be forced to join a union. But I also feel that anyone who chooses to organize or join a labor union should have that right. Employees should be able to make this decision for themselves. In fact, I am a cosponsor, and have been in several Congresses, of H.R. 697, the National Right-to-Work Act. This legislation would prohibit compulsory union membership by applying the right-to-work laws that we have in Tennessee to the entire Nation. 
   In regard to H.R. 980, I want to emphasize four of the act's main points and then provide some additional details. First, this bill specifically prohibits strikes and lockouts by public safety employees and employers, as has been pointed out by previous speakers.  
   Second, the bill is not mandatory. It is totally voluntary and, therefore, is a right-to-work bill. Third, it does not federalize or nationalize this aspect of labor relations. The important details would still be governed by State law. 
   As has been pointed out by some other speakers, several States give their public safety employees more collective bargaining rights than this bill, and it certainly hasn't caused any problems that anyone knows of in those States. 
   Finally, this bill would simply give firefighters and police officers some, but not all, of the rights enjoyed by other workers. The legislation provides very limited collective bargaining rights and does not give State and local public safety employees the right to strike or numerous other rights that almost all other employees have. 
   Over the years, Congress has enacted a number of laws granting such rights to other workers and has expanded the scope of collective bargaining laws to govern private sector, nonprofit association, transportation and Federal Government employees. 
   Since the enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act, State and local public safety employees are the only workers left in America who do not have the right to enter into collective bargaining agreements with their employers. While most States provide collective bargaining rights for these employees, others do not. 
   When this legislation was being considered originally during the 105th Congress, local firefighters and police officers contacted me directly regarding the bill. Unfortunately, as local elected officials changed, these public safety workers have found that their benefits and wages have sometimes been subject to change, too. These firefighters and police officers feel that this legislation will help them establish consistency in their benefits between the administrations. 
   Firefighters and police officers have taken an oath to protect public safety. I believe that these individuals should have the opportunity to voice their concerns about issues affecting their livelihood. These brave people risk their lives for public safety every day and should have the same rights as workers in other fields. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just mention, as others have, that the Fraternal Order of Police and other police of the National Association of Police Organizations are supporting this bill, and the International Association of Firefighters. 
   Mr. Speaker, finally, I will close just by emphasizing once again that this legislation would give firefighters and police officers an option to participate in collective bargaining discussions but would not require such action. 
   I think the good labor unions do not need compulsory unionism agreements. I believe that this is a bill that is encouraging and voluntary, and I urge its support.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, in the last 2 days there have been two major stories about comments made by the prime minister of Iraq. In the first, he said that terrorism in Iraq has been defeated. In the second, the Iraqi prime minister said he wants to negotiate a departure date for U.S. troops. 
   Yet, because the Defense Department has requested more money for Iraq this year than any year of the war so far, you can rest assured that we will not be leaving any time soon. This war has always been more about money and power than about any real threat to the U.S. Saddam Hussein's total military budget was only a little over 2/10 of 1 percent of ours. 
   As the conservative columnist Charley Reese wrote a few years ago: We attacked a country that had not attacked us, that had not even threatened to attack us, and was not even capable of attacking us.'' 
   Now some are gloating about the success of the surge as if this somehow justifies all the deaths, all the injuries, and all the waste, fraud, and abuse of previous years. Well, surely with the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, there would be a few successes along the way. 
   It is not criticism of the troops to say that this was a very unnecessary war that we should never have been in, in the first place. This war has meant massive foreign aid, huge deficit spending, and has put almost the entire burden of enforcing U.N. resolutions on our taxpayers and on our military. It has gone against every traditional conservative position I have ever known. 
   The Democrats recently passed a budget raising our national debt limit to $10.5 trillion. We are still borrowing staggering amounts of money, and this war has been our largest single expense. The Defense Department, like any giant bureaucracy, always wants more money, yet we simply cannot afford to keep spending at the rate our military leaders want. 
   Georgie Anne Geyer, the conservative foreign policy columnist, wrote a few months after the Iraqi war started that, ``Americans will inevitably come to a point where they have to choose between a government that provides services at home or one that seeks empire across the globe.'' 
   This war has already become the most expensive and wasteful war in American history. There has not been anything fiscally conservative about the war in Iraq. In fact, there has been so much waste of money, so much fraud, so much excessive and lavish spending that fiscal conservatives should be the ones most upset about all this. 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, we already have $53 trillion to $54 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities on top of our national debt, and this figure is going up every day. We are now spending at the rate of $500 million a day, every day, for our military ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan. In just a few short years we will not be able to pay our Social Security and veterans pensions and all the other things we have promised our own people with money that will buy very much. 
   Evan Thomas in the June 23 issue of Newsweek wrote, ``American politicians have gone to extraordinary lengths to be seen as Churchill, not Chamberlain, with results that have not always been in America's best interest.'' 
   He wrote that Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic were frequently compared to Hitler. ``But,'' Thomas wrote, ``the only real Hitler was Hitler. Saddam and Milosevic were murderers, but at most local menaces.'' 
   Both parties are falling all over themselves trying to prove their patriotism, and thus are afraid to question any Pentagon expenditure. And the Defense Department seems to know that no matter how wasteful or inefficient it becomes, that Congress will keep on giving it huge increases. 
   Where are the fiscal conservatives? Where are those who will say that, since the surge has been successful, we need to spend less money in Iraq, not more? Where are those who supported this war who will not back up the Iraqi prime minister and say it is time to start bringing our troops home? 
   Surely conservatives, who have always been the biggest opponents of world government, are not going to say we should keep on running Iraq and simply stay there forever regardless of how the Iraqis themselves feel. 
   At some point we need to start putting our own people first once again. At some point, Madam Speaker, we need to stop borrowing hundreds of billions to spend in other countries, and take care of our own people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF WORLD WATER DAY -- (House of Representatives - April 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I thank, first of all, the gentlelady from Florida, the new ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, for yielding me this time and for her kind words and her strong support of this legislation. I also commend Chairman Lantos for bringing this resolution to the floor. But I especially want to commend my good friend and colleague, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for his work in bringing this matter to the floor today and also calling attention to what is a very, very serious problem. 
   I had the privilege of chairing the Aviation Subcommittee for 6 years, and that subcommittee seemed to generate a lot of attention and publicity. Then I chaired for 6 years the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, and unfortunately I think people did not pay as much attention to that subcommittee; and I thought it was just as important, perhaps more important, than the Aviation Subcommittee. And yet I said many times there probably is nothing that the people in this country take for granted as much as they do our clean water and wastewater infrastructure in this Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, much work needs to be done in this country in regard to our water to keep it to the standards that the people of this country want. And so the day after tomorrow we will hopefully pass a long overdue bill, the Water Resources Development Act, a bill that we passed two or three times here in the House, that has been held up in the Senate, but that is very, very important for our water infrastructure in this Nation. 
   You have heard some of the statistics already. My statistics vary just a little bit. I was given the information that 1.2 billion don't have access to clean water; Chairman Lantos said a lower figure, I think Mr. Blumenauer said a higher figure, but it is an astounding number of people, whatever the exact number is, that don't have access to a good, clean water source. 
   Water-related diseases, as Chairman Lantos said, kill over 5 million people each year. Six million are blind today because of trachoma, an eye infection  spread through poor hygiene caused by dirty water and unsanitary conditions. I could give all kinds of statistics. 
   As the gentlelady from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) said, I was proud that in my hometown of Knoxville recently, the city council, at the urging of our great Mayor Bill Haslam, passed a proclamation in support of World Water Day. This was done without my knowledge, and so I am pleased that other people are helping to call attention to what is one of the most serious problems that this world faces today. 
   And so I think that it is very appropriate that the Congress take up a resolution at this time, and I think that this will help lead to progress in this area, much, much needed progress; and I urge support for this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (PROMOTING THE SAFE OPERATION OF 15-PASSENGER VANS -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio for his strong and enthusiastic support for this resolution, and I want to add my support for House Resolution 964. 
   I introduced this resolution because of a tragic 15-passenger van accident last July in which a 10-year-old girl from my hometown of Knoxville was killed. 
   Alexis ``Lexie'' James was traveling in a 15-passenger van being driven by close family friends to Savannah, Georgia, for a softball tournament. The driver was not a professional driver with a commercial driver's license. In fact, a commercial driver's license is not required to drive 15-passenger vans. This van was privately owned, and there were only five passengers: the dad and mom, their 16- and 10-year-old children, and Lexie. 
   On July 17, 2007, as the van was traveling east on Interstate 26 near St. Matthews, South Carolina, the left rear tire of the van blew out, and the van ran off the right side of the highway, down an embankment, overturned, struck a fence, crossed the frontage road, and came to rest on its side. 
   Everyone in the van was wearing a seat belt, but somehow Lexie slipped out of her belt and was ejected from the van onto the frontage road and was killed. 
   I have met with Lexie's dad, Patrick James, and he is asking some hard questions about the safety of 15-passenger vans. The resolution we are considering today focuses on safety issues that are firmly within the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee regarding driver and passenger behavior, including the need for better driver training and passenger safety information. 
   A 15-passenger van does not handle or operate like a larger version of a passenger car. These vans have a higher center of gravity, which makes them less stable and more difficult to handle. In addition, the bodies of the vans extend 4 to 5 feet beyond the rear wheels, causing instability during emergency maneuvers such as sudden turns. This causes the vans to fishtail, and because they are top heavy and may be overloaded in the rear, they are prone to roll over and result in devastating crashes. 
   In May of 2005, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a consumer advisory safety warning to all drivers of these vehicles. The precautions that NHTSA recommends for all drivers of 15-passenger vans are: 
   One, keep your passenger load light. 
   Two, check your van's tire pressure every week. 
   Three, require all occupants to use seat belts or the appropriate child restraint. 
   Four, if possible, seat passengers and place cargo forward of the rear axle. 
   Five, do not place loads on the van's roof. 
   Six, be very mindful of speed and road conditions. 
   Better driver training and more thorough dissemination of safety tips like these are the best tools we have right now to help save the lives of other children and adults riding in 15-passenger vans. 
   As Chairman DeFazio just stated, this resolution is a first step towards calling the public's attention to the very dangerous situation or condition of some of these 15-passenger vans and how prone they are to very serious vehicle accidents. 
   I strongly support this resolution and hope to make this important safety issue a priority for the Nation. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I first would like to thank Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, and Mr. DeFazio, the chairman of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee, for continuing to work on this important technical corrections bill. I rise to voice my support for H.R. 1195 as amended by the Senate, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. This is the fifth time we have brought a SAFETEA-LU technical corrections bill to the House floor in the past 2 years. 
   The bill we are considering today is H.R. 1195. This is a bill that the House passed in March of 2007. The House also passed a more recent version of SAFETEA-LU technical corrections on August 1, 2007, H.R. 3248. As Chairman Oberstar mentioned, that bill passed the House with only one dissenting vote. The Senate has amended H.R. 1195 so that the version of H.R. 1195 that we are considering today includes all the changes that were made in H.R. 3248. 
   Once the President signs this bill, SAFETEA-LU will finally be able to accomplish what the Congress voted for it to do almost 3 years ago. There were many minor errors in policy and in Members' projects in SAFETEA-LU that needed technical correction.     
   We have heard from the U.S. Department of Transportation and several State DOTs regarding fixes to different programs and high priority projects. I believe this bill addresses most of the issues that have been brought to our attention. 
   This bill makes critical corrections to the Federal Highway Research Program to ensure that the department can continue essential research programs, including the Future Strategic Highway Research Program and the University Transportation Center Research Program. The bill also corrects several drafting errors regarding the Magnetic Levitation Transportation Deployment Program. 
   It is important to note that this bill does not make substantial policy changes to SAFETEA-LU. Rather, this bill corrects provisions that were not workable by State DOTs or the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   Let me just add a couple of things. Ranking Member Mica, Chairman Oberstar and others have mentioned that our economy needs this bill. Just a couple of hours ago, I met with homebuilders from my district in Tennessee. In 2000, Fortune Magazine said the Knoxville metropolitan area was the most popular place to move to in the whole country based on the number moving in in relation to fewest moving out. Ours has been a very popular, fast growing area. Yet this group of homebuilders told me that their market was down 60 percent just from last year. I have been hearing similar stories. We have got some problems that need work. 
   One of the Republican Presidential candidates was talking about the stimulus package that we passed earlier and they said the problem with it was that we were going to be borrowing money from the Chinese so that people could buy Chinese products. I am not really talking about the merits or demerits of that bill, but he suggested that what we should do is have a stimulus package on infrastructure, because that would be doing things that needed to be done here in this country and the money would be going to American workers to do that very needed work in this country. So I think that is something that we might want to consider at a later point. 
   But I simply will close at this time by once again thanking our great chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and my boss and good friend, Ranking Member Mica, for their persistence on this technical corrections bill. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (HUGE COST OVERRUNS AT PENTAGON -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, the front page of the Washington Post today carries a story about $295 billion in cost overruns at the Pentagon; $295 billion. That is a mind-boggling, almost incomprehensible figure to anyone who stops to think about it. The headline reads, ``GAO Blasts Weapons Budget.'' 
   Listen to this story. Government auditors issued a scathing review yesterday of dozens of the Pentagon's biggest weapons systems, saying ships, aircraft and satellites are billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. The story continues, ``The Government Accountability Office found that 95 major systems have exceeded their original budgets by a total of $295 billion, bringing their total cost to $1.6 trillion and are delivered almost 2 years late, on average.     
   Apparently, there are no fiscal conservatives at the Pentagon. Apparently they believe that the Congress will just keep giving them more money, no matter how wasteful or inefficient they become. Of course, almost all the defense contractors hire plenty of admirals and generals, so almost all of these contracts are sweetheart deals anyway. 
   It is what the International Herald Tribune a few years ago called the ``revolving door'' at the Pentagon. $1.6 trillion in total costs, and $295 billion in cost overruns, and this was just on the major systems. No telling how much more was wasted on the smaller contracts. 
   $295 billion would run the entire government of Tennessee, schools, health care, roads, prisons, parks, and on and on for the next 11 years. 
   Then, on top of all this waste, the request for the Iraq War for the coming fiscal year is $189 billion, or over $500 million a day. Apparently we are having so much success over there that we have to give them more money, more troops and more contractors than ever before. 
   There is nothing fiscally conservative about the war in Iraq. Conservatives, above all, should realize that any gigantic government bureaucracy is always going to ask for more money and always find reasons to justify it. 
   And Congress is afraid to cut the Defense Department for fear of being seen as unpatriotic. Yet, it is a very false and very blind patriotism that allows the Pentagon to continually waste mega billions and allows the Defense Department to spend like there is no tomorrow. 
   In a few short years, we will not be able to pay all of our Social Security, Medicare, veterans' pensions, veterans' health care and many other things if we do not bring Federal spending under some type of control. 
   In a newsletter I sent to my constituents in Tennessee a few weeks ago I wrote these words before I knew about these cost overruns I've spoken about today. ``Jonah Goldberg wrote in a recent issue of National Review that the `insight that involvement abroad fuels the expansion of the state was central to the formation of the modern conservative and libertarian movements.' 
   ``In other words, perpetual war leads to bigger government and goes very much against traditional conservatism. 
   ``Yet some conservatives have fallen into a trap of never questioning any military expenditure even though there is great waste and overspending in the military just as there is in any giant government bureaucracy. 
   ``Our Constitution is a very conservative document, and our founding fathers felt very strongly that we should have civilian control of the military: 
   ``Service in our military is very honorable and patriotic, but we need strong national defense, not international defense. 
   ``We simply cannot afford to be the policeman of the world, and with the speed of communication and transportation today, we do not need our military in so many countries. 
   ``Conservatives should support an efficient, fiscally conservative military, but it should not believe in turning the Department of Defense into the Department of Foreign Aid as it is in many ways today.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (FEDERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE ENHANCEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I would like to commend Chairman Waxman and my colleague from New York, my longtime friend (Mr. Towns), with whom, as he noted, we share the same birthday, for bringing the Federal Customer Service Enhancement Act to the floor today. I also appreciate their efforts as it moved through committee, and I certainly want to thank him for accommodating comments and concerns we raised during the process. As Chairman Towns noted, he has included and the chairman has included in this legislation concerns that the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) raised and also has included legislation that I introduced, H.R. 2324, in this bill. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I fully support this bill, and I want to commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) for his hard work on this, and we will hear from him in just a few minutes. 
   The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has always sought to improve the performance of the Federal Government, and as anyone who has ever worked in the private sector knows, customer service is the lifeblood of any organization. 
   As we often look to the private sector for best practices, I think it is important, Mr. Speaker, that we in the Federal Government are able to capture data on how each and every agency is doing in regard to customer service. The administration continues to work with us on this bill so no unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles are created. 
   This bill recognizes the importance of the agencies within the Federal Government to be responsive to their various constituencies and for the government to remain accountable to the American taxpayer. Responsiveness and accountability are the things that really are behind this legislation. 
   I particularly appreciate section 2 in which the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall develop standards and measures of customer service performance. I think that is very important and is a first. It has not been done before within the Federal Government. And especially, also, the parts in section 3, which incorporate much of my legislation and require customer service information such as a mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address. It requires the appointment of a customer relations representative. And one thing I have noticed, I have gotten letters from Federal Departments and agencies in the past, and there has been no mailing address, no phone number on there, almost as if the people within that Department or agency really didn't want to be bothered by their bosses, bothered by the American people calling on them or finding out how to contact them, and making it very difficult for many people to do so. 
   Section 5 is another good section of this bill and really is the result of the work of the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), and that includes some incentives in there to do better jobs. Bonuses to Federal employees will now be based, at least in part, on customer service. 
   So with all of these things, I think this is good legislation. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 404. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to honor a remarkable First Lady and great conservationist, Lady Bird Johnson. And it is with much sadness that the House continues to note her recent passing. 
   Born in 1912 in Karnack, Texas, in an era when women were not expected to accomplish great things, Mrs. Johnson came to represent strength of character that was the hallmark of her life. 
   After graduating from the University of Texas in 1933, she married Lyndon Baines Johnson. Mrs. Johnson became the mother of two daughters, certainly her most important work, Lynda Bird and Luci Baines Johnson. She spent the next few decades raising her children and supporting her husband in his political career, which, of course, led him to the Presidency. She was a trusting sounding board for her husband through all his years in the House and Senate and in the White House. 
   Mrs. Johnson led a nationwide effort to call attention to the beauty and the goal of highlighting historical sites and highways by planting flowering plants and wildflowers. While First Lady, she visited numerous public sites and scenic areas, thus bringing local and national attention to her beautification and conservation initiatives. 
   As we all have seen each spring in Washington, Mrs. Johnson has left a lasting legacy for all American and foreign visitors to this great city, who can now see incredible numbers of flowers throughout the area. She not only helped beautify Washington, but was also responsible for the 1965 Highway Beautification Act, calling for control of outdoor advertising, as well as the clean-up of junkyards along the national highways. 
   It is partly because of her efforts that we now have the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, requiring at least one-quarter of 1 percent of funds expended for landscaping projects in the highway system to be used to plant native flowers, plants and trees. 
   After leaving Washington, Mrs. Johnson enthusiastically continued her conservation efforts throughout her beloved home State of Texas right up until the date of her death on July 11, 2007. 
   I urge my colleagues to please join me in honoring this great woman of Texas and First Lady of the United States, Lady Bird Johnson, for her untiring efforts in educating a Nation on the benefits of conservation and beautification throughout her lifetime. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H. Res. 528 commemorates the Town of New Milford, Connecticut, on its 300th anniversary. New Milford is not the largest city, but under the definitions of the State, it is the largest town within the State, with a population of nearly 30,000 residents. This quaint and friendly community is home to thriving businesses and manufacturing industries and has abundant historical roots. 
   New Milford was established and founded in 1707 when John Noble, Sr. of Westfield, Massachusetts, purchased a large portion of land for his family. More families arrived in the new community soon afterwards, and the settlement began to flourish. Over time, new churches and schools were founded, and in 1774, the town saw 285 of its men leave to serve in the Revolutionary War. 
   In its 300 years, New Milford has seen weather-related tragedies, devastating illnesses, and damaging fires hit the town. But it has overcome these tragedies and events and today has many successful industries and businesses. 
   New Milford educates its residents and visitors each year through cultural tours, concert events, art fairs, and camps. It has witnessed much history and seen tremendous growth in its 300 years and is certainly one of the most pleasant places to live in this Nation today. 
   I am pleased to support H. Res. 528 to honor this historic 300th anniversary.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (EVEN THE SOLDIERS WILL TELL YOU: ``NOTHING'S GOING TO HELP'' -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I voted against going to war in Iraq when Congress voted on this in October of 2002, and I am opposed to sending more troops there now. 
   President Bush has said that he is going to listen mainly to his commanders. I wish he would listen to Specialist Don Roberts, 22, of Paonia, Colorado, now on his second tour in Iraq, who told the Associated Press, ``What could more guys do? We can't pick sides. It's almost like we have to watch them kill each other and then ask questions.'' 
   Sergeant Josh Keim of Canton, Ohio, also on his second tour said, ``Nothing is going to help. It is a religious war and we are caught in the middle of it.'' 
   Saddam Hussein was an evil man, but he had a total military budget a little over two-tenths of 1 percent of ours, most of which he spent protecting himself and his family and building castles. He was no threat to us at all. 
   But even before the war started, Fortune Magazine had an article saying that an American occupation would be ``prolonged and expensive'' and would make U.S. soldiers sitting ducks for Islamic terrorists. 
   Now we have had more than 3,000 young Americans killed, many thousands more wounded horribly, and have spent $400 billion and the Pentagon wants $170 billion more. Most of what we have spent has been purely foreign aid in nature: Rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, giving free medical care, training police, giving jobs to several hundred thousand Iraqis, and on and on. 
   Our Constitution does not give us the authority to run another country as we have in reality been doing in Iraq. With a national debt of almost $9 trillion, we cannot afford it. To me, our misadventure in Iraq is both unconstitutional and unaffordable. 
   Some have said it was a mistake to start this war, but now that we are there we have to ``finish the job'' and we cannot ``cut and run.'' Well, if you find out you are going down the wrong way down the interstate, you get off at the next exit. 
   Very few pushed as hard for us to go to war in Iraq as did syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Last week, he wrote that the Maliki government we have installed there cares only about making sure that the Shiites dominate the Sunnis. And he wrote, ``We should not be surging American troops in defense of such a government,'' Krauthammer wrote. ``Maliki should be made to know that if he insists on having this sectarian war he can well have it without us.'' 
   There is no way we can keep all of our promises to our own people on Social Security, veterans benefits, and many other things in the years ahead if we keep trying to run the whole word. 
   As another columnist, Georgie Anne Geyer, wrote more than 3 years ago, ``Americans will inevitably come to a point where they will see they have to have a government that provides services at home or one that seeks empire across the globe.'' 
   We should help other countries during humanitarian crises, and we should have trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges, but conservatives have traditionally been the strongest opponents to interventionist foreign policies that create so much resentment around the world. We need to return to the more humble foreign policy President Bush advocated when he campaigned in 2000. 
   We need to tell all these defense contractors that the time for this Iraqi gravy train with its obscene profits is over. It is time to bring our troops home, Mr. Speaker. 
   I wrote that in a column that ran last Friday in Tennessee's highest circulation newspaper, the Nashville Tennessean, but let me just add this: William F. Buckley, who has often been called the Godfather of Conservativism, wrote about 1 1/2 years ago, ``A point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose but misapplication of pride.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot win a civil war between the Shiites and the Sunnis. There can be no victory for us in such a war. 
   Mr. Speaker, as a teenager I sent my first paycheck as a bag boy at the A&P grocery store as a contribution to the Barry Goldwater campaign. I have been a staunch conservative since high school. This war in Iraq went against every conservative position I have ever known. We need to return Iraq back to Iraqis and start putting our own people first once again.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LAND -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, today the Federal Government owns over 30 percent of the land in this country. State and local governments and quasi-governmental agencies are controlling the other 20 percent. Half the land, 50 percent, is in some type of government or public ownership or control. 
   We could probably live with this, but the problem is that government at all levels keeps taking over more and more property at a faster rate than ever before. 
   People don't get upset unless or until their property gets taken. And it sounds great for a politician to create a park, but now we have so many parks, recreation areas, nature preserves, national forests, and on and on that we can't take care of all of them. 
   We are constantly being told we have a mega-billion-dollar maintenance backlog for the national parks and all these other public areas; yet we keep taking over more land. You really can never satisfy government's appetite for money or land. 
   We just do not teach our young people how important private property is to both our freedom and our prosperity. We see this most clearly in the fact that counties that have high percentages of public land are almost always poverty areas or at least counties with incomes far below the national average. Also, because we keep taking so much land off the tax rolls, we keep shrinking our tax base at the same time that all of the schools and government agencies tell us they need more money.  
   Now almost every State has gone to lotteries, casinos, or some type of gambling in a desperate attempt to get more revenue because property taxes just don't raise enough money since so much land has been taken off the tax rolls. Because of this, I believe gambling addiction is going to become a real problem in this country in the years ahead. 
   Another part of this problem is that government at all levels keeps putting more and more restrictions on the land that remains in private hands. The Washington Post had a headline a few months ago that said: ``Judge Saves Land From Development.'' It might also have said: ``Judge Preserves Land for Wealthy'' or ``Judge Keeps Young People From Buying Homes.'' 
   Preventing more land from development is driving up the cost of homeownership and putting it out of reach for many young families. It is also forcing more people into apartments or townhouses or homes on postage-stamp-size lots, leading to new problems from congestion. 
   The Washington Times pointed out that more than five times as much land, more than five times as much land, has been set aside as national parks, wilderness areas, Federal forests, and Federal grazing areas than has ever been developed. Today, you could put every family of four in the State of Texas and give them 3 acres of lands each and leave the whole rest of the country empty. Over three-fourths of the population lives on 3 1/2 percent of the land.

This resolution was introduced by Representative Blumenauer and cosponsored by Chairman Oberstar, Highways and Transit Subcommittee Chairman DeFazio, the subcommittee of which I have the privilege of being the ranking member, and Representative Petri, to honor the 200th anniversary of the Gallatin report on roads and canals, a first-of-its-kind assessment for Federal interests and investment in our Nation's transportation infrastructure. 
   In 1808, when he presented the report, Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin urged the Federal Government to focus on three basic concepts. 
   The first concept was that it is appropriate for the Federal Government to finance transportation projects that transcend local needs. Second, only projects that yield a return on investment should be constructed. Third, a nationwide system of transportation is essential in the interest of national defense. 
   All of these concepts that Gallatin proposed 200 years ago are relevant to the challenges that our Nation faces today and in the future. 
   I also appreciate that the resolution has incorporated the need for a new national transportation plan. Ranking Member Mica has, for some time, advocated for a new national transportation plan that provides a long-term strategic approach to funding our Nation's transportation infrastructure system so that we can continue to be competitive in a worldwide economy. 
   I believe that Secretary Gallatin would have supported this type of vision for the future of our transportation system, and I certainly hope that my colleagues will as well. 
   I have said many times, Mr. Speaker, that the people in Tennessee use the roads in Ohio and California, and people in New York and Michigan use the roads in Tennessee. There is very much a significant and legitimate national interest in our transportation system in this country. 
   Also, I appreciated the Speaker's remarks about the need to invest in and improve our Nation's infrastructure. I heard someone say about the last stimulus package that what we were really doing was borrowing money from China so that the people could go out and buy Chinese products. If we spend money on our infrastructure, we will be spending that money here and the money will be going to American workers to do these projects. And many of them are very, very necessary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think this resolution is very appropriate, and I urge my colleagues to support this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and once again I urge support for this resolution. 
   I will say this: We have had many, many hearings in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee about the need to greatly improve our infrastructure in this country. We attempted, in the last highway bill, to put in some environmental streamlining. These projects are taking about three times as long and costing about three times as much because of environmental rules and regulations and red tape. We have got to speed up these infrastructure projects. The other developed nations are doing these projects in a third or half the time that we are, and that's going to really harm this country in the future if we don't speed these projects up. 
   Also, if we don't have more domestic energy production, we're going to make ourselves much more vulnerable to foreign energy producers, but we're not going to be able to afford the infrastructure projects that we really need to do in this country. So those are two thoughts that we need to take into consideration when we consider a resolution like this. 
   But I commend my colleagues, Chairman DeFazio and Mr. Blumenauer and Mr. Petri, for this resolution, and I urge its support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (KEEPING OUR PROMISES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, first I want to commend David Walker for his years of service as U.S. Comptroller General, heading up the Government Accountability Office. Mr. Walker is a highly respected CPA from Atlanta and for the last few years has been trying to be a Paul Revere about the horrible financial condition of the Federal Government. He has appeared before many Congressional committees and on television and has traveled around the country trying to sound the alarm about our $9 trillion national debt, and, even worse, our $53 trillion in unfunded future pension liabilities. 
   Two days ago in the Washington Times he was quoted from testimony he gave about Iraqi oil revenues. ``The Iraqis have a budget surplus,'' Mr. Walker said. ``We have a huge budget deficit. One of the questions is who should be paying.'' 
   Stewart Bowen, Inspector General for Iraq reconstruction, said increased production, along with the highest oil prices in history, ``coalesce into an enormous windfall for the Iraqi government.'' Mr. Bowen said Iraqi oil revenue is now around $60 billion, and probably headed higher. 
   Most estimates are that we have been spending approximately $12 billion a month on the war in Iraq, a really astounding figure if you stop to think about it. However, even worse, the request for this fiscal year is $189 billion, or $15.75 billion a month. This comes out to $500 million a day. 
   There is certainly nothing fiscally conservative about the war in Iraq. William F. Buckley, Jr., was an inspiring figure to almost every conservative Republican. In the current issue of the New Republic, John Judis begins an article about Mr. Buckley in this way: ``In the last years of his life, William F. Buckley, Jr., who died on February 27 at the age of 82, broke with many of his fellow conservatives by pronouncing the Iraq war a failure. He even expressed doubt about as to whether George W. Bush is really a conservative, and he asked the same about neoconservatives.'' 
   Mr. Buckley wrote in 2004 that if he had known in 2002 what he then knew, he would have opposed the war in Iraq. 
   More significantly, in June of 2005, he wrote, ``A respect for the power of the United States is engendered by our success in engagements in which we take part. A point is reached when tenacity conveys not steadfastness of purpose, but misapplication of pride.'' Mr. Buckley continued, ``It can't reasonably be disputed that if in the year ahead the situation in Iraq continues as bad as it has done in the past year, we will have suffered more than another 500 soldiers killed. Where there had been skepticism about our venture, there will then be contempt.'' 
   The major difference is that instead of just 500 more soldiers killed, we have had more than 2,000 killed since Mr. Buckley wrote that. Earlier in 2005 he had written that the time had come to get out. 
   There is nothing traditionally conservative about the war in Iraq. It is huge deficit spending. It is massive foreign aid. It is placing really the entire burden of enforcing U.N. resolutions on our taxpayers and our military, when conservatives have traditionally been the biggest critics of the U.N. This war has gone against every traditional conservative position. 
   In addition, our Constitution does not give us the authority to govern Iraq, which is what in reality we have been doing. All this against an enemy whose military budget was only a little over two-tenths of one percent of ours, most of which was used by Saddam Hussein to build castles and protect himself and his family. Iraq was no threat to us whatsoever. 
   As the conservative columnist Charley Reese wrote, ``The war in Iraq was against a country that was not attacking us, did not have the means to attack us, and had never expressed any intention of attacking us. And for whatever real reason we attacked Iraq, it was not to save America from any danger, imminent or otherwise.'' 
   Similarly, nationally-syndicated columnist Georgie Ann Guyer wrote a few months after the war started, ``Critics of the war against Iraq have said since the beginning of the conflict that Americans, still strangely complacent about overseas wars being waged by minorities in their name, will inevitably come to a point where they will see they have to have a government that provides services at home or one that seeks empires across the globe.'' 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we have to choose. Do we keep spending mind-boggling amounts of money in Iraq, or do we keep our promises to our own people? We cannot afford to do both.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Florida, the ranking member, for yielding me this time; and I thank him for giving me the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the Highway and Transit Subcommittee. It is a pleasure to work with him and Chairman Oberstar and with my good friend, Chairman Peter DeFazio, on the Highway and Transit Subcommittee. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3248 make technical corrections to the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, or what we typically call SAFETEA-LU. 
   This is the fourth time we have worked to finalize these technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU. During the 109th Congress, the House passed H.R. 5689, a bill to make technical corrections to SAFETEA-LU in June, 2006. During the summer and fall of 2006, we worked with the Senate to create the bipartisan H.R. 6233, which was a very similar product to the bill that we passed at the beginning of this Congress. Now we are trying again; and hopefully this bill, H.R. 3248, will go to the President for his signature of this very necessary bill. 
   As my colleagues have said, this bill makes numerous technical corrections to the Federal Surface Transportation Programs authorized by SAFETEA-LU. The technical corrections included in this bill have been identified by the Department of Transportation and State DOTs and are mostly of a conforming nature or to correct drafting errors. 
   The most important correction we are making is to strengthen the Federal Highway Research Program by ensuring the continuation of the legacy research programs carried out by the Department of Transportation. This research hopefully will lead to not only safer highways but also less congestion, which is very, very important to this Nation, that we work on that. 
   The largest section of this bill is section 105, which makes changes to almost 350 of the high-priority projects in section 1702 of SAFETEA-LU. These changes address ``broken'' surface transportation projects, clarifying recipients and increasing certain project funding levels and decreasing others to achieve budget neutrality. 
   I especially appreciate the fact that Chairman Oberstar and Ranking Member Mica have allowed me to put in language that will allow the city of Knoxville to go forward with a very important transit center project; and, also, I am very pleased that we are rearranging some funding so that the very small town of Calhoun, Tennessee, in my district, can pave some roads. This is very, very important to them. So often we leave out the small towns in rural areas or they don't get nearly as much attention and funding as the big cities do. 
   This is a very good bill, and I urge the support of all of my colleagues. I think it is one that will pass with total bipartisan support.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1495, WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Water Resources Development Act, one of the most important bills we will take up in this Congress and I think certainly one of the most important environmental bills; and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) for yielding me this time. 
   This bill contains flood control projects, environmental restoration projects, wastewater system improvements, water projects all over the country in rural areas, small towns, medium-size cities and large cities. And in many of these areas, our water systems are 50 or 75 or even 100 years old and are in desperate need for work and improvement and, many times, new construction. 
   I had the privilege, as my friend from South Carolina (Mr. Brown) mentioned, of serving as chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years; and during that time, as the gentlelady from California (Ms. Matsui) mentioned, we passed the WRDA bill twice, once with only 8 votes against it, once with only 14 votes against it. Unfortunately, the bill did not pass in the Senate. 
   In this Congress, under the leadership of my good friend, Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, and my friend, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker), and certainly under the leadership of our full committee chairman, our outstanding chairman, Mr. Oberstar, the gentleman from Minnesota, and the Ranking Member Mica from Florida, this bill passed not only the House, but it passed the Senate by a vote of 91-4. So there is tremendous support, bipartisan support, for this legislation from people all over the country. 
   You know, if an automobile needs an oil change and you don't get it, a very low-cost matter, an engine can later explode and cost thousands of dollars; and that's sort of the situation we're in with many of our water systems from around the country. As several people have noted, this is a 7-year bill, and it deals with these water needs that have built up over all of that time. 
   I think it's a very fiscally conservative bill. As expensive as it is in one way, it's only a little over a month and a half of what we're spending in Iraq. And comparing these 7 years of built-up needs to what we're doing in the little over 1 1/2 and a half months in Iraq, I think makes this a very conservative bill. 
   I had the privilege of chairing the Aviation Subcommittee for 6 years before I chaired the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years, and in both of those areas I saw that there were very strong, competing interests in those areas. But, in this bill, we brought all these competing interests together. There was a great deal of compromise that went on and a great deal of work was put into this legislation. 
   I'm very proud to support this bill. I think it's good for this Nation. I know it's good for my home area of east Tennessee, where we have so many water needs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just want to commend everybody who has worked so hard on this legislation. It's very important for this country. There is nothing that the people in this country take for granted like we do our clean water and wastewater systems, and we desperately need this work to be done. 
   I think this is a bipartisan legislation that all of our colleagues can and should support.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Dick Armey, our former majority leader, said in an interview with a major newspaper chain last week that he deeply regretted voting for the war in Iraq. Mr. Army said, ``Had I been more true to myself and the principles I believed in at the time, I would have openly opposed the adventure vocally and aggressively.'' Chris Matthews, on MSNBC on election night, said, ``The decision to go to war in Iraq was not a conservative decision historically.'' And he added that it ``asked Republicans to behave like a different people than they intrinsically are.'' 
   William F. Buckley, Jr. wrote in 2004 that if he had known in 2002 what he knew then, he would have opposed the war. And in 2005 he wrote that to continue there beyond another year would indicate ``not steadfastness of purpose but, rather, misapplication of pride.'' 
   What about this surge? The conservative columnist George Will wrote in opposition to it and said it would take a miracle for it to succeed. 
   Very few people, Mr. Speaker, pushed harder for us to go to Iraq than the columnist, Charles Krauthammer. A few weeks ago he wrote that the Maliki government we have installed there cares only about making sure the Shiites dominate the Sunnis.     
   ``We should not be surging troops in defense of such a government,'' Krauthammer wrote. ``Maliki should be made to know that if he insists on having this sectarian war, he can well have it without us.'' 
   But listen to what the enlisted men say: Specialist Don Roberts, 22, of Paonia, Colorado, now in his second tour in Iraq, told the Associated Press: ``What could more guys do? We cannot pick sides. It is like we have to watch them kill each other, then ask questions.'' 
   Sergeant Josh Keim of Canton, Ohio, also on his second tour said, ``Nothing is going to help. It is a religious war and we are caught in the middle of it.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I certainly want to first thank Dr. BOUSTANY for yielding  me this time and for his hard work on this legislation. As he mentioned, I had the privilege of chairing the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee for 6 years, for the past 6 years, and he served as my vice chairman during part of that time. I appreciate his work. 
   I also want to salute my really good friend, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, whom I admire and respect so much, and who was my ranking member of that subcommittee and now serves as the full chairman. 
   I want to also commend Congressman BILL PASCRELL, the gentleman from New Jersey, who has been interested in this issue for several years, as has my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Camp, and who are the primary sponsors of this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have said many times that there is nothing that the people of this country take for granted as much as they do our clean water and waste water systems in this country that are so very important, first of all, to our environment, our public health, but also to our economy. 
   We have environmental extremists in this country who don't want us to cut any trees, dig for any coal, drill for any oil or produce any natural gas, and they basically want to shut our whole economy down. I don't go along with their agenda, but I can tell you that this bill is one of the most important bills that we could do for the environment. Those who really care about the environment should be over here in strong support of this bill. 
   The water infrastructure network has done some real yeoman's work in regard to the needs of this country, in this regard, for the last few years, and they have estimated that we have needs over the next 20 years or so of over $400 billion in our clean water and waste water systems in this country. 
   This bill and the other two bills we will take up later this week certainly are very important, and they are good starts in alleviating some of this problem. It has been said that we have spent more from a Federal level on the water system in Iraq over the last 4 years than we have spent from the Federal level on the water systems in this country. Certainly more money has been spent in this country on our water systems, but that has been done by the ratepayers and the local and State governments. 
   There is an important Federal role in this regard because people in California drink the water in Tennessee and vice versa. We have a mobile society, and there is an important role for this Congress to play and for our Federal Government to play in this regard. 
   I think this bill is a good start in the right direction, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. There are going to be, I think, two or three amendments offered from our side to make the bill a little more fiscally conservative, and, certainly, I have no objection to that. 
   But we need to pass this legislation, because, as Mr. Camp said, there is a lot of this water infrastructure in our country, both waste water and clean water, that dates back to the 19th century. We need a lot of work if we are going to have the water systems and the kind of country that our people want us to have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, and I thank all who have worked to bring this legislation to the floor today. 
   I wish the bill went much further, but there are so many former Federal employees working for Federal contractors now, and so many present Federal employees who want to some day hitch on to this lucrative Federal gravy train, that the pressures against reform are tremendous. 
   Unfortunately, almost every Federal contract is a sweetheart or insider or friendship type deal. Almost all Federal contracts have at least one or usually several former Federal employees working for them. 
   Defense contractors are the prime examples. The International Herald Tribune had an article a year and a half ago describing what it called the revolving door at the Pentagon. 
   It said the top 20 defense contractors had hired over 300 retired admirals and generals during the 90s. 
   But this type of thing is rampant throughout the Federal Government. 
   Now I am not against the Federal Government contracting out many functions. 
   Usually, or often, the Federal bureaucracy is so wasteful and inefficient that Federal contractors can do things better or cheaper, even while making huge profits. 
   But some of the markups on contracts in Iraq have been mind boggling. I believe fiscal conservatives should be the ones most upset about some of the ripoff deals in Iraq. 
   Be that as it may, this bill helps highlight what has become a serious abuse of power, and abuse of the taxpayer, and this is a good start toward correcting this problem.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (ENVIROMENTAL GROUPS ARE DRIVING UP THE PRICE OF GASOLINE -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, oil prices have reached $112, $113 a barrel, an all-time high. Gas prices have reached an average of $3.50 a gallon and in some places even higher, and the only people who seem to be happy about this are Sierra Club and some of these other environmental groups. I have noticed that almost all of these environmental radicals or environmental extremists seem to come from very wealthy or very upper-income families. They are elitist types, and perhaps they're not concerned when their policies destroy jobs and drive up prices because who they're really hurting are the poor and the lower income and the working people in this country. 
   As the previous speaker, Mr. Poe, pointed out, now some of these environmental groups, their policies are causing food prices to go up worldwide and, in many countries, leading to starvation. But once again, the environmentalists are hurting the poor and the lower-income and the working people. So perhaps they don't care. 
   About a year and a half ago in one of my newsletters I wrote this: I said, many experts are still predicting that the price of oil, and thus the price of gas, is going to go way back up. Environmental groups think this is good because it will force people to drive less. However, many people already have difficulty paying their gas bills, especially people from small towns in rural areas where many people have to drive long distances to go to work. 
   And I might add, Mr. Speaker, that when you drive these gas prices up, as some of these environmental groups want, to $4, or $5, or $6 a gallon so people will drive less, you'll put the final nails in the coffins of some of the small towns in rural areas. The environmental groups loudly complain about urban sprawl, but yet their policies are leading to more urban sprawl as they continue to drive up these gas prices. 
   Syndicated columnist Walter Williams wrote recently, ``If I were an OPEC big cheese, I would easily conclude I could restrict output and charge higher prices were U.S. oil drilling restricted. I would see environmental groups as allies and make `charitable' contributions to help them reduce U.S. output,'' and that's something I thought for quite some time that these OPEC and countries and foreign energy producers I'm sure are contributing big money to these environmental groups, and they're receiving huge multi-million dollar contributions that they were refusing to disclose the source of. 
   Leonardo Mangeri, of the Italian energy company ENI, said, there are proven oil reserves now, economically and technologically recoverable, of 1.1 trillion barrels, or 38 years of world usage. In addition, he says there are another 2 trillion barrels of recoverable reserves that will be obtainable as technology improves over the next few years. 
   Also, the International Energy Administration, Mr. Speaker, estimates that at current prices, it will be economic to recover at least another 2 trillion barrels of petroleum from tar sands and oil shale. 
   Just a couple of months ago, I wrote in another newsletter this: Gas prices are far too high and probably will go even higher. They could be much lower, but very powerful environmental groups want them to go higher so people will drive less. Thus, we have put 85 percent or 611 million acres of the outer continental shelf off limits to oil production. We will not allow drilling in 99.9 percent of Alaska where oil could be found, and have prohibited or restricted production in other parts of the U.S. 
   We've also placed so many rules, regulations and red tape on all types of domestic energy production that small- and medium-sized businesses cannot compete or even enter these industries in the first place. All of these productions can be done in environmentally safe ways. Some of these environmental groups help the big business giants and foreign energy producers tremendously, but they are really hurting lower- and middle-income people.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (INTERVENTIONIST FOREIGN POLICY -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, no country has ever done as much for another country as the United States has done for Iraq. We have spent hundreds of billions rebuilding their infrastructure, providing police protection, building hospitals and clinics, schools, and water and power plants, giving free medical care, hiring hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and on and on. All of this in a country that had a total GDP of only $65 billion the year before the war was started. 
   In spite of all this generosity, a huge majority of Iraqis, 78 to 80 percent by almost every poll, wants us to leave. They want our money, of course, but not our presence, except those who are working for us. But there needs to be some limit to our generosity. 
   We need to start putting our own people first. If we do not, we are soon not going to be able to pay all the Social Security and military pensions, and all the other things we have promised our own people with money that will buy very much. 
   Governments all over the world have gotten in this situation. They then start printing more money, and people do not realize what is going on. All they see is each year their pensions buy less than the year before. 
   Today we have a national debt approaching $9 trillion. Even worse, according to the GAO, we have unfunded future pension liabilities of $50 trillion. 
   We all love and respect our military, but there is waste in any gigantic bureaucracy, and there is huge waste even in the military. A year and a half ago, it was reported by the Defense Department's own inspector general that $35 billion had been misspent in Iraq due to waste, fraud and abuse, and another $9 billion had simply been lost and could not be accounted for at all. 
   Not only has the U.S. done more for Iraq, we do more for every other country, by far, than does any other Nation. Almost every Federal department and agency has operations around the world. 
   Liberals will tell you that our foreign aid is only a little over 1 percent of our budget. This is very misleading. We are spending megabillions in other countries when you add up not only the Defense Department but all the other departments' spending, too.  
   We all love and appreciate our country, but all of this spending is not helping. There is more resentment than ever toward the U.S. because of our interventionist foreign policies. 
   President Bush campaigned in 2000, saying that we needed a more humble foreign policy, and that we should not be doing nation-building. Interventionist foreign policies and nation-building are not only causing resentment toward us, but we simply cannot afford them if we are going to pay our Social Security and other promises a few years from now. You can still love this country and be a very patriotic American and oppose interventionist foreign policies. 
   We cannot afford perpetual war just because defense contractors and people at the top levels of the Pentagon always want more and more money. All of this is stated more articulately by two conservative writers, Jacob Hornberger, president of the Future of Freedom Foundation, and Richard Ebeling of the Foundation for Economic Education. 
   Mr. Hornberger wrote: ``If Americans come to realize that the Federal Government's philosophy on foreign aid, foreign intervention and empire lies at the heart of foreign anger, resentment, and hatred for America, then they will see that another option is available to them: End the motivation for terrorism by putting an end to the U.S. Government's role as international welfare provider, intervenor, and meddler. 
   ``The interventionist and imperial vision will inevitably lead to more terrorism against Americans, less freedom for the American people, and more power for the Federal Government. It is a vision that will inevitably lead us away from the principles on which our Nation was founded.'' 
   He continued, ``The contrary vision, a vision based on liberty, free markets and limited government, is the key to peace, prosperity and harmony for the American people. That vision entails ending the U.S. Government's interventionist and imperial role in the world and limiting it to protecting our Nation from attack or invasion.'' 
   Mr. Ebeling wrote: ``Two wrongs do not make a right. That America does things abroad it should not is not an excuse or rationale for what happened on September 11. But the United States will continue to create desperate and fanatical men who will view it as the enemy for as long as it interferes into the affairs of other people in other nations. That means there is no end to this 'war on terrorism' as long as the United States follows the foreign policy'' of recent years. ``Ending U.S. foreign political and military interventionism is the only way to reduce the creation of enemies of America in other lands.'' 
   He continues, ``Ending the policy of foreign internventionism is also crucial to protecting our freedoms at home. 
   ``Who will guard us from the guardians is the perennial dilemma. When the crisis has passed there will be new government agencies and bureaus with new government employees who will look around for new justifications and rationales to keep their jobs and expand their budgets. They will have powers to intrude into our lives that they will want to use in ways not originally intended. And even more of our freedoms will then be at risk.''

And I also have said that oftentimes it appears that the biggest thing in my district is Tennessee football and Tennessee women's basketball, although Tennessee men's basketball is coming back under the leadership of our great new coach, Coach Bruce Pearl. But we are especially proud of our Lady Vols basketball coach, Ms. Pat Head Summitt. Under Coach Summitt, Tennessee women's basketball sometimes frequently had crowds of two and three times the number of fans that the men's basketball team would draw, sometimes drawing crowds as large as 24,000, 25,000 people. Pat Summitt is the NCAA's winningest coach, man or woman, in Division I, and has posted an overall record of 947 wins against only 180 losses, a phenomenal winning percentage of 84 percent. 
   Her 2007 NCAA title was the seventh in her 33-year career at Tennessee. She also captured NCAA titles or led the Lady Vols to NCAA championship titles in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1996, 1997 and 1998, as well as this year. She trails only UCLA's legendary John Wooden for the most lifetime NCAA titles. Coach Wooden captured 10 during his tenure. 
   She was named SEC Coach of the Year in 1993, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2007. She was the NCAA women's Coach of the Year an unbelievable number of times, in 1983, 1987, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1998 and 2004.     
   She was named the Naismith Coach of the Century in the year 2000. I want to congratulate Pat Head Summitt and her assistant head coach Holly Warlick who has been with her through most of those years, and also assistants Nikki Caldwell and Dean Lockwood. 
   The 2007 Lady Vols compiled a 27-2 regular season record, a 14-0 SEC record, a 34-3 allover record including the SEC and NCAA tournaments. 
   On April 3, 2007, before a crowd of over 20,000 fans, the Lady Vols beat the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers by a score of 59-46. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of the players on the Lady Vols have grade point averages over 3.0. Coach Summitt, in her 33 years of coaching, has had an astounding record of a 100 percent graduation rate. And she won't even let her young women take easy courses. It is an amazing record that no other coach in the country can match. 
   I want to commend Candace Parker, the most outstanding player of the 2007 NCAA tournament, and the starting lineup of Shannon Bobbitt, Nicky Anosike, Sidney Spencer, Alexis Hornbuckle; Sidney Spencer, the only senior on the team; and certainly the key bench players like Dominique Redding, Alberta Auguste, Alex Fuller, and Cait McMahan from my own district in Maryville, Tennessee. 
   I want to also thank all of the members of the Tennessee delegation for cosponsoring this resolution with me, as well as 22 other bipartisan cosponsors from across this country, from California to West Virginia and South Carolina to Pennsylvania. 
   I appreciate the nationwide support this resolution has.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, we all want to do what we should to fight  terrorism, but the Federal Government has to do many other things, too. The Wall Street Journal editorial said: ``We would like to suggest a new post-September 11 rule for Congress. Any bill with the words ``security'' in it should get double the public scrutiny and maybe four times the normal wait, lest all kinds of bad legislation become law under the phony guise of fighting terrorism.'' 
   More significantly, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff testified in front of a congressional committee: ``We should not let an overexaggerated threat of terrorism drive us crazy, into bankruptcy, trying to defend against every conceivable threat.'' He went on to say: ``We do have limits, and we do have choices to make. We don't want to break the very systems we're trying to protect. We don't want to destroy our way of life trying to save it. We don't want to undercut our economy trying to protect our economy, and we don't want to destroy our civil liberties and our freedoms in order to make ourselves safer.''

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to manage the time on this important resolution for the minority to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act. 
   Clean water is critical to the Nation and our standard of living. The Clean Water Act has resulted in significant water quality improvement in the last 35 years. However, we still have work to do before all of our lakes and streams meet State water quality standards. 
   H. Res. 725 encourages the American people to recognize and celebrate the water quality improvements we have achieved and recommit ourselves to the goals of the Clean Water Act. 
   No committee in the Congress has done more to work towards the clean water goals that all of us want to achieve than the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which was called, as Chairman Oberstar has mentioned, the Public Works and Transportation Committee for many years before the new name. And no one man who has ever served in this Congress has done more than has Chairman JAMES OBERSTAR in working to achieve clean water in this country, first as a staff member and then staff director for 11 years for the committee and then for the last 33 years representing his district and, indeed, the entire Nation in working to clean the waters of this Nation. 
   And we have made great progress over that time. The leading liberal magazine, the New Republic, said in an editorial a short time ago that to listen to some people ``is to learn that the environment is in bad shape today and, with the smallest push, could be in disastrous shape tomorrow ..... Fortunately, this alarm is a false one. All forms of pollution in the United States,'' the New Republic said, ``air, water, and toxic materials have been declining for decades.'' 
   In 1972 only 30 to 40 percent of our waters were estimated to have met water quality standards. Today, monitoring data indicate that 60 to 70 percent of our waters meet these goals and twice as many Americans are served by advanced or secondary wastewater treatment. 
   Twenty-five years ago, we were losing almost 400,000 acres of wetlands annually; yet the latest data collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service indicate that we are close to achieving a net gain in wetlands nationwide. 
   Our Nation's health, quality of life, and economic well-being rely on adequate wastewater treatment. Industries that rely on clean water, like farmers, fishermen, and manufacturers,  contribute over $300 billion a year to our gross domestic product. 
   To provide clean water, our Nation already has invested over $250 billion in wastewater infrastructure. But this infrastructure is now aging and our population is continuing to grow, increasing the burden on our existing infrastructure. If communities do not repair, replace, and upgrade their infrastructure, we could lose the environmental, health, and economic benefits of this investment. And no matter how much progress has been made in the past, you can always do better. People always need to improve, although we need to do this in a way that doesn't overregulate, but that brings about progress in a commonsense, practical manner and one that doesn't impede progress. 
   Various organizations have quantified wastewater infrastructure needs. The Congressional Budget Office, EPA, and the Water Infrastructure Network have estimated that it could take between $300 billion and $400 billion to address our Nation's clean water infrastructure needs over the next 20 years to keep our drinking water and waterways clean and safe. This is twice the current level of investment by all levels of government. These needs have been well documented in our committee and subcommittee hearings. 
   We can reduce the overall cost of wastewater infrastructure with good asset management, innovative technologies, water conservation and reuse, and regional approaches to water pollution problems. But these things alone will not close the large funding gap that now exists between wastewater infrastructure needs and current levels of spending. 
   Increased investment must still take place. That leads to the question where is the money going to come from. There is no single answer to that question. Municipal wastewater services are a State and local responsibility, but there is clearly a strong Federal interest in keeping our waters clean. 
   With all due respect to President Eisenhower, who I think was a great President and who, especially, was certainly right in warning about the dangers of the excesses of the military industrial complex, I believe there is a legitimate Federal interest in clean water in this country. The people in Tennessee drink the water and use the wastewater systems of people in other States, and the people of other States fish and swim and drink the water in Tennessee. So there is a legitimate Federal interest, I believe. 
   But what we need is an effective partnership between all levels, Federal, State, and local. That means all partners need to contribute. If we do not start investing in our wastewater system now, it is going to cost our Nation many billions more in the future if we delay. 
   In any event, the Federal Government, while its role is important, is not going to be able to solve this problem alone. The Democratic Governor of Montana told us at a committee hearing earlier this year that his State did not want the ``long arm of the Federal Government'' imposing regulations that would threaten the livelihoods of ranchers, farmers, and miners. He asked that the Federal Government be a ``partner and collaborator'' with the States in a joint effort to protect water resources. 
   Clarity and reasonableness and common sense are needed in the regulatory program. It is unknown exactly what are the maximum limits of Federal authority under the Clean Water Act. Neither Congress nor the courts have defined them explicitly. This uncertainty is a matter for much speculation and probably much future litigation. What we may ultimately need is legislation that clearly and reasonably delineates the Federal role and the State role and the local role in regulating activities affecting the Nation's waters. 
   While the historical perspective of the Clean Water Act is interesting and informative, we must decide under today's circumstances what is appropriate Federal regulation of the Nation's waters. 
   We should celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Clean Water Act by providing the tools and resources needed to achieve the goals of that act. 
   We need to reform the Clean Water Act State Revolving Loan Fund program to make it more efficient, effective, and flexible to improve the management of infrastructure assets, fund those activities that will best improve water quality, address the needs of small and disadvantaged communities, and encourage private financing of treatment works to help bring private resources to bear on the overwhelming needs of the Nation's water infrastructure. 
   It is also time to fashion new water quality management tools so we can continue the job of achieving clean water. These new tools could include utilizing more in the way of performance-based standards than rigid Federal mandates; harnessing market forces within the public and private sectors to safeguard and improve the environment more effectively; protect individual and private property rights; and adequately considering the costs and benefits of government actions so we can set priorities.     
   It is appropriate today that we celebrate this anniversary of the Clean Water Act, but we must be prudent as we go forward. We all want the same thing, clean water. I encourage all Members to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Chairman Oberstar was kind enough to mention my 6 years as chairman of the Water Resources Environment Subcommittee. I tried to have an active subcommittee with many hearings because I thought that that work was among the most important that the Congress could deal with, and that's why I'm here tonight, because I don't believe there is any topic, or very few topics, anyway, more important than clean water. And certainly the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) was one of the most active members of that subcommittee. 
   Another member, though, who has also been very active on these issues is the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), and I yield him such time as he may consume.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (MICHAEL W. SCHRAGG POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Michael Schragg grew up on his family's farm in Ceresco, Michigan. In 1967, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served in Germany for 3 years. After this period, he returned to Michigan and began his career in the postal service in 1970. Within 5 years he was promoted to postmaster for the Olivet office, and in 1979 became the postmaster for Marshall, Michigan. During his tenure, the Marshall office was named the All-American Post Office. 
   Beyond the postal service, Mr. Schragg has always been active in his community. He is a past president of the Marshall Rotary Club and continues to serve on the Marshall Historical Society. 
   However, his most noteworthy accomplishment is the creation of the Marshall Postal Museum. The Marshall Postal Museum is the second largest in the U.S., behind the Smithsonian Postal Museum here in Washington, D.C. The museum is now one of the cornerstones of the immensely popular Marshall historical home tour. In fact, in 2003, the New York Times called the postal museum the town's piece de resistance. The article went on to say, ``If you think you have no interest in postal history, a tour conducted by the ebullient Mr. Schragg will change your mind.'' 
   Beyond the New York Times, Mr. Schragg and his museum have also been featured in Michigan magazine. Mr. Schragg even drove a vintage 1931 Model A mail delivery truck in the 2001 inauguration parade.     
   Considering his devotion to preserving the past and his work to develop the future of the Postal Service, it is fitting that we name the building where he toiled for so long in his honor. This is especially true since the Marshall Postal Museum is housed in  the basement of the same Marshall Post Office. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of this resolution honoring and recognizing the heroic efforts of the firefighters and other first responders to the fires in Southern California. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think we should take a moment to ponder what happens when a situation like this occurs. A disaster occurs and people appear, seemingly out of nowhere, to offer every type of help and assistance. They are organized and disciplined and effective and precise. They are heroic and swift and knowledgeable and kind. 
   But who are they? Who are these men and women who drive toward the disaster when the rest of us drive away? Who leaves behind his home and family for perhaps weeks on end and goes to help others? Who sets up the shelters and the medical aid stations? Who helps seniors and the infirm evacuate? Who rushes to save Los Angeles and Ventura and Orange and Riverside and Santa Barbara and San Bernardino and San Diego? 
   In the case of California, about 2,500 citizen soldiers, we call them National Guardsmen, have raced to the rescue. So have countless numbers of firefighters, law enforcement, and medical personnel. 
   We owe these people and their families a debt of gratitude. We couldn't do what they do. Thank God they can.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (MAKING PERMANENT THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE SPECIAL POSTAGE STAMP TO SUPPORT BREAST CANCER RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - October 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I want to commend my good friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), for his remarks and his work on this legislation. 
   I rise today to urge passage of H.R. 1236, to extend the authority of the U.S. Postal Service to issue a stamp to support breast cancer research. 
   Those of us in Congress received a tragic reminder of the need for continued research into this disease with the passing of our beloved colleague, Jo Ann Davis; and we thank the majority, in particular Mr. Clay, for taking the opportunity to honor her memory.  
   Nearly 180,000 people, mostly, but not all, women, will learn that they have invasive breast cancer this year alone. About 40,000 people will die from this disease. Women who are white and over the age of 40 are more likely to suffer from breast cancer, but its victims run the gamut of age, race and socioeconomic background. We have made some progress in recent years thanks to early detection and increased awareness and availability of mammograms. 
   But in the past 3 years, both mammograms and incidence of breast cancer have decreased. This doesn't mean things are getting better. It means ominously and unfortunately that fewer cases are being detected. 
   As I am sure Jo Ann Davis would tell us if she were still with us here today, early detection, early treatment, constant vigilance and public awareness are key to putting this disease in its place. For example, incidence rates of both invasive and in-situ breast cancer rise and fall with the percentage of women who receive mammograms. 
   After two decades of progress, both the use of mammograms and the rates of detection have begun to slip in recent years. As early detection increased, so did survival rates; but they will fall, too, if we can't improve public awareness of the importance of early detection. 
   That's where the measure that is before us comes in. This bill would reauthorize the Postal Service to issue the 55-cent stamp for first class mail, with 14 cents of each stamp going to breast cancer research and awareness programs for an additional 4 years. Since the program began in 1998, the Postal Service has sold more than 785 million of these stamps and raised $54.6 million for breast cancer research. 
   This disease preys on women such as Jo Ann Davis and on so many others, women on whom others have come to depend. They are mothers, grandmothers, business owners, teachers, researchers, even Members of this great body. We need these women and the invaluable contributions they make to our life and society. We need this measure to help save their lives. 
   I have had the privilege of attending every single Race for the Cure for the past 11 years, every single one that has been held in my hometown of Knoxville.     
   This is a very worthwhile cause that I am sure all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle can support very enthusiastically. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing the 40th Anniversary of the Mass Movement for Soviet Jewish Freedom and the 20th Anniversary of the Freedom Sunday Rally for Soviet Jewry on the Mall in Washington, D.C. 
   As with many other peoples of faith, Jews suffered under the oppressive yoke of communism in the Soviet Union. Their struggles inspired American Jews to establish the American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry and the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry in 1964 in order to campaign on behalf of their fellow Soviet brethren. 
   After the Six-Day War in 1967, the Soviets intensified the persecution of the Jewish community through state-controlled media and by reducing Jewish autonomy. Soon a mass exodus, a mass emigration of Jews from the Soviet Union began. These developments helped to galvanize the advocacy movement within the U.S. 
   Over the following years, this mass advocacy movement helped spur the U.S. Government to achieve much. Perhaps most notably, in 1975 President Ford signed into law the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. This amendment prohibited the extension of trade benefits to countries that limited immigration and otherwise infringed human rights. It was drafted specifically with the plight of Soviet Jews in mind. Later, President Reagan signed a law drawing attention to the hardships imposed on the Jewish community of the Soviet Union. 
   In 1987, an estimated 250,000 people demonstrated on the Mall before a Reagan-Gorbachev summit. This rally increased the issue's national visibility. Partly due to these efforts, the Soviet Union finally opened the doors of emigration to its Jewish population in 1989. Two years later, the Soviet Government codified the right of every Soviet citizen to emigrate, prompting massive flows of Jews to Israel and to the United States. 
   This serves as an example of the great American tradition of citizen involvement for the greater good. I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to join my fellow Members of Congress in recognizing Dennis Collins and his extraordinary contributions to Bayonne, New Jersey. Fortunately for Bayonne, Mr. Collins missed his trip on the Titanic to visit family members back in Ireland. If it were not for this fortunate coincidence, the rest of Mr. Collins's biography most likely would not be possible. 
   Mr. Collins was born and raised in Bayonne, where he attended St. Vincent De Paul Grammar School and the Holy Family Academy. As a young man, he served in World War II, including time in the China-Burma-India theater of operations. Upon his return, he went to work for Tidewater Oil Company, General Motors, Edward F. Clark Real Estate and Insurance Agency, and Bayonne Water and Sewer Utility. 
   Ultimately, it was his interest in the community that led Mr. Collins to seek political office. In 1962, Mr. Collins was elected to his first of three terms on the municipal council, two of which he served as council president. In 1974, he was elected to serve as mayor of the City of Bayonne. His popularity in the  community was so immense that he served for the next 16 years. He currently holds the record for Bayonne as the first individual to serve seven consecutive 4-year terms in elective office and four consecutive 4-year terms as mayor. 
   Mr. Collins retired in 1990 as mayor, but he continues to be an active and committed leader to the citizens of Bayonne. 
   Mr. Collins's reputation as a public servant was forged by his compassion and interest in helping his fellow citizens. His legacy and service to others is a wonderful example to his children, grandchildren and to the citizens of Bayonne and beyond. 
   With gratitude for his devotion and service to the Bayonne community, it is particularly fitting that we name the United States Postal Service building located at 570 Broadway in his honor.

   Tim Russert was known across the country as moderator for ``Meet the Press'' where he interviewed high-profile guests, bringing Washington politics into American living rooms. He was recognized for his on-the-air tenacity as a moderator and his intense passion for politics. It is no wonder that Time Magazine named Mr. Russert one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Despite his success, Tim Russert never lost sight or forgot his roots in Buffalo, New York.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding this time. 
   I rise in support of this bill. I have seen over the years a great deal of good work that has gone on by the Appalachian Regional Commission and the projects it has funded in its 13-State region and especially in my home State of Tennessee where much of their activities have been concentrated. 
   I read recently that two-thirds of the counties in the U.S. are losing population. That surprises people in my particular district because the Knoxville area has become one of the most popular places to move to in the whole country. But there are many counties in Tennessee and throughout the Appalachian region and many small towns and rural areas that are still struggling. Many of these small towns and rural areas are barely holding on. 
   The previous speaker mentioned more energy production. We've got to have more production of oil in this country or we're going to put the final nail in the coffin of the small towns and the rural areas because those people as a rule have to drive further distances to go to work and to meet other needs. 
   In addition, the Office of Surface Mining caused almost all the small coal companies in east Tennessee to go out of business. I was told at one time that in 1978 there were 157 small coal companies in east Tennessee, and now are there none. I have noticed over the years that most of these environmental radicals come from very wealthy and very upper-income families. And they have always wanted gas to go higher, and they have always opposed all types of energy production. Well maybe they can afford $5 and $6-per-gallon gasoline. But most lower and middle-income people in this country can't. It may be true that we can't drill our way out of the current crisis. But we also can't get out of the crisis that we're in on energy without having more drilling for oil in this country and more production of coal where it can be done in environmentally safe ways where it couldn't be done previously. 
   So I agree with the previous speaker that we need more domestic energy production in this country to help the Appalachian Region and also to further the activities of the Appalachian Regional Commission.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, Bruce Fein is a nationally syndicated columnist who was a high-ranking official during the Reagan administration. He does not support a neocon, globalist, world policeman-type of foreign policy for the U.S., a foreign policy that used to be considered as the policy of liberals. 
   Last week, Mr. Fein wrote a column describing the traditional conservative view. He wrote: ``Non-intervention and global neutrality should be the national security creed of the United States. Every soldier deployed abroad should be returned to deter and defend the United States at home. Non-intervention and neutrality everywhere, coupled with the threat to annihilate any United States attacker would make the country safer, freer, and more prosperous. Foreign adventurisms create more enemies than they destroy. 
   He also quoted George Washington's farewell address, in which President Washington warned against ``overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.'' 
   In other words, Mr. Speaker, the traditional conservative view is what was expressed by President Bush during the 2000 campaign when he came out very strongly against nation building and said the U.S. needed a more humble foreign policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, as the previous speaker just mentioned, tomorrow we will begin debating the Iraq war surge resolution. George Will, the conservative columnist wrote in opposition to this surge and said it would take a miracle for the surge to succeed. 
   Dick Armey, our former majority leader, in an interview with a major newspaper chain said just a few days ago that he deeply regretted voting to go to war in Iraq, and said, ``Had I been more true to myself and the principles I believed in at the time, I would have openly opposed the whole adventure vocally and aggressively.'' 
   William F. Buckley, Jr., often called the godfather of conservatism, wrote in 2004 that if he had known in 2002 what he knew in 2004 he would have opposed the war. Chris Matthews on Election Night said, ``The decision to go to war in Iraq was not a conservative decision historically,'' and he said it asked Republicans, ``to behave like a different people than they intrinsically are.'' 
   And that confirmed what I have said many times on this floor, that the war in Iraq went against every traditional conservative position I have ever known. I would like to read into the Record at this time a column that I wrote for the Nashville Tennessean, Tennessee's largest circulation daily. 
   I wrote this. ``I voted against going to war in Iraq when Congress voted on this in October of 2002. And I am opposed to sending more U.S. troops there now. President Bush has said repeatedly that he is going to listen mainly to his commanders. I wish he would listen to Specialist Don Roberts, 22, of Paonia, Colorado, now in his second tour in Iraq, who told the Associated Press: ``What could more guys do? We cannot pick sides. It is like we have to watch them kill each other then ask questions.'' 
   Sergeant Josh Keim, of Canton, Ohio, also on his second term said, ``nothing is going to help. It is a religious war and we are caught in the middle of it.'' 
   Saddam Hussein was an evil man, but he had a total military budget only a little over two-tenths of 1 percent of ours, most of which he spent protecting himself and his family and building castles. 
   He was no threat to us at all. As the conservative columnist Charley Reese has written several times, Iraq did not threaten us with war. They did not attack us, and were not even capable of attacking us. 
   But even before the war started, Fortune Magazine had an article saying that an American occupation of Iraq would be ``prolonged and expensive'' and would make U.S. soldiers ``sitting ducks for Islamic terrorists.'' 
   Now we have had more than 3,000 Americans killed, many thousands more wounded horribly, and have spent $400 billion, and the Pentagon wants $170 billion more. 
   Most of what we have spent has been purely foreign aid in nature: rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, giving free medical care, training police, giving jobs to several hundred thousand Iraqis and on and on. Our Constitution does not give us the authority to run another country as we have in reality been doing in Iraq. 
   With a national debt of almost $9 trillion, we cannot afford it. To me our misadventure in Iraq is both unconstitutional and unaffordable. Some have said it was a mistake to start this war but that now that we are there we have to finish the job, and we cannot cut and run. Well, if you find out you are going the wrong way down the interstate, you do not keep going, you get off at the next exit. 
   Very few pushed as hard for us to go to war in Iraq as did syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Last week he wrote that the Maliki government we have installed there cares only about making sure the Shiites dominate the Sunnis. We should not be surging troops in defense of such a government, Krauthammer wrote. Maliki should be made to know that if he insists on having this sectarian war, he can well have it without us. 
   There is no way we can keep all of our promises to our own people on Social Security, veterans benefits, and many other things in the years ahead if we keep trying to run the whole world. As another columnist, Georgie Anne Geyer, wrote more than 3 years ago, Americans ``will inevitably come to a point where they will see they have to have a government that provides services at home or one that seeks empire across the globe.'' 
   We should help other countries during humanitarian crises and have trade and tourism and cultural and educational exchanges. But conservatives have traditionally been the strongest opponents to interventionist foreign policies that create so much resentment for us around the world. 
   We need to return to the more humble foreign policy President Bush advocated when he campaigned in 2000. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, we need to tell all of these defense contractors that the time for this Iraq gravy train with its obscene profits is over. It is time, Mr. Speaker, to bring our troops home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's appropriate that the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area be named after Morley Nelson. Morley Nelson demonstrated how private voluntary wildlife conservation efforts can be far more effective than big Federal programs and showed that punitive laws, like the Endangered Species Act, can inhibit and interfere with more creative approaches. 
   He worked with Idaho Power to redesign their towers and power lines so eagles would not be electrocuted when they landed on them. This not only saved the eagles; it saved Idaho Power the substantial cost of power disruptions. 
   He worked with private falconers to create a captive breeding and release program that was so successful, the peregrine falcon was one of the first species taken off the endangered species list. The Fish and Wildlife Service has yet to achieve a comparable recovery after more than 30 years. 
   I am pleased to see Morley Nelson recognized for his great conservation achievements. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 5151 will designate portions of the Monongahela National Forest in West Virginia as wilderness, and it is my understanding that Members of Congress whose districts are affected support the bill. 
   Although we should give considerable deference to those who have been elected to represent the people in the area, I do not necessarily agree that wilderness designation is always the wisest conservation decision we can make. Wilderness designation is the most restrictive policy we can impose on an area, and there are often far better, more creative ways to conserve our forests and other natural areas. In many instances, it is a mistake to foreclose active management options that can improve fish and game habitat, increase recreational access and lessen the severity of wildfires. And to protect our economic well-being, provide jobs for young people and protect our national security, our country is going to need continued access to the rich resources our own public lands provide. 
   We now have over 100 million acres in wilderness areas, and we keep adding to that at a record level. And we are very close to getting to the point where that's beginning to hurt us economically at a time when we don't need more blows to our economy. 
   Nevertheless, I do wish the people of West Virginia good luck living around these wilderness areas, and I know that they, like the people of my State, will in the long run prove to be better guardians of their mountains, rivers and wildlife than bureaucrats in Washington. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, oil has hit $118 a barrel. Gas is $3.50 to $4 a gallon. Fox News this morning said some experts say it will be $5 a gallon by later this summer. 
   Most environmental radicals and extremists seem to come from very wealthy or very upper-income families. They want gas to go even higher so people will drive less. Perhaps the wealthy leaders of the Sierra Club and some of these other environmental groups aren't being hurt, but they are really hurting the poor and the lower income and the working people of this country. 
   We don't need to produce all of our oil here domestically, but if we would just start producing a little bit more, then some of the OPEC countries and foreign energy producers would hold their prices down. We need to not let this country be sent into a deeper recession by environmental extremists and radicals.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 831 introduced by our distinguished colleague, DON YOUNG, conveys approximately 12 acres of National Forest System land to the City of Coffman Cove. The City of Coffman Cove, Alaska, is a small community with about 200 residents that developed around the Tongass National Forest logging camp and work site. The 12-acre Forest Service site is now in the middle of town, and a new ferry terminal is planned for an adjacent parcel. The location of most of the Forest Service site makes it difficult and inefficient for the Forest Service to manage and an obstacle to the future development and design of the city's downtown. Conveyance of the Forest Service site would benefit both the Forest Service and the city in this regard. 
   In short, this noncontroversial bill simply conveys to Coffman Cove a small parcel of Forest Service land for which the Forest Service has no use. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, in an interview published yesterday by the McClatchy newspaper chain, Dick Armey, our former Republican majority leader, said he felt really bad about voting to go to war in Iraq. Mr. Armey said, ``Had I been more true to myself and the principles I believed in at the time, I would have openly opposed the whole adventure vocally and aggressively.'' 
   It takes a big man to admit something like that. Chris Matthews on MSNBC on election night said, ``The decision to go to work in Iraq was not a conservative decision historically'' and said the President asked Republicans ``to behave like a different people than they intrinsically are.'' 
   In 2004, William F. Buckley, Jr., often called the godfather of conservatism, wrote that if he knew in 2002 what he knew by 2004 he would have opposed going to war in Iraq. 
   Today, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee held a hearing on the subject of waste, fraud and abuse in Iraq. A couple of years ago the same committee, then under Republican leadership, held a similar hearing. 
   David Walker, now head of the GAO but then Inspector General of the Defense Department, testified at that time that $35 billion had been lost in Iraq due to waste, fraud and abuse and another $9 billion had just been lost and could not be accounted for at all. 
   I heard a talk by Charlie Cook, the very respected political analyst, who said people could not really comprehend anything over $1 billion. But $44 billion is an awful lot of money in anybody's book.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (COMMENDING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY ON ITS 75TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding me this time. I rise in support of this resolution congratulating the Tennessee Valley Authority on its 75th anniversary. 
   First, I want to commend my good friend the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Cramer) for bringing this resolution to the floor. He has served with great distinction as chairman of the TVA Caucus in the Congress. 
   Since the Congress passed the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, TVA has played an important role, not only in the Tennessee Valley but in the course of the history of this Nation as well. TVA carries out its three-pronged mission of providing reliable electric power, economic development, and stewardship of the Nation's fifth largest river system by tapping into the talents of its 12,000 employees, many of whom live in my district. 
   Right from the start, TVA tried to establish a problem-solving approach to fulfilling its mission of resource management for power production, navigation, flood control, malaria prevention, reforestation, or erosion control, and each was studied in its broadest context. TVA weighed each issue in relation to all the others. 
   Today the Tennessee Valley is one of the most beautiful and fertile places in the Nation. With its beauty, hardworking people and abundant natural resources, the Tennessee Valley would have developed in a good and prosperous way without TVA, as did other areas of the South where there was no TVA. 
   However, the establishment of the TVA led to the development of cutting-edge fertilizers and improved farming techniques and helped to revive the Tennessee Valley and forever changed its landscape. With the completion of dams, TVA brought electricity and flood control to the Tennessee Valley, providing stability and vital insect control programs that helped drastically reduce deaths caused by mosquitos and increase the quality of life. 
   By the end of the 1930s, the Tennessee Valley was probably the most thoroughly mapped region in the country. Before long, however, TVA was called upon to use this expertise to provide then-General Eisenhower with the most detailed topographic maps of German-occupied France and, later, Japan during World War II. 
   TVA played an important role in the Manhattan Project, the development of our first atomic bomb. At a time when the enrichment of uranium in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, consumed around 15 percent of the electricity of the United States, TVA rose to the occasion and met those power needs and helped end World War II. 
   I am proud to say that TVA is headquartered in my congressional district. I am proud of TVA's president and CEO Tom Kilgore, and Chairman Bill Sansom, two good friends of mine, and of the leadership they provide to TVA in this challenging time for utilities across the country. 
   I believe as we move into the future and look for more sustainable sources of energy, that TVA will continue to provide the leadership to help the valley become even stronger and more economically vibrant. I can tell you that my region has become one of the most popular places to move to in the entire country, and that is in no small part because of the Tennessee Valley Authority and the role it plays in the lives of our citizens. 
   The citizens of the Tennessee Valley have been better off because of the work and historic mission of the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   I rise to say it has been a privilege and honor for me to serve with the gentleman from Alabama who unfortunately is leaving the Congress this year. Bud Cramer and I have traveled many times together. We have become, I think, very close friends. It is interesting to me that our careers have been almost parallel. We were in law school at approximately the same time. We practiced law. He became a prosecuting attorney in his hometown of Huntsville when I was serving as a criminal court judge in my hometown of Knoxville. He came to Congress shortly after I did. He rose to become one of the senior members and one of the most powerful and influential members on the Appropriations Committee here in the Congress. 
   I can tell you that I have respect and admire Bud Cramer more than almost anybody I know. He has been an outstanding public servant in every way, and this Congress will certainly miss the gentleman from Alabama when he leaves. I want to personally thank him for not only his friendship to me, but more importantly his service to this Nation.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I want to commend the gentlelady from California (Ms. Richardson) for bringing this bill to the floor today. Certainly, it's a very appropriate bill because of all of the firsts that the gentlewoman from California has already mentioned and for many other reasons. 
   I'm honored to support H.R. 4131. As has been stated, this bill would designate a portion of California's State Route 91 in Los Angeles County as the Juanita Millender-McDonald Highway. This is a very fitting tribute to our former colleague Congresswoman Millender-McDonald. 
   Congresswoman Millender-McDonald was a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for over 10 years. Beginning when she was first elected to Congress in April of 1996, she was a tireless advocate for transportation issues impacting her district, including projects related to the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and the Alameda Corridor freight railroad project. 
   She was also a leader on national transportation issues. She took her experience in dealing with freight mobility challenges in southern California and founded the Congressional Goods Movement Caucus. Through her position on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and in her role with the Congressional Goods Movement Caucus, Congresswoman Millender-McDonald promoted transportation projects necessary to facilitate interstate commerce while protecting communities from the adverse effects associated with freight movement. 
   She rose to the level of being a full committee chairwoman in this Congress, and she was respected and admired on both sides of the aisle. More importantly than all of this, than all of her work in Congress, Juanita Millender-McDonald was just a good human being.     
   She was a friend of mine, and I knew from discussions I had with her how much she loved her family and her friends. She was beautiful in appearance and was so dignified and professional in every way and set such a good example for all of us. She served the people of her district and this Nation well and with great honor and distinction. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill honoring a good friend, Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (BARRING ACCESS OF LONG-HAUL MEXICAN TRUCKS -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of H.R. 6630 with Chairman DeFazio, Chairman Oberstar, and Ranking Member Mica; and I simply want to commend them for the work they have done on this legislation, along with the gentlewoman from Kansas. 
   On September 6, 2007, the Department of Transportation began a 1-year cross-border demonstration project to open the Mexican border to truck traffic. According to the Department, they instituted this program in order to comply with the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
   The Department announced on August 4 of this year its intent to extend the program for an additional 2 years. 
   Like many other Members, I believe there are legitimate concerns about continuing this demonstration project, and many of those have been outlined by Chairman DeFazio here a few moments ago. 
   The bill under consideration today terminates the demonstration project 1 year after it began, just as the Department originally intended, until certain information is provided to the Congress.     
   Additionally, the bill prohibits the granting of new authority for Mexican trucks to operate beyond the commercial zone on the border without the express authorization of Congress, as I just mentioned. 
   Last year, we took up consideration and voted overwhelmingly to pass a similar bill, H.R. 1773, the Safe American Roads Act of 2007. Like the bill under consideration today, H.R. 1773 barred Mexican trucks from operating beyond the border zone without Congressional action. That bill passed the Transportation Committee unanimously and then passed in the House--as Chairman DeFazio has mentioned, passed the House by a vote of 411-3. 
   The House has expressed its feeling on this issue in a very strong and bipartisan way. Before the border is completely open to Mexican trucks, we must ensure the safety of motorists on our highways. No matter how much we want to have good relations and trade with our friends in Mexico--and we do--our first obligation is to the American people. 
   I want to make clear, though, that this bill does not prohibit forever some type of border crossing in relationship with Mexican trucking companies. H.R. 6630 simply requires the Independent Review Panel established by the Secretary of Transportation and the Department of Transportation itself to report to the Congress on the effects that the demonstration project had on motor carrier safety. It also provides a requirement to submit other required information, such as enforcement costs and various safety violations and other things like that, of the companies that have participated in the demonstration project thus far. Once Congress receives this information, Congress could then act to allow Mexican domiciled motor carriers access to the U.S. 
   This bill does not permanently prevent this type of program but ensures that the border will not be fully open without proper protections in place. 
   H.R. 6630 will help ensure the safety of our Nation's highways, and especially--and this is so important to me and most Members on both sides--it will help protect our American trucking companies, our small businesses, and our truck drivers. Republicans and Democrats have come together in the interest of the Nation and produced a bipartisan bill that impacts the entire Nation. 
   I support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Once again, I will say this is a bill primarily concerned about the safety and fairness to American trucking companies and American truckers. I agree with my colleagues that the high cost of energy, high cost of diesel fuel has hit especially small trucking companies and truckers harder than almost anyone, and certainly Republicans have been trying desperately for several months to do everything possible to increase energy production in this country, which is the only way to bring down these exorbitant costs we've been experiencing over the last 2 years. 
   The cost of gasoline when Speaker Pelosi was sworn in was a little over $2 gallon. Now, it's gone to more than $4 a gallon but has started coming down now just because of the threat of increased production. And we certainly need to do more in regard to that to be fair and helpful to our truckers and our trucking companies. 
   Now, let me say once again: this is a very moderate, sensible, balanced, and reasonable bill. It does not prohibit some sort of program for Mexican trucking companies that are safe and don't have all these violations. It would allow them to come in after additional information is given to the Congress about the results from this 1-year demonstration project. That's not much to ask for from the administration, and we need that information about safety violations. 
   We need to find out whether these Mexican truck drivers have drug addictions or they have numerous safety violations, find out whether some of these trucking companies are coming in, these trucks are coming in here in a very unsafe and uninsured condition. 
   So I think this is a bill that all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle can support. As I said earlier, practically the same bill was passed a few months ago by a vote of 411-3, and I ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation which has bipartisan support. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for yielding me this time. 
   Madam Speaker, the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame is located in my district and my hometown in Knoxville, Tennessee. One of the main reason is that no college team in history, men's or women's, and no coach can claim the accomplishments of the University of Tennessee Lady Vols basketball team and head coach Pat Summitt. 
   On April 8, 2008, as the gentleman from Illinois just mentioned, the University of Tennessee Lady Vols captured their second NCAA Division I national championship in a row, beating the Cardinal of Stanford University by a score of 64-48. It was their eighth national championship victory, cementing Coach Summitt's status as the Nation's all-time winningest NCAA basketball coach in both the men's and women's leagues. 
   Coach Summitt, with 983 wins over 34 seasons at the University of Tennessee, is certainly a remarkable leader. Anyone who has had the pleasure of meeting her in person knows the depth of her character, and it shows both on and off the court. Her 2008 team continues a remarkable 100 percent graduation rate. Every student athlete since she became head coach has completed their eligibility at the University of Tennessee, either graduating or working  toward the requirements for graduation within the required 6-year time limit set by NCAA rules. 
   I have always said that the colors orange and white are almost as patriotic in my district as red, white, and blue. I doubt there is any community that shows more support for women's athletics than the people of Tennessee. The Lady Vols regularly attract huge crowds to watch them play, sometimes as large as 25,000 people. It is easy to become overwhelmed with statistics when speaking of the Lady Vols. They finished this season with 36 wins and only two losses, the second most wins in a single season in school history. 
   I especially want to commend Candace Parker, who won back-to-back most outstanding player of the Final Four, and some people say that she is probably the greatest women's basketball player of all time. I also want to congratulate Shannon Bobbit and Nicky Anosike, who both also earned All-Final Four team honors, and Alexis Hornbuckle who played and started in her 21st NCAA tournament game. 
   I want to also thank all the members of the Tennessee delegation for cosponsoring this resolution, as well as 16 other bipartisan cosponsors from across the country.     
   I also want to commend the entire coaching staff, Pat Head Summitt, certainly the greatest head coach in women's basketball history; Joan Cronan, our great women's athletics director; and Holly Warlick, associate head coach; Dean Lockwood, assistant coach; and Nikki Caldwell, assistant coach, who is now moving on to become UCLA's new head coach. And I certainly appreciate the nationwide support for this resolution. And I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, we hear and read about so many examples of waste by the Federal bureaucracy that almost nothing shocks or surprises us anymore. However, the Washington Post reported yesterday on a really ridiculous waste of money. 
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency paid $24 million for 112,000 tons of ice after Hurricane Katrina. 42,000 tons were stored for future use, and FEMA paid $12.5 million in storage fees. Now, all this unused ice is going to be thrown away. But here is the really ridiculous part. 
   FEMA is going to pay $3.4 million, $3,400,000 to melt the ice. It's over 90 degrees outside. The Department of Homeland Security, of which FEMA is a part, has 171,000 employees. A first-grader could melt ice. But the Federal Government is going to pay $3,400,000 to have it done. 
   No wonder the Federal Government is almost $9 trillion in debt. If we ever created a Hall of Fame of government waste, FEMA should be the first admission.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida, Ranking Member Mica, for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in strong support of this bill, offered by our distinguished chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, my good friend (Mr. Oberstar), along with my good friend (Mr. Mica). 
   Our condolences, in fact the condolences of the entire Nation, go out to the people of Minnesota who were affected by this terrible tragedy. 
   And I want to recognize Mr. Oberstar's leadership and his efforts to provide an immediate response to this incident. Less than 18 hours after the I-35W bridge collapsed into the Mississippi River, Mr. Oberstar introduced this bill, H.R. 3311. 
   This bill authorizes funding to help the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area get back on its feet. It authorizes $250 million from the Federal Highway Administration's Emergency Relief Program for the repair and reconstruction of the I-35W bridge that collapsed Wednesday night. 
   Yesterday, the Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters, went to Minneapolis, visited the site, and immediately made available $5 million to pay for traffic-flow adjustments and debris removal associated with this disaster. But this bill takes the first step in providing funding to repair and rebuild this bridge. 
   While we will not know for several months the final cost to repair and rebuild the I-35W bridge, this bill demonstrates the House's support and certainly the strong commitment from our committee to rebuild this bridge and restore some sense of normalcy to the Minneapolis-St. Paul region. 
   Mr. Speaker, there was a column in The Washington Post today that repeated some of the statistics you have just heard from the gentleman from Georgia about the number of deficient bridges, but this columnist also said this: ``It's unrealistic to think this disaster is going to spur the Nation to seriously address all its infrastructure problems. We'll talk about the issue for a while, then go out and buy another TV. But we can, and should, at least do a more rigorous inventory and identify the structures that pose the most peril. Yes, it's boring stuff to even think about. But just look at the alternative.'' 
   Those are very true words, Mr. Speaker, and I pledge the support of our subcommittee and to work with all the leadership on our committee to not do what this columnist has said and just forget about this or move on to something else too quickly. We owe that to the people of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 390, the Preservation of Records of Servitude, Emancipation, and Post-Civil War Reconstruction Act, legislation which would establish a grant program, as outlined just a moment ago by Mr. Clay. 
   H.R. 390 would authorize the creation of a national database within the National Archives to include records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction held by Federal agencies. These records include: the Southern Claims Commission Records, Records of the Freedmen's Bank, Slave Impressment Records, Slave Payroll Records, and Slave Manifests. 
   Many of these records are not organized, catalogued, or well protected from the elements. H.R. 390 will not only make these documents more accessible to the public but will preserve them as well. H.R. 390 continues the important preservation efforts begun under the Freedmen's Bureau Records Preservation Act of 2000. The creation of a searchable database will help African Americans conduct genealogical research and learn more about their families' history. 
   In addition, the national database will help historians and others interested in the Civil War and post-Civil War eras to conduct research that promises to reveal more about the history and culture of the South and the African American experience. Similar records of servitude, emancipation, and post-Civil War reconstruction are held by local and State entities. 
   H.R. 390 authorizes the National Archives to provide grants to States, universities, and genealogical associations to digitally preserve their records through the creation of searchable databases. The digital preservation of these important historical documents and improved accessibility to them will ensure that they are available to future generations of Americans. 
   I think this is legislation that all my colleagues can support, and I urge support for H.R. 390.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Chairman, I first want to commend Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Chairwoman Johnson, with whom I spent so many hours. She was my ranking member during the entire 6 years that I had the privilege of chairing the Water Resources and Environment, or during part of the time that I chaired the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, and such a good friend, and Ranking Member Baker, for bringing this bill to the floor today and for their good and hard work on this legislation. And I urge its support. 
   This is a very conservative bill, Mr. Chairman. It is a bill that passed this House with only eight dissenting votes a few years ago and then later only 14 dissenting votes. The bill passed with over 400 votes in favor of it each time in the House. We did our work, but then it got held up in the other body. 
   Some people say that these projects should be paid for entirely on a local basis. But I can tell you there is a very important Federal role in regard to our water resources because people in California or New York or Michigan use the water in Tennessee. And people expect us to have a good wastewater and clean water system in this country. And yet it is something that people take for granted probably more than anything else that I can think of. And we have got to improve and strengthen our water resource system in this country. 
   Over the last few years, we have spent many billions on the water system, our wastewater and clean water systems in Iraq. But we have fallen down at the Federal level on what we are doing on our wastewater and clean water systems in this country. And most of the spending has been done by the State and local governments and particularly by the ratepayers. And so this is a very necessary, very overdue bill, as many have pointed out. And I urge support for this legislation.

   Mr. DUNCAN. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for yielding me this time, and I thank the majority side for agreeing to this unanimous consent request. 
   I simply wanted to rise to say this. During my 6 years as chairman of the Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, I do not believe we had a better member or more active member than the gentleman from Oregon, and I certainly have the greatest admiration and respect for him and his concern about this legislation. 
   I simply wanted to rise to say this. I don't believe this Congress could pass a stronger environmental bill than this legislation that is before us at this time; Chairman Oberstar has continually made sure of that. And when we started with this bill several years ago, some people wanted no Corps reform at all; some people wanted so much Corps reform that really they were trying to stop every project that was included in this bill. 
   Mr. Costello, who was my ranking member at that time, we compromised, we worked out things. 
   I want to commend the staff for their work in this regard, and we put in many environmental concerns the first time around. Then we put in even more the second time around when we passed this bill. 
   We are now here again. We have given reform on peer review now so that all the major projects, all the projects over $50 million are subject to peer review. We have put in environmental reform and Corps reform in regard to mitigation issues. We have put in Corps reform in regard to project planning so that all the concerns of all the environmental groups who want to be involved in this process will be included. 
   I just want to point that out, how environmentally strong this legislation is thanks to not only our efforts on this side and the staff and Mr. Baker, but also Chairman Oberstar, Mr. Costello, Chairwoman Johnson with a lot of contribution from the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) himself.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Mr. Speaker, I won't take much time. I'll be very brief. 
   I just wanted to come over here and congratulate my colleague, Congressman Grijalva, and especially congratulate his women's softball team from the University of Arizona. They proved, once again, as they have done several times before, that they really have another great team. I think this was probably, what, their seventh national championship or something like that. 
   This was the first time that my Lady Vols softball team had gone as far as that team did. The University of Tennessee is my alma matter. It's a school of which I am very proud; and it has not only great academics, but it also has a very rich athletic heritage and history. We've been primarily known for our men's football team and our women's basketball, several national championships by both of those programs. But the Lady Vols softball team this year was one of the greatest sports teams in the history of the University of Tennessee. And, in fact, our great pitcher, Monica Abbott, won more games than any pitcher in women's collegiate softball history. And probably no athlete in the history of the University of Tennessee has ever dominated a sport like Monica Abbott. 
   So once again I want to say congratulations to my Lady Vols, my Tennessee Lady Vols softball team. But I'm here today to especially offer congratulations to a great women's softball team from the University of Arizona. They won another national championship, and it was a well-deserved championship because they had to fight very hard to get it, and I just wanted to come and say congratulations at this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (WASTEFUL EXPENDITURES IN U.S. EMBASSY IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, the easiest thing in the world to do is to spend other people's money. And it never ceases to amaze how the Federal bureaucracy can rationalize or justify the most wasteful or ridiculous expenditures. But the lavish new embassy we are building in Baghdad and the staffing and expenses for it will just about take the cake. 
   Here is part of a recent Fox News report: ``It's as big as Vatican City and makes foreign embassies dotting the tree-lined streets of Washington, D.C. look like carriage houses.'' But the barely finished U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is already prime for expansion. 
   Due for completion in September, the $592 million campus is surrounded by concrete blast walls and features green grass gardens, palm-lined avenues, and volleyball and basketball courts. Available to embassy employees are a PX, commissary, cinema, retail and shopping areas, restaurants, schools, a fire station, power and water treatment facilities, a swimming pool, a recreation center, and the ambassador's and deputy ambassador's residences. 
   And with months still to pass before it opens, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told a Senate subcommittee in May that additional staffing and housing needs have forced officials to add more structures to the now 21-building site. She asked for an additional $50 million from Congress to make that happen. In other words, almost $600 million is not enough. Then the budget for 2006 for the employees was $923 million, not including salaries and expenses for about 600 employees from other Federal agencies and departments than the State Department. 
   To a recent story from The Washington Post: ``Mention the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to Lawrence Eagleburger and he explodes. 
   `` `I defy anyone to tell me how you can use that many people. It is nuts. It's insane, and it's counterproductive. And it won't work,' says the Republican former Secretary of State and member of the Iraq Study Group.'' 
   Secretary Eagleburger said, ``I've been around the State Department long enough to know you can't run an outfit like that.'' And Secretary Eagleburger was reacting to a staffing level of 1,000, twice the size and 20 to 30 times the budgets we have at our embassies in China, Mexico and Britain. 
   The Post story quoted a senior State Department official as saying, ``Maintaining an oversized mega embassy in Baghdad is draining personnel and resources away from every other U.S. embassy around the world, and all for what?'' The story also said that counting contractors and Iraqi employees, the staff actually is not 1,000, but a staggering and astounding 4,000. 
   Madam Speaker, I know that many people in our Federal Government want to think of themselves as world statesmen and to feel real important, but it is both unconstitutional and unaffordable for the U.S. to try to govern or police the whole world. And all this certainly goes against every traditional conservative position I have ever known. 
   Above all, what we are doing building this Taj Mahal industry in Baghdad and allowing an almost $1 billion budget to operate is as far from fiscal conservatism as you can get. 
   And finally, Madam Speaker, because a previous speaker mentioned General Petraeus's report, let me add this: There is a very important reason why our Founding Fathers, and throughout the history of this Nation our leaders, have always believed in civilian control over the military. The admirals and generals will almost always give positive or optimistic reports saying progress is being made. We have received positive reports from our top military leaders all through the war in Iraq. It is almost like the generals saying they're doing a bad job if their reports are not positive. 
   Madam Speaker, we should admire, respect and appreciate our military, and I certainly do. But we should not worship them or feel it is somehow unpatriotic to ever criticize any Pentagon waste or any decision a general might make.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (ESTABLISHING NATIONAL TUNNEL INSPECTION STANDARDS -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to voice my strong support for H.R. 409, and I would also like to commend Chairman DeFazio and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano) for bringing this bill to the floor at this time. 
   On August 2, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee passed an earlier version of this bill on a voice vote. I believe that the entire committee agreed with the main objective of this bill, to ensure that our Nation's highway tunnels are safe. But some members had concerns about the new tunnel inspections directly competing with ongoing bridge inspections. This substitute bill addresses these concerns. 
   This bill requires the Federal Highway Administration to establish a new national highway tunnel inspection program in consultation with State DOTs and other knowledgeable organizations. The new tunnel inspection program is modeled directly on the existing highway bridge inspection program and addresses three major areas: One, it establishes national highway tunnel inspection standards to ensure tunnel inspection uniformity. Secondly, this establishes a national tunnel inventory  to publish the findings of all tunnel inspections. And thirdly, it develops a national program for training and certification of highway tunnel inspectors. 
   This bill will make tunnel inspection requirements consistent with the current bridge inspection requirements. I think this is a concept we can all agree on. 
   There are approximately 400 highway tunnels in the United States, and we need to make sure that those tunnels are safe. But there are more than 580,000 road and highway bridges in the United States, including almost 55,000 interstate bridges. I'm pleased that instead of having tunnel inspections compete directly with highway bridge inspections, the substitute bill before us makes tunnel inspections eligible for funding from other highway programs: the Surface Transportation Program, the Federal Highway Administration administrative expenses, or surface transportation research funds. 
   I hope that if this legislation secures Senate passage and becomes law, we can further fine-tune the tunnel inspection funding source issue so that the different tunnel inspection activities are funded from the appropriate program. 
   Again, I voice my support for H.R. 409, and I urge its passage. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to also voice my support for House Resolution 772. House Resolution 772 was introduced by Chairman Oberstar, Ranking Member Mica, Highways and Transit Subcommittee Chairman DeFazio, and myself to recognize the 75th anniversary of the American Highway Users Alliance, a broad national coalition of organizations representing motorists and businesses. 
   The American Highway Users Alliance is a nonprofit advocacy organization with the mission to promote safe, uncongested highways and enhanced mobility. The group's membership includes over 300 national trade associations, corporations, small businesses, and other State and local nonprofit groups. They represent over 45 million highway users. 
   Since 1932, the group has fought for road and bridge investments that will save lives, promote economic growth, improve quality of life, and protect freedom of mobility. 
   The American Highway Users Alliance focuses its campaigns on fair highway use taxation, Federal highway policy and funding, and responsible environmental policy. 
   The American Highway Users Alliance is an important voice for the interests of motorists and businesses and has been an active participant in every major national highway and traffic safety law passed over the last 75 years. 
   I strongly support this resolution and congratulate the American Highway Users Alliance on its achievements and on its 75th anniversary. Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (AMENDING THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986 TO RESTORE THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND BALANCE -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6532, a bill that will restore funding to the highway trust fund and ensure that the flow of Federal highway funds is not interrupted at the height of the construction season. 
   According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation officials, if this problem is not fixed, States could lose up to $14 billion in highway funding resulting in approximately 380,000 jobs lost. 
   At a time when our economy continues to struggle, we simply cannot afford to cut Federal funding for highway projects. Earlier this year when we were debating the economic stimulus package, some said we were simply borrowing money from the Chinese to purchase Chinese products. This bill ensures that we are investing in our own transportation infrastructure, giving income to American workers and improving America in the process. 
   It is also important to note that we are restoring funds to the highway trust fund that were transferred out of the fund 10 years ago. In other words, this is money that was supposed to be in the highway trust fund in the first place. We are not robbing the general fund, we are simply restoring money that was never supposed to be in the general fund. 
   In 1998, Congress determined that the balances of the highway trust fund were too high and transferred $8 billion out of the trust fund and into the general fund. This bill returns those gas tax revenues to the highway trust fund to ensure that it does not become insolvent. 
   Madam Speaker, I always rank in the top 10 or 15 most fiscally conservative Members of Congress, but there are some things that we need to do, and a first class national system of transportation is vital to our national economy. I urge support for this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3999 and encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this bill. It has been an honor and privilege for me to serve now 20 years on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. In significant part, it has been an honor and privilege because of the opportunity to serve with a man like Chairman Oberstar, who certainly is the most knowledgeable person on these issues of anybody in the entire Congress. 
   I can confirm that he has been speaking out on the need to do bridge maintenance and construction and repairs for all of that time, and not just after the terrible tragedy in his home State of Minnesota. 
   It's also a privilege to serve with my boss, my ranking member, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica) to whom I owe the privilege of serving as the ranking member of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee. 
   This bill makes much-needed improvements to the existing Federal highway bridge program and to the regulations pertaining to bridge inspections. The bill incorporates a risk-based priority system for the replacement and rehabilitation of bridges to ensure that States are addressing their most urgent bridge needs in a timely manner. We haven't had this up until now. 
   The bill also requires more frequent inspections of bridges that are classified as structurally deficient and strengthens the training and certification requirements for bridge inspectors. These changes to the existing Federal highway bridge program are designed to improve the program and should benefit all States. 
   The bill also provides $1 billion for States to replace and rehabilitate highway bridges. This is a substantial sum of money, but the Federal Highway Administration estimates that it will cost more than $65 billion to address existing bridge deficiencies. This $1 billion is merely a start. It will only provide an average of about $20 million to each State to address bridge-related needs, barely making a dent in this problem. 
   But I do have some concerns with a few aspects of this bill. I am concerned that the formula through which the funding in this bill will be distributed does not reward States for placing a priority on maintaining their bridges. Since funding is distributed based on the number of deficient bridges in each State, States that put an emphasis on maintaining their existing bridge inventory may get less under this formula than a State that has neglected their bridge needs. 
   My home State of Tennessee has placed a priority on maintaining their bridges and as a result the number of structurally deficient bridges in Tennessee is about half of the national average. But instead of being rewarded for their responsible approach to maintaining their highway infrastructure, the State in a way will be penalized and will receive less than their fair share in funding from this program. I think we should have rewarded the States who have worked harder at this. 
   I am also concerned that this bill practically eliminates any flexibility a State has to transfer funding from the bridge program to other Federal highway programs when there are urgent needs to do so. We are concerned about that. The flexibility provision in this bill eliminates flexibility for every State except for one, the State of Delaware. 
   Despite these concerns, I do strongly support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I have just a couple of additional comments, Madam Chairman, and I recognize myself for such time as I may consume before Chairman Oberstar closes. I do want to, once again, commend him for his work on this important legislation. 
   I think everyone agrees that to have a vibrant national economy, we have to have an effective, efficient and first-class system of transportation. Certainly our local governments have an important role in that process and our State governments have an important role. But there is a very important and legitimate national role in our transportation system in this country. 
   People in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida use the highways and bridges in Tennessee and vice versa. And now under SAFETEA-LU, we are providing an average of $4.5 billion a year for our bridge system. But as so often is the case, terrible tragedies sometimes call our attention to shortcomings or to needs that exist in this country. And the tragedy of the bridge collapse in Minnesota certainly did that and called our attention to the fact that we need to do a great deal of work on our bridges. 
   This is a one-time, 1-year, $1 billion supplemental authorization for some additional funding for our bridges. As I said earlier, it averages out to about $20 million a State. It will barely put a dent in our problem, but it's a legitimate thing for this Congress to do. 
   I urge support for this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (NATIONAL DEFENSE AND ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss two very important national issues that are unrelated. 
   First, I consider national defense to be one of the most important and most legitimate functions of the National Government. Yet even I am astounded at sometimes the waste and inefficiency of the Defense Department, and I think the primary reason is that almost every defense contract is some sort of sweetheart or insider type deal. 
   Just yesterday in the Washington Times, I would like to read a portion of a story that the Times carried yesterday. It says: ``Similarly, Edward C. `Pete' Aldridge, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics at the Pentagon, left the agency to join the board of Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon's largest contractor. Weeks before he left the Pentagon, Mr. Aldridge approved a $3 billion contract to build 20 Lockheed planes. That decision was made after he criticized the plan and threatened to cancel the contract. While serving on the Lockheed board, Mr. Aldridge was picked in 2004 to chair the Commission on the Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy, a decision that drew criticism only from Senator John McCain of Arizona, now the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, who said Lockheed was one of NASA's biggest contractors and called for Mr. Aldridge's removal because of a conflict of interest. His criticism went unheeded.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the problem is that all of the defense contractors hire all the retired admirals and generals, it has been referred to as the ``revolving door at the Pentagon,'' or all the high level Pentagon employees, and then they come back to these same people and they get these multi-billion dollar contracts. In this example, this man awarded Lockheed Martin a $3 billion contract, the same contract he criticized at one point. But then, surprise, shock of all shocks, he approved this contract, and then a short time later joined the board of Lockheed Martin. 
   This is just one example. I could give examples day after day of similar types of things. All of these defense contracts going to companies that hire all the retired admirals and generals, and it should be stopped. 
   The second issue, a very important issue but very unrelated, is the issue of energy and gas prices. I would like to read part of a column by Charles Krauthammer a few days ago. Mr. Krauthammer is very respected by both sides of the aisle. 
   He said, ``Gas is $4 a gallon, oil is $135 a barrel and rising. We import two-thirds of our oil, sending hundreds of billions of dollars to the likes of Russia, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. And yet we voluntarily prohibit ourselves from even exploring huge domestic reserves of petroleum and natural gas.'' 
   Mr. Krauthammer continued: ``At a time when U.S. crude oil production has fallen 40 percent in the past 25 years, 75 billion barrels of oil have been declared off limits, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That would be enough to replace every barrel of non-North American imports for 22 years.'' That is nearly a quarter century of energy independence. 
   Mr. Krauthammer said, ``The situation is absurd.'' 
   George Will wrote a column a few days ago and he said this: ``One million barrels is what might today be flowing from ANWR if in 1995 President Bill Clinton had not vetoed legislation to permit drilling there. One million barrels produce 27 million gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel.'' 
   And Robert Samuelson, who is not really considered a conservative or Republican columnist, he is a columnist for the Washington Post, he wrote a few weeks ago this. He said, ``The truth is we are almost powerless to influence today's prices. We are because we didn't take sensible actions 10 or 20 years ago. If we persist, we will be even worse off in a decade or two. The first thing to do, start drilling.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I am one of the very few Members who has been up to Prudhoe Bay in Alaska twice. I have been up there to this frozen tundra. There are millions of acres without a tree or a bush on that entire expanse up there, 19.8 million acres, 36 times the size of the Great Smokey Mountains, part of which I represent. They want to drill on about 2,000 or 3,000 acres of this 19.8 million acre refuge. It takes a survivalist to go in there. In fact, Time Magazine said 4 years ago it only had about 200 visitors a year. 
   It is ridiculous that we do not drill in an environmentally safe way. Most environmental extremists, I have noticed over the years, they come from very wealthy or very upper-income families. Perhaps they can afford gas to go to $5 or $6 a gallon. They have said for years they wanted gas prices to go higher so people would drive less. But I can tell you this: They are hurting a lot of poor and lower-income and working people in this country, and they are shutting this country down economically. 
   We heard in the Highways and Transit Subcommittee a few weeks ago that  935 trucking companies had closed in the first quarter of this year, and they only counted trucking companies with five trucks or more. Two weeks ago we heard in a hearing of the Aviation Subcommittee that eight airlines had shut down, had ceased operating in the last year-and-a-half, and one more was in receivership. 
   We are at a very dangerous point. We don't have to produce all of our oil or all of our energy, but we have got to start producing a little bit more, or these foreign energy producers are going to know they can keep on raising these prices, and as I say, they are going to hurt a lot of working and ordinary Americans in the process.

<DOCNO>Mr. DUNCAN. (REGARDING INSPECTOR GENERAL OF COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. DUNCAN. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm honored to be on the floor on this legislation with my good friend, Chairman Towns, who is one of our great Members on the other side. 
   Today we take up H.R. 6406 which elevates the Inspector General of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to an Inspector General position requiring a Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, or, as some people refer to it, a PAS position. 
   On behalf of Ranking Member Davis, I do want to express one concern, and that is that this legislation does not come to the floor through regular order, and while we understand the need to move quickly to ensure that we have solid oversight from an independent source at the CFTC, this bill could have benefited from a review by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. 
   Recommendation 6 of Paul Volcker's National Commission on Public Service issued in January of 2003 said, ``Congress and the President should work together to significantly reduce the number of executive branch political positions.''     
   The Commission noted that President Kennedy had 286 leadership positions to fill when he became President in 1960, and that by the end of the Clinton administration there were 914 principle leadership positions; and that in 2001, the new President, George W. Bush, at that time confronted a total of 3,361 offices to be filled by political appointment. 
   The Commission pointed to several reasons for this, mostly due to a bad Federal management structure. But regarding Inspectors General, we believe much of this stems from an assumption that the PAS process generates a more professional and independent Inspector General. To our knowledge, no one has successfully demonstrated a nexus between the PAS process and professional excellence. And our fear is that a growing lag in the PAS process will cause even larger gaps in leadership during the Presidential transitions. 
   With that said, however, on our side, we're inclined to support this bill given the current crisis that we face. And we know that the CFTC is a very important agency, particularly at this time. But we caution our colleagues to pay more attention to these ``elevation bills'' in the future and insist on a specific articulated need for any proposed change, and also, hopefully, full committee hearings. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I have a statement that I wish to place into the Record on behalf of Ranking Member Davis and myself in support of this legislation.  
   Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of this bill designating the facility of the United States' Postal Service located at 801 Industrial Boulevard in Ellijay, Georgia, as the ``First Lieutenant Noah Harris Ellijay Post Office Building.'' 
   On June 17, 2005 First Lieutenant Noah Harris was conducting a mounted patrol in Baquba, Iraq, when enemy forces fired rocket-propelled grenades at his armored Humvee. Noah Harris died from the injuries on June 18, one week before his 24th birthday. 
   By all accounts, Noah Harris was a remarkable person. 
   While attending Gilmer High School in Ellijay Georgia, Harris was the captain of the football team, a state wrestling champion, and Honor Bar Thespian in the theater club. 
   After graduating high school in 1999, Harris attended the University of Georgia's Terry College of Business, where he continued his involvement in the community and athletics. He was the captain of the cheerleading squad, a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and a volunteer for Watch Dawgs, an organization that works to prevent alcohol related accidents among students. 
   In 2001, Harris was one of the first participants in the Leonard Leadership Scholars Program, a leadership development program for undergraduates by the Terry College Institute for Leadership Advancement. It was during that time, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, that Harris first considered serving our country through military service and joined the ROTC. 
   After graduation, Harris was commissioned as a second lieutenant and stationed at Fort Benning. To keep up morale among his soldiers' Harris began a pen pal program with family and friends. He also started ``Operation Noah's Dream'' by encouraging members of his community to send him beanie babies, which he passed out to children in Iraq. 
   He was truly a person that strove to make a difference at home and Iraq. Tragically his life was cut short but his memory will live on and he will be greatly missed. 
   With gratitude for his sacrifice to his country, I ask all members to join me in support of HR 6847, to name the 801 Industrial Boulevard Post Office in Ellijay, Georgia in his honor.  
   At this time, I yield the balance of our time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Deal).
