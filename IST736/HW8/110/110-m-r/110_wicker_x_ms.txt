<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE IMPRISONMENT OF AYMAN NOUR -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, this week marks the third anniversary of the imprisonment of Egyptian parliamentarian and presidential candidate Ayman Nour. He was jailed on charges of forgery during the 2005 presidential elections in Egypt. 
   Nour suffers from numerous health problems. He has been subjected to documented physical abuse and has been denied visitation rights afforded to other prisoners. His health condition continues to worsen. 
   Many Members of Congress stand in solidarity with Ayman Nour and respectfully call on President Mubarak to grant his unconditional release. December 10 is Human Rights Day, marking the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In honor of that day, the Egyptian Government should release Ayman Nour. This action would symbolize a recommitment to the inherent dignity of all people and to their equal and inalienable rights.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (SAYING GOODBYE TO THE PAGES -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just say, not everyone within the sound of my voice realizes how hard these young people have worked, some of them, for the last semester, some of them for the past 9 or 10 months, but almost to a person they have been in the page school. There will be a graduation ceremony tomorrow, I understand. 
   They get up in the wee hours of the morning and go to school in a very rigorous academic course, and then they put in a full day. On those frequent occasions when we are in session late at night, they are here with us. So we appreciate their hard work. It has been a great learning experience for them, I know; and I just want them to know how much we appreciate it. 
   They have been here during momentous times. They have seen the President of the United States, as my friend from Maryland stated. They have seen heads of state come and go in the building and witnessed debates concerning the great issues of our time, issues today concerning the very question of life itself. Issues of war and peace and billions of dollars being debated, they have been able to witness. 
   Just as significantly as all of those issues, they have witnessed the orderly transfer of power that we have seen year in and year out, Congress in and Congress out in this great institution. The transfer of power not at the point of a gun, as a result of a battle, but as a result of Americans, one by one, going eventually in the millions and voting in the ballot at the ballot box. 
   Sometimes we are delighted with that orderly transfer of power, as I was in 1994 and 1995, when I first came here as a Member of a new majority. Sometimes, as occurred last November and this past January, I was not particularly overly delighted, but it is profound, nonetheless, that we make those changes in government at the ballot box and not at the point of a gun. 
   In 1967, I had the privilege for only 1 month to serve as a page in this great Chamber for this great body. It was a life-changing experience for a young boy from Pontotoc, Mississippi; and I daresay for the young people lining the back rail and listening to our words this afternoon it has been, in so many ways, a life-changing experience for them. 
   It occurred to me during that brief stay here as a page that I might someday, if given an opportunity and if luck came through, come back here as a Member of the House of Representatives. I had that great opportunity. 
   But to so many of them, undoubtedly, they have no desire whatever to come back here as a Member but to go on and serve their country in other respects, in their professions, perhaps in the military, or perhaps some of you also in public service. 
   But I would simply say that, in closing, they have had such a rare opportunity to serve their country in a way that so few young people have been able to do. We appreciate it very, very, very much. We wish each and every one of them Godspeed as they go back to their homes and families. 
   I thank my friend for yielding the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution celebrating National Community College Month. 
   For more than a century, community colleges have offered millions of Americans an affordable means of education close to home. Today 11 million students are enrolled in these institutions, and the reach of this educational opportunity goes far beyond serving the traditional high school graduate. Many adults are taking classes to pursue a college degree, gain continuing education for their present jobs, learn skills for new careers, and earn high school diplomas. 
   Community colleges are also playing key leadership roles today in support of economic development activities. The unique ability of these institutions to adapt workforce training programs to meet specific needs in the areas they serve is a powerful resource. These schools have been partners in attracting new industry and helping existing businesses expand operations. 
   As co-chair of the bipartisan Community College Caucus, I am proud to join this effort to support the goals of National Community College Month and congratulate these institutions, their students, faculty, and staff for their contributions to education. 
   Our caucus was created in 2006 to help educate Members of Congress and focus national attention on the activities community colleges are undertaking to provide educational options and improve the quality of life in the areas they serve. 
   I am also proud of the role the State of Mississippi has played in the development of this important educational opportunity. In 1922, Mississippi became the first State to create a statewide system of junior colleges. It brought affordable and accessible post-secondary educational choices to all of our citizens. Today, more than 70,000 full-time students are enrolled at 15 community colleges in my home State. 
   I stand in strong support of our community colleges and salute their work to educate a diverse group of Americans spanning all age, income, race, and ethnic categories. The enhanced opportunities provided by these institutions are educating millions of people and helping provide a more skilled workforce to compete in our global economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin the debate by thanking Chairman Edwards for all the hard work he's put into preparing this legislation. I congratulate him on his first bill as chairman of Military Construction-VA, and I appreciate his kind words made just a few moments ago. Mr. Edwards has continued the excellent bipartisan relationship that this subcommittee has enjoyed for years. The chairman held many, many hearings this spring, perhaps more hearings on the VA accounts than any previous subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue. 
   Mr. Edwards has previously thanked our staff for their diligent work to prepare this bill and has mentioned them by name. I will thank them once again by name. They include Liz Dawson, Dena Baron, Jamie Swafford and Susan Sweat on the minority staff, and Carol Murphy, Walter Hearne, Tim Peterson, Donna Shabaz, Mary Arnold and John Conger on the majority staff. They have worked very hard on this measure, but their work is just beginning. 
   As most of us know by now, there's much left to do in conference on this bill. For the first time in the history of the subcommittee, for the first time since 1958, the military construction portion contains no specific recommendation for projects. While I remain disappointed that no projects were included in this appropriation, I am pleased that last night we reached an agreement that will restore the transparency and openness begun by the Republican majority in the last Congress with regard to earmarks in the remaining appropriations bills. 
   I want to make sure my colleagues understand that there is very little to the military construction portion of this bill. Unlike some appropriations bills, such as the Homeland bill we passed earlier today which include funding for specific agencies, offices and programs in addition to projects, the MILCON appropriation consists almost entirely of projects. 
   Pursuant to yesterday's agreement, specific detailed funding amounts for the following programs will have to wait until conference: Base Realignment and Closure needs; initiatives to restation 70,000 troops and their families from Europe and Korea to the United States; projects necessary for increasing the active duty Army by 65,000 and the Marine Corps by 27,000; relocating Marines from Okinawa to Japan; consolidating U.S. forces south of Seoul, South Korea; establishing enduring bases in Afghanistan and Djibouti; new runways, control towers, National Guard readiness centers, and projects in the Middle East or Afghanistan where we have soldiers in harm's way. All of these specific details will have to wait until conference, Mr. Chairman. 
   In addition, we know that quality-of-life issues are a priority for our military; yet, no specific initiatives such as modernization of unaccompanied housing, construction of new medical facilities or much-needed child development centers, which we continuously heard in our hearings was the primary quality-of-life issue for our soldiers and their families, none of these are included in this bill. 
   Specific projects and earmarks will no doubt be included in the Senate version of this bill, and I hope Chairman Edwards and Chairman Obey will work with Mr. Lewis and me to make sure that House Members' initiatives will receive equal consideration at the conference level and are not disadvantaged by our airdropping of these projects into the conference. I would point out that the bill is different from other appropriations bills in that military construction projects have an added layer of examination, having already undergone scrutiny by the Department of Defense. 
   It is my hope that our colleagues will not offer amendments today that may decrease the military construction accounts. Though this bill today does not detail how these accounts will be used, the accounts will provide for many important military projects that our troops need. 
   Now, with regard to the VA portions of the bill, the VA is receiving the largest increase in the Department's history, an increase of $6.7 billion over the last fiscal year level. All of us in this body are deeply grateful for the sacrifices and service our veterans have provided this Nation, and this generous increase is appreciated by Members on both sides of the aisle. We do have concerns about the VA's ability to absorb so large a funding increase in one fiscal year. We are determined to work with VA officials in this effort as part of our oversight responsibilities. 
   The bulk of the increase is going to boost medical services, medical facilities and construction for the VA. The bill increases the VA's discretionary funding by more than 18 percent over the fiscal year 2007 level. It is important to remember that the increase in this bill is in addition to the $1.8 billion this Congress just provided to the VA in the supplemental. When considered together, the supplemental funding and the funding in this bill amount to a 23 percent increase for the Department of Veterans Affairs' discretionary accounts. 
   Chairman Edwards has indicated that we will be conducting oversight hearings later in the year, and I'm glad to know that. Hearings will be needed to ensure that the funding we have provided actually gets to the veterans and does not languish in an administrative account. Mr. Chairman, we all want to make sure our veterans receive the care they deserve, but we will have to be diligent in our oversight in order to get this funding where it is intended, to our veterans. 
   The President has indicated he will sign this bill even though it exceeds his budget request by some $4 billion. However, he has stated that offsets for these increases should be found in other appropriations bills. I agree with him, and I call upon my colleagues across the aisle to work with us and find these savings elsewhere. 
   I think it is important to point out that, though we have some concerns on our side of the aisle about the feasibility for this large 1-year increase, it has been in large part Republicans that have a track record of meeting veterans' needs. During the period of Republican majority from 1995 to 2007, VA funding increased by 96 percent from $38.2 billion to $74.5 billion. I would point out that in the final decade of the last Democratic majority, veterans funding increased by less than half as much, about 42 percent, Mr. Chairman. 
   Similarly, Republicans led the way to increase spending per veteran by over $1,800 when we held the majority, while the Democrats managed to increase per-veteran spending by $411 during a similar period of their majority. It was also a Republican Congress that passed the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, which expanded eligibility for millions more veterans to access VA health care. 
   I point out these things to make sure my colleagues understand the historical record on veterans' issues. And in truth, Mr. Chairman, funding for our veterans has always been a bipartisan issue. 
   I support the bill on the floor today. It continues in the bipartisan tradition. It's not a perfect bill in my opinion, but our subcommittee has a good work product, and I'm proud of the combined efforts of Republicans and Democrats to continue the longstanding tradition of support and commitment for the men and women who have served our great country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Just in closing, the Speaker of the House just said what a happy day this is for her. It is a happy day for me and for Members on this side of the aisle also, Mr. Chairman. 
   Why on a bipartisan issue do we have to sound so partisan sometimes in supporting the bill? 
   The Speaker mentioned that veterans funding had been so neglected for the past few years. I will again point out to Members of the House, Mr. Chairman, that during the period of Republican majority, in working with our friends across the aisle and funding VA, we increased funding by 96 percent during that period, from $38.2 billion annually to $74.5 billion. And during the final decades of the Democratic majority, the increase was only half that much. 
   The Speaker mentioned the concurrent receipt issue. Of course it was during the speakership of Speaker Hastert that the House of Representatives enacted concurrent receipt legislation. And as a matter of fact, the previous speaker, Mr. Buyer, was the author and prime mover behind that legislation, and he deserves credit. 
   The point is this is a bipartisan issue. There is bipartisan support. I expect after discussion of a few amendments, Mr. Chairman, that we will have a near unanimous vote in favor of this bill. I will certainly be voting for it, as will the leadership of the Appropriations Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, this really is an unprecedented move. We were originally told that it would be scheduled for first thing this morning. Then it was rescheduled for early this afternoon. And once again, the matter was so controversial that it had to be pulled again and we find ourselves discussing it now at this moment. 
   I frankly wish my friend from Wisconsin would pull the motion again, because there is only one way to understand this process. This is, as the Republican leader said, a political stunt. If it is allowed to proceed, the result will be predictable. The President will veto the product of this conference committee, because it will attempt to spend billions and billions of new dollars on domestic programs we cannot afford, just when a balanced budget is within sight again. The President will veto the bill, the President's veto will be sustained, and we will be back to the drawing board. 
   While all of this is unfolding, much-needed funds for our veterans clinics and for our servicemembers and their families will be delayed, not to mention essential funding for our Nation's defense in the global war on terror, for our troops in combat in Afghanistan and Iraq who are risking their lives for our country even as we speak. These key national security expenditures will have to wait even longer than they have already waited. 
   The other result of this process will be just as predictable. Some people in this town, in this very House, will have gotten what they wanted: more political theater, more attempts to link good policy with excessive spending in an attempt to score political points. 
   Madam Speaker, does the Democratic leadership of this Congress want to pass appropriation bills or do they just want to make new campaign commercials? 
   Four and one-half months ago the House of Representatives passed the Military Construction-VA bill with an overwhelming 409 votes. The Senate passed its version of MilCon-VA with only one dissenting vote on September 6, 8 weeks ago. The President has expressed his willingness to sign the bill. Mr. Edwards and I, along with our subcommittee, have stood ready to go to conference for almost 2 months. Why, other than politics, have these funds for military quality of life and for our Nation's veterans been delayed? 
   Mr. Edwards and I, as chairman and ranking member, have worked along with our Senate counterparts and our staffs to craft a compromise between the two versions of MilCon-VA. Only a few outstanding issues remain. We are ready to go with this essential bill. The same is true for the Defense appropriations bill. 
   That means we could have bills on the President's desk within a matter of days. Funds for vital infrastructure for our troops, child development centers and veterans programs could be in the pipeline within a matter of days. Do we really want to hold our present and former troops hostage for political games? 
   So I urge my friends on the other side the aisle to reconsider this unprecedented maneuver. Send the bills by regular order according to the established rules. Let's get the funds to our troops without further delay.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I expect a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle are going to vote for this legislation. I can't vote for it because it doesn't live up to the rhetoric that we have heard from the proponents of the legislation in debate today. 
   If you want to come up with a bill to, indeed, make college more affordable for middle America, then count me in. If you want to improve access to a college education for millions and millions of American young people, then count me in. If you want to do something about the very real problem of slowing the growth rate of college tuition, which is really what we should be getting at, then count me in. But I don't think this bill does any of that. And frankly, I am afraid that in the end this legislation, if enacted, would actually make a college education more expensive. 
   But I have to respond to some comments made by my friend from Virginia, Mr. Moran, just a few moments ago to the effect that Republicans are not interested in helping Americans get a college education, that we somehow have a poor record in supporting student aid and higher education. I would take strong exception to those remarks, and I would submit to the contrary, Madam Speaker, that House Republicans, over 12 years of Republican majorities in this House of Representatives, have a proud record of working to expand college access through a two-pronged effort: Number one, working to hold institutions more accountable for their role in college costs, and this bill does nothing to address that whatsoever, and number two, maintaining a historic bipartisan commitment to Federal student aid. Under 12 years of a Republican majority in this House of Representatives we have achieved record levels of overall student aid, more than tripled what it was a decade ago. We funded more Pell Grants, a two-thirds increase over the past decade. In addition, the Republican record on student aid includes new grant aid for Pell Grant students, higher loan limits to give students access to more financial aid, lower loan fees so that students can keep more of what they borrow, tuition savings and deductibility, reduced student loan payments and ending the single holder rule, student loan relief for higher demand teachers--and certainly, that is something that we could have hearings about and have a bipartisan consensus about, Madam Speaker, targeting this student aid to those students who plan to go into difficult areas where there is a great need in this country--taxpayer savings through fewer lender subsidies and, finally, less fraud and abuse in Federal student aid. 
   So I would submit that this party has had a proud 12-year record of accomplishment in student aid, and I could not let the statements of my very good friend from Virginia go uncontested. We are all for helping students, for making college education more affordable and more accessible and for helping move more people into a higher education and a better way of life for them and their families. And I don't think this bill gets us there. I think 12 years of Republican leadership is something that we can all be proud of. So I will be voting against the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation to fund our troops.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this legislation. I want to thank Chairman MURTHA and Ranking Member Bill YOUNG for their leadership and for working with the members on both sides of the aisle in crafting this important bill. 
   This measure provides the funds to enable our military to meet the challenges it faces in the global war on terror and to protect our homeland. It contains resources to address the needs of our military families and includes initiatives to produce the advanced weaponry, equipment, and training to ensure that our military remains the best in the world. 
   I am particularly pleased that the Committee did not include restrictions on funds that would prevent the President and our military commanders in the field from implementing the surge strategy in Iraq. 
   In the debate on funding for the troops and the surge earlier this year, some of my Democratic colleagues and many in the news media proclaimed this operation to be a failure even before it began. Many said the war was lost. Despite signs that the new strategy was taking hold, the Democratic majority sought to undermine this effort with attempts to cut off funding and set a date-certain for withdrawal. President Bush and Republicans in this Congress countered that we should support the troops fully and give the surge time to work. 
   There is solid evidence now that this strategy so ably put into place by GEN David Petraeus is working. Two military commanders on the ground there reported this week that they are denying freedom of movement to Al-Qaeda and that the citizenry have a new level of confidence in the Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces. More Iraqis are turning against Al Qaeda and working with Coalition forces to make their communities safer. 
   Further proof about progress in Iraq was provided in a July 30 op-ed in the New York Times. The column, entitled ``A War We Just Might Win,'' was written by Michael O'Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack, two fellows at the Brookings Institution who have been harsh critics of the war effort. They spent eight days in Iraq and spoke of the significant changes taking place there. 
   They wrote that troop morale is now high, that Coalition forces are confident in the strategy, and that they have the personnel on the  ground to ``make a real difference.'' Army and Marine units are working well with 
   Iraqi security units and the political and economic arrangements being forged at the local level are helping provide basic services to the Iraqi people. 
   They visited Anbar province and its capital of Ramadi, which has gone from being described as the worst part of Iraq to the best in just six months. To quote, ``A few months ago, American Marines were fighting for every yard of Ramadi; last week we strolled down its streets without body armor.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, in a previous House debate on this issue, I noted that the American people are war-weary and impatient with the progress of our efforts there. I also said I believe the American people want us to win. I understand the frustration they feel about this engagement, but I still believe they want us to succeed in bringing about a free and stable government in Iraq and in defeating Al Qaeda. The reports I referenced earlier offer encouragement that our strategy may yet produce those results. 
   Our success there would stymie the plans outlined by Osama Bin Laden and his Al Qaeda Jihadists who consider Iraq a central battleground in the war on terror. They seek to establish a radical Islamic caliphate in the Middle East and use it as a beach-head to spread their terror and intolerance throughout the region and around the world. 
   We have taken the fight to terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan to deny them the staging ground to plot more September 11-style attacks in the U.S. We have also been vigilant about protecting our homeland since 9-11, and we must continue to provide the support our military and our intelligence communities need to meet that challenge. That includes modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to enable our intelligence agencies to remove outdated restrictions on the collection of information needed to stop terrorist plots before they can be carried out. 
   The funding in this bill and revising the FISA provisions will send a message about our commitment to providing the resources to protect our homeland, enable our military to defend American interests, and fight terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I thank my distinguished friend from Washington. 
   Madam Speaker, my friend from Florida says that this new Democratic majority was determined to govern differently than previous majorities. He has succeeded in this regard, Madam Speaker: This is the latest the Congress has gone without sending a single appropriation bill to the President for his signature since 1987. I don't think that is what the Democratic majority had in mind when they said they would govern differently, but they have certainly done so. 
   So I rise to express my opposition to the rule and to the conference report that will serve no purpose other than to delay funding for veterans, for our troops and for their families. 
   The conference report before us includes both the Labor-HHS Education appropriation bill and the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriation bill. The President stands ready to sign the MilCon-VA bill into law. He could have done so already and made funding available for key veterans health and benefit programs and much-needed military construction projects. 
   But the majority has chosen to link that bill with a bloated Labor-HHS, Education bill, a measure which the President will veto. So this exercise today amounts to a waste of time and sends the wrong message to veterans and military personnel. Instead of honoring these men and women for their sacrifices and providing assistance to them today on the eve of Veterans Day, we are short-changing our veterans in the interest of political gamesmanship. 
   The majority's strategy was to couple these bills with the expectation that many Members of Congress would not have the political will to oppose funding for veterans even temporarily. We should not use our veterans as pawns and we should not insult their intelligence. Give our Nation's heroes more credit than that. Our veterans can see through this ruse. So can the American people, and they should be rightly outraged by it. 
   I have in my hand a statement taken from the Web page of the American Legion, our Nation's largest veterans organization. The American Legion says, ``Here we are again, the start of a new fiscal year and Congress still has not passed the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill.'' The American Legion goes on to ask the question: ``So what is the problem?'' And their answer is accurate: ``Politics.'' 
   The American Legion goes on to denounce Congress' plans to hold VA funding hostage. 
   Another veterans organization, VetsForFreedom.org identifies this process for what it is: ``A cynical attempt to use veterans as a political shield for further wasteful government spending.'' VetsforFreedom goes on to say they call on Congress to pass clean bills for the Veterans Administration and the Department of Defense as quickly as possible. 
   Madam Speaker, we should be moving this legislation under regular order. It is true that Congresses in the past have used omnibus bills, but always as a last resort after first trying to follow regular established procedure. In this instance, the Democratic leadership did not even attempt to follow regular order. Instead, their first attempt to bring these conference reports to the floor amounts to an unprecedented departure from established procedure. 
   I very much regret the decision of the majority to link these two bills. The House passed its version of the MilCon bill in June by a vote of 409-2. The Senate passed its bill on September 6, 2 months ago, with a vote of 92-1 in favor of the bill. For 8 weeks, Chairman Edwards and I stood ready to conference these bills. We could have brought a bill to the floor weeks ago that would have passed overwhelmingly and been signed into law by the President. 
   Instead, after waiting 8 weeks, when we were finally given the green light to move forward with a conference, the members of our subcommittee were not appointed as conferees as is normally the case. The majority decided that the Labor-HHS conferees, most of whom did not attend MilCon-VA hearings or participate in our bill's creation, would be involved in deliberations on VA-specific provisions. 
   Mr. Edwards and I, as chairman and ranking member, have worked along with our Senate counterparts and our staffs to craft a compromise between the two versions of the MilCon-VA bill. The compromise before the House includes funding for numerous military construction projects that are vital to support the working environment and quality of life of our soldiers and their families. 
   We have included funding for base realignment and closure. We have included funding for initiatives to restation 70,000 troops and their families to Europe and Korea; projects necessary for increasing the active duty Army by 65,000 and the Marine Corps by 27,000; relocation of Marines from Okinawa to Japan; consolidating U.S. forces in South Korea; establishing enduring bases in Afghanistan and Djibouti; barracks and family housing projects; new medical facilities; and needed support facilities for our Guard and Reserve. And all of this on a bipartisan basis. 
   I was especially pleased to join Chairman Edwards in a very important quality of life initiative, funding much-needed child development centers. 
   With regard to the VA portions of the bill, the department is receiving the largest increase in the department's history, an increase of $4.8 billion over fiscal year 2007. This increase even exceeds the independent budget request submitted by the various veterans service organizations. The bulk of this increase is going to boost medical services at VA hospitals and clinics. In fiscal year 2008, it is estimated that the VA will treat 5.8 million patients, including 263,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. 
   The conferees have produced a bipartisan conference report. It is a good work product. It continues the long-standing tradition of support and commitment for the men and women and their families who are serving our country and those who have served our country in the past. 
   It is unfortunate that these worthy projects are now joined with a bill that includes $10 billion in excessive spending on domestic programs. 
   Included in the Labor-HHS portion of the bill is a new duplicative program for the CDC for comprehensive sex education; a new grant-making initiative at the Department of Education targeting the creation of full-service community schools. 
   The only office at the Department of Labor the majority has seen fit to cut is the one responsible for union oversight. Apparently union accountability is unimportant to the majority, so they cut the labor management standards budget by 20 percent. 
   In conclusion, Madam Speaker, I mention these things to point out that there are legitimate differences surrounding the Labor-HHS bill. There are good reasons the President will veto Labor-HHS. But there are no good reasons for this bill to be linked with MilCon-VA. Vital funding for the VA and infrastructure for our troops could be in the pipeline within a matter of days, but the majority will simply not allow that. Instead, we are sacrificing veterans for the sake of a cheap, cheap political stunt. Our Nation's veterans deserve better. The American people deserve better. 
   Vote ``no'' on the rule and vote ``no'' on the conference report.

   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, my friend from Texas, with whom I have worked closely and for whom I have the greatest regard, mentions proudly and properly this, the largest increase in veterans spending in history. 
   I have to say that it does come on top of record spending increases for veterans over the past 12 years. So, I take a second place to no one in my support and in defending our stewardship of the Veterans Administration over the past 12 years. 
   My friend quoted the DAV organization. I am sure they support this bill. I am also sure, just like the American Legion and the Vets for Freedom, that they don't want it delayed as this process will do, and that's why I urge a defeat of the previous question and of the rule. 
   My friend says that not one Republican Member voted for the budget resolution. The budget resolution provided great funding for the veterans, but it also included the largest tax increase in the history of this country, and that's why Republicans voted against the budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has been a very difficult issue for me for quite some time and I think for many of my colleagues also. It involves deeply held convictions by conscientious people of good faith, by some of my closest friends, on both sides of this question. 
   So I would like to begin with some things we can all agree upon. Principles about which there is no real debate today. 
   First of all, this bill is not about the legality or illegality of embryonic research. Surprisingly, I have had constituents say to me that they weren't asking for Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, only that it be legal. This represents a misunderstanding of existing law. 
   So let us be clear at the outset. Embryonic stem cell research is legal today, has always been legal, and few people are suggesting that it be otherwise. 
   Secondly, there is currently a great deal of embryonic research going on today. Over the past 6 years, under the Bush guidelines, more than $130 million has been devoted to human embryonic stem cell research. Such research is also being conducted by State governments to the tune of $140 million. I happen to believe that this type of research is ethically troubling, but for my colleagues who feel otherwise, let us at least acknowledge that a lot of embryonic research is being done under current law. 
   Next, I think we can all agree that the Federal Government alone cannot possibly fund all the medical and scientific research we would want. The annual appropriation for the NIH is $28 billion. But even if that figure were to be doubled or even tripled this year, we couldn't afford all the potential research that is out there. 
   It is our job as Federal legislators to pick and choose. We have to allocate scarce resources, and we can't do it all. 
   Which brings us to the real philosophical difference in the debate today. For me and many of my fellow Americans, the destruction of a human embryo involves profound ethical and moral questions. This is a matter of conscience for millions of taxpayers who are deeply troubled by the idea of their tax dollars being used to destroy another human life. 
   We have been told by proponents of this bill that all they want to do is use embryos from fertility clinics which would otherwise be thrown away. I do not believe it will end there. After a period of time with no progress, we will be asked to approve and fund therapeutic human cloning, the creation of a human life for the express purpose of destroying that embryo for research purposes. This is the very real slippery slope upon which we are perched. Indeed, many proponents of this bill have voted against legislation to prohibit human cloning. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, given the admitted ethical problems involved in destroying human embryos, given the lack of any results so far from embryonic research and the proven cures and accomplishments from adult stem cells, given the great potential of germ cells, cord blood cells and amniotic stem cell research without the ethical drawbacks, and given the limited Federal resources and the fact that we can't fund everything, shouldn't we concentrate Federal dollars on research that does not involve the destruction of human embryos?

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is a rather straightforward and simple amendment. It would simply restore to the face, or the obverse, of the dollar coin, the new dollar coin that is being minted now, the words ``In God We Trust'' and ``E Pluribus Unum.'' 
   ``In God We Trust'' is the current national motto and has been our motto since 1956. ``E Pluribus Unum'' was actually suggested by the Congress to be on the seal of the United States of America as early as 1776. These two phrases have been a part of who we are and what we are about for as long as almost anyone within the sound of my voice can remember. 
   Now, I have in my hand here a United States quarter. On one side, it has ``In God We Trust.'' You turn it over, and this happens to be one of the new quarters featuring a State, it happens to be Rhode Island, but still there's room on the other side of that coin for the term ``E Pluribus Unum''--out of many, one people, as I say, a very significant phrase about who we are as a people. 
   You take the dollar coin, Mr. Speaker, and there's a picture of George Washington on the front, there is a likeness of the Statue of Liberty on the back, but if you're looking for the words ``E Pluribus Unum'' or ``In God We Trust,'' it's not on either side. In order to find that, you have to look at the very edge of the coin and you have to get the light just right and there it is on the edge of the coin. 
   I think most people would agree with me, Mr. Chairman, in saying they would like to have these significant phrases returned to a position of prominence on the coin. Whether by design or by accident, whether purposely or unintentionally, the fact that these two important mottos are on the edge of the coin, I think it puts them in a less prominent place, and I think most Americans would appreciate it if we put them back where they should be. 
   With that, I would urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WICKER. My friend the gentleman from New York says there's the possibility that we might do something unintentional here. Really this is quite clear. And Members voting on this in a few moments should understand that it's quite clear. If you feel that ``In God We Trust'' ought to be put in a place of prominence on the dollar coin, you'll vote ``yes'' for the amendment. If you feel that the all inclusive phrase ``E Pluribus Unum'' should be put back on the dollar coin in a place where it can actually be read by people using it in commerce, then you should vote for the Wicker amendment. 
   If there is a question on interpretation, if there is this possibility that the chairman mentions, certainly that can be cleared up. This amendment has a little farther to go. The Senate may take up the appropriation bills. At some point we will have to come to some sort of agreement between the House and Senate on how to fund the Treasury and the departments dealt with in this appropriation bill. 
   I say the issue is clear. If you want ``In God We Trust'' on the dollar coin, it's a very simple question. Vote ``aye'' on the Wicker amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear that my friend from Oregon supports regular order. That is not what we are seeing today. 
   But the pundits say there is no point in talking about the legislative process in this debate today. They say people don't care about the rights of the legislative minority. I am not so sure about that. When people outside the Beltway hear that the funding bill for the rest of the year was basically drawn up by two people--one Senate chairman and one House chairman, in a closed room with no input from anyone else--they might conclude that doesn't sound quite right. And then when they hear this bill cuts military construction by $730 million below last year's level and falls over $3 billion short of the redeployment needs of our servicemen and their families, then most people might feel a little more debate and a few more people in the room could have resulted in a solution that fully funded these essential programs. That is the way the legislative process works. Someone drafts up a proposal. Then it is debated and amended, and in the end, a consensus is possible. 
   But this is the first time in recent memory where the leadership simply puts two people in a room and lets them write an entirely new bill, moving the numbers around to suit their own preferences. And then the House is told ``just take it or leave it.'' No amendments. No give and take. No one else allowed to submit a better idea. And only 30 minutes of debate for the minority side. 
   Maybe that is why this bill does not meet the critical needs of our soldiers, such as basic housing allowance and research for Gulf War veterans and amputees. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, process may be considered inside baseball and a nonissue to some. But to me, democracy calls for a fair process, even in a continuing resolution; and, more often than not, it results in a better bill for the average citizen.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, on December 31, 1776, with the fate of the Revolution in doubt, General George Washington faced a challenge of convincing his soldiers to stay in the fight. With their enlistments over, they wanted to go home. Washington made an impassioned plea and even offered volunteers a bonus. But no one responded. He spoke again, saying that all they held dear was at stake. And finally one man stepped forward. Then others followed. 
   Public opinion at that time was not on Washington's side. Only a third of the population supported the war for independence. One-third were openly hostile, and another one-third simply did not want to be involved. 
   We should be grateful that George Washington was not obsessed with public opinion polls. 
   Only days earlier Thomas Paine had written: ``These are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.'' 
   In the summer of 1863, Colonel Joshua Chamberlain of Maine faced a similar crisis. He had to convince a group of mutineers to stand and fight in a key battle. He promised to plead their case later if they rejoined the ranks. They did, and helped him win the Battle of Gettysburg. 
   Public opinion at that time was running against President Lincoln and the war. It was lasting longer and costing more than anticipated. In Congress, Democrats demanded the troops be brought home immediately, but Lincoln stood by his convictions and won the war. 
   It is easy for us to look back on these pivotal moments in our Nation's history without remembering how tough the going was, how reluctant many of our own people were, and how it took strong leadership to bring about victory. 
   Let's contrast those times with the situation today in Iraq. Clearly the American people are tired and impatient with this war, and many believe we cannot win. Yet troop morale is high. In testimony before Congress last week, the senior enlisted personnel from each service, the National Guard, and the Reserves, said our forces in Iraq believe in what they are doing and that positive things are being accomplished. 
   But you don't have to take their word for it. The enlistment and reenlistment figures themselves are a testimony to the commitment of our troops. All service branches met and exceeded their goals in both categories in 2006. The command sergeant major of the Marine Corps told our committee that young people join the Marines today to get to the fight. Knowing full well they will go to Iraq, they are signing up with enthusiasm and purpose. It almost takes your breath away to hear the troops who have been there say they continue to believe in our mission and want to see it through to completion. 
   I hear the same thing from my constituents who have returned from Iraq. They express frustration about the news media's focus on the bad news. Returning troops tell of their successes in helping steer Iraq toward a path of democracy and freedom. 
   I received an e-mail this week from a Mississippi soldier in Iraq. He said, ``No one wants everybody home more than I do, but we must finish the job. We are doing good things here and taking bad guys out of the game.'' 
   The most important question in today's debate is what message does this resolution send to our military, to the volunteers who have been serving so proudly in harm's way? And make no mistake, they are listening to what we say here and watching what we do here. Will the passage of this resolution give our troops encouragement? I don't think so. 
   The Americans are conflicted about this war. A CBS poll this week showed that only 44 percent of Americans support this resolution; 45 percent are opposed. That is all the more reason for leaders to lead. Washington and Lincoln were not concerned about public opinion polls. They did what was necessary to succeed, and that is what is called for in the halls of Congress today. 
   I am convinced that deep in their hearts, most Americans realize we are in a serious global war for survival against an enemy that wants to wipe us off the face of the Earth. When all is said and done, the American people want us to win this war. Success in Iraq is a key element in winning against the terrorists. 
   Osama bin Laden's chief deputy has urged al Qaeda operatives in Iraq to expel the Americans, extend the ``jihad wave'' to neighboring countries, and 2 weeks ago he spoke of Afghanistan and Iraq as two ``most crucial fields.'' I regret to say that enemies like these will be pleased when this resolution passes. 
   Madam Speaker, let's send the terrorists a message of strength and resolve. Let's send a message of support and unity and confidence and appreciation to our troops. This resolution sends the wrong message, and I will vote against it.

   Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood and I were elected together in 1994, as were the two previous speakers. And we were part of that history-making, majority-making 73-Member class who came to office in 1995. 
   It didn't take us long to realize that Charlie Norwood was one of the wisest and steadiest and most dependable Members of that class. He was a conservative, and never wavered from that philosophy. He was trustworthy, as Mrs. Myrick said. 
   He was a competitor. When Charlie Norwood waged battle on this floor on your side, you knew you had a capable comrade at arms. And if he was on the other side, when it was over, you knew you had been in a fight. I remember at the end of the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, right along the rail back here, Charlie Norwood and Tom Coburn embracing after the debate like athletes after a great contest. 
   Whatever he did, Charlie Norwood did it cheerfully, and that is one of the main things I will remember about Charlie. He was a patriot in every sense of the word. He was a credit to  this House of Representatives. I am proud to have called him my colleague and my friend.

   Actually, it is not usually my practice to come before this House and defend the New York Times. But it was actually an advertisement, a full-page advertisement taken out in the New York Times by the ultra-leftist group, moveon.org. I have a copy of it right here. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is by George Soros and moveon.org. It says: ``General Petraeus or general betray us? Cooking the books for the White House.'' I was astonished to see even moveon.org attack the messenger as they did today and attack the credibility and integrity and, if you please, the patriotism of this great servant who has served so many years in the military and who was confirmed unanimously in the United States Senate. It was and is an insult. It shows the level to which the opponents of this surge and those who would legislate defeat in Iraq would go. 
   I was glad to see Ranking Member Duncan Hunter and Ranking Member Ileana Ros-Lehtinen take this group to task during the hearing and to call on members of the committee at the hearing today to disassociate themselves, whether they agree with our policy in Iraq or not, to disassociate themselves from this type of smear tactic that we saw coming from moveon.org in the New York Times in the form of this full-page ad.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. I appreciate my friend yielding, and I have also been in need of a poster before and not been able to find it. If the gentleman would put that quote from General Petraeus back up, I will refer to it while he looks for the other quote from the ambassador. 
   To emphasize this point again, coalition and Iraqi security forces have made progress toward achieving sustainable security. Now, that is the testimony of this well-respected general that we have entrusted with this very important mission. 
   And it disturbs me, Mr. Speaker, that often the message of the accomplishments doesn't get through to the American people. We hear only about benchmarks not quite being met or expectations not quite being realized. For example, people point to the fact that an oil law has not yet been enacted by the leadership in Iraq and submitted to the Iraqi Parliament. 
   As a matter of fact, as the testimony indicated today, oil revenues in Iraq are up and the revenues are in fact being distributed out to the local governments and the provinces. Now, this is in the absence of a final piece of legislation enacted by the parliament. But the fact remains that under this interim procedure that they have now, the oil revenues are there. Iraq is exporting oil for the first time in quite some time, and the oil revenues are being distributed out where they can benefit the people. That may not be a benchmark of legislation, but it is a real accomplishment; and it is the sort of thing that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were talking about. 
   Also, there has been much made of the fact that there has been no reconciliation statute enacted into law over there. But as was pointed out today in the testimony, former members of the Iraqi Army, former Baathists, if you please, are now being accepted into the government and being given pensions from the government and many of them are being accepted back into the security forces there in Iraq. 
   Now, a law hasn't been passed, but in my opinion that is de facto reconciliation and de facto amnesty for these people who were formerly in Saddam's Iraqi Army. By the thousands, these people are being integrated back into the mainstream of Iraqi security forces. 
   Also in the Anbar province, it is well known at least in this capital city that the sectarian leaders all across that province have turned on al Qaeda. They were in league with them a year ago. They have now turned on them, and they are helping the United States and coalition forces because they realize that their future does not lie with this destructive, violent al Qaeda force, but with the forces that would bring freedom and liberty and self-determination to more Iraqis. 
   Sectarian violence is down, as Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain pointed out in their op-ed in the Wall Street Journal today, and I would commend that to our colleagues. There is an excellent bipartisan piece about that. Sectarian violence is down all over the country, down 70 percent in Baghdad alone. So there are real accomplishments there. 
   Certainly, as the general said, innumerable challenges lie ahead. The assessment is optimistic, but it is sober  and this is no rosy scenario; but there is much reason to be optimistic. 
   Let me just say this about the feeling of the American people: I know that they are frustrated about this. This war has gone on longer than expected, and they have been conflicted about it. But I believe after being home for much of August and talking to my constituents, I think the American people do want us to succeed in Iraq. They realize that failure there, that withdrawal there, that leaving too early would leave a huge void that probably al Qaeda would fill and probably our detractors in Iran would fill, and they know that would be a disaster. They want success, and I think these two gentlemen who testified before us give us a good opportunity for success. 
   A few moments ago we gathered on the east steps of the House of Representatives, and we commemorated the sixth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on 9/11. Two other speakers on the floor today were not Members of the House of Representatives at that time. I was, and I shall never forget the resolve and the determination of the Congress, both ends of this building, both sides of the aisle, on that day to defeat these terrorists. 
   The al Qaeda terrorist network that we are fighting in Iraq today is the very same network that brought down those two buildings in New York. They are the very same network that sent a plane crashing into the Pentagon. And they are the very same al Qaeda that had a plane headed toward Washington, DC, which undoubtedly was 
   headed towards the Capitol Building. 
   We are still fighting al Qaeda, and I appreciate people like Ambassador Crocker and General Petraeus who are fighting that war as capably as they know how. Al Qaeda must be defeated, Mr. Speaker. And our best opportunity, our greatest chance to defeat al Qaeda today is to be successful in Iraq. That's what I would urge my colleagues to support, and I believe that is what the American people want us to do. I thank my friend for calling this Special Order.

   So it would certainly be inaccurate to say that the Jones report was totally negative and that the Petraeus report was somehow far different. So I very much appreciate the gentleman pointing that out, and I simply wanted to underscore the very optimistic words that the general had in his testimony.

   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, I served as a conferee on this bill Monday afternoon, and I was disappointed at what I saw. Everyone in the room knew then, as they know now, that President Bush will veto this legislation because it contains dangerous timelines for withdrawal in Iraq, undercutting our chances for success and making a political statement at a time when we should be working in a bipartisan manner to give our troops the resources they need to succeed. 
   Many of us heard General Petraeus this afternoon. I think most Members are highly impressed with his command of the situation and his candor. We ought to be willing to give him and his new strategy a chance. Instead, the bill before us tonight would guarantee failure. 
   This is a futile exercise and a waste of valuable time. It ensures further delay in getting the equipment, supplies and support to the troops. Because Congress has not provided this funding already, our military leaders must shuffle existing funds. Spending on new equipment will be postponed and repair work will be slowed on equipment needed elsewhere around the world, and the Pentagon will have to curtail training for National Guard and Reserve units. This will hamper their capabilities and their readiness. 
   The veto will come quickly, and, when it does, I hope the majority will not engage in further attempts to micromanage the war. Let's craft a responsible, focused supplemental package that funds the military and demonstrates to our soldiers that we support their efforts to complete the mission. 
   Contrary to what some in the Democratic leadership say, the war is not lost. Let's not legislate as if it is.

It will be acted on today, it will be acted on perhaps tomorrow by the Senate and on the President's desk. There is another bill that very much needs to be on the President's desk by Veterans Day, which is November 11. I suppose we will be celebrating it on Monday, November 12, this year because we don't have the Federal holidays on Sunday. That's the bill making appropriations for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs. That bill is ready to go and also ready to be sent to the President of the United States. 
   The House passed its version of the MilCon-VA bill on June 15 of this year by a vote of 409-2. The Senate passed its version of MilCon-VA on September 6, over 2 months ago, by a vote of 92-1 in favor of the bill. For over 2 months, we have stood ready to conference this bill to send it on to the President and send vital funds for infrastructure, for our troops and for their families, and also for our heroes who have served in the past. 
   As we all know, this is the latest the Congress has gone without sending a single appropriation bill to the President in the past 20 years. 
   Now, what this amendment that the gentleman from Florida will do, if he is allowed to offer the amendment, is simply to instruct the Speaker to appoint conferees immediately for the MilCon-VA bill. It will do nothing to the Defense bill whatsoever, but it is a way for us to proceed immediately on legislation, which all of our veterans service organizations say is important, which is a good bill, and which should be sent to the President by Veterans Day. 
   I will be joining Mr. Diaz-Balart and others in voting against the previous question, not because there is anything wrong with the Defense bill, but in order for this amendment to be added and simply allow MilCon-VA to proceed also. 
   Now, as we say sometimes in the rural south, there is more than one way to skin a cat. If Members feel that defeating the previous question is not what they want to do and requiring the Speaker to appoint conferees immediately, there is another way to move the MilCon-VA immediately and have it sent to the Senate this very day, and that is some legislation which I introduced last night. It's H.R. 4104, and here is what it does. It contains the exact language that was signed by the conferees with regard to MilCon-VA. It is a stand-alone bill with the conference language on MilCon-VA, and it could be adopted this afternoon by unanimous consent. It could be adopted under a suspension of the rules, sent to the Senate immediately, and sent on to the President for his signature before Veterans Day. 
   What a way to honor our veterans. What a way to honor and pay tribute to the families that will benefit from the MilCon projects and to the troops that need that vital infrastructure. 
   Defeating the previous question and amending the resolution, I support. But if Members feel they cannot go along with that, I urge them to look at this bill, H.R. 4104. We already have over 100 cosponsors. As I say, it is identical to the bipartisan MilCon-VA conference agreement that Mr. Edwards and Mr. Obey and I and Mr. Lewis worked out as a conference agreement with Members of the Senate. It is the exact language that was passed as an attachment to the Labor-HHS bill. 
   You know, this should not be a partisan issue. I strongly disagreed on the floor of this House with my friend Mr. Obey and the leadership of this House with the strategy of linking MilCon-VA with the Labor-HHS appropriation bill. I stated that I thought it would slow things down, and, indeed, it did slow things down. The strategy didn't work. The Senate delinked those two bills yesterday afternoon, and now we are really not sure where we are. 
   H.R. 4101 is the best way and the quickest way for this House and for the Senate to simply send that legislation on to the President. He could be signing it tomorrow afternoon. 
   So I call on my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. I like Mr. Diaz-Balart's strategy. Frankly, I like my strategy a little better because it's cleaner. Let's pass a stand-alone MilCon-VA conference report, the exact language that every one of us has already agreed to, send it on to the President and honor our troops by Veterans Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in strong support of the amendment, thanking my subcommittee chairman, Mr. Edwards, for his kind remarks about me 2 days ago and about the staff, expressing regret that we couldn't have done the MilCon-VA bill earlier.  
   Mr. Speaker, allow me to say a word or two about the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs portion of this omnibus bill. When the legislation was before the House earlier this week, Chairman Edwards was generous in his praise of our majority and minority staff members of the subcommittee. I wholeheartedly echo that sentiment. We have been blessed with a capable and hard-working staff. 
   Chairman Edwards was also kind enough to acknowledge that he and I have worked in partnership on this bill from day one. I want to take this opportunity to return that salute. Mr. Edwards sought my input throughout the process, and I am grateful that together with our subcommittee members we have been able to put together a bipartisan product that provides historic increases for our veterans, for our troops, and for the quality of life of current military families. These funds come on top of substantial increases for these accounts during the 12 years when Republicans were in the majority. 
   I would also gently remind my colleagues that this vital funding has been unnecessarily delayed. We could have moved to conference quickly on this type of funding--in a bipartisan and unifying way. Instead, powers above Mr. Edwards' and my pay grades decided to attach the bill to a much more controversial Labor-HHS-Education measure, and there it has sat, now some 80 days into the new fiscal year. 
   In an attempt to break the logjam, I introduced legislation identical in every respect to the Milcon-VA conference agreement, and every Republican member of this body co-sponsored that bill. We could have had funding in the pipeline for family housing, childcare centers, veterans and military construction early on. But the bill was held hostage as leverage for an additional $22 billion in completely unrelated areas. 
   In the end the ploy did not work. Thankfully we are passing an omnibus bill at roughly the President's level, and the veterans and troops are finally getting a bill. I would simply urge my fellow Members to resist these types of maneuvers in the future. Let's not hold up Milcon and VA spending in an effort to spend more elsewhere. 
   Having made that point as cordially and charitably as I can and in the spirit of the Christmas season, I again thank and commend my Chairman for allowing me to participate in an excellent bipartisan achievement.

<DOCNO>Mr. WICKER. (WOUNDED WARRIOR ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WICKER. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this and other efforts to correct deficiencies in our military health care system and to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces get the attention and quality they deserve. This is not a partisan issue; as a matter of fact, this is a bipartisan effort, and I am glad to be a part of it as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs in the Appropriations Committee. 
   The Wounded Warrior Assistance Act is an important first step in improving the delivery of medical care and quality of life for our injured military personnel and their families. I say a first step, Mr. Chairman, because I hope it is the first of several to focus the necessary resources and enhance the facilities for overall delivery of service. 
   I am particularly interested in simplifying and speeding the paperwork process associated with both the initial care of these heroes and their transition to the programs administered through the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   Our wounded warriors, their families and the dedicated health care professionals committed to serving their needs should not have to face bureaucratic stumbling blocks that prevent the timely administration of care and the processing of claims to help these heroes get back on their feet. I support provisions in this legislation that will provide more resources to address the problem, especially the medical evaluation delays. As the bill moves forward, I will say to the leadership of the full committee, I encourage the authors of this legislation to consider adding additional judge advocates to assist the medical evaluation process. 
   In conversations with soldiers at Walter Reed, I learned of a shortfall of properly trained full-time attorneys to assist and represent patients during the formal evaluations. This occurs during the process leading up to the board and during the board. In many instances, the backlog was so long that soldiers retained outside counsel for hearings at their own cost. Those who could not afford to do this were forced to wait. In fact, the March 12 inspector general report highlighted this problem and recommended an increase in trained attorneys. 
   I am grateful for the full committee leadership of the Appropriations Committee for accommodating me in my amendment in this regard. While we await the full Army Tiger Team report in May, I hope my colleagues will recognize the need and right of our wounded soldiers to proper representation. 
   I participated in hearings on this issue as ranking member of the MILCON VA Appropriations Subcommittee, and as a member of the Defense Subcommittee. I have visited Walter Reed Army Hospital and talked to soldiers receiving treatment there and elsewhere in our military and VA systems. While the recent problems have stained our military health care system, I have been encouraged by the bipartisan manner in which we have approached this issue. I have also been encouraged to hear very positive reviews also with regard to our VA health care system, and I know it can be improved on, but certainly we get very, very positive reviews from the constituents who actually use these facilities. 
   These oversight activities have been very helpful in identifying steps we can take immediately to put the focus back on caring for our wounded soldiers. I look forward to working with the chairman and others of my colleagues to advance this legislation as it moves through the process.
