<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMAN QUARTERLY REPORT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Madam Speaker, tonight we come with a quarterly report from the freshmen Republicans. This is something that we promised to do when we were first elected, and we continue to do it each and every quarter because we want to come back to the American people and tell them what their House is doing. 
   Tonight, for many of you and many of your houses it might be summer school, and last week I just got my daughter and my sons' report cards. They did very well, if you were concerned about that, Mr. Heller. But what the report will be from this Congress on this night is not good. 
   In less than 2 days, this House is scheduled to adjourn; adjourn without solving the energy crisis, or even allowing a vote on this floor. So tonight as the freshmen Republicans come to you to talk about this quarterly report, something has happened in the last 2 weeks. 
   You know, in the minority party here, Madam Speaker, one thing that these freshmen Republicans will do is they don't sit back.     
   Even if the majority party, the Democratic controlled House here, will not allow a vote on the floor, we believe the American people are hurting; we understand the American people are hurting when it comes to the energy crisis with the price of gas over $4 a gallon, the heating fuel costs which continues to not only hurt the individuals, but it hurts the nonprofits, it hurts the school districts. As we continue to move forward, some districts in my area are talking about even maybe going to 4 days a week, some are talking about charging if the kids want to even ride the bus to school. So we talked about, how can we go about helping America? How can we help solve this problem? 
   So collectively as freshmen and as Republicans, we got together along with our leader, Mr. John Boehner from Ohio, and we decided, let's go on the all-American energy tour and let's actually sit down and talk to some experts. 
   So not last weekend, but the weekend before, we went together to Golden, Colorado. In Golden, Colorado they have the National Renewable Energy Laboratory from the Department of Energy. Here, they study from wind, from solar, to hybrids, to hydrogen cars. We drove them. We looked at them. We went through with the biomass, different ways about where the future will go in energy and how we can actually become independent and have an American energy program that creates American jobs. Because, as many of you know, in America today we use 20 million barrels of oil a day but we only produce 7. So to solve this problem, we really need all of the above. We need more wind, we need more solar, we need to actually be able to conserve more, but we also have to be able to explore more. 
   So just as we went out and looked at the renewable energy and we looked to where you build the windmills; you build them where the wind blows. Where do you put out the solar panels? You put them out where the sun shines. Where do you explore for oil? Where it is, underground.  
   From there we traveled up to Alaska. We landed in Fairbanks and we went up to ANWR. We went out and looked exactly where we are already drilling today. We went out to the first place where the Alaskan pipeline starts. The Alaskan pipeline, when it starts right there, it sends 700,000 barrels of oil a day. It takes 9 days to get from the beginning to the end. But in 1989, that used to produce 2.2 million barrels a day. Every year that we do nothing, it loses 15 percent. That is 15 percent less barrels of oil coming down. America is still using 20 million barrels, but only producing 7. 
   And as we looked around, we looked for environmentally friendly ways to do it. We found that in the past you would take 64 acres, today you would only take maybe 16, maybe 6. You could actually drill down and drill out 8 miles because of technology advancements, and that we could do it in an environmentally sound way. And as we went to ANWR, just a few miles over, we found that there is another 10 billion barrels. 
   We found out that if ANWR was allowed to be drilled, where this body will not even let it come up for a vote, it would add 1 million barrels a day. And 1 million barrels a day added inside that pipeline, what would it mean to you back home? What would it mean to the average citizen? It would mean 50 cents less in the gasoline per gallon that you buy. 
   Our Federal Reserve Chairman was before our committee just 2 weeks ago, and he said 1 percent added in production would decrease the cost by 10 percent. That is just a 1 percent addition. One million barrels of oil would lower the barrel $20 a barrel from what you see out on the market. 
   We have a plan. We have an idea. But tonight, and unfortunately when we come to you, the power of the idea will not win on this floor. Not because the desire is not there, but because the majority party will not allow it. 
   Today we had a very big vote, like many of our votes here. But do you know what the vote was today? By one simple vote. If you wonder if that one votes ever makes a difference, that one vote made a difference today, because on this floor by one vote the Democrat-controlled Congress voted to adjourn, voted to adjourn while the gas prices were over $4 a gallon; saying to the American people that, as I listened to the Speaker the other day, she is trying to save the planet. She is looking at the longevity of the world. I am looking back for the constituents back home that can't afford to continue to live the way this economy is going. 
   Tonight, we are going to listen to a lot of the different freshmen that actually went on the tour, been a part of it, seeing what is going on in America today. And first we are going to start off with my good friend from the State of Michigan, District 7, back in Battle Creek, Tim Walberg.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman from Michigan as he tells of the personal stories within his district of the suffering, of the pain. 
   But as I said earlier, what did this Democrat-controlled Congress do? Today it voted to adjourn, adjourn for an entire month, as many across America dreamt about maybe going on a summer vacation, but told their kids, no Disneyland this year; we can't afford even to drive there. 
   But, as the Republicans, we don't sit back and just complain. We believe that we can lead. When you look at Congress, you look at the opinion polls, it is down at 9 percent. Many across America are now beginning to call this Democrat-controlled Congress the ``No Drill Congress.'' 
   And we won't even bring up appropriation bills. One of the major jobs of this Congress is to fund government. 13 appropriation bills they are supposed to bring up each and every year, but the majority won't even bring them up because they are afraid of an amendment coming on the bills. The amendment would say, let's create an energy plan. And what would that energy plan be? It would be all of the above. It would expand solar, it would expand wind, it would explore, it would go beyond for the new technologies at the same time, and it would lower the price of gas and create an American energy independent program that creates American jobs. 
   We have other members from the Freshman Class here with us tonight. Our next speaker, you may have heard him just a little bit ago talking about the National Guard in Nevada, and he continues that leadership now as he begins to talk to us about the energy. Representing Reno, Sparks, Carson City, the majority of Nevada, coming from the Second District, I yield to my good friend, Representative DEAN HELLER.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman from Nevada for the leadership he continues to show in this work that we are trying to do within the energy. 
   Tonight, when we went up to ANWR, one thing that I found most interesting when we talked about is how you can do it environmentally friendly. One thing that they showed when we were up in Alaska, that in the 1970s, it took them 20 acres and they would go down 1 mile. 1980s it took them 16 acres. 
   But you think about technology, and the greatest way for America to understand technology, think of that very first cell phone. It came in a bag. It was about the size of a brick. Today it is a very little phone, and you know within that phone that it has more technology in the cell phone today than we had on the Apollo when it landed on the moon. 
   But you expand with that technology. Today, present, it takes only 6 acres, so your footprint is much smaller. But what they are able to do when they drill down, to go out 8 miles across, what does that mean to the American people? 
   One, that we are able to explore much further, to do it in an environmentally sound way, have a much smaller footprint, and actually have fewer wells to drill. 
   There is a plan to be able to go forward that allows exploration, wind and solar, but the Democratic-controlled Congress will not even allow it to come up on to the floor. 
   This is becoming, Madam Speaker, a ``No Drill Congress.'' But the American people continue to suffer. 
   And tonight we wanted to hear from our good friend from Ohio, JIM JORDAN. I yield to my friend from Ohio.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman from Ohio. And the one thing that he was talking about was we flew over ANWR. We took a few photos. And what you will see here, here is a photo of ANWR. You wonder, where are the animals? Where are they at? 
   And people wonder about, well, how far away is this from where we are currently drilling? It is within 70 miles. 10 billion barrels of oil sitting right there. It would not take you 10 years to begin.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. The gentleman makes a very good point because in 1970 when this was created, back then when Jimmy Carter became President of the United States, he had full intention of drilling in ANWR because that's where the oil is. That's why you put the windmills where the wind blows and the solar panels where the sun shines. You discover where it's at. 
   And what the Member did talk about was if you look here, this is where we currently are, and ANWR is just to the side. And you're wondering just how large is it. It's 19 million acres. We're looking at only talking about 2,000 acres. 
   To put it in perspective, as you go out when school starts back up, you go to your high school football games, I want you to look across that football field when no one's there. I want you to just look out at it, and I want you to take one little postage stamp and set it on the field. That's the equivalency. That's how much we want to be able to talk about being able to get 1 million barrels of oil a day out of ANWR, a postage stamp on a football field. 
   The gentleman from Ohio brought up a very good point that we have this infrastructure, this pipeline. It produces 700,000 barrels a day. Once it goes to 300,000, it will no longer produce then. You have to have more than that. 
   Now I would like to yield to my good friend, a new member from the freshman class from the First District of Louisiana, STEVE SCALISE.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana. He made some very good points. And one thing you think of this House and you think of America. I still believe this is the most beautiful building we have in all of this country. You would think the power of the idea would win at the end of the day. And you would think of the debates you have here. But when did you ever think that the Democratic controlled Congress would be so afraid of having a debate, to actually allow a vote to take place? They have the majority. They can vote the way they want. 
   Today they had the majority to vote to adjourn. Now they're going to have to go home and answer to the American people why they are not back working and finding an American independent energy policy to move forward. 
   Now I would like to yield to my good friend from eastern Tennessee, DAVID DAVIS.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. So what the gentleman is saying is the Democratic controlled Congress, the majority who controls what comes to the floor, will not even allow a vote? Not even allow a vote on a plan that says all-of-the-above, that says ``yes'' to solar, ``yes'' to wind, ``yes'' to more drilling, ``yes'' to the new technologies for geothermal and others, but you can't even have a vote on this floor?

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. You're all raising very good points, but you're showing what is happening on this floor by not allowing the vote. But there is another way. There is all-of-the-above. If we were able to drill in ANWR, the Federal Reserve Chair said, if you increase production by 1 percent, it goes down 10 percent. ANWR will produce 1 million barrels a day. That automatically would lower the price per gallon by 50 cents. 
   But think about what's happening today. It's the largest transfer of wealth from our country, America, to countries that disagree with us. If we had an American energy plan that made us independent, what else does it do? It creates American jobs. The $700 billion stays in America.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Reclaiming my time, because as we begin to end here, one, I want to thank all my colleagues for coming down, for talking to the American people about the quarterly report, telling them what actually goes on in this building. 
   When we think for one moment that, as this House adjourns--not because anybody on this floor right now voted to adjourn. We said let's stay here and let's create a plan that creates an energy program that has all the above, from wind, to solar, to hydrogen, to nuclear, to exploration, takes us into the new frontier. 
   Because when you think of the floor that we're on, they built this Dome in the Civil War. You think of the challenges that this country has faced. And time and time again, we have met that challenge. But how did we meet that challenge? By not being afraid of debate, by not being afraid of the idea coming forward, not being afraid of one side of the aisle or the other, not saying the country's red or blue. This country is red, white and blue. 
   And that's the American energy plan we have. It makes us American independent of foreign countries. It stops sending the greatest amount of wealth out of this country to somebody else by creating American jobs right here. 
   But the only way we're ever going to be able to do it is that this Democratic-controlled Congress has got to change. It's got to allow the idea to come forth and not be afraid of the vote. 
   So, today, when you go home and when you see your Member out maybe in a parade, maybe on a street corner, maybe they're having a town hall meeting, ask that Member if they voted to adjourn. Did they vote to stay? Did they vote to make America energy independent? Or did they vote no, let's go home, let's let that price go up higher? 
   Well, I want to thank the Members for being a part of this tonight, and thank you for coming down and telling the American people where the report stands, where we're going forward and being willing to lead, going to Golden, Colorado, to see the renewable energy, and going to ANWR.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, tonight we are having our third quarterly report to the 110th Congress. This is a quarterly report for the newly elected republican freshmen. We came here to solve problems. We came here to find partnerships. We came here to really, what we listened about during the campaign, to make America better. Tonight, I have a few freshmen joining with me. 
   The idea tonight is about accountability. What has gone on here in Congress? I think every time we do this quarterly report, I go and I check the Web sites. Again, today is a new record. Congress has the lowest approval rating, at 11 percent, that it has in the history of its taking a poll; lower than in the years of Watergate, lower than during the years when we were rationing and being held hostage in Iran, lower than the time of 1994 when the last time the parties switched powers here. Tonight is the night we talk about what has gone on, the accountability of what has happened here, and what has taken place. 
   To start us out tonight is a congresswoman from Minnesota, from St. Cloud, Michele Bachmann. I yield to Mrs. Bachmann.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bachmann for her talk. You can see from her enthusiasm, you can see from being a mother of 23 foster children, that she brings hope, not only to America, but to Congress. She brings a problem-solving idea, trying to find some commonsense ways actually to make change here. We are so proud to have you here. 
   As I said, this is the third quarterly report put on by the freshmen Republicans on accountability of what has gone on here in Congress. We want to bring it back to your house, Mr. Speaker, to let people know what has gone on on this floor. 
   There is a reason why America has lost faith in their Congress. The approval rating is now at 11 percent, the lowest in the history of any poll on the approval rating of what has gone on in Congress. So tonight we want to talk about what has happened here. But we want to also talk about our future and how we can make things better, how we can find common ground, how we can actually bring hope back to America and have real change. 
   Tonight I have the honor of introducing one of the superstars in the freshman class. He comes from the Sixth District of Illinois, Congressman Peter Roskam from Wheaton, Illinois. I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman PETER ROSKAM. He makes a good point that you may campaign as a Republican or a Democrat, but when you come here, you should come to the issues as Americans. That is how we come to you tonight, looking for common ground, and the place where we can actually solve problems. That is what we campaigned on and made a promise to do, and that is why we are before you. 
   Just as when you are back home sitting at your table with your children, and I have mine, Connor, 13, and Megan, 11. I look for their report cards. I look at their grades. Tonight we are going to talk about Congress's grades. 
   The next speaker we have tonight is an individual from Ohio. He was a State senator, kind of a star there as well as on match, a wrestler, an NCAA champion. And currently, he is serving on Judiciary, Oversight and Government Reform, and Small Business. He is also looking out after us when it comes to the budget.

   As we heard earlier from the Congressman from Ohio about the spending, we heard from Congresswoman Michele Bachmann from Minnesota, we have found that we are not talking about hope here, we are talking about the largest tax increase in American history, because that is what has gone on on this floor, and we want to make a real change about it. 
   I now have another freshman who is joining us. He comes from Colorado, Colorado Springs, the home of the Air Force Academy, Congressman Doug Lamborn.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman from Colorado, and I appreciate his opportunity to come down and talk with us. 
   As I said earlier, as we talked about the accountability of what has gone on on this floor and we said, why has spending increased by 9.3 percent from last year? And we talked about the majority here and how they have had the ``Monument to Me,'' where they put $2 million in to name a library after themselves. 
   When you talk about earmarks, when you talk about transparency, this is what we are talking about. We can find ways that we can eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. That is what the American people want to have happen here. I don't believe the taxpayers of America think Members of Congress deserve $2 million libraries with well-furnished offices and a library for your papers and memorabilia, that taxpayers should be spending their money on that. I think we should be spending their money in the classroom teaching our kids to read and write English. That is what we should be spending our money on. 
   But I will tell you, we have another Member, a brand new Member of the freshman class. Unfortunately, there was a death after the election by Congressman Charlie Norwood in Georgia, and that special election has taken place and we have a new Member to join with us tonight. He actually has some late-breaking news that he wants to share with us, so I would like to introduce and yield what time he desires  to Congressman Paul Broun, representing Augusta and Athens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3571, which provides needed flexibility for the Office of Compliance to fill critical positions within the office and to maintain institutional knowledge within the office. 
   The Office of Compliance provides an important function in the legislative branch. It is charged with administering and enforcing the Congressional Accountability Act. The act, one of the first considered and passed by the 104th Congress with the new Republican congressional majority, required Congress to comply with the same employment and workplace safety laws that applied to the private sector, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
   Current law governing the office places limits on the appointment and tenure of the staff and board. These limits, placed in part to preserve the integrity and independence of the office, have unfortunately resulted in the board's inability to fill vacancies with the best-qualified candidates. 
   In addition, GAO has recommended, and the board agreed, that Congress amend the law to allow for reappointment of board members and staff to an  additional term in the office to maintain institutional continuity and to ``prevent the loss of critical organizational knowledge'' within the office. 
   This bill is a commonsense adjustment of current law, and I recommend my colleagues support the legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I appreciate the work you're doing for the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, this last weekend leaving on Friday was a group of Members, one led by Congressman John Boehner. And I applaud the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) because his is an open-minded leadership. He believes that the power of the idea should win at the end of the day. So he put together a group of individuals and Members from across the country. There were about ten of us. And we traveled first to Golden, Colorado. And in Golden, Colorado, I don't know, Mr. Speaker, if the American people know, but there is the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. And what this laboratory does, it is under the Department of Energy, it studies solar, wind and many different avenues for renewable energy. When it comes to automobiles, we drove from hydrogen to hybrid to 
   electric cars, as well. This is where the technology, the patents are being created where we can see the future of America, where we can see the future for energy. 
   And that is much what the gentleman from Georgia was talking about, all of the above. From there after we studied where we can go, but as we studied this technology, and as we drive these cars--one car costs $1 million and can only go 60 miles--you see that in the future, with technology, where we can go and bring the price down where the average American could actually afford it. 
   And you do that really by thinking about an individual cell phone. Think about one of those big old bricks you used to have for a cell phone, you would carry them in a suitcase, to where we are today. Many of the Members here actually have Blackberries. Do you know that there is more technology in a Blackberry than the Apollo had when they landed on the moon? 
   After our meetings in the renewable energy, we then boarded the plane the next day. And we went up to Alaska. We went up to Alaska to look at the Alaskan fields. We went into the different ones to actually see firsthand, not to sit back and say, no, we will never allow the ability to drill, we will never allow it, to understand if we can do it in an environmentally friendly way, to see what is happening up there. We went to the bay. We went up to the pumping of the first transmission line through. 
   Do you know what we found when we were there? We saw how even technology has changed from when they started in the 1970s to today. Before they would take 65 acres to drill. Now we flew over the one portion which is out over a little ways. Do you know there are no roads? They just put in a landing strip. They only took 6 acres to produce the oil out of it. And you would find that you could mitigate at the same time while you're producing this. We walked up and saw three caribous coming right up to us. So you can actually have an environmentally sound way and actually produce more oil and actually make America more energy independent. 
   Now, the one thing I found most interesting in this, if you went to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, you found in this pipeline it would transport oil produced up in northern Alaska all the way down to Valdez, and it would be shipped down into the lower 48. But the one thing I have found is that in 1989, this pipeline produced 2.2 million barrels of oil a day. Think about that for 1 minute, 2.2 million barrels a day. Today it only produces 720,000 barrels a day because in these fields, as you're bringing it up, every year that nothing happens, you lose 15 percent. And what is going to happen is when this pipeline gets down to 300,000 barrels a day, it will shut down. It has too little to go. 
   So, as this Congress continues to debate and as this Congress does nothing by not allowing the bills to come forward, we're about ready to lose a national treasure. And the American people have to understand, Mr. Speaker, that they consume 20 million barrels a day and only produce 7 million barrels a day. And as we sat there and looked at the wind and the solar and you talked to the individuals, where is the best place to put up these windmills? Where the wind blows. Where is the best place to put solar? Where the sun shines. Where is the best place to be able to explore and produce more oil? Where the oil is at. 
   And where the oil happens to be is 75 miles over. Ten billion barrels of oil sitting right there in ANWR. The ability to be able to get it where you have the transmission line to come in. You won't have to wait 10 years as we sat and talked to them. And the environmental footprint would be much smaller than it has ever been in the past. When they were drilling back in the 1970s, they would drill down, and they could not expand very far, so you had to have a numerous amount of wells. Today, the new technology allows one well to go down and go out 8 miles. So you could have fewer wells, fewer roads, mitigate the concerns when it comes to the environment, do it in a friendly, safe manner and at the same time create an energy policy with all the above, to have wind, to have solar, to have hydro, to have nuclear, and also actually produce more. Then what happens? This no longer becomes a red State versus a blue State. This becomes a red, white and blue American energy policy. 
   And when you think for one moment where the economy is at, $700 billion a year being shipped over to other countries, of whom we're funding, instead of creating American jobs, and you sit back and you think of this House, Mr. Speaker, you think of this floor. This floor should be created on the concept that the power of the idea wins at the end of the day. But as my good friend from Georgia pointed out, we can't even bring up a bill. We have no appropriation bills simply for the fact that the majority party does not want to have an individual to bring up an amendment. Why? Because it would pass on this floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. The gentleman is correct. And what did the chairman of Appropriations say? He said there will be no Appropriations bills this year. And then when we get up right before the weekend, the majority party brings up a bill that doesn't produce any more wind, it does not produce any more solar, and it does not produce any more oil or explore any more oil, on suspension simply for the fact that you can't do an amendment.     
   It is not the masses of the public holding back or the Members having a vote on this, it is the leadership. That's why I go back and I credit, Mr. Speaker, the Republican leadership to be open-minded about all forms of energy and not say no, you are going to pick one winner and one loser, it has to be all of the above. 
   I yield back my time to my good friend from Georgia, and thank him for the work he is doing and letting the American people know the way to go is all of the above.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (FREEZING WEATHER IN CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - January 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk of the severe damage that the recent freezing weather in the Central Valley and Central Coast has had on our crops. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress must do what we can to help the hardworking farmers and workers who were hit this past week with freezing weather and are predicted to have lost almost all their crops which feed our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, California's fresh citrus industry is valued at over $1 billion and provides 95 percent of the country's fresh citrus. Kern County alone, which I represent, produced over $350 million worth of citrus in 2005. While we do not know the full extent of the damage yet, over 75 percent of our citrus crops may have been lost. 
   Also in my district is San Luis Obispo, where over $7 million worth of avocados were grown last year, this freeze could have ruined the next year's crops as well. 
   My heart goes out to all my constituents who have spent sleepless nights trying to save their crops. I applaud Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has already declared a state of emergency in Kern and San Luis Obispo and eight other counties. My California colleagues and I have already sent a letter to the Agriculture Secretary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask this Congress to speed all Federal disaster assistance they can to California farmers and workers.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, tonight for the American public, we are going to hold the fourth quarterly report of the newly elected freshmen Republicans giving an update of what has gone on here on the floor. As the Sun begins to set on our first year in Congress, this is really the appropriate time to talk about it. This week we are bringing up what they call the omnibus bill, because we have 13 appropriation bills, but this Congress has only been able to get one through. 
   So what are they doing this week, at the last hour, at the last moments because Christmas is coming and people want to go home? They are throwing them all into one great big ball and putting them before the American people. 
   Now, when we flew back here, like we do each and every week, when I got here on Monday, I quickly found 34.4 pounds of pieces of paper of the omnibus bill and was told that in a few short hours we were going to go to a vote. 
   Well, tonight we want to tell the American people that we want to bring a little transparency to their government. We want to show them exactly what is going on here. And I will tell you this, the American people should know, Mr. Speaker, that this government is not small. This government is $2.9 trillion. Now, just think for a moment. That is just the amount of money that this government spends. Now, if you compare that to economies, not just to what other countries spend in their government, but to their economy and what they produce, what their governments spend it on, ours would be the third largest in the world. Of course, the United States economy is the largest, and there would be Japan, but we would be larger than Germany. We would be larger than China with all the money they spend in government and all that they produce as you look at the different products that they make. We would be larger than the United Kingdom, larger than France, and larger than Italy. 
   When you think about that and you think about the deficit that we have, isn't there a place that we can find the fraud, the waste and the abuse and eliminate it? And that is what these 13 freshmen who have been newly elected a year ago have been about to do. 
   Now, tonight, we are going to start out talking with different members of the freshman class. It is an honor to look at the different members that we have. Our first individual that we have comes from the State of Minnesota, the Sixth District, Representative Michele Bachmann from Stillwater, Minnesota. 
   I would like to yield time to Michele.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota, Mrs. Bachmann, because she said it right, that this alternative minimum tax is going to hit a lot of Americans. And it is not about a revenue crisis here in Washington, DC.; it is really a spending crisis. We set a new record that more money has come into this Treasury than ever before, but more money is going out. 
   This Congress has a couple other historical facts with this year. This is the longest a Congress has ever gone without approving 13 appropriation bills. This is a Congress that has not been effective from that date. And I will tell you from the 13 freshman Republicans that got elected all at the same time, we talked about accountability. We talked about changing the way Congress goes about it, that we bring transparency back home. And in that omnibus bill that was before us, those 34 pounds of paper, there were 9,000 earmarks; 9,000 earmarks. Think for one moment. Did the American public get to debate them? Did they get to see them? Did the power of the idea win at the end of the day down here? 
   And you wonder as you are sitting back at home, Mr. Speaker, with the American people, maybe they don't qualify this year to pay the alternative minimum tax. Will they be affected still? I will tell you, if you are a taxpayer and you get a refund from the IRS and you try to send that in early, get your taxes done early so you can get that money back, and maybe you are going to take your kids to Disneyland, maybe you are going to put a little money a way for a kid's college, or maybe you are going to put money away for yourself for retirement, you know what? You are not going to get it back very soon. The IRS has already said because this Congress has not acted, this majority has not taken it up and solved the problem, because of that, we are going to wait 7 extra weeks. They have to reprogram, even if an action is taken here tomorrow on this floor, and that is the concern I have. 
   When you think about this budget, $2.9 trillion. People at home say, You are talking trillion, you are talking billion, what does that mean? Let's take it down just one step. It is 1,000 billion for every trillion. Just think for a moment, just $1 billion. It is Christmastime. If someone were to give you $1 billion and you went and said, I am going to spend $1,000 a day. I am going to go on a shopping spree each and every day. How long it will take you to spend $1 billion? 2,740 years. A billion minutes ago the year was 104 A.D. and the Roman Empire was flourishing; yet the Federal Government spent $1 billion in the last 3 1/2 hours. That is what is going on that the American people need to know about. 
   To continue on, we have some more freshmen here with us tonight. From eastern Tennessee, we have Representative DAVID DAVIS from Johnson City. Let me tell you a little bit about DAVID DAVIS. He sits on the Committee on Education and Labor, Homeland Security and on Small Business, because he has been a small businessman. He knows how to run a business, how to earn money, how to employ individuals and how to grow the economy. 
   But I will tell you, he is a Representative that never loses sight of where he represents in eastern Tennessee. Just last week he opened up his house to all of his constituents. He welcomed them over for a little time of cheer during the holiday season. And you had about 500 people through your house, and you said at the end of the time it was nice, because you had the hardwood floors and you had it all cleaned up. 
   But we are very proud of the representation you give and how you reach out to your constituents, and I yield the time to DAVID DAVIS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. He has done a tremendous job here, and I appreciate your comments. Because when we all sat on this Chamber's floors and we listened for the first time the pride of having the first woman elected Speaker, her comment and her words were: partnership, not partisanship. And we looked forward to that day that we would sit down, we would debate the ideas, and we would actually change the way that this body works, and no longer would congressional Members just slip something into the bill so it would pass and no other Member was able to see it or debate it. But we soon learned that did not change. 
   You know, the President of the United States stood in these Chambers and gave the State of the Union speech, and he challenged this Congress to cut their earmarks in half. Now, that would mean there would only be about 6,700 earmarks inside the bill. There were 9,000. We heard the majority side say: we had to put another 230 in from the last time you even were able to look at these just to get Members to vote for it. That is not the way the American people want legislation produced. They want to see it in a committee, they want to see it debated, they want to see the power of the idea actually win. 
   What are these earmarks about? Well, these earmarks are probably the worst things you have ever seen. We used to have a former chairman of the Ways and Means, Bill Thomas. And when he retired, he took all his papers, it is an historical time, on what he was able to accomplish in his 6 years as chairman and his 28 years in Congress, and he gave it to the junior college in Bakersfield, California. We have a new chairman of Ways 
   and Means, and he had been there only about 6 months, now it is almost a year. Within 1 year, he had already put $2 million into the Health and Human Service appropriation to build a library named after himself, to build a very nice office for himself in the style of a Presidential library of like Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter. Those two libraries were built with private funds. 
   But, you know, I take a great deal of pride of the Republican freshmen, because all 13 voted ``no.'' The majority in the majority party all defended him; came down with an amendment to say, let's strip that $2 million, we have a deficit. The college didn't even ask for it. That individual actually came to the floor, defended it, and said he deserved it, he worked here so long. We said, well, you named it after yourself. Should we put something in and name it after ourselves? No, no, you wouldn't deserve it. But that, the Building a Monument to Me? The idea that it is not the taxpayers' money? That is what has gone on. That is what is going wrong here. And that is why tonight we are talking about the transparency. We are talking about what is going on. 
   Our next speaker tonight comes from the State of Ohio, the Fourth District. And I will tell you, the impact that he has had on this floor in less than a year is tremendous. If we had just taken his amendment on each and every appropriation bill that he would put forward, the American taxpayers would have saved $20 billion. $20 billion. But each and every time, the majority party twisted the arms of each and every one of their Members to make sure that it wouldn't pass. But he did not give up, and he continues to fight that call and be able to move us forward. 
   So I yield to Representative JIM JORDAN, who is the only freshman Republican who serves on the Committee of Judiciary, Committee on House Oversight and Reform, and the Committee on Small Business. Congressman Jordan.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I appreciate my good friend from Ohio. The gentleman brings up a good point. The article the gentleman cited said if the Federal Government was a public business, that our stock would be dropping. Well, if you look at the poll ratings, that is exactly what has taken place. 
   We have set a new record in this Congress with this new majority with the lowest congressional approval rating ever. This new majority has set a new record of being the least effective; 13 appropriation bills, 1 year to get them done, and only got one through. Twelve have not gone through. So they compiled them all and laid them on the floor. This is the longest any Congress has ever gone. And the only reason that the omnibus bill is going to pass now is a deadline. 
   The American public does not believe that their government should work based upon deadlines; it should work based upon ideas and accountability. We have been in office about a year now. As that sun begins to set, I have thought about what could improve this House. The House really is the leader of the free world. I have come to the conclusion there are two things this House needs. Number one, we need accountability. Number two, we need adult supervision to get the job done. 
   I will tell you that is what tonight is about. Our next speaker comes from the Seventh District of Michigan representing Battle Creek, Jackson and Adrian. His name is Representative TIM WALBERG. He serves on the Committees of Agriculture and Education  and Labor. And let me tell you how hard this individual works. 
   I caught him this morning. He was up working on constituent services. He is now on the floor. There are times he is over in the hospital visiting troops. I told him we were going to be speaking on the floor tonight. He said, Let me see. I am going to be in my office and I am going to put on a teletown hall to my district. He is calling thousands of people in their home, and they are going to question their Congressman. 
   So when I talk about this place needs accountability, I will tell you that the Seventh District of Michigan is getting that accountability from morning to night, that TIM WALBERG is hard on the job, working fast and making sure that accountability is coming back home. 
   I yield to my friend from the Seventh District of Michigan, TIM WALBERG.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman from the Seventh District of Michigan. 
   When we came to this floor, I like many of you sat here and dreamt about the day we put people before politics. You watched TV, and you didn't want a red or blue country; you wanted it red, white and blue. When we come to this floor, we put on our American hat, not our Republican, not our Democrat hat. But the one thing, we haven't found the partnership here; we found the partisanship. We found bills that were coming up for political gain, not to be debated on the floor, not to be debated in committee. And I will tell you when you think about that, that is not the way to run this House, and the American people have said so when you saw the poll numbers. 
   Tonight is about bringing about accountability and talking to those Members who are home in their houses and wondering about what they are going  to be able to do for Christmas and what they are seeing on the floor of this Congress. This new majority has put in the largest tax increase in American history. 
   You know, the IRS Federal codes have 1.6 million words. That is 380 times the number of words in the U.S. Constitution. When our Founding Fathers said what would it take to run this country, they were able to do it in much fewer words and regulations. 
   I think tonight as we sit and talk, and we sat and debated on this floor, I look to my good friend from eastern Tennessee to talk a little bit about the earmarks and the abuses that have come forward that the people back in eastern Tennessee would say that is not the way they run their household.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. You make a very good point, and I will tell you, you talk about these earmarks. That just means the majority party goes out and tries to raise more money, raises the taxes. And one of the leaders to stop that, because you see how many taxes you pay and what really comes from the leadership that continues in Ohio, Congressman JIM JORDAN.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I appreciate that, Congressman, because you made a very good point, because that wasn't the only Member that sat there and put an earmark in. We had a bill come through here talking about the Defense, went over to the Senate, came back. We had an individual that was in the leadership of the Democratic Party, all a sudden there was $1 million in there for a golf course in his district. And we asked, well, why did you need to put $1 million in the Defense bill for a golf course there? They said because all they had was tennis courts. They needed golf as well. 
   Do the American people really believe they need their taxes raised so some Member could put in a golf course and never even be debated in committee, never even have to withstand the ability to have accountability to look at it transparently? I mean, that's the frustration we see. 
   And I know my good friend from Michigan, Mr. Walberg, when he sat there and worked on the farm bill, he looked time and time again at those family farms that say when they want to pass on to the next generation, he looked at this new majority, what they did, that they were going to raise the inheritance tax to 55 percent. You know what would happen to those family farms back home.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, I thank the gentleman, and I thank all the freshmen that have been able to join us tonight, because really tonight was about bringing accountability and maybe some adult supervision because I think that's what the American public wants to see here in Congress, see that we are able to provide more free time, not take up more of your time to earn more taxes for the American Government. 
   I'll tell you tonight we're probably going to turn out the lights here in Congress in the next couple of days. But as those freshmen coming from the Republican Party, we all pledged that we would work in a bipartisan manner. We're eager to do that. We have a desire to do that, not to be a red and blue State but be the red, white and blue country. And we challenge the majority party here to change from the last year. It doesn't have to end a year from now as poorly as it ended this year. It doesn't have to end with the failure in setting new records, with the approval ratings so low with the lack of bills coming through, nothing but earmarks to try to get a bill through. It could actually end with common sense, with pride and, really, to be able to move it forward. 
   I'll tell the American people, I might get at times a little depressed sitting on this floor, but if anyone ever comes back to Washington, DC, I'd ask you to look up your Congresswoman or your Congressman and have them give you a tour because the greatest city in the world is right here and the greatest monument is this building, and the best monument inside this building are the stairs. 
   I will tell you, those stairs are made of marble. When you walk on those stairs those stairs are worn out from the feet that have walked before. And every day that I come over I take the stairs to go up the one flight just so I can walk on those stairs. And you know what? I get goose bumps each and every time I do it, because I believe that regardless of how big our challenges are, we will come together because the people before us and the challenges before us were much greater than we're facing today, that they came together. And if we can learn one thing through those stairs of marble it's that each and every one you take one step at a time. And I think we need to take one step, each at a time to come a little closer into the middle and find some common ground. 
   So I thank you for the time you have been with us tonight, and God bless.

<TEXT>
   Mr. MCCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 66. The purpose of this resolution is to authorize the use of the Capitol rotunda on April 19 for this year's national ceremony to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. I am pleased that with the passage of this resolution, the Congress will be able to, once again, provide a venue for those who wish to mark this solemn occasion in the peaceful setting that the rotunda provides. 
   The annual Days of Remembrance provide all Americans with an opportunity to reflect together upon the Holocaust, to remember its victims and to renew our commitment to democracy and human rights. 
   In order to help focus our reflections on the Holocaust, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum selects a yearly theme. This year we reflect on Children in Crisis: Voices from the Holocaust. 
   Mr. Speaker, an estimated 1 million Jewish children died at the hands of the Nazi regime during the Holocaust. Being the most vulnerable, children were often the first of the victims to be targeted for death. Many times they were sent to the gas chambers immediately following their arrivals in the concentration camps because most were not old or strong enough to work under the forced labor conditions. But at the same time, this year's theme also recognizes the importance of remembering those children who were able to survive through their own courage and determination and the aid of dedicated individuals risking their own lives to help thwart the horrible intentions of the Nazi Party. 
   I think it is imperative that we never forget either the horrors of the Holocaust or the incredible courage and humanity that enabled some children to survive such awful conditions. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this resolution.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's quite ironic, Mr. Speaker, that Mr. Price has this hour tonight. Tonight is Halloween. I will tell you, when I look back at home in California, my kids will be getting ready to go out with their friends. Some of them are going to dress up, some will try to scare one another. But tonight, Mr. Speaker, this is the scariest moment of all. This largest tax increase in American history is going to scare every American there is. 
   I will tell you that as you study history and study economics, you will see in the last cycle when taxes were lower, we set a record April 15. April 15 was the day people were paying their taxes. With taxes lower, more revenue came into American coffers, government, than ever before in the history of collecting taxes. Why? Because you let people keep more of what they earn. They went out and took their money and invested into capital, invested into businesses. What does this plan do that the Democrats put forward in the Democrat's largest tax increase? It taxes small business, small business at the highest rate. How do you create a big business? I guess you can't under the Democratic plan. 
   For those that are sitting at home, Mr. Speaker, I want them to think for one moment when you think about taxes, because you always don't realize how much taxes you pay in a day. On an average day, you wake up, you take a shower; do you realize you pay a tax on that water? You go maybe over to Starbucks to get a cup of coffee, you pay a tax on that coffee. You stop off and fill your car up with gas; you pay a gasoline tax. You go into work, and for the first three hours you're just paying taxes before you make any money. You go home, turn on the TV, hopefully you will see yourself on television, you pay cable tax if you're watching this show tonight. 
   You go out tomorrow, a lot of us are going to fly home, and when we buy that airplane ticket, we're going to pay an airport tax. You rent a car, you pay a rental tax. Somebody stays in a hotel, they pay an occupancy tax. God forbid, you save enough money and unfortunately die, you're going to pay an inheritance tax. On the Democratic plan, it goes to 55 percent. 
   They think they know what to do with your money. I believe the Republicans know what to do with your money. You keep your money and invest it and build America. The plan has shown that if government continues to grow, they are going to raise your taxes further. 
   Mr. Speaker, this plan and the appropriations that have gone through on this floor have continued to make government grow, continued to increase. How do they want to feed it? By taking more of what you have. 
   I want to yield to my good friend from Georgia and thank him for the time that he has put into this, because it is a Truth Squad. It's rather ironic that tonight you're talking about how the Democrats have scared the rest of America. It is scary because they plan to move forward with their plan.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. My good friend from Georgia, I appreciate your yielding. You are talking about spending and you are talking about how much it has increased. 
   The American public would say before you raise my taxes, have you cut the waste, the fraud and abuse? You just talked about the chairman of Ways and Means. You look at the tax increase he proposed and you wonder why does he want to increase taxes so much? 
   I look back and I remember on this floor when we were bringing up the Health and Human Services bill. In there, you thought you were going to talk about the needs and the other things. 
   There was an amendment in there. I remember the debate on the Republican side, Mr. Speaker, because in there, there was put in what is called an earmark for $2 million for a library which the college didn't ask for to be named after the chairman of Ways and Means. It was interesting to me, I call it ``the monument to me,'' because that is exactly what it is. The American people need their taxes raised so somebody on this floor can name a library after themselves for $2 million? And if you look at the brochure, it says it will be just as nice as President Clinton or President Carter, which I will tell the American people, Mr. Speaker, were paid for by private funds. 
   When it was challenged on the side of the Republicans to say maybe that earmark is not right because it didn't go through the process, the chairman of Ways and Means came to the floor and defended it and said he deserved it. When someone said, Well, maybe you shouldn't name it after yourself, he talked about it and said, No, I have been able to raise $25 million from corporations to go through it. Then when he sat there and talked and they said, Well, maybe we should name one after ourselves, he said, No, no, you don't deserve it. 
   But that is the hypocrisy that goes on on this floor of the Congress. When you continue to spend, when you continue to move earmarks and you think you can just tax the American public more and more, they are going to wake up. That is why I appreciate the time you have taken, the Truth Squad, to let people know what goes on on this floor.     
   Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the American people for scaring them too much, but this is the truth, and I yield back to my good friend from Georgia.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Madam Speaker, I just want to congratulate this Member because I truly believe more people are listening than we've been hearing about. We see Nielsen's ratings out there and we see a number of people that watch C-SPAN. But I must tell you, there must be more because when I was sitting in my office, I was reading headlines, and the headline recently said, Congress has its lowest approval rating to date: 29 percent of the United States approves of what Congress is doing. And that means nothing. 
   And I believe that a lot is coming from what you're talking about. You're giving people truth and accountability on what's gone on in this new majority and what has happened in this new majority. 
   And that's really what I want to talk about today. Not much has moved. It's more about doing nothing. You talk about they are talking about putting politics before policies. And what I'd like to talk about today is actually a solution. I'd like to talk about putting people before politics. That's where we have to have a new direction and a new change. 
   When you look at some of the graphs that are sitting down on that floor, you will see, and it is a direct comparison of what policy the Republicans believe in and the policy the Democrats believe in. 
   A headline that I read just the other day was the largest amount of money coming in on April 15 in the record of the United States of America. The largest amount. And how did we come about doing that? We lowered taxes. It said, if you let people keep more of what they earn, they will invest. And what happens when they invest? They create more jobs. When you create more jobs, you create more homeowners. When you create more homeowners and more jobs, more people are able to go to college, get a greater education. That's talking about putting the people before politics. 
   It all goes back to the 2003 tax relief bill, much of what your graph will say. It'll show greater job creation the Republicans went out to do, and it'll show greater investment and, in the end, greater amounts of money to America today. 
   And what happens? It comes down to tell us that this is not a revenue problem in our deficit. It is a spending problem. But the Democrats look at it all different. They believe they should take more of what you earn. And I know I've said it before on this floor but I want to say it again. When you put people before politics, let's talk about taxes. Let's talk about what the Democrats proposed in their 100 days of increasing taxes which, Madam Speaker, our speaker just said on this floor, increasing taxes in every realm. If you have children, it's going to cost you more. If you're married, it's going to cost you more. If you're elderly, it's going to cost you more. If you're in the lowest tax bracket, it's going to cost you more. 
   Now, I want to put it in perspective, because this is something that this floor doesn't talk about. What is the day-to-day life of an American? How do they pay taxes? Do they pay enough taxes? Well, I want to give you an average day. A person wakes up, they go in and they take a shower. Do you know, when they turn that water on they are paying a water tax? 
   They get ready for work. They go out, maybe they stop off at a coffee shop, buy a cup of coffee. They pay a tax on that coffee. 
   They look at their gas gauge. They go to the gas station. I am in California, paid $3.49 a gallon. A lot of that was in tax. 
   Then I go into work. For the first 3 hours of work, I'm just paying State and Federal tax. Lo and behold, maybe I'm like most of Americans, I have to move in my job. I have to be able to go to other places to be able to sell because it's a global economy. I buy an airline ticket, I pay an airline tax. I rent a car when I get there. I pay a rental tax. I go and work part of the day. I come home, turn on the TV maybe to see our good speaker here on television. I pay a cable tax. 
   And lo and behold that I was able to put a little money away after they tax me from morning till night, and I invest. I invest for my family. I invest for my children to go to college. I invest and take the risk and hopefully I got a little reward. And maybe I invest in some property. Maybe I invest in the stock market. And because the Republicans lowered the tax and more people are paying dividends, so I'm getting a greater income and my kids can go to a maybe more expensive college. Then maybe I can afford to send my kids to Disneyland a little more. Maybe I can afford to spend time with my family a little more, and that's what Americans want. 
   But lo and behold, if I invested and I got a return on my investment, and I wanted to leave some money for my children and my grandchildren, what do the Democrats answer with? They answer they want 55 percent of that. They don't even want half. They want 55 percent. Because you decided to invest in America, they think you owe the government. 
   What do Republicans say? Keep it and add on. Why? Because we believe that's your money. We believe the capital is good for America, good for the investment. It helps us to be more competitive in a global economy. Yeah, you're becoming more efficient; that you should, if you owned a small business, invest in new equipment because your employees will be able to be more efficient. America will be more efficient, and that's what this Congress has produced. 
   There is a direct change in this Congress, and I applaud this individual on the floor, Mr. Price, because from the standpoint I believe more people are  listening. If it's rating a 29 percent, your Truth Squad is getting out that accountability is lacking here in Congress today. 
   And I would like to just talk to you a little longer about this. Maybe you can dwell on a little more, you have a graph down there. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what you see from the 2003 plan to today's plan as well.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. You make a great point. Numbers don't lie. You see it in a graph. You see it in the facts. You see it on April 15, the highest revenue ever to come in. 
   Now, why do we continue to have these deficits? Because it is a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Just as when you live at your own house, you balance your checkbook. If you have got more money coming in, how come you are going further into debt? Because of the management and the lack of accountability here. You see the unemployment rate continue to go down from 2003. Why? Because if people are able to keep more of what they earn, they are able to invest. 
   We want America to be the most competitive, to be able to be the most productive, and you need capital to do that. And do you know what else you want? You want the creation of small business. You want everybody across the board to have the opportunity for the American dream. 
   Well, if you are taking a savings account that you maybe want to invest in your family, to invest for them in the next 21st century, to invest them in the ability to have a small business, invest them in taking a risk and a little reward, you don't want to give 55 percent to the government. You want to be able to hand it down.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. And don't you want your grandchildren to be able to have a greater opportunity, greater education? It is not just the undergraduates we look at. 
   As I told you before, I have two kids at home: Connor, who is 13; and Meghan, who is 10. And when I look at their education and we sit around our kitchen table, my wife Judy and I, all we do is talk about the future for our children. And I am not worried about our children competing with somebody from another part of California or even somebody in different parts of America. Do you know whom our children are going to compete with? It is a global economy. They are going to compete with the kids in India and China. And I will tell you in India and China they don't have a 55 percent tax rate on the death tax. They don't hold their children back like we are holding ours back. We don't have the opportunity to grow. And this economy is competitive. And for us to stay that way, we need actually a new direction in this Congress where the people are before politics. And the one thing I have seen in these 100 or so days, this November election never ended, that we continue to have politics on this floor in each and every way we go about doing it. We should now start talking about solutions. How do we solve the problems? How do we make America energy independent? Not how we simply fund greater dictators, not that we buy as much oil from Venezuela as we do from America, and you listen to what Mr. Chavez says about America, ``ending the evil empire.'' We want to make America and this world safer, freer, and leave it a better place for our own children. And we are not going to do it with the change in direction in this Congress. We are not going to be able to achieve those goals. 
   That is why I want to congratulate you on the work you have done because you are bringing accountability to this floor. You are letting the American people see it. And what we want to derive from that are solutions, bringing people back before politics.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the legislation, S. 2110, to designate the United States Post Office located at 427 North Street in Taft, California, as the Larry S. Pierce Post Office, the true hometown hero. 
   U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Pierce was born in Oklahoma in 1941. As a young child, his family moved to Taft, California, which I represent today. Sergeant Pierce attended Taft city schools and would have graduated from Taft Union High School with the class of 1959 but decided to serve his country by joining the U.S. Army in 1958. 
   Sergeant Pierce served in the 1st Battalion Airborne, 503rd Infantry and the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the Vietnam War. 
   On September 20, 1965, near Ben Cat in Vietnam, Sergeant Pierce was leading his reconnaissance platoon, was ambushed by hostile forces. Sergeant Pierce and his squad successfully routed the hostile forces from their location. During pursuit of this enemy, Sergeant Pierce heroically sacrificed his own life to save his men. He came upon a road where they found a mine. He threw himself upon it knowing that if this mine went off, it would destroy many and take many lives of his own men. 
   Upon hearing of this and upon his death, in February of 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Sergeant Pierce the Medal of Honor. In this award, he went on to say for his ``inspiring leadership and personal courage,'' and his ``profound concern for his fellow soldiers,'' acting with ``extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his life'' and to ``great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.'' 
   Sergeant Pierce would have been 66 years old this year. He is survived by his wife, Verlin, who currently lives in Bakersfield, California; his children, Teresa, Kelley and Gregory. 
   This legislation is a fitting honor for a Vietnam War veteran who sacrificed his life to save the lives of fellow soldiers by naming the post office in his hometown of Taft in his memory. 
   I do want to thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this legislation and for working with me. Taft is a place where Senator Feinstein's own father worked. She knows of the work of Sergeant Larry Pierce, the hometown hero, as many have gone on to say. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a copy of Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce's Medal of Honor and a copy of the Taft City Council letter of support and resolution requesting the post office in his name. 
   U.S. Army--Medal of Honor Citation 
   PIERCE, LARRY S. 
   Rank and organization: Sergeant, U.S. Army, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1st Battalion (Airborne), 503d Infantry, 173d Airborne Brigade. Place and date: Near Ben Cat, Republic of Vietnam, 20 September 1965. Entered service at: Fresno, Calif. Born:  6 July 1941, Wewoka, Okla. G.O. No.: 7, 24 February 1966. Citation: For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty. Sgt. Pierce was serving as squad leader in a reconnaissance platoon when his patrol was ambushed by hostile forces. Through his inspiring leadership and personal courage, the squad succeeded in eliminating an enemy machinegun and routing the opposing force. While pursuing the fleeing enemy, the squad came upon a dirt road and, as the main body of his men entered the road, Sgt. Pierce discovered an antipersonnel mine emplaced in the road bed. Realizing that the mine could destroy the majority of his squad, Sgt. Pierce saved the lives of his men at the sacrifice of his life by throwing himself directly onto the mine as it exploded. Through his indomitable courage, complete disregard for his safety, and profound concern for his fellow soldiers, he averted loss of life and injury to the members of his squad. Sgt. Pierce's extraordinary heroism, at the cost of his life, are in the highest traditions of the U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, like most every Member inside this House, the first day that you are sworn in is a highlight, one of the highlights in your life. As I look across this floor, I see Members from both sides of the aisle that experienced that for the very first time with me this January. 
   I sat on the floor, and I brought my young son and daughter with me.

And the words that she spoke that rang to me that I applauded, I stood up and said ``yes,'' was this was going to be a Congress of partnership, not partisanship. 
   It's sad to say that today this is not a Congress of partnership. We may be from different sides of the aisle, we may be Republican, we may be Democrat; but first and foremost, we are American. We are Americans with a desire to have an American energy independent policy, and it's sad to say that this bill does not. This bill, created in the middle of the night. 
   And when you think about where you sit and what part you're a part of, that the Chamber, that this dome that we're under today was built during the Civil War confronting the challenges that face America. We can meet that challenge, but we can only meet it with partnership, and we need to come together and vote against this bill today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 207, a resolution recognizing the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service. 
   I am honored that Edwards Air Force Base, home of the Air Force Flight Test Center, is located in my district, the 22nd District of California. I rise today to honor the men and women of the United States Air Force, especially those who have spent part or all of their careers in the pursuit of cutting edge flight technology at Edwards. 
   The USAF was ``born'' in 1947, but as we all know, our military's efforts to explore air power began in the early part of the 20th century with the Wright Military Flyer. The area now known as Edwards joined the effort in 1933, when LTC Henry H. ``Hap'' Arnold of the Army Air Corps selected a site on the edge of Rogers Dry Lake for a bombing and gunnery range at a place called Muroc, a reversal of the last name of the Corum family, which had settled in the area in 1910. 
   After World War II, Muroc Army Air Field was alive with activity on the X-plane programs, resulting in great successes such as the Bell X-1, which broke the sound barrier on October 14, 1947, with Chuck Yeager at the controls. The base was renamed in 1949 after CPT Glen Edwards, who died in a crash of the YB-49, and the Air Force Flight Test Center was activated in 1951, the same year that the Air Force moved its test pilot school to Edwards. In the 1960s, the X-15 broke record after record for speed and altitude. Over the years, the Flight Test Center has tested and supported the development of virtually every aircraft system that has entered the Air Force inventory and has been involved in more major milestones in flight than any other comparable organization in the world. It has been on the cutting edge of every major development that has transformed the field of flight, from the first American jet plane to the current system-of-systems revolution. 
   It is a pleasure to recognize and honor the hard work of the men and women of our United States Air Force on their 60th anniversary, although each day we should remember those who sacrifice in defense of our country. As the Air Force moves forward from its 60th year, we can look to the motto of the Air Force Flight Test Test Center--``Ad Inexplorat ..... Toward the Unexplored.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, while I agree with the intent and substance of the bill, I have to object to the process of bringing this bill to the floor under suspension in the time frame established without committee debate. 
   There have been three versions of the bill. The committee received notice of the bill intent action by the majority just last Thursday when we all left town. Since then, the bill has been amended twice, and we just received the final version at 11:30 a.m. today when Members were just returning. H.R. 2630 has not been the subject of any debate or questioning by the committee. There is clarification needed as we go through on this debate. 
   While I would support the bill, and I sit on the committee, I have only been  in this House and this body for 6 months, and already I see we are repeating our old mistakes. As I sat on this floor when we debated H.R. 6, the ethics reform which I fully supported, voted for, passed with 430-1, to my amazement right afterwards we found that when we thought we were doing a good deed, we thought we were changing what we thought was wrong about flying around on these planes, having individuals be able to donate planes to fly around, soon we found out that those who are pilots on this floor, those who had their own plane, we said they couldn't even fly on their own. Why? Because we did not go through the process that we have set up; we did not debate it in committee; we did not have clarification; we did not have light of day. 
   While I am the first one to stand up and want the reform, I am also the first one to stand up and say going around the process is just as wrong. We should have the debate, we should have a bipartisan bill, we should have common sense, and we should learn from our mistakes. 
   Our ratings are low, yes. Our ratings are low probably because of this action that we are trying to change. But they are also low because they see inaction. Don't hurt the bill by going around the process. The end does not justify the means.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe Congress is a marketplace of ideas, and at the end of the day, the best ideas should win. Unfortunately, with the process today, that will not happen. 
   Allowing a vote on an alternative minimum wage approach is in America's best interest. Republicans offer a balanced approach to increase the minimum wage and provide offset tax relief for small businesses to take on the increased labor cost for the minimum wage hike. 
   The unbalanced approach of the Democratic bill, H.R. 2, to solely increase the minimum wage is irresponsible. Never mind that the basic economic statement setting an artificial price floor like the minimum wage could actually raise unemployment. 
   The Federal Reserve study states that if H.R. 2 is enacted, a million restaurant workers could lose their jobs. 
   I can tell you, as a former small business owner, personally, this is a tough decision. I came to Congress to work to increase opportunities for all Americans, not to harm workers and small businesses. I listened to the debate today, and I listened to the other side, as a freshman. If you look at the Republican bill, it is a compromise. It is a common solution. The minimum wage will be increased, but what else will happen? There will be greater healthcare for the workers. There will  be tax relief where you can expense off when you are buying business equipment. What happens? The workers of America are more competitive in a global economy for the 21st century. 
   And I ask my colleagues on the other side; last week on this floor I listened closely to what our Speaker said. Speaker Pelosi said, ``Let's work in a spirit of partnership, not partisanship.'' Well, I will tell you, the Republican bill is just that, it is a partnership that lets the power of the idea win at the end of the day.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. Con. Res. 15, which authorizes the use of the rotunda of the Capitol for the ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the Tuskegee Airmen. 
   I would like to thank the distinguished chairman from New York (Mr. Rangel) for sponsoring the House version of this resolution. I would also like to thank my Chair of House Administration for her work as well. 
   All of our men and women of the armed services deserve our praise and recognition for the contributions they have made in defense of our country. It is notable that in the case of the Tuskegee Airmen they were fighting not one but two battles. As they bravely flew and maintained combat aircraft in World War II, these men also fought against the notion that somehow the color of their skin would affect their ability to courageously protect our Nation. 
   In 1941, the formation of the all African American squadron based in Tuskegee, Alabama, a group that would come to be known as the Tuskegee Airmen, was largely regarded as an experiment of the U.S. military to test the combat readiness of the all-black fighting squadron. Sadly, there were some at the time who expected or perhaps even hoped that the experiment would fail. Instead, the Tuskegee Airmen became one of the most highly regarded units of the war, fighting bravely with distinction. 
   Among the honors bestowed upon them, they were awarded 150 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 744 Air Medals, 14 Bronze Stars, and 8 Purple Hearts. I proudly support authorization of the use of the Capitol rotunda where they will be recognized once more for their bravery and for blazing a trail, not only in the sky, but in the history as well.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 998, which would direct the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution to collect and preserve audio and video recordings from individuals who were involved in the civil rights movement. 
   In 1954 the Supreme Court landmark decision, Brown v. Board of Education, served as a beacon of hope to those who had longed for racial equality in this Nation, and is largely credited with beginning the period commonly referred to as the civil rights movement. Rather than viewing the case which provided for the desegregation of public schools in the United States as the end of a journey, supporters of the civil rights movement recognized the Court's decision as the beginning of a long and difficult road ahead. 
   The years that followed brought many hard battles, from the Montgomery Bus Boycott that was a result of Rosa Parks' brave refusal to give up her seat to a white passenger, to the march in Selma, Alabama, during which our own colleague, Congressman Lewis, suffered severe physical trauma in defense of voting rights. Congressman Lewis' recollections of this time have often brought those who have heard him speak to tears. It is exactly those types of oral histories that are in danger of being lost in the absence of a concerted effort to preserve them. We cannot afford to lose those accounts of extraordinary courage in the face of profound injustice. 
   With the passage of time, generations of Americans have now been born with freedoms that would not have been possible without the struggle and sacrifice of those who participated in the civil rights movement. The audio and video recordings preserved as a result of this bill's passage will be an invaluable resource from which those young people who may learn about the struggle for racial equality and will serve as an inspiration to all Americans as they reflect upon this pivotal time in our Nation's history. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

(EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND FEDERAL VOTING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SHOULD ENSURE THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION ON VOTING IN THE 2008 GENERAL ELECTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 388, which would express the sense of Congress that the Department of Defense and the Federal Voting Assistance Program should take additional measures to ensure that members of the Armed Forces and their dependents are provided with reasonable information on voting in the 2008 general elections. This bill will also extend information to civilians living abroad for the same purpose. 
   Mr. Speaker, recent data compiled by the Election Assistance Commission found that less than 17 percent of the 6 million citizens eligible under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act chose to participate in the 2006 general election. Of the 48,600 Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act ballots that were not counted by States and local jurisdictions in the November 2006 elections, 70 percent were not counted due to incorrect or undeliverable addresses. It is simply unacceptable that thousands of the brave men and women who fight for our freedom each day were denied a voice in the electoral process due to incorrectly filling out a ballot. 
   In September 2007, the EAC also found that ``the third largest reason for rejected ballots was that they were received by election offices after the deadline stipulated by State law.'' 
   I have introduced H.R. 5673, the MVP Act, to ensure that military personnel are not left out of the elections process while serving their country overseas. Although my bill has been endorsed by the Vets for Freedom, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars called it ``an important piece of legislation ensuring that the men and women who wear our Nation's uniform are not left out of the election process while serving in harm's way,'' the MVP Act has not yet been brought before the House for consideration. However, I am hopeful that this resolution will create awareness of this issue and lead to more comprehensive reform that will provide a solution to this problem. 
   In addition to meeting ballot deadlines and correctly completing absentee ballots, there is also an issue with  military personnel receiving information from the Federal Voting Assistance Program. A survey conducted recently by the Inspector General for the Department of Defense analyzed the effectiveness of the Federal Voting Assistance Program during the 2006 general election and found that only 40 percent of members of the Armed Forces received voting information from the military and only 33 percent were aware of the Federal Post Card Application. 
   We must ensure that the Federal Voting Assistance Program improves their communication efforts and promotes the Federal Post Card Application and the Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot so that our service men and women are aware of the resources available to them during an election. 
   This year, perhaps more than any other year in recent memory, our Nation's electorate is excited to cast their ballots for the candidates of their choosing. For those serving their country overseas, and for civilians living abroad, we must do everything in our power to ensure that they have the information necessary to do so. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6625 which would permit facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs to be designated as voter registration agencies. 
   As I have stated in the past, it is important that we ensure that every vote is counted and that every citizen is able to cast a ballot. As a part of that effort, I'm pleased to join in support of this bill which would designate veteran facilities as voter registration agencies. Doing so will allow those who have risked their lives for our freedom an opportunity to register to vote and make their voices heard. 
   I am also pleased that Chairman Brady addressed our chief concern with the original version of the bill, that the desire to facilitate the voting process for patients does not supersede patient care due to intrusion by third party groups in VA facilities. This bill's original language stated that nonpartisan groups would have ``reasonable access'' to veterans in order to encourage voter registration. The word ``reasonable'' means different things to different people, and we would hate to see a veteran who wishes to convalesce in a private setting be intruded upon by activists from a voter registration group, however well intended they may be. Also, some patients may choose not to cast a ballot, and they should not feel pressured to do so. 
   Language was added to this bill that stipulates that third party groups must work with the administrator of each VA facility to ensure their efforts will not infringe upon a patient's right to privacy and that their practices would not in any way disturb patients' recovery. 
   Implementing this provision will require a commitment of time and personnel from the Veterans Administration. It is my sincere hope that in acting as a liaison between their patients and outside groups, the VA will not siphon off precious time and resources intended to improve patient care. 
   Also, while the intention of this program is to ensure that our Nation's veterans are more easily able to cast a vote, the passage of the bill should not be taken as an invitation to disregard the absentee voting programs implemented at the State level in favor of turning Federal, State, or NVRA designated agencies into voting locations. 
   Veterans also require months of care as a result of their injuries and have limited mobility during that time. This bill was crafted with their unique circumstances in mind, and it is not intended to be a gateway to similar programs at other agencies. When it comes to establishing voting locations outside of each State's established protocols, this bill should be considered the exception, not the rule. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman Brady for his leadership on this issue and his commitment to improving this bill in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Resolution 61, which expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States flag flown over the United States Capitol should be lowered to half-mast 1 day each month in honor of the brave men and women from the United States who have lost their lives in military conflicts. 
   For all of those who work in or visit the Capitol each day, the flag that flies atop this building is an emblem of the democratic principles that guide this body. This powerful symbol of freedom is even more striking when it's lowered to half-mast, signaling that our Nation is in mourning. 
   The men and women of our military who defend our Nation in the time of war may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Lowering the flag atop the Capitol once a month in their honor is a small yet meaningful way to communicate how deeply their loss is felt by all Americans. 
   In addition to being a moving tribute to the members of our military who we have lost, it is also a reminder to all Members of Congress that the actions we take--or do not take--have profound consequences on the men and women of our military. When we talk about funding our armored vehicles or express our views on intelligence gathering in the war on terror, it is imperative that we do not forget the real ramifications that our decisions will have on our servicemen and -women who must live with the consequences of our actions. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this moving tribute to our Nation's Armed Forces. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1384, a bill I introduced to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 118 Minner Avenue in Bakersfield, California as the ``Buck Owens Post Office.'' 
   An accomplished, self-taught musician, Alvis Edgar ``Buck'' Owens, Jr. amassed twenty-one country music hits throughout his career, of which ten were consecutive #1 hits, including ``Act Naturally,'' ``My Heart Skips a Beat,'' and ``Streets of Bakersfield.'' Over his more than 50 years in the music industry, Buck worked with other legendary country musicians including Merle Haggard, who dubbed Buck's band ``the Buckaroos,'' Wanda Jackson, and Dwight Yoakam. 
   Buck was best known for his signature ``freight train'' musical sound that combined classic country music with electric guitar, a unique rhythm, and rock and roll and honky-tonk influences, and always played his trademark red, white, and blue guitar. Buck was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame, both in 1996, for his musical talent and accomplishments. In 1999, Buck received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award for one of his #1 hits, ``I've Got a Tiger by the Tail.'' 
   In addition to recording hit country music songs, for almost twenty years, Buck could be seen on Hee Haw, an immensely popular country music comedy show. Following Hee Haw and returning to his country music roots, Buck opened Buck Owens' Crystal Palace in 1996, a concert hall in Bakersfield, California, where Buck hosted other bands and performed live for fans up until the night he passed away, on March 25, 2006. 
   An astute businessman, Buck owned several radio stations, including KKXX-FM, which was under Buck's tenure for more than a decade the #1 rock-and-roll station in Bakersfield. In addition, Buck also owned KUZZ-AM, which he expanded to FM radio, and, up until his death, was and remains the #1 country music station in Bakersfield. Finally, Buck established his own music production company, Buck Owens Enterprises, which produced records by country music artists. 
   Buck moved to Bakersfield in 1951, and contributed greatly to the country music industry in Bakersfield and around the Nation and amassed a legion of fans, like myself, across the country. H.R. 1384 is a fitting honor and  tribute to this influential and charismatic Californian by designating the post office in his hometown of more than 55 years in his memory.  
   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed. 
   The title was amended so as to read: ``A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 118 Minner Avenue in Bakersfield, California, as the `Buck Owens Post Office'.'' 
   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I rise today to enter into a colloquy with my colleagues, the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, Mr. Edwards, and Ranking Member Wamp, about an issue of significant importance to my constituents in Ridgecrest, California. 
   China Lake, the large naval installation in Ridgecrest, was slated to become the Navy's Center of Excellence for weapons development as part of the 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closure. This news confirmed what those of us familiar with China Lake have always known; China Lake's location, access to airspace, 350 days of flying a year and exceptional personnel make it an excellent place for the military to develop the tools for the men and women serving on the front line. 
   Unfortunately, since the recommendation was made, I have had concerns that it is not being implemented as consistently with the original recommendation as it should be. I am concerned that the number of jobs slated to move and overall construction plan has decreased more than would be expected. 
   For these reasons, I come to the floor today to ask the chairman that he work with me to ensure that Congress continues its oversight of the BRAC implementation process. 
   I would yield to the subcommittee chairman.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (ESTABLISHING PROGRAM TO MAKE GRANTS REGARDING BACKUP PAPER BALLOTS -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly rise in opposition to H.R. 5803, which unfortunately creates a system of IOUs for States with no guarantee of being paid back with Federal money. 
   Notwithstanding my concerns about even the necessity of this bill and the majority's desire to federalize traditionally local responsibility of administering elections, as outlined in the Constitution, it's difficult to understand how we are going to pay States back this year for promises we are making in this bill when Democrat congressional leaders have indicated that they will not complete work on appropriation bills this year. A leader on the House Appropriations Committee was quoted as describing the appropriations process as ``dead'' and later clarified the chances of appropriations this year are ``slight.'' 
   Additionally, the majority leader in the other body was recently described in an article called ``No Lame Duck Session'' as wanting ``to punt most of the 12 annual appropriation bills to the 111th Congress.'' He said, ``I would hope that before we would leave here this year, we would do a continuing resolution ..... '' 
   So the question I have is where are we going to get this money to pay back the States for a grant program in this bill? Are we just demonstrating once again that Washington is broken by wasting more time when we could focus on finding solutions to our Nation's pressing problems, like the energy crisis? 
   Prioritizing concerns continues to be a problem that plagues Congress. Today we are debating a bill asking State and local election jurisdictions to do something that many already do and to pay for something that many already pay for. According to a recent survey of elected officials, if we are trying to improve election administration for the November, 2008, election, why not focus on a problem that strikes at the heart of our democracy, making sure that the votes of our brave men and women protecting our country abroad are counted? I encourage my colleagues to focus on efforts that will provide the greatest impact, including the Military Voting Protection Act, also called the MVP Act, which has 42 cosponsors. The MVP Act helps ensure that military personnel are not left out of the election process while serving our country overseas by improving delivery methods so the votes are counted. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House Administration Committee towards addressing these and other issues internal to the strength of our Nation's elections. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition for a number of reasons. First and foremost, we are putting forward legislation that we will not even be able to fund. Appropriations said they will not meet, they will not pass, so we are telling States that this is an IOU. 
   Secondly, Mr. Speaker, over $3 billion in Federal grants have been made available to States in 2008 in previous years to assist with election systems and administration which can include the purchase of authorized backup paper ballots. Of this amount, over $1 billion remains unspent, but we are asking the Federal Government to spend more. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are talking about paper ballots. Survey after survey of Secretaries of States have shown that they have backup operations prepared for their States and their ballots. Even in our own committee, Mr. Speaker, you have pointed out time and time again that paper ballots are where mistakes are made when they are hand counted. Paper ballots are where things become manipulated. So, Mr. Speaker, I ask for a ``no'' vote. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. 
   I do come from California and I am a new Member, and I think as is only fitting we are talking about how letting people keep their hard-earned money, how jobs grow, revenue grows, and individuals can spend the money on what they desire, like putting their kids through college. But we would be remiss if we didn't mention this day, because I think it is rather ironic. Today is the 96th birthday of Ronald Reagan, and nobody finer than that talked about taxes and talked about which way they went. And President Ronald Reagan was actually Governor of California at one time. That is where I come from prior to serving in this House; I served in the State assembly. And when I got elected to the State assembly, we had a $36 billion deficit. 
   And much like the other side of the aisle here, the other side of the aisle there, their answer was to raise taxes. We sat down, the Republicans, and crafted a bill that actually proposed a budget that didn't raise taxes. It gave incentives that let people keep more of what they earned. We have seen revenues continue to grow. We are now about out of our deficit, which was fundamentally the biggest one they have ever had, and it has continued to move forward that we were able to bring more revenues in. 
   But I want to put forth really the graphs you have been talking about, put it into everyday life, put it into where people understand it. Where you saw that graph continue to take off, that is when the tax cut happened. 
   Now, what does that mean to the millions of Americans? Well, more than 100 million Americans have now had more than $2,200 of tax relief. That may not sound like a lot of money to Washington where they spend trillions of dollars, but that is $180 a month. Do you know what that means? That means day care, that means you can take your kids maybe to Disneyland, that means you can go and invest for your kids' college future. That is what it means when you send more than $1 trillion back to the taxpayers that actually earned the money. 
   Now, to put it in a much broader perspective where a person can understand day-to-day life, I always like to see what I did today and what did it mean about taxes and what did it take out of my pocket on my money. 
   When I woke up this morning, I took a shower. Do you know what? I paid a tax on that water. When I got out, a friend of mine needed a cup of coffee, I bought a cup of coffee. I paid a tax on that. We had to stop at the gas station and put gas in the car. We paid a tax there. When we got to work, most Americans work the first 3 hours just paying the taxes before they earn any money. When I go home, I am going to turn on the TV. Hopefully, I made C-SPAN. I am going to pay a cable tax just to watch the government at work. Then when I go out, somebody is going to have to travel for their work. They are going to buy an airline ticket; they are going to pay a tax on the ticket. They are going to rent a car; they are going to pay a tax on the car. 
   They check into the hotel; they are going to pay an occupancy tax. And, God forbid, if the other side of the aisle gets their way and we are successful in individuals earning money, the death tax is going to come back. We are taxed from the morning we wake up to take a shower to the night we go to sleep. It is tax, tax, tax. 
   And I am here to say, just like Ronald Reagan said: ``We don't have a tax issue when it comes to that, we have a spending problem.'' 
   Our revenues are coming in and coming in very strong. So I would proclaim and what I would like to see happen is we actually reform so that we can compete. I will tell you, I have two small kids, Connor and Megan who are just 12 and 10, and every day I call home when I'm back here and we talk about their education, we talk about if they have  done their home work. Because I am not concerned with my kids from Bakersfield, California competing with kids with Sacramento, California or even competing with kids from Georgia. Do you know who I am concerned with my children competing with when they grow up? Kids from China and India. And we need a system that allows us to be competitive. We need a tax system that creates jobs, we need a tax system that creates entrepreneurs. And the way we do that is let taxpayers keep more of what they earned. 
   That is why I applaud you today for your truth, and I applaud you for coming down and doing this work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today actually for two reasons, to congratulate Mrs. Miller, rightfully so. She was selected, rightfully so, that the Speaker was able to appoint her. But today I actually rise in disappointment, disappointed in this resolution. 
   As the Member said, I am a new Member from California. But I am not new to this House. I had the pleasure of serving Mr. Thomas, who had served as the chairman of House Administration in 1995. 
   I know the work that was done and the respect for this House on both sides of the aisle. I never questioned the respect for this institution on either side. But to go about in bringing an audit to this House I knew the work that needed to be done. I worked as a staffer, and I found out in 1995 when we went to do the first audit, we did not keep enough books to even have an independent audit. 
   And what has transpired, in the last 8 years, we have had a clean, independent audit. And how were we able to achieve that? This body was able to achieve that by being bipartisan in the selection of the chief administrative officer, and to do this resolution today is actually a step backwards. 
   Transparency in this House, both sides will agree, is the best thing for the House of Representatives; and my question today is, I do not question the credentials of Mr. Beard. Will he make a great CAO? I do not know, quite frankly, because he has never come before us. We have never had the ability to go for the search, and we have actually done a disjustice to him, because we have gone through to select and not even empower him, when both sides of the aisle could go by and make a selection. That would empower that office in a bipartisan manner, much like we have done in the past. 
   My biggest disappointment is this side of the aisle was ready to work. I know the ranking member had sent a letter to the new Speaker to ask about doing it just like we did in 1997, where somebody from the Democrats and some from the Republicans got together and agreed unanimously. That is the respect of this office. 
   On my first day on this floor, I listened intently. I came with no animosity. I came to work together. I came to find common ground. And up in that top, I listened to the Speaker when she said, this is about partnership not partisanship. 
   But today is a step backwards. This was the opportunity to move forward in a partisanship much like we have done in 1997, much as history has shown. And I will tell you, in the end, the respect for this House has to come from both sides of the aisle that we have, and we have to do it when it comes to the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution to dismiss the election contest related to the results of the 13th Congressional District of Florida race in 2006. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the chairman of this task force, Mr. Gonzalez. It was a three-member task force with Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren and myself. Every bit of this contest, as we went through studying it and spent the hours on it, was a unanimous decision. This was a bipartisan movement, a bipartisan investigation; and I just want to thank the chairman for his professionalism, his respect and the ethics in which he carried this out. 
   In my former life, I was actually a staff member to a former chairman of House Administration, and I was an individual that investigated some contestant elections. I will tell you this is probably the most thorough investigation we have seen. 
   We knew after the last election that there were races in this body that were even closer, within 100 votes; and we  did not contest those as they went. But we wanted to make sure, as Christine Jennings moved this debate and this argument, as we were going through, that we looked at every single one. 
   I want to thank the State of Florida. Before we even went to study it, they went through analyzing all the machines. We had the GAO look at every ability of the machines, even miscalculating the machines as they came forward to make sure they were still correct. 
   The American public can be very proud to know that every vote in the 13th District was counted. The outcome was correct, and Congressman Vern Buchanan was elected on that day and still elected today. I want to congratulate the work that was done by the task force. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the ranking member. 
   Madam Chairman, I rise today in disappointment. Disappointment, because only 6 months ago I sat in this chair to be sworn into this body, and I listened to our Speaker sit up at that podium and say this body was going to talk about partnership, not partisanship. 
   When I went onto the Agriculture Committee, I thought I found that partnership. For 6 months, we worked in a bipartisan manner, and I will tell you, I was proud of the fact to work with my colleagues, my colleagues like JIM COSTA and DENNIS CARDOZA. We worked together in a bipartisan fashion on bills such as this farm bill. We even looked to the 21st century and putting in specialty crops. We have done tremendous items when it comes to this farm bill. 
   But I will tell you that that was all taken away this week. That all changed when we now decide to raise taxes, $4 billion. Instead of looking for the future, instead of thinking of our children, who are going to compete for the first time since the 1860s, to have economies that are going to compete in America, to be as large as or even larger when you talk about China and India, now we are going to take away jobs. That is not partnership. That is partisanship. 
   And it is not like we bring up a farm bill every year, or we even bring it up every 2 years. We only talk about a farm bill twice every decade. We are missing an opportunity. We are missing a very big opportunity. 
   That disappointment, when I think back 6 months ago when I listened to our Speaker say that, I listened earlier tonight to our debate when we had our chairman from the Ways and Means Committee down here talking about why he wanted to raise taxes. And I listened earlier this week when we had appropriation bills, and you wonder where does the money go? We build monuments to ourselves, because people think they have served in this body long enough that they should spend $2 million building their own libraries. That is not what the American people are asking for. That is not what the American people are looking for. 
   I guess I when I think back 6 months ago, the Speaker should have looked at a quote from Dwight Eisenhower, when Dwight Eisenhower said, ``You don't lead by hitting people over the head. That is assault, not leadership.'' 
   Let's send this bill back and have real leadership, and go back to the bipartisanship that the Agriculture Committee has experienced for the last decades, because there is only two chances we have for it for the next decade. 
   Madam Chairman, I ask for a ``no'' vote.

   Much like what we have seen, we want to find solutions. We want to move America in the right direction. We want to tell you first and foremost what has gone on here for the last 100 days, give us a report card, tell us where we are going, and the most important thing, we want to bring accountability back to America. 
   So tonight we are going to start off, and we have got an interesting freshman class. We have got people from all walks of life. This is a microcosm of society, just much like America is. So our first speaker is going to be the president of the Republican class. He comes from Idaho. He served in the legislature. From Boise, Idaho, we have Mr. BILL SALI.

   As we know, we have been here 4 months; we have cast more than 200 votes. We have something to show where we are going, and pretty much what it is going to be is a report card, a quarterly report for across America. 
   The next speaker we have tonight, for those that live in Nevada, they know this person well. He has already made a very big name for himself. He was the secretary of State for three terms. He was able to work in a bipartisan manner, bring Republicans and Democrats together. He is still doing it here. He is putting partnership, not partisanship, forth. 
   The one thing I have seen from this Congressman, Congressman Dean Heller, he represents the largest part of Nevada. There are only three Members of Congress who are serving from there. He represents about two-thirds of the State, even more. 
   He serves on Natural Resources, he serves on Small Business, something he knows well, creating small businesses, and he also got put on Education and Labor, caring about the education in America. 
   Let's hear from you a quarterly report on what you have seen in the first 100 days and what you think reflects on your district, Congressman Dean Heller.

   I know you tell me many times we serve here Monday through Friday and you fly back home, you will travel 1,000 miles in that car that weekend just because your district is so large. Last night I saw you were late past 10:00 to do a tele-town hall just trying to listen to your constituents. That is what this is really all about, finding accountability and listening to constituents. I appreciate your service. 
   Now we are going to go across the country and hear from Florida. If you happen to be down in Clearwater or Palm Harbor, you know who this individual is. He is already making a very big name for himself here in the 110th. If you happen to be a veteran in America today, you know him because of his service. He serves on Veterans' Affairs, and he serves on Homeland Security. He has been doing a tremendous job.

   Promises made and promises kept. You promised to do something about the insurance problem in Florida, and you have introduced legislation to do that. 
   You brought up a good point about what has happened in the first 100 days. The President asked for a security supplemental, one for our men and women in uniform, to make sure that they are  protected. But what happened when he asked for $100 billion? He got $121 billion. Where did the $21 billion come from? They gave money to peanuts and shrimp. That is pork. That is not what the American people want. They want accountability. 
   When it comes to accountability and a hardworking freshman Member, you don't have to look beyond Michigan 7 with Congressman Tim Walberg. You serve on the Agriculture Committee and Education and Labor, and you are doing a great job. Can you give us an update on the first 100 days?

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank you, Mr. Walberg. You raised a good point. It has only been 100 days, and in less than 100 days, the largest tax increase in America has taken place. 
   During the campaign, you heard from both parties, you heard what people said they would do. In less than 100 days, they were broken. 
   If you happen to be sitting at home and you are married, you have some children, you are going to pay more. If you are elderly, you are going to pay more. If you happen to maybe seek the opportunity of America, worked hard, made a business, saved, bought some land and went forward, you happened to pass away, this majority party, the Democrats, want to take 55 percent of that. That is the difference. 
   I appreciate your principled view, let people keep their hard-earned money, and make sure that you bring accountability back. 
   Now we want to go to another place in middle America because that is where solutions are. We want to get an update from Ohio. In Ohio, you can find a lot of individuals, but you can't find someone who works harder. Congressman Jim Jordan, along with his wife, Polly; I think they hold the American dream.     
   They are doing a fantastic job of raising their own children. They reach out into this community. They help others and make sure they are able to have a place to stay, a place a work and place for education. But Jim, Congressman Jordan is the only Republican freshman to get placed on Judiciary. Why? Because of his work, not only as an attorney, but his work in the Senate in Ohio, that stood out across this Nation. And I want you to give us an update. Talk a little further more about taxes and what this 100 days have meant to America and how much this Democratic Party is going to reach into your pocket.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, one thing we know on this floor, and you brought up a very good point, Mr. Speaker, as we talk, we listen to other Members here, the largest tax increase in American history happened within the last 100 days. And, Mr. Speaker, when we think about is America taxed enough, I simply, and I think about the average American, they wake up in the morning and they take a shower, they pay a tax on that water. They maybe stop off at Starbucks or someone else, and get a cup of coffee. They pay a tax on that coffee. They stop off, fill their car up so they can make it to work, drop their children off at school, they pay a gasoline tax. They go to work, for the first 3 hours they are paying the Federal and State tax. They go home, they turn on the TV, maybe to watch a little C-SPAN, Mr. Speaker, if anybody at home is watching this, they are paying a cable tax. 
   Maybe their business says they have got to get up and try to find more opportunity because the world is being very competitive, so they have got to get on a plane. They pay an airplane tax. They rent a car. They pay a rental tax. They stay at a hotel, they pay an occupancy tax. Lo and behold, God forbid they get very successful and they save some money, and they put it away and they want to give their children, their grandchildren some opportunity for the future. This majority party wants to take 55 percent of that.  
   Now, I don't know, Mr. Speaker, if this majority party was on that plane, was working hard to make sure those people earn that money, but I don't think they need to pay them. I think America is taxed enough. 
   And I will tell you, we need to go firsthand in that Budget Committee to see where the fight was, to see what was said and what went on. And the only freshmen Republican to get appointed to that was my good friend from Nebraska, Adrian Smith. Adrian, can you give us an update on the Budget Committee and where it is going.

   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Congressman Smith, I appreciate that. And you point out a very good point. During the Republican majority, we lowered taxes, and what happened? We heard from the Democrats that the world was going to collapse because we were going to let people keep the money they earned. 
   Revenues to the Treasury went up. Why? Because they invest it. More small business, more ownership. The stock market at an all-time high? Why? Because people got the independence. They actually invest and create jobs. 
   And that is what this House should be about, the power of the idea, the power of opportunity. Not to take. But in these first 100 days, the largest tax increase in history. 
   And I will tell you, as I walk these halls and I see these marble stairways, and you see as you walk that they are molded out by other feet that have walked before you, you think of how long a history that is. But just in the last 100 days history was broken. Why? Because this new Democrat majority went back to their old ways. 
   But they didn't just go back. They went further. They broke every record of every Democrat majority in the past. They raised taxes $400 billion. That is not a sound bite. That is exactly what happened on this floor, and that is what this is all about. That is what a quarterly report is about. Just like when I open the report card for Connor and Megan in my house, I want to know how my children are doing. 
   And as we end up here tonight and we close, Mr. Speaker, I would just like to hear the time report from the Members that are still with us. If we could just go around and they could give final statements just to sum up the first 100 days, this first quarter in this House of Congress.  
   I will yield to Congressman Jordan.

   We appreciate the time we have had, Mr. Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her service to the country. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in a different position than the majority of this body. You see, I am one of the 54 newly elected Members of this Congress. We did not have the opportunity to debate and vote on the authority to use military force in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to have an honest debate, not for political gain and not one that questions anyone's patriotism, because I believe everyone in this body wants to move this country in the right direction. 
   But I believe the right direction means that we move forward, not backwards. On this floor today is a nonbinding resolution that I believe moves us backwards. This resolution offers no hope to the American people. It offers no plan of action, no new strategy with the prospect of achieving success. 
   A lot has changed since last November's election. We have a new Defense Secretary, recommendation from the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and a new general, General David Petraeus. He will lead our troops on the ground in Iraq. 
   We have a new plan, a new way forward that addresses the problem of security in Iraq through a strategy that requires more ground power. This reinforcement of troops is recommended by the study group, and we will also hold the Iraqi Government accountable to establish and preserve the peace. 
   Our Commander in Chief, the military commanders, and our troops believe we can still achieve stability in Iraq. 
   But this resolution would be the first step in gutting the very resources necessary to achieve success. This resolution offers nothing. 
   The Commander in Chief, the bipartisan study group, and General Petraeus offer a new way forward. This resolution offers the status quo. The status quo is a mandate to fail and begins the chain of events that lead to a precipitous withdrawal from Iraq and all the consequences that would inevitably follow. 
   And what would those consequences be? 
   Withdrawal makes the young Iraqi democracy vulnerable to takeover by extremist elements that hate America. 
   What would withdrawal mean for the stability in the Middle East? 
   What would generations of Iraqis believe, that Americans will quit before the job is done? 
   Who will fill the void of our strength, al Qaeda, Syria, or a country like Iran that threatens regional stability through an aggressive nuclear program, that supports terrorist groups like Hezbollah, and that possibly supplies weapons to insurgents killing our troops? 
   Withdrawal only strengthens terrorist groups fighting the United States and demoralizes our American troops. 
   I may be new to this House, but I recognize when a simple, nonbinding resolution has potential to do great damage to our Nation and to our men and women in the military. 
   I believe that, by voting for this resolution, the House will send a demoralizing message to our service men and women who are courageously implementing this strategy. By voting for this resolution, the House will strengthen our enemies and tell them that the end is near; that the Congress will continue to undermine our Commander in Chief, our military commanders, like General Petraeus and our troops, by cutting funding or demanding further retreats.     
   By voting for this resolution, the House will snuff out the hope of democracy that millions of Iraqi people have. By voting for this resolution, the House will begin a process that leads to the creation of a dangerous power vacuum in Iraq to be potentially filled by those who mean America great harm. 
   I ask the Members to join with me in voting ``no'' on this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCARTHY of California. (COMMITTEE FUNDING RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCARTHY of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the work that he has done. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reluctantly oppose this. As a member of the House Administration Committee, I sat through the hearings that we had, where the chairmen and the ranking members came before us and talked about what they needed in funding, and it was our accountability, our role to oversee that. We went through the committees. 
   But after this resolution was done and went to the Rules Committee, the Rules Committee created a new select committee, added $3.7 million, going beyond the jurisdiction of House Administration. Where is the accountability? Where is the approval process? Where is the role of this House and this committee to oversee that? 
   If the Rules Committee felt we had $3.7 million more to spend, I think there would be other places to spend it. For one, when we look at the ethics and the changes in this House and what this House wants to accomplish, I am a new Member, I sat on this floor the day we were sworn in, and I listened to our Speaker when she said she wanted a new House, when she talked about changing partisanship and making it partnership. 
   I do not see partnership with the Rules Committee overstepping the bounds of the House Administration Committee. I do not see partnership when we have put new rules on this floor, when the Ethics Committee needs to oversee them, when the Ethics Committee needs to be able to interpret them and bring them back to this floor so this floor understands it, is able to live by it and be the House that the people want it to be. 
   So I stand before you reluctantly, because I voted for the version that went before the House Administration Committee, but I will not vote for the version that came back from the Rules Committee. I believe it is overstepping its bounds. I believe the jurisdiction, the accountability, rests in the House Administration Committee, just like every other individual when they were the chair or ranking member and had to stand before us and had to justify the money they were going to spend.
