<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, in a blatant show of partisanship, the New York Times this week refused to publish an op-ed by Senator John McCain about Iraq just days after publishing an op-ed on the same subject by Senator Barack Obama. The Times' op-ed editor, a former staff member in the Clinton administration, said he wanted something from MCCAIN that ``mirrors Senator Obama's piece.'' 
   Instead of permitting one candidate to set the rules, maybe the Times should allow equal opportunity for the Presidential candidates to both express their views on major issues like Iraq. 
   The American people should demand more fairness and less favoritism from the New York Times. Voters deserve the highest standards of journalism both during this important election and afterwards.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I, in turn, thank the gentlewoman and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding me time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize that there are good arguments for and against this bill, but I want to focus on a provision that many Members may not be aware of. 
   Under current law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to consider HIV/AIDS a communicable disease of public health significance; as a result, aliens with HIV/AIDS are inadmissible. Section 305 of the bill rescinds the statutory designation of HIV/AIDS as a communicable disease. This change would allow the current or a future administration to decide that HIV/AIDS is not a communicable disease of public health significance, and immigrants with HIV/AIDS would be admitted. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this provision will result in the entry of thousands of persons with HIV/AIDS. This change of policy inevitably will threaten the health and lives of many Americans. The CBO also estimates that allowing entry of thousands of persons with HIV/AIDS will cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The cost of health care for each person with HIV/AIDS averages more than $600,000. Mr. Speaker, this provision removes a safeguard that protects the health of Americans and costs many millions of dollars.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I reluctantly support H.R. 5104, which extends the Protect America Act for 2 weeks. 
   Last year, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, notified Congress about a dangerous loophole in our ability to collect intelligence information overseas. Director McConnell estimated that the intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications. Congress passed the Protect America Act last August to close this loophole. Unfortunately, the legislation contained an arbitrary 6-month sunset and is currently set to expire this Friday. 
   After 6 months of waiting, the Democratic majority is now coming perilously close to threatening the safety of every American. But rather than pass a long-term fix to the terrorist loophole, the Democratic majority wants another extension. The White House promised to veto the 30-day extension that the majority was going to bring to the floor yesterday. Today's bill represents a compromise for only a 2-week extension. 
   The truth is we do not need any temporary extension. In fact, there is a bipartisan bill that we can and should pass today. The Senate Intelligence Committee already has approved a bill to close the terrorist loophole and provide liability protection to the telecommunication companies. That is being blocked by the Democratic majority. 
   As the deadline draws near, the urgent needs of the intelligence community must be addressed. This is no time for partisanship. This is a time for responsible action. 
   Any bill must include two critical provisions. First, Congress has the responsibility to enact long-term legislation that allows intelligence officials to conduct surveillance on foreign targets without a court order. A U.S. Army intelligence officer in Iraq should not have to contact a Federal judge in Washington to conduct surveillance on Iraqi insurgents. 
   Second, Congress must provide liability protection to U.S. telecommunication companies that responded to government requests for information following the terrorist attacks of September 11. Close to 40 frivolous lawsuits against the telephone companies already have been filed. These companies deserve our thanks, not a flurry of meritless lawsuits. 
   Terrorists have not placed an expiration date on their plots to destroy the American way of life. Congress should not put an expiration date on our intelligence community's ability to protect our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   The Senate Intelligence Committee has already approved a bipartisan bill to replace the Protect America Act. It contains important provisions to help the intelligence committee gather foreign surveillance and provides liability protection to telecommunications  companies that assisted the government after the terrorist attacks on Ð9/11. 
   The Democratic majority has a duty to end political gamesmanship with America's national security and immediately pass legislation that gives our intelligence community the tools they need to protect us. 
   Madam Speaker, given the rapidly approaching Friday deadline, today I ask that my colleagues support a temporary extension; but, of course, that's with the understanding that we come back immediately and pass a good bill that is long term, that gives liability protection to the telephone companies, and that doesn't force us to get a court order to listen to Osama bin Laden when he makes a cell phone call from a cave in Pakistan to initiate attacks on the United States. 
   I hope that any bill that we consider in the coming days will have those provisions in them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Congressman Calvert for introducing the original bill on which this legislation was based, and for sponsoring this legislation as well. Also, thanks go to Chairwoman Lofgren, who just spoke; Ranking Members McCrery and Johnson, and Chairman Rangel for reaching a compromise on such an important issue. 
   The E-Verify Program protects American workers by ensuring that jobs are reserved for legal workers. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 created the basic pilot program, which is now known as E-Verify. For the last decade, this program has provided American employers who want to do the right thing with an effective way to ensure that they are hiring a legal workforce. It ensures that new employees are not providing their employers with fake Social Security numbers. 
   As the E-Verify Program has grown more popular--over 69,000 employers nationwide now participate--it has become the subject of some very unfair criticism. To set the record straight, participating employers are happy with  the basic pilot program. Last year, an outside evaluation determined that ``most employers found the Web basic pilot to be an effective and reliable tool for employment verification'' and that an amazing 96 percent did not believe that it overburdened their staffs. 
   The accuracy of the databases that lie at the heart of the basic pilot program also has been unfairly maligned. However, the facts about these databases could not be more encouraging. 
   Last year's outside evaluation found that in less than 1 percent, only .6 percent of cases, do employees who were eventually determined to be work-authorized undergo secondary verification. This means that persons eligible to work receive immediate confirmation 99.4 percent of the time. For the native-born, 99.9 percent receive immediate confirmation. For employees born outside of the U.S., 97 percent receive immediate confirmation. That is a success rate any company in America would be happy to have. 
   A common misperception is that secondary verification means error by a Federal agency. That is simply not the case. Secondary verification usually means that an illegal immigrant has been caught providing false information or that an employee has failed to update their records with the Social Security Administration. This is seldom acknowledged by those who question the E-Verify Program. 
   Of the employees who were asked to contact local Social Security Administration offices as part of the verification process, 95 percent said their work authorization problem was resolved in a timely, courteous, and efficient manner. 
   Finally, it has been alleged that the Social Security Administration's Inspector General has found the agency's database to be inaccurate. However, the Inspector General actually stated, ``We applaud the agency on the accuracy of the data we tested.'' 
   The legislation before us tonight reauthorizes the E-Verify Program for 5 years and puts in place a system to help ensure that the Department of Homeland Security covers the cost of the program. 
   It is hard to believe that those who attack E-Verify are serious about reducing illegal immigration or saving American jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the bill is on the House floor. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last week, President Bush removed the executive ban on offshore drilling. After the announcement was made, crude oil futures plunged. Prices fell $6.44 in the biggest one-day drop since the Gulf War. The next day, prices dropped another $4.50 to $134. This is not a coincidence. 
   The Democratic majority says it will take years to produce oil from offshore drilling and that it won't affect energy prices. 
   If Congress lifts the ban on offshore drilling, we will continue to see oil prices fall. Energy traders do take government policies into account. Deciding to develop our American energy resources can immediately lower the cost per barrel of oil and can provide relief at the gas pump. 
   Democratic Party leaders should heed the will of the American people and should schedule a vote to increase our American energy supply.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 923, which has broad bipartisan support. 
   At the full committee markup of this legislation last week, members from both sides of the aisle, as Chairman Conyers just mentioned, and from all backgrounds and experiences joined together to ensure the swift prosecution of civil rights-era crimes, which were oftentimes ignored. 
   It is appropriate that the House consider this legislation today, Mr. Speaker. Last week marked the 44th anniversary of the murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers. Before his death, Medgar Evers was a primary, although unofficial, investigator of the Emmett Till murder. The committee was privileged to hear from his widow, Mrs. Myrlie Evers William. She movingly testified that the conviction of Medgar's killer in 1994, 31 years after his murder, gave a sense of hope to those who experienced this bleak time in our Nation's history. 
   Last week also marked an enormous victory in the fight to bring justice to unsolved civil rights-era murders. A Mississippi jury convicted former Klansman James Ford Seale for his role in the 1964 kidnapping and murder of 19-year-olds Charlie Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee. 
   Unfortunately, time is running out for other unsolved civil rights-era murders. To date, the FBI has identified nearly 100 outstanding cases that still need to be solved. Many of these crimes are 30 to 40 years old. Evidence has been lost or destroyed, witnesses and defendants have died, and memories have dimmed. We must act swiftly to help bring long overdue justice to the victims, their families, and the communities that these brutal crimes affected. 
   H.R. 923 directs the Attorney General to designate a deputy chief within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to coordinate the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil rights-era murders. The bill also directs the Attorney General to designate a supervisory special agent within the Civil Rights Unit of the FBI to further investigate these outstanding cases. 
   Finally, the bill provides much-needed resources to the Department of Justice, the FBI, and State and local law enforcement officials to prosecute these same cases. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to especially thank Chairman Conyers and Representatives NADLER, FRANKS, SCOTT,  and FORBES, members of the Judiciary Committee, for their commitment to this legislation. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this much-needed bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes), the ranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, and I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control that time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am a strong supporter of H.R. 1943, The Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2007. 
   I introduced this legislation in the last Congress and am an original cosponsor of it this year as well. And I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Waters, for her energetic help. I was happy to work with her in the last Congress, and I am pleased that we have worked together again this year. Also, I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the House floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, the incidence of HIV and AIDS in Federal and State prison populations is difficult to measure because not all Federal and State inmates are routinely tested. There are approximately 170,000 prisoners in the Federal system. The Justice Department said in its 2006 report that about 2 percent of State prison inmates and over 1 percent of all Federal inmates were known to be infected with HIV. The occurrence of HIV and AIDS cases in Federal prison is at least three times higher than it is among the United States population as a whole. 
   H.R. 1943 requires routine HIV testing for all Federal prison inmates upon entry and prior to release. For all existing inmates, testing is required within 6 months of enactment. This reasonable requirement will enable prison officials to reduce HIV among inmates and provide much needed counseling, prevention, and health care services for inmates who happen to be infected. 
   Requiring Federal inmates to be tested when they enter prison and when they leave prison is just good common sense. For some prisoners tested when they enter prison, such testing will ensure that they receive adequate treatments, education, and prevention services while incarcerated. Similarly, it is important that prisoners are tested shortly before they are released into the community so that adequate services can be provided after their release. That, in turn, will protect the community. 
   I believe in tough punishment for criminal offenders because the public deserves to be protected. But we have a duty to treat prisoners humanely and to rehabilitate them. Preventing the spread of HIV and AIDS among prisoners is an essential aspect of humane treatment and rehabilitation. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Before I reserve the balance of my time, I just want to thank Congresswoman Waters again for making sure that we are here today, for her leadership on this legislation, and for working with me both last year and this year on such an important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 742, the Antitrust Modernization Commission Extension Act of 2007. 
   Our Nation's first antitrust laws were enacted at the turn of the 20th century. The Antitrust Modernization Commission Act of 2002 created a commission to examine how to update our antitrust laws in light of the new technologies that have developed in recent years. 
   The Antitrust Modernization Commission, or AMC, was required to produce a report 3 years after the date of its first meeting on April 2, 2004. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to report that the AMC will submit its recommendations to Congress and the President by the statutory deadline of April 2, 2007. 
   The AMC is required to terminate 30 days after submitting its report. However, the commission has requested an extension of its authorization by an additional 30 days so that it can effectively conclude its operations. This additional 30 days will allow the AMC to properly archive its records and transfer property to other agencies. 
   Pursuant to that request, H.R. 742 extends the authorization of the AMC by 30 days and also makes a small technical correction to the original authorization statute. This bill will not delay the submission of the AMC's report to Congress nor will it require the appropriation of any additional funds. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to cosponsor this bill, along with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to allow the AMC to wrap up its important work without imposing any additional cost on the American taxpayer. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not believe I have any others who want to comment on this legislation, and so, because of that, I will yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Ohio yielding me time, and I also want to thank Ranking Member Tom Davis and Chairman Henry Waxman for their hard work on this issue. I know how strongly they feel about the need for more open government, and I and many others appreciate their efforts. 
   The process for obtaining government information is overly burdensome, and Federal agencies have become less and less responsive to requests for information. This deters citizens from obtaining information to which they are entitled. 
   H.R. 1309, the Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 2007, has much to recommend it, but it contains at least one fatal flaw, the statutory presumption of disclosure. For that reason, I oppose this legislation. 
   The presumption of disclosure would reverse the FOIA guidelines set out by former Attorney General John Ashcroft. Shortly after September 11, 2001, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft directed that FOIA be used to ensure an open and accountable system of government while at the same time protecting national security and personal privacy. 
   The directive encouraged agencies, when making a decision on discretionary disclosure, to carefully consider whether national security, privacy, and government's interest would be jeopardized. 
   Unfortunately, this bill only exacerbates national security and personal privacy concerns. Instead of allowing agency discretion regarding national security concerns, this statutory language would mandate the release of information if the information does not blatantly fall under an existing exemption. 
   For instance, under the bill's language there is no discretion to determine whether the information requested will invade personal privacy. Also, if information requested is required by FOIA to be released, under this language it could tip off a terrorist to an investigation that is being conducted. So the bill could set in motion events that could compromise our national security. 
   Last year, neither the House nor Senate bipartisan legislation included this questionable presumption of disclosure language. It is my understanding that this year's bipartisan Senate version also will not include this questionable language. And, furthermore, Mr. Speaker, the administration opposes this provision, too. 
   There is no good reason to support a flawed bill, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would ask unanimous consent to have the statement of opposition by the administration be made a part of the Record.

   One, Senator Obama has led Senator McCain in news coverage for 12 consecutive weeks, according to the Nonpartisan Project For Excellence in Journalism. 
   Two, journalists who gave money to Senator Obama outnumber those who contributed to Senator McCain by a 20-1 margin, according to Investors Business Daily. 
   Three, while the media often label Governor Palin ``conservative,'' they rarely call Senator Obama or Senator Biden ``liberal,'' even though the National Journal ranked Senator Obama as the most liberal Member of the Senate and Senator Biden as the third most liberal Member of the Senate. 
   Four, the New York Times opinion editor, a former staff member in the Clinton administration, refused to publish an op-ed by Senator McCain about the Iraq war, just days after publishing an op-ed on the same subject by Senator Obama. 
   Five, although the media criticize Senator McCain for running negative TV ads, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project found that 77 percent of Senator Obama's recent ads have been negative, far more than Senator McCain's.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) not only for yielding me time, but also for his favorable mention a few minutes ago when he was speaking. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007. 
   This legislation gives the public more information and better insight into the workings of the government by strengthening the Freedom of Information Act, called FOIA. FOIA performs a vital check and balance on the Federal branch. It protects our open system of government and ensures that the government responds as it should to the American people. Unfortunately, the process for obtaining information is overly burdensome and Federal agencies have become less and less responsive to the requests for information. This deters citizens from obtaining information to which they are entitled. 
   Taxpayers should have the opportunity to obtain information from the Federal Government quickly and easily. This legislation contains several provisions similar to those in a bill I introduced last March. These include provisions regarding recovery of attorneys' fees, penalties for agencies that do not comply within the specified FOIA time limits, and additional agency reporting requirements. 
   I am pleased that the bill under consideration today creates a more open government without threatening national security or invading personal privacy. The ability to obtain records from the Federal Government is one of the fundamental rights of the American people. When the government closes the doors on information, the people cannot monitor their government. Democracy is based on the people's right to know. That is why I support the Freedom of Information Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill rightly makes it easier for citizens to get answers to their requests for information, and that's why I hope all of my colleagues will support it.

   Mr. Speaker, I am an original cosponsor of this legislation and believe it is necessary to protect judges, their family members and the other courthouse personnel by preventing disclosure of personal information that can be used to target and retaliate against them. 
   This legislation extends the authority of Federal judges and court personnel to redact sensitive and personal information from financial disclosure reports for security reasons. The current authority to redact personal and sensitive information from financial disclosure reports expired at the end of 2005. 
   Recent assaults and threats against Federal judges and their family members demonstrate the need for this redaction authority to continue. I believe this is an important safeguard to prevent vindictive offenders and litigants from seeking their revenge by harming or intimidating judges, probation officers and others. 
   H.R. 1130 extends the authority for 4 years, expands the coverage to include immediate family members, and improves the annual reporting requirements on the use of this authority. Although I favor a permanent extension of redaction authority, I support a 4-year extension to ensure the bill's timely passage by the Senate.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 545, the Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2007, which provides urgently needed funds to Native American communities for the enforcement and treatment of methamphetamine addiction. 
   The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 was enacted last year as part of the U.S. PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act. It included three critical grant programs to assist States with America's escalating methamphetamine problem: the COPS Meth Hot Spots program, the Drug-Endangered Children program and the Pregnant and Parenting Women Offenders program. However, the act inadvertently omitted Native American communities from participation in two of these grant programs. 
   At a hearing before the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee in February, Mr. Ben Shelly, vice president of the Navajo Nation, stated that methamphetamine is the drug of choice in Indian country. 
   In 2005, 40 percent of all calls seeking police assistance on the Navajo Nation were meth-related. Even more troubling is that 40 percent of all violent crimes committed on the Navajo Nation are directly related to methamphetamine use trafficking. 
   Mr. Udall of New Mexico, the sponsor of H.R. 545, testified at the hearing that 74 percent of Native Americans surveyed in a recent study say that meth is the single biggest threat to Native American communities today. The Native American Meth Enforcement and Treatment Act corrects this oversight and gives Native Americans full access to all three meth grants. This legislation is critical to our continuing fight to eliminate the meth epidemic in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 740, the Preventing Harassment Through Outbound Number Enforcement Act, or PHONE Act, and I thank Chairman Conyers and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for their support of this bill which unanimously passed the House at the end of the 109th Congress. 
   Mr. Speaker, a new type of fraud known as ``spoofing'' is becoming more prevalent. Spoofing involves masking one's caller ID information to facilitate a fraudulent telephone call to the recipient. Those who engage in spoofing use incorrect, fake or fraudulent caller identification to hide their identity, and then obtain personal information from the victim. 
   Call recipients unwittingly divulge their names, addresses, or Social Security numbers under the mistaken belief that the caller represents a bank, a credit card company, or even a court of law. 
   Spoofing is not simply annoying; it is the latest tactic for committing identity theft and other types of fraud that costs victims thousands and sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
   Spoofing not only victimizes the phone call recipient, but also invades the privacy of those individuals whose caller ID is used to mask the fraudulent calls. To address this, H.R. 740 specifically prohibits the use of an actual person's caller ID information for spoofing. 
   Although the technology needed to spoof has been available for some time, it previously required special equipment and knowledge to use the masking technology. 
   Recently, this technology has become more accessible either through the purchase of Internet telephone equipment or through Web sites specifically set up for spoofing. 
   These Web sites claim to protect one's privacy. However, the use of this technology has been linked to fraud, prank phone calls, political attacks, and telemarketers' attempts to avoid ``do not call'' restrictions. 
   Additionally, calling cards can be purchased or accounts set up to facilitate multiple telephone calls. One of the greatest concerns related to spoofing is the use of the technology by criminals to mislead law enforcement officials and evade prosecution. 
   H.R. 740 addresses these concerns by creating a new Federal crime to prohibit the modification of caller ID with  the intent to deceive the recipient of a telephone call as to the identity of the caller. 
   The bill imposes a fine and/or a prison term of up to 5 years for violations. However, the legislation does not affect legally available blocking of caller ID technology, or lawfully authorized activities of law enforcement or intelligence agencies. 
   This legislation will help deter telephone fraud, protect consumers from harassment, and protect consumers and their personally identifiable information from identity thieves. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support better health care being made available for the mentally ill. Americans should have the freedom to choose health care plans that offer mental health benefits. 
   I also support the passage of H.R. 1424, the ``Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act of 2007,'' because this legislation represents a step forward in the mental health care debate. 
   However, I believe the House bill goes too far by limiting physicians' ability to refer patients to physician-owned hospitals. Physician-owned hospitals play an important role in providing high quality care to patients. These facilities should not be penalized for offering accessible health care to so many individuals. 
   In addition, this legislation requires any plan that provides mental health or substance-related disorder benefits to offer coverage for all disorders listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). The list of disorders encompassed by this legislation is too broad and could be used by some individuals to take advantage of the health care system. 
   H.R. 1424 also will not allow employers to have discretion over the benefit coverage decisions for their employees. It instead imposes a mandate that requires employers to cover all conditions listed in the DSM-IV. This mandate likely will increase health insurance costs. 
   I am hopeful that if this legislation goes to a Conference Committee, the House will adopt much of the language contained in the Senate version of the bill, S. 558, the ``Mental Health Parity Act.'' The Senate bill represents a compromise between the mental health and business communities. 
   The Senate legislation provides employer discretion by allowing employers to determine which mental health conditions should be covered under their plan and does not include language that penalizes physician-owned hospitals. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this important issue and to making sure we have an improved bill at the end of the process.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. First of all, I thank my friend from Indiana (Mr. Burton), the former chairman of the Government Reform Committee, for yielding me time. I also want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis) for bringing this bill to the House floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we honor Cyndi Taylor Krier, a distinguished public servant who has spent more than a quarter of a century in local, State and Federal public office in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government. 
   Cyndi Krier began her public service career when she became the first woman from Bexar County elected to the Texas senate. She represented Bexar County in the State senate from 1985 to 1992, serving on the Finance, Education, Jurisprudence, and Natural Resources Committees. She then became the first woman elected Bexar County judge. She served as county judge from 1992 to 2001, representing more than 1.4 million people in the San Antonio metropolitan area. 
   Cyndi Krier also was a regent for the University of Texas system from 2001 to 2007, overseeing the University of Texas' nine academic and six health campuses, and serving as vice chairman of the board and as chairman of the academic affairs committee. 
   Cyndi Krier's family has strong ties to the United States Postal Service. Her grandfather served as postmaster in Dinero, Texas, until his death in 1956, and was succeeded by her grandmother, who served as postmaster for more than 20 years. Her mother served the United States Postal Service in Beeville, Texas, for more than 30 years as a clerk, rural route delivery person, and civil service examiner. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the accomplishments of a good friend, Cyndi Taylor Krier, by supporting H.R. 4774, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 10250 John Saunders Road in San Antonio, Texas, as the Cyndi Taylor Krier Post Office Building. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, it gives me great pleasure to have introduced this bill and to see it considered by the House today.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, sometimes the worst examples of unfair news coverage are what reporters choose not to say. For example, while the media often label Governor Sarah Palin ``conservative,'' they seldom call Senator Barack Obama or Senator Joe Biden ``liberal,'' despite the fact that the National Journal ranks Senator Obama as the most liberal member of the Senate, and Senator Biden as the third most liberal member of the Senate. 
   A comparison of television network news programs immediately after each vice presidential selection shows that newscasters continually referred to Governor Sarah Palin as ``conservative,'' but did not one time, not a single time, label Senator JOE BIDEN as ``liberal.'' 
   The American people should encourage the media to apply the same rules to both Presidential tickets. Only then can we restore Americans' faith in news reporting.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2640, the NICS Improvement Act of 2007. Just 2 months ago, Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year-old student, killed 32 people and injured 20 others in a horrendous shooting at the Virginia Tech campus. Our Nation was shocked by the senselessness and brutality of this attack. 
   In addition to our sadness over the identity of the innocent lives lost, we were angry to learn that Cho Seung-Hui should not have obtained the two guns he obtained to commit this act because he had a history of mental illness. 
   Unfortunately, Virginia State law did not provide for transmittal of records of mental illness to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database, which would have disqualified him from purchasing firearms. Ambiguities in current Federal law also contributed to the system's failure to stop him from obtaining weapons. Today we take the first step in making sure that this tragedy is not repeated. 
   I commend Congresswoman McCarthy and Congressman Dingell and the other cosponsors for their commitment to addressing this issue in a way that protects every American's constitutional right to bear arms. 
   The NICS Improvement Act will ensure that the NICS background check system really is instantaneous and accurate. The act will require Federal agencies to provide relevant criminal mental health and military records for using NICS, create financial incentives for States to provide relevant records for using NICS, improve the accuracy of NICS by requiring Federal agencies and participating States to provide relevant records, require removal of expired, incorrect or otherwise irrelevant records, prohibit Federal fees from NICS checks and to require an audit by the Government Accountability Office of funds already spent for criminal history improvements, since hundreds of millions of dollars intended for NICS were spent on non-NICS programs. 
   To strike a fair balance on the issue of mental adjudications, the bill clarifies existing law to include involuntary commitments to a mental institution, prevents use of Federal adjudications based on medical diagnoses without a finding of dangerousness or mental incapacity, requires all Federal agencies imposing mental health adjudications or commitments to provide a process for ``relief from disabilities'' and requires States receiving funding to have a relief from disabilities program for mental adjudications and commitments. 
   The tragedy of April 16 can never be erased, but this bill is a step forward in protecting our country from violence by persons who have no right to possess a firearm. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, much of our economic crisis today is rooted in misguided policies of the past. Permitting home mortgages with nothing down was a disaster waiting to happen when home prices fell. Unfortunately, all the bad mortgages and the resulting credit crisis have dragged down our economy and threatened the financial well-being of all Americans. 
   If companies big and small cannot access funds they need to operate and pay employees, this will adversely impact the entire economy and punish hard-working Americans. If  credit to buy homes, cars and other purchases dries up, home prices will fall even further and loans will become even harder to get. 
   Many people felt the original proposal was unfair. It would have been far more unfair to do nothing and allow a recession to occur, which would hurt everyone. Changes were made to the plan to address those concerns. Measures were successfully included to ensure Wall Street pays its share and taxpayers are protected. 
   We were facing the economic equivalent of a cattle stampede. To stop a stampede, you have to act quickly and decisively and get ahead of the herd to turn it. This plan, while not perfect, does that. 
   This is not about bailing out Wall Street. It's about protecting American jobs, the financial security of families, and the economy of our Nation. 
   Since half of all households own stocks either directly or indirectly through 401(k) accounts, IRAs, and pension plans, we had to find a solution to this crisis. 
   The money in the compromise plan will be used to purchase the mortgage-related assets at the center of the problem. When the financial markets stabilize, many of those assets will regain their value and will be sold by the Federal Government to recover a substantial portion of the cost for taxpayers. 
   This plan will stabilize the economy, strengthen home values, and prevent a devastating recession. It's an investment in the future of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we all deplore unethical conduct by Members of Congress and their staff. Each party has their fair share of examples. The public wants and deserves honest government. Unfortunately, this legislation does not bode well for this Congress' ability to deliver it. 
   In May, this House brought up a base bill that seemed very familiar to Republicans because the increased disclosures required in the bill were largely those contained in H.R. 4975, which was introduced by Congressman David Dreier, and which passed the House in the last Congress. 
   Last year's H.R. 4975 contained all of the following provisions: a requirement for Members to disclose post-employment negotiations with private entities; a prohibition on partisan influences on an outside entity's employment decisions; and increased quarterly electronic filing in a public database of lobbyist campaign contributions linked to Federal Election Commission filings. 
   That Republican legislation also increased civil and criminal penalties for failures to comply; required disclosure by lobbyists of all past executive branch and congressional employment; and contained a prohibition on lobbyists' violation of House gift ban rules. 
   Legislation the Democrats introduced this Congress, in the form of H.R. 2316, largely replicated Republican efforts from the previous Congress. 
   At the Judiciary Committee's markup of H.R. 2316, several additional Republican amendments that would strengthen this bill were adopted by voice vote. One provided for a 1-year revolving door ban that would prohibit private lawyers and law firms who enter into contracts with congressional committees from lobbying Congress while under contract to such committee and for 1 year thereafter. 
   That amendment by Representative Chris Cannon was adopted by voice vote at the committee, and was passed out of the House of Representatives. But it is nowhere to be found in the bill before us today. 
   Also, in May, Democrats supported and passed two motions to recommit offered by Republicans that contained even more ethics reforms. Those reforms required lobbyists to disclose which special projects they lobbied for. 
   If a special interest lobbyist is having closed-door meetings with Members of Congress regarding programs that do not benefit all Americans but only benefit a small group of people in one part of the country, then those projects should be disclosed. 
   The Republican motion to recommit also closed the existing loophole that allows State and local government entities to give gifts and travel to Members and their staff that other entities cannot give. It makes little sense to exempt entities that operate on taxpayer dollars from the gift and travel ban. 
   Current rules allow taxpayer-funded entities to give gifts and travel to Members and staff while they try to convince those same Members and staff to send more Federal taxpayer dollars their way. That is not fair, and the Republican motion to recommit, which was adopted, would have ended that practice. 
   The Republicans' motion to recommit also contained a reverse revolving door provision that would have prohibited a congressional employee who was a registered lobbyist prior to their congressional employment from engaging in official business with their former private employer for a period of 1 year. 
   The Republicans' motion to recommit also included the Republican-amended text to H.R. 2317, which required that bundled contributions to political action committees, often referred to as PACs, be fully disclosed. 
   Viewed in the harsh light of recent history, the legislation we consider  today is a hollow shell of reform. Just listen to the following list of reforms that Democrats have abandoned. 
   The provisions in this bill requiring the disclosure of contributions bundled together by lobbyists is weaker than the reforms passed in May, as this legislation requires the disclosure of bundled contributions exceeding $15,000 rather than the original $5,000. 
   That means less disclosure and less accountability to the American people. The weakened bundling disclosure provisions in this bill do not even cover bundled disclosures to PACs, a reform that 33 Democrats supported when it was accepted as part of the Republicans' motion to recommit H.R. 2317, and that 158 Democrats supported when it was accepted as part of the Republicans' motion to recommit H.R. 2316. 
   The newspaper Roll Call reported yesterday that, ``The average Democratic incumbent raised over 63 percent more from PACs during the first half of this year than during the same period in 2005.'' Could that be why Democrats don't want to disclose the bundled contributions lobbyists give to PACs? 
   This bill also fails to contain the following reforms that 158 Democrats supported in May. The length of this list defines the credibility chasm that now separates the Democratic Party from American voters. 
   The provision requiring the disclosure of bundled contributions by political action committees? Gone. 
   The provision requiring lobbyists to disclose the special projects they lobby for? Gone. 
   The provision prohibiting State and local governments from giving expensive gifts and lavish travel to Members of Congress in return for taxpayer dollars? Gone. 
   The provision prohibiting congressional employees who were lobbyists from engaging in official business with their former lobbyist employers? Gone. 
   Last May, the Washington Post reported that the Democrats brought up their original legislation ``after scrapping most key elements of an ethics package meant to deliver on Democratic promises to bring unprecedented accountability to Congress.'' 
   Today, essential reforms have been thrown overboard, and the Democratic pledge of reform is sinking fast. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

As I mentioned in my opening statement a few minutes ago, I went through all the provisions that, in fact, had been carried over from the Republican bill last year. 
   But I would correct the majority leader in one respect, and that is many of the Republican reforms that were included in our motion to recommit which passed successfully with largely Democratic support earlier, all of those Republican reforms were eliminated. So this bill would have been much improved and much better if all the Republican reforms had, in fact, been included. I regret that was not the case.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this legislation would return the procedures for appointing interim U.S. Attorneys to what it was before Congress reauthorized the PATRIOT Act. 
   Some have claimed that the PATRIOT Act's reform was used to avoid Senate confirmation of permanent U.S. attorneys. To prevent that alleged abuse, this bill, H.R. 580, was rushed headlong through the Judiciary Committee. 
   One hearing was held on the bill. But that hearing focused mostly on the current U.S. Attorney controversy, not the bill, itself. It was then pushed immediately to the full committee, without an opportunity for subcommittee mark-up. 
   Republicans on the Judiciary Committee would have liked to have worked more with the Democrats in a bipartisan fashion to improve the existing law. We might well have found a better solution. 
   The majority's own witnesses at the hearing, for example, testified that much of the problem with the interim appointments process is the time it takes to obtain Senate confirmation. This bill, however, does not address that problem. 
   Given more time, we might have considered some promising ideas from the other side of the Capitol. 
   Senator Kyl, for example, proposed a 120-day interim appointment power for the Executive Branch, and a 120-day clock for the Senate to confirm permanent appointees. This would have addressed the principal problem. 
   Senator Sessions proposed to set qualification standards for judicial appointments of interim appointees. These standards would have helped prevent unsuitable judicial appointees--assuming, for the purposes of argument, that there should be any judicial appointees of Executive Branch prosecutors. 
   This bill would allow judges to appoint the very Executive Branch prosecutors practicing before them, and would raise legal, ethical and practical concerns. Surely we could have done better than return to a flawed law of the past. 
   The rush to legislation also led to an under-considered amendment adopted at committee mark-up. That amendment would preclude the use of the full range of tried and true tools in the Vacancy Reform Act to obtain interim U.S. Attorneys. 
   Specifically, it would preclude the President from reaching out to Senate-confirmed, Presidential appointees serving in other capacities, rather than just career civil servants, to serve in these important posts on an interim basis. 
   The amendment limits the pool of qualified individuals to serve temporarily as U.S. Attorneys, so it weakens the federal government's ability to fight crime. 
   In these times of the War on Terror and the continuing, age-old war on crime, the service of U.S. Attorneys--the front line of federal law enforcement--is more than ever a matter of first importance to the Nation. Their appointment is serious business. 
   We should not have rushed to judgment in attending to this business, but instead have given the legislative process the time that it deserves. 
   We have missed an opportunity to improve this bill. The American people have not been well-served.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 5349, which extends the Protect America Act for 21 days. Another extension is unacceptable and unnecessary. 
   Last August, Congress enacted the Protect America Act to close a dangerous loophole in our ability to collect foreign intelligence. The Democratic majority insisted on an arbitrary 6-month sunset. But instead of using that time wisely, they ignored the needs of our intelligence community and passed a partisan, unworkable bill, the RESTORE Act. Then, 2 weeks ago, the House Democratic majority insisted on another extension. Again they squandered the last 2 weeks. Now House Democrats want more time. But their time is up. 
   We know from Admiral McConnell, Director of National Intelligence, that before Congress enacted the Protect America Act, the intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications, endangering American lives. 
   Some in Congress are willing to let the Protect America Act expire because ongoing surveillance under the act can continue for up to a year. This might be acceptable if the terrorist threat also expired this weekend, but it doesn't. If the act expires, we will return to the status quo, unable to begin any new foreign intelligence surveillance without a court order, again threatening America's counterterrorism efforts. 
   Another extension represents a failure by the House Democratic majority to protect the American people. The Senate understands this. The intelligence community needs a long-term bill to fix gaps in our intelligence laws, not a 21-day extension. 
   The Senate bill addresses the concerns of our intelligence community and has strong bipartisan support. But House Democrats are at war with themselves and at odds with the American people. House Democrats disagree with the Senate Democrats and House Democrats disagree among themselves. One group wants to approve the bipartisan Senate bill and another opposes it. 
   Americans are tired of this kind of partisanship in Washington. Now we have partisanship within partisanship within the Democratic Party. House Democrats disagree among themselves, disagree with Democrats in the Senate, and oppose a bipartisan bill that passed yesterday with overwhelming support by a vote of 68-29. 
   The House Democratic leadership is like a clock that runs backwards. They keep going in counterclockwise circles to the left. Unfortunately, we can't turn the clock back on terrorists. We must act to gather intelligence on terrorists and prevent another attack. 
   Why do we keep delaying our ability to protect American lives? Another extension represents a failure to act, a failure to lead, and a failure to protect our country. It doesn't take long to do what is right. Let's stop the stalling and pass the bipartisan Senate bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject this extension and urge the Democratic leadership to allow the House to consider the bipartisan Senate bill.

Yesterday, the Senate approved its bipartisan FISA bill by an overwhelming majority of 68-29. The Senate bill addresses the concerns of our intelligence community and has strong bipartisan support. 
   The intelligence community needs a long-term fix to gaps in our intelligence laws now, not 21 days from now. What message does it send that we lack confidence in our intelligence community? Why are we making ourselves vulnerable to those who want to hurt us? Spies and terrorists don't operate by deadlines and sunsets. Neither should our intelligence laws. 
   We cannot allow the Protect America Act to expire and return to the status quo, unable to begin any new foreign surveillance. The time to act is now. Another extension represents a failure by the House Democratic majority to protect the American people. 
   We should reject this extension and urge the Democratic leadership to allow the House to consider the Senate bill, which has majority support in the House.

I hope the gentleman will withdraw his point of order and allow us to take a vote on a bill supported by both parties in the Senate, the administration, and many Democrats in the House.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am glad we are considering this timely legislation tonight, H.R. 1777, the Need-Based Educational Aid Act of 2008. I also want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt) for his tireless efforts in promoting this legislation, and also for his leadership, because if it were not for his leadership, we would not be here tonight considering this important bill. It was good working with him and I appreciate the success that he has had in getting us to this point. This issue has long been of interest to me personally as well. I also sponsored the bill that extended the exemption in 1997 and 2001. 
   Beginning in the mid-1950s, a number of private colleges and universities agreed to award financial aid solely on the basis of demonstrated need. These schools also agreed to use common criteria to assess each student's financial need and to give the same financial aid award to students admitted to more than one member of that group of schools. In the 1950s to the late 1980s, the practice continued. 
   In 1989, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice brought suit against nine of the colleges. After extensive litigation, the parties entered into a consent decree in 1991 that all but ended the practice. In 1992, Congress passed the first exemption to the antitrust laws for these colleges as part of the Higher Education Amendments. That temporary exemption codified the settlement and allowed colleges to provide aid on the basis of need only, to use common criteria to determine need, to use a common financial aid application form, and to allow the exchange of the student's financial information through a third party. 
   In 1994, Congress extended this exemption as section 568 of the Improving America's Schools Act. Congress has extended the exemption twice since 1994, in 1997 and 2001. Twenty-seven schools currently are members of the so-called Presidents' Group which utilizes this antitrust exemption. Several other colleges, including Yale and Harvard, participate as advisory members of the group. This exemption expires on September 30, 2008. 
   Common treatment of these types of issues makes sense and, to my knowledge, there are no complaints about the existing exemption. In fact, a recent GAO study of the exemption found that there had been no abuse of the exemption and stated that there had not been an increase in the cost of tuition as a result of the exemption. The Antitrust Modernization Commission studied this exemption and found that it provides ``limited immunity for limited conduct.'' That is, it is narrowly tailored to meet its goals of promoting access to need-based financial aid. 
   This bill would make the exemption passed in 1992, 1994, 1997, and 2001 permanent. It would not make any change to the substance of the exemption itself. The need-based financial aid system serves worthy goals that the antitrust laws do not adequately address, namely, making financial aid available to the broadest number of students solely on the basis of demonstrated need. No student who is otherwise qualified should be denied the opportunity to go to one of the colleges involved because of the limited financial means of his or her family. This bill helps protect need-based aid and need-blind admissions. 
   Mr. Speaker, the last time the House considered a permanent extension of this antitrust exemption, it passed by a vote of 414-0. The bill is supported by the American Association of Community Colleges, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, the National Association for Independent Colleges and Universities, the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, and the Presidents' Group. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as well.  
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Mr. Delahunt for his work on this legislation and for getting us to the point where it is being considered tonight. 
   With that, I will yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (COMMEMORATING THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill commemorates the 40th anniversary of the tragic assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was the leader of a historic, nonviolent revolution in the U.S. Over the course of his life he fought for equal justice and led the Nation towards racial harmony. 
   While advancing this great movement, Dr. King's home was bombed, and he was subjected to relentless personal and physical abuse. Despite this violence, Dr. King responded in peace  with strong conviction and sound reason. And as a preacher, Dr. King's religious beliefs were essential to the success of his nonviolent efforts. It is doubtful that such a long and enduring movement of peace could have survived in the face of such violence without the power of religious inspiration behind it. 
   From 1957 to 1968, Dr. King traveled over 6 million miles and spoke over 2,500 times about justice and equal freedom under the law. 
   On August 28, 1963, Dr. King led a peaceful march of 250,000 people through the streets of Washington, D.C. And it is here, in this city, where he delivered a speech that spoke for all Americans, regardless of the color of their skin. In his ``I Have a Dream'' speech, Dr. King called the march the ``greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation,'' and he was right. 
   ``I have a dream,'' he said, ``that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.'' 
   Dr. King not only lived the American dream, but he opened that same door of opportunity for millions of Americans. He lived for the causes of justice and equality. 
   On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his hotel room in Memphis, Tennessee, Dr. King was assassinated. But a single vicious act could not extinguish Dr. King's legacy, which endures to this day. And America is a better, freer Nation because of his legacy. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (ARTS REQUIRE TIMELY SERVICE (ARTS) ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) for his generous comments a while ago, and I certainly appreciated working with him on this bill as well. 
   Performing arts organizations use O and P visas to bring many talented foreign artists to our country to perform  before American audiences. Despite the fact that the Immigration Nationality Act provides that the Department of Homeland Security shall adjudicate O and P visas within 14 days, adjudication of up to 180 days has been reported. These long delays create the risk that performances involving international artists must be cancelled, creating high economic risks to arts institutions and the local economies they support. 
   Henry Fogel, President of the American Symphony Orchestra League, has stated that, ``nonprofit arts organizations confront long waits and uncertainty in gaining approval for visa petitions for foreign guest artists. This degree of uncertainty can prove too risky for many performing arts organizations and is having a direct impact on their ability to present foreign guest artists. Orchestras must sell tickets in advance, creating a financial obligation to their audiences. Performances are date, time and location specific, and the nature of scheduling, booking and confirming highly sought after guest soloists and performing groups requires that the timing of the visa process be efficient and reliable.'' 
   The INA does provide that the Department of Homeland Security can charge a fee of $1,000 to provide premium processing for employment-based visa petitions, adjudication within 15 days. However, many nonprofit arts organizations cannot afford to pay this extra amount either because they are a small, cash-strapped institution, or because they sponsor many foreign artists over a year's time. The Arts Required Timely Service, ARTS, Act provides that if a nonprofit organization's petition for an O visa or for a P visa is not adjudicated within 30 days, it will receive premium processing free of charge. 
   I support this bill. And I want to thank the chairman and Mr. Berman for their bipartisan amendment in committee that clarified that only arts organizations that are qualified as tax exempt under 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code can receive the fee waiver, and that organizations petitioning for athletes do not qualify for this waiver. 
   Mr. King, the gentleman from Iowa and the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, offered a number of amendments in the Judiciary Committee markup of this bill. For example, one provided that only small and nonprofit arts organizations should be eligible for the fee waiver. These amendments would have, in fact, improved the bill. Unfortunately, they were not adopted. 
   On the whole, however, this is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the debate on H.R. 2, the ``Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007,'' would benefit from a discussion of the facts. 
   For example, increasing the minimum wage would not have a positive impact on all working and non-working Americans. 
   The number of people who would benefit from raising the minimum wage is not nearly as large as some claim and those individuals who receive the minimum wage are not nearly as poor as some suggest. 
   According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2005 only 2.5 percent of all hourly-paid workers earned the minimum wage. More than a quarter of those workers are teenagers and half are under 25. 
   Those who support a minimum wage increase should be forthright--some Americans will lose their jobs if the minimum wage is increased, especially youth and low-skilled workers. If the minimum wage is raised, businesses will incur additional costs and some will be forced to layoff employees. 
   Also, most individuals who receive the minimum wage have other sources of income, such as food stamps, government allowances, or earned income tax credits. 
   Still, we are confronted with the stark reality that over one million families must survive on little more than $1,000 a month. These families need food, clothes, housing, transportation, and hope. 
   Frankly, any person who engages in honest labor deserves a worthy wage and a dignified life. 
   Some say there are jobs Americans won't do. That demeans hard-working Americans who do work in every occupation. It especially demeans those who work at back-breaking and dangerous jobs for little pay. If we want more Americans to take those jobs, then let's pay them more. 
   And today is a good time to start.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (RYAN HAIGHT ONLINE PHARMACY CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, America is no stranger to the plague of illegal drugs and drug addiction. For decades, Congress has fought to curb the flow of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and marijuana into our country. 
   Today, America is facing a new threat--prescription drug abuse. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, prescription drugs now rank second--only behind marijuana--as America's drug of choice. 
   The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that as many as 7 million Americans are addicted to prescription drugs--more than the number of cocaine and heroin addicts combined. 
   Today, prescription painkillers cause a higher number of overdose-related deaths than cocaine or heroin. And large quantities of these drugs are just a few mouse clicks away. The dangers posed by illegal online pharmacies are real. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse reports a 542-percent increase in abuse of prescription opiates among 12- to 17-year olds between 1992 and 2002. 
   Hundreds of rogue online pharmacies peddle these highly-addictive painkillers to adults and teenagers without a valid prescription. The most popular of these drugs is commonly known as Vicodin. 
   Teenagers are fast becoming addicted to prescription painkillers, in large part because of their availability on the Internet. The Partnership for a Drug Free America reports that every day, 2,500 teenagers use a prescription drug to get high for the first time. Teenagers are abusing prescription drugs at a higher rate because they perceive them as less dangerous than illegal drugs. 
   Today, the House has the opportunity to put a stop to illegal online pharmacies. I am pleased to join Congressman Bart Stupak and Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack as an original sponsor of H.R. 6353, the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008. 
   On February 12, 2001, Ryan Haight died of an overdose of Vicodin. He was just 18. An investigation into his death revealed that Ryan ordered the drugs from a doctor he had never seen and who had never examined him. The drugs were shipped directly to his home by an online pharmacy. 
   This legislation amends the Controlled Substances Act to address the growing sale of prescription drugs by these so-called online pharmacies. The bill prohibits the sale or distribution of all controlled substances via the Internet without a valid prescription and requires online pharmacies to display information identifying the business and any pharmacy and doctor associated with the Web site. The bill also provides tough penalties for the illegal sale of prescription drugs. 
   Legislation sponsored by Senators Feinstein and Sessions unanimously passed the Senate in April. It is time for the House to do the same. 
   This legislation represents months of hard work and bipartisan negotiations by House and Senate Republicans and Democrats. I wish to thank my House colleagues, Mr. Stupak and Mrs. Bono Mack and my Senate colleagues, Senators Feinstein and Sessions, for their efforts to complete this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Associated Press is one of the largest and most influential news organizations in the world. It serves thousands of newspapers, radio stations and TV outlets. Americans expect the AP to be fair and unbiased in its reporting. Unfortunately, all too often it has fallen short. 
   For example, a comparison of AP news stories following the announcement of each vice presidential running mate shows that while dozens of AP stories characterized Governor Sarah Palin as ``conservative,'' only three described Senator Biden as ``liberal,'' even though the National Journal ranked him as the third most liberal Member of the U.S. Senate. 
   This is one example of a much larger media slant problem. In interviews, articles and news analysis, the media have grilled one side and coddled the other. The American people want the media to apply the same rules to both political parties in this election.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (OBSERVING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I strongly support H. Res. 61, which observes and celebrates the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr., and encourages the people of the United States to celebrate his life and legacy. 
   We should all thank Dr. King not only for his role in helping to end discrimination, but also for his role in helping to remove a stain on American history that had lingered far too long. 
   Dr. King's commitment to nonviolent change never wavered. Between the time he assumed leadership of the Montgomery, AL, bus boycott in 1955, until his tragic assassination years later, Dr. King faced hundreds of death threats and a firebombing of his home with his wife and children inside. Still, he remained an unblinking beacon to all those who sought peaceful change. He grew from a person taught in segregated schools to a world leader who was awarded the Nobel Prize. 
   Dr. King delivered his now famous speech entitled ``I Have a Dream'' following a march of 250,000 people in Washington, DC. Twenty years ago, the City of San Antonio's Martin Luther King, Jr., Commission began honoring Dr. King with a march that furthers his legacy and serves to educate local citizens regarding his deep, rich legacy. That march has become one of the largest in the country and this march marked its own 20th anniversary yesterday, the day Dr. King would have turned 78. 
   Despite near freezing temperatures, the San Antonio march attracted thousands of people of diverse backgrounds, which in the past has featured Rosa Parks, the woman who sparked the modern civil rights movement by refusing to sit at the back of the bus. Those in the march knew that no matter what the weather, it paled in comparison to the slings and arrows--the death threats and beatings, and the repeated arrests--Dr. King faced during his too-short but immensely inspiring life. 
   Such peaceful marches are possible today in large part because of Dr. King's abiding courage. The San Antonio march serves as a powerful reminder that if one person finds the strength to keep walking forward, determined to reach what Dr. King called the ``Promised Land,'' he or she can leave in their wake a lasting legacy of marches--stretching from generation to generation--that celebrate and encourage changes in both laws and attitudes that will continue to make America a better place.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I oppose this legislation because it is clearly unconstitutional. While the bill may be well-intentioned, as Members of Congress, we swear an oath to support our Constitution. We cannot gloss over its deficiencies. 
   At the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill, Professor Jonathan Turley, someone the majority consults frequently for his views, said, ``Permit me to be blunt, I consider this act to be the most premeditated unconstitutional act by Congress in decades.'' 
   Supporters of this bill claim Congress owes the authority to enact this bill under a broad reading of the so-called District Clause in Article I, section 8. However, Article I, section 2 says, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States.'' Since D.C. is not a State, it cannot have a voting Member in the House. 
   This was an issue that was clearly raised, debated and rejected by the Founding Fathers. Alexander Hamilton offered an amendment to the Constitution during the New York ratification convention that would have allowed Congress to provide the District with congressional representation, but his amendment was rejected by the convention on July 22, 1788. 
   More recently in 2000, a Federal district court here in D.C. spoke on the issue, stating, ``We conclude from our analysis of the text that the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve as a State for purposes of the apportionment of congressional representatives.'' 
   The House Judiciary Committee has already spoken on this point as well in the 95th Congress. Under the leadership of Democratic Chairman Peter Rodino, the Judiciary Committee reported out a constitutional amendment to do what this bill purports to be able to do by statute. The report accompanying that constitutional amendment stated the following, ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is essential; statutory action alone will not suffice.'' 
   Congress passed that constitutional amendment in 1978, but it failed to get the approval of three-quarters of the States over a 7-year period. In fact, only 16 of the 38 States required for its ratification supported the amendment. 
   So what is being attempted by the legislation before us today is something long recognized as requiring a constitutional amendment that the vast majority of States have already failed to approve. Proponents of this legislation cite a 1949 Supreme Court case called Tidewater, but the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a report analyzing that case. It concluded that ``at least six of the Justices who participated in what appears to be the most relevant Supreme Court case, National Mutual Insurance Co. of the District of Columbia v. Tidewater Transfer Co., authored opinions rejecting the proposition that Congress's power under the District Clause was sufficient to effectuate structural changes to the political structures of the Federal Government. 
   ``Further, the remaining three judges, who found that Congress could grant diversity jurisdiction to District of Columbia citizens despite the lack of such jurisdiction in Article III, specifically limited their opinion to instances where there was no extension of anymore fundamental right,'' such as the right to vote for a Member of Congress.     
   The unconstitutional approach of this bill is completely unnecessary. Most of the District of Columbia, other than a few Federal buildings, could simply be returned to the State of Maryland. That process of retrocession is clearly allowed by the Constitution. It would grant representation to those in Washington D.C., by a simple majority vote, and they would then have representation in both the House and Senate, an improvement over this bill that limits representation only to the House. 
   Any discrepancies regarding the number of electorates granted to D.C. by the 23rd amendment could easily be corrected through a constitutional amendment once D.C. Members were represented in Congress through retrocession. Madam Speaker, even conceding for purposes of argument the proponents' interpretation of the vast breadth of the District clause, this bill unfairly subjects many citizens to unequal treatment. 
   H.R. 1433 grants Utah an additional Representative that will run at-large or statewide. The at-large provision creates a situation this country has not seen since the development of the Supreme Court's line of cases affirming the principle of ``one man, one vote.'' 
   Under this provision, voters in Utah would be able to vote for two Representatives, their district representative and the at-large representative, whereas voters in every other State would only be able to vote for their one district representative. The result would be that Utah voters would have disproportionately more voting power compared to the voters of every other State. 
   There is no question D.C. residents have fought bravely in wars and served their country in a variety of ways. That is interesting, even heartrending, but irrelevant to whether or not this legislation is constitutional. 
   I also ask this House to consider the serious, practical consequences of passing this legislation. The inevitable legal challenge to this bill could produce legislative chaos by placing into doubt any future legislation passed in Congress by a one-vote margin. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill because it is clearly unconstitutional, and, if enacted, could lead to years of protracted legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, let me summarize the reasons we should oppose this legislation. D.C. is not a State, and the Constitution clearly limits representation in the House to States. 
   Supporters of this bill claim Congress has the authority to enact this bill under a broad reading of the so-called ``District clause'' in Article I, section 8 of the Constitution. However, Article I, section 2 clearly says, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' 
   The bill unfairly subjects many citizens to unequal treatment as well. H.R. 1433 grants Utah an additional Representative who will run statewide or at large. The at-large provision violates the principles of one man, one vote. Voters in Utah would be able to vote for two Representatives, their district Representative and their at-large Representative, whereas voters in every other State would only be able to vote for their one district Representative. The result would be that Utah voters will have disproportionately more voting power than the voters of every other State, and that, too, is clearly unconstitutional. 
   In 2000, the Federal District Court in D.C. itself stated, ``We conclude from our analysis of the text that the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve as a State for purposes of the apportionment of congressional representatives.'' 
   Furthermore, Madam Speaker, this unconstitutional approach is completely unnecessary. Most of the District of Columbia, other than a few Federal buildings, could simply be returned to the State of Maryland. That process of retrocession is clearly allowed by the Constitution. That process could grant representation in the House to those in Washington by a simple majority vote. D.C. voters could then be represented by both House and Senate Members, an improvement over the current legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, finally, and for many good reasons, the administration also opposes this legislation.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the motion to recommit I have offered contains a bipartisan proposal by Representatives Mike Ross and Mark Souder, the District of Columbia Personal Protection Act. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have suggested today that District of Columbia citizens have the right to vote in Congress. If that is the case, then they must also agree that the citizens of the District should have a constitutionally guaranteed right to possess firearms. 
   Currently, D.C. citizens are prevented from owning any handgun at all. Even those who lawfully own and store a rifle or shotgun are prohibited from using them to defend themselves, their families or their homes. 
   District law threatens honest people with imprisonment if they unlock, assemble or load their guns even under attack. Although the District has the most stringent gun control laws in the Nation, they still suffer from one of the highest murder rates. Since January 1 of this year alone, 35 people have been murdered in the District. Last year over 150 people were murdered, and 2,000 suffered gun assaults. 
   This violence continues unabated, despite the strict gun control laws. It is time to restore the rights of law-abiding citizens to protect themselves and to defend their families. 
   On March 9, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit struck down some, but not all, of the District of Columbia's gun control laws as unconstitutional. The court agreed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Justice Department and constitutional scholars, present and past, that the second amendment protects the right of individuals to possess firearms. This court decision, which will continue to wind its way through the judicial system, compels Congress to act now to protect all second amendment rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, the prohibition of firearms in the District of Columbia is as ineffective as it is unconstitutional. It is high time we rectify this wrong. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Souder), who in the last Congress passed a piece of legislation very similar to the motion to recommit that we consider now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule. 
   Yesterday, House Democrats said that Congress does not have enough time to pass critical FISA modernization legislation to keep America safe from foreign terrorists. Today, we are wasting Congress' time on an issue that does nothing to make our Nation safer. Clearly, the Democratic majority is out of touch with the needs of our intelligence community and is placing Americans' lives at risk. 
   On the eve of the expiration of critical intelligence legislation, the House Democratic majority has chosen to put extreme partisanship ahead of our country's safety. Apparently, the Democratic majority cares more about the alleged steroid use of a few baseball players and the personnel decisions of the White House than they do about promoting national security. 
   Last year, Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, warned Congress that the intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications, endangering Americans' lives. Congress enacted the Protect America Act to close this terrorist loophole. 
   Now House Democrats are going to let the Protect America Act expire. If the act expires, we will return to the status quo, unable to begin any new foreign intelligence surveillance without a court order and risk losing two-thirds of all foreign intelligence. 
   Today we find ourselves at two very dangerous thresholds: first, expiration of legislation vital to this Nation's national security, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House Democratic majority has let this legislation lapse without even allowing a straight up-or-down vote on the bipartisan Senate bill approved earlier this week by a vote of 68-29. Instead of reauthorizing FISA, the Democratic majority chooses to take us to another threshold, that of a needless constitutional confrontation in the courts over the dismissal of a handful of United States Attorneys. 
   We know that the President has the authority to dismiss U.S. Attorneys. We know that his executive privilege claims are consistent with those made by previous Presidents for decades. We know that by tilting at the executive privilege windmill we risk severely undermining the very oversight authority we would want to protect. But most of all, we know that reauthorization of FISA is infinitely more important than this spat over executive privilege. 
   Once again, we see why Congress' approval rating is at an historic low. It's  because the Democratic majority engages in extreme partisanship and ignores the people's business. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1927, the Protect America Act of 2007. We are a Nation at war with foreign terrorists who are plotting deadly attacks. Al Qaeda recently released a video promising a big surprise in the near future. Yesterday, the Senate passed this national security bill, and the Senate got it right. It is time for the House to do the same. 
   This morning, the President called on the House to pass this critical bill, stating, ``Protecting America is our most solemn obligation, and I urge the House to pass this bill without delay.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, last night we wasted valuable time considering a bill on the same subject strongly opposed by the Director of National Intelligence. But that debate did serve a purpose. Now we know where the majority of the majority stands. Ninety percent of the majority voted to deny the Director of National Intelligence what he said he needs to prevent future terrorist attacks. 
   The majority claimed that its legislation fixed the problem, knowing that the Director had publicly opposed the bill because it would not allow him to carry out his responsibility of protecting the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment. 
   In the 30 years since Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, telecommunications technology has dramatically changed. As a result, the intelligence community is hampered in gathering essential information about terrorists needed to prevent attacks against America. Congress must modernize FISA to address this problem. 
   The bill, one, clarifies well-established law that neither the Constitution nor Federal law requires a court order to gather foreign communications from foreign terrorists; two, adopts flexible procedures to collect foreign intelligence from foreign terrorists overseas; three, provides court review of collection procedures for this new authority; and, four, requires semiannual reports to Congress on the use of this new authority. 
   Unlike the majority's proposal from last night, this bill does not impose unworkable, bureaucratic requirements that would burden the intelligence community. Regrettably, the Protect America Act includes a 180-day sunset, but terrorists do not sunset their plots to kill Americans, so Congress must enact a permanent change in our laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, last April, the Director submitted to Congress a comprehensive proposal to modernize FISA. That proposal already should have been approved. Congress must enact the Director's proposals from April to give the intelligence community the additional tools they need to keep our country safe. 
   As we approach the sixth anniversary of the devastating 9/11 attacks, it is critical that we remain vigilant in our war against terrorism. President George Washington once said: ``There  is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to meet the enemy.'' Heeding his words, we must maintain our commitment to winning the war against terrorism. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

We know the best of intentions underly his desire and the desire of all Ethics Task Force members to enhance the integrity of the House of Representatives. 
   While this proposal is marginally improved over the first proposal, it still contains flaws that make it defective. The fundamental flaw of the proposal is that it fails to reform the House Ethics Committee itself. The creation of another ethics entity would be an admission of the failure of the Ethics Committee. 
   Americans rightly feel the ethics process simply does not work. They do not know when ethics investigations are started; they do not know the status of those investigations, and they do not know whether a partisan deadlock  has resulted in stalling an investigation forever. Americans need this knowledge, and that can only come through reforms to the Ethics Committee itself that will produce more bipartisanship and greater transparency. But the proposal before us simply adds another layer of bureaucracy on top of an already broken system. It creates an entirely new entity that invites yet more partisanship under clearly undemocratic procedures. 
   This country and the House of Representatives is founded on the principle of rule by majority; yet this proposal allows ethics inquiries to be initiated upon the request of only two out of the six board members. Furthermore, the proposal requires ethics investigations to go forward even when majority support among the board members cannot be obtained. This is undemocratic. 
   The resolution before us today is different from the original resolution and includes several changes. One amendment to the resolution now provides that the Speaker and minority leader will each nominate three members of the board with the concurrence of the other. Even under such a system, three board members will have been selected by the leader of a partisan political party. 
   Another amendment would provide that an investigation be terminated unless three board members affirmatively voted to proceed with an investigation. But if one board member nominated by the Speaker and one board member nominated by the minority leader agreed to initiate an investigation, but upon further review either board member decides the matter should be dismissed, the investigation can still proceed with the support of only those board members nominated either by the Speaker or the minority leader. 
   Not only does this resolution retain the undemocratic nature of the resolution, it also allows investigations to go forward on a purely partisan 3-3 vote. This is an open invitation to a partisan free-for-all. As a recent editorial in Roll Call stated bluntly, ``We don't deny it's a gamble.'' 
   Under this proposal, many Members who deserve better could have their reputations unfairly diminished. A recent editorial in The Hill newspaper entitled ``Leaking Ethics'' focused on this point. It said, ``All it takes is one source to say the Ethics Committee may launch a probe into a Member and that lawmaker's reputation will be forever damaged whether he or she is guilty or innocent.'' 
   Whether this resolution passes or not, Congress will survive. But if it passes, Members should know there is an obvious danger the ethics process will become even more partisan and that innocent Members will be hurt. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the rule on the resolution which invites partisanship, undermines democracy, and poses unacceptable risk.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's program ``Reliable Sources,'' has strongly criticized the media's coverage of Senator BARACK OBAMA's breaking his promise that he would accept public campaign funds. 
   Last Sunday, Kurtz argued: ``All of these liberal commentators who have always supported campaign finance reform, getting big money out of politics, many of them are defending OBAMA. And I have to think the press is cutting him a break here.'' 
   Kurtz concluded the segment by saying, ``If George W. Bush had done this, blown off public financing as he considered doing during the 2004 campaign, there would be howls in the media about one candidate trying to buy an election.'' 
   A recent poll found that, by more than a 3-to-1 margin, voters believe the media favors Senator BARACK OBAMA over Senator JOHN MCCAIN. The media should report the facts, not slant the news.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (ADA AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the Americans with Disabilities Act, enacted almost 18 years ago, removed many physical barriers disabled people faced in their daily lives. It also helped remove the mental barriers that often prevented non-disabled Americans from looking beyond wheel chairs and walking canes and seeing disabled Americans as the friends and coworkers they are. 
   When the ADA was originally enacted in 1990, it was the result of bipartisan efforts in Congress. So I am pleased that various interested parties have been able to reach agreement on statutory language amending the ADA. 
   I support the compromise and believe it was reached in good faith. However, I do have some concerns regarding how the courts will interpret the legislative language we will consider today. 
   So let me express what I believe to be the nature and import of this legislation. 
   First, the common understanding in Congress is that this legislation would simply restore the original intent of the ADA by bringing the statutory text in line with the legislative history of the original ADA. 
   That legislative history from both the House Education and Labor and the Senate committee reports provided that ``[p]ersons with minor, trivial impairments such as a simple infected finger are not impaired in a major life activity,'' and consequently those who had such minor and trivial impairments would not be covered by the ADA. 
   I believe that understanding is entirely appropriate, and I would expect the courts to agree with and apply that interpretation. If that interpretation were not to hold but were to be broadened improperly the judiciary, an employer would be under a Federal obligation to accommodate people with stomach aches, a common cold, mild seasonal allergies, or even a hangnail. 
   So, I want to make clear that I believe that the drafters and supporters of this legislation, including me, intend to exclude minor and trivial impairments from coverage under the ADA, as they have always been excluded. 
   Second, the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing v. Williams held that under the original ADA, ``[t]he impairment's impact must also be permanent or long term.'' 
   The findings in the language before us today state that the purpose of the legislation is ``to provide a new definition of `substantially limits' to indicate that Congress intends to depart from the strict and demanding standard applied by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing.'' 
   I understand that this finding is not meant to express disagreement with or to overturn the Court's determination that the ADA apply only to individuals with impairments that are permanent or long term in impact. 
   If these understandings of the language before us today do not prevail, the courts may be flooded with frivolous cases brought by those who were not intended to be protected under the original ADA. 
   If that happens, those who would have been clearly covered under the original ADA, such as paralyzed veterans or the blind, will be forced to wait in line behind thousands of others filing cases regarding minor or trivial impairments. I don't believe anyone supporting this new language wants that to happen, and I want to make that clear for the record. 
   With the understandings I have expressed, I support the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This debate today is not about Republican or Democratic arguments. It is not about right or left ideology. It is simply about protecting our country, and it is about protecting American lives. This might be a good time to recall the story of the American soldiers who were killed in Iraq last May. When the U.S. military discovered that the soldiers had been kidnapped by terrorists, they launched a full scale search and rescue mission. 
   In the early hours of the operation, U.S. intelligence officials on the ground discovered a lead that required immediate electronic surveillance of telephone conversations. But the terrorist loophole, which requires a court order from Washington before conducting surveillance on a foreign target, prevented our intelligence officials from gathering information from almost 10 hours. 
   The body of one of the soldiers was later found in the Euphrates River. The terrorists claim to have executed the other two soldiers. 
   We will never know if that information could have saved the lives of our soldiers. But we do know that the terrorist loophole tied our hands then and perhaps is costing us lives now. 
   Prior to enactment of the Protect America Act, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, warned Congress that our intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications. Three weeks ago, the Protect America Act expired, and our intelligence community lost the tools they need to monitor terrorists overseas and protect Americans here at home. We may never recover the foreign intelligence lost because of Congress's inaction. 
   This intelligence might have given us information about terrorist plots or foreign espionage. I hope these missed opportunities will not lead to a terrorist attack in the United States or in other countries that could have been prevented. 
   We are now 27 days late and much intelligence short because of the Democratic leadership's refusal to consider the bipartisan Senate bill. If they had brought it to the floor 3 weeks ago, it would have passed easily; and America would be safer today. But rather than modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the Democrat majority's bill actually weakens it. 
   First, the Democrats' bill requires a court order before the government can begin surveillance of a foreign terrorist overseas. FISA has never required a court order to target foreigners overseas. As we saw in May, this causes significant delays in gathering foreign intelligence, placing Americans at risk. 
   Second, the Democrats' bill denies giving immunity to telecommunications providers who assisted the government following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The past  and future cooperation of these companies is essential to our national security. 
   Ninety-eight percent of America's communications technology is owned by private sector companies. We cannot conduct foreign surveillance without them. But if we continue to subject them to billion-dollar lawsuits, we risk losing their cooperation in the future. In fact, this bill is so flawed that the President has promised to veto it. Even more, Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, acknowledges that this legislation will never pass in the Senate. 
   Congress can and must do better than this bill. Our liberties, our security, and the future of our Nation depend on it. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this fatally flawed piece of legislation, and I ask the Democratic majority to bring the bipartisan Senate bill to the House floor for a vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, this might be a good time to read excerpts from a letter to the Speaker. This letter was written 2 days ago by the Attorney General and by the Director of National Intelligence, and I think Members and the American people are going to be very interested in what these two individuals had to say. 
   They expressed particular concern about requiring prior court approval to gather foreign intelligence from foreign targets located overseas. 
   The letter says: ``Congress did not include such a requirement when it passed the original FISA statute, and with good reason. These foreign targets have no right to any court review of such surveillance under our Constitution. We know from experience that requiring prior court approval is a formula for delay. Thus, this framework would impede vital foreign intelligence collection and put the Nation at unnecessary and greater risk.'' 
   They conclude about this bill that it does not provide the intelligence community the tools it needs to collect effectively foreign intelligence information vital for the security of the Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, H.R. 1592, for three reasons. First, the bill will result in disproportionate justice for crime victims who do not fall within the categories it contains. Second, it will have a chilling effect on religious freedom and first amendment rights. And third, it is probably unconstitutional and raises significant Federalism issues. 
   We can all agree that every violent crime is deplorable, regardless of its motivation. Every violent crime can be devastating not only to the victim, but also to the larger community whose public safety has been violated. That is why all violent crimes must be vigorously prosecuted. However, this bill, no matter how well intended, undermines basic principles of our criminal justice system. 
   Our criminal justice system has been built on the ideal of equal justice for all. Under this bill, justice will no longer be equal, but depend on the race, sex, sexual orientation, disability or status of the victim. It will allow different penalties to be imposed for the same crime. For example, criminals who kill a homosexual or transsexual will be punished more harshly than criminals who kill a police officer, a member of the military, a child, a senior citizen or any other person.     
   To me, all victims should have equal worth in the eyes of the law. In fact, in 1984, Congress, in a bipartisan manner, enacted the Sentencing Reform Act to ensure the consistent application of criminal penalties to avoid, ``unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct.'' 
   Why are we departing from the fairness embodied in that Act? Ordinarily, criminal law does not concern itself with motive, but rather with intent. 
   This legislation forces law enforcement officials to comb the offender's past to determine whether the offender ever expressed hostility toward a protected group. In addition, the bill raises the real possibility that religious leaders or members of religious groups could become the subject of a criminal investigation focusing on a suspect's religious beliefs, membership and religious organizations and any past statements made by a suspect. A chilling effect on religious leaders and others who, press their constitutionally protected beliefs, unfortunately, could result. 
   Some of my colleagues on the other side will claim that an amendment adopted during committee markup protects religious speech. However, it would not diminish the chilling effect of possible involvement in criminal investigations. Religious speakers and groups will feel in greater jeopardy as a result of this bill. 
   The facts of the Supreme Court decision in Wisconsin v. Mitchell underscore the danger of this legislation. In that case, Todd Mitchell received an enhanced hate crime sentence because of remarks he made to prior to others attacking a teenager because of his race. Mitchell did not participate in the physical assault of the teenager. His sentence was upheld. He was punished for his words. 
   My colleagues on the other side have argued that no prosecutor would ever subject members of a religious community to the criminal process. Are we willing to take the risk and leave the first amendment protections to a prosecutor's discretion? 
   I also believe the bill itself is probably unconstitutional and will likely be struck down by the courts. There is little evidence to support the claim that hate crimes impact interstate or foreign commerce, an important consideration for any Federal court reviewing the constitutionality of this legislation. 
   In 2000, the Supreme Court in the United States v. Morrison struck down a prohibition on gender-motivated violence. In that case, the court specifically warned Congress that the commerce clause does not apply to noneconomic violent criminal conduct that does not cross State lines, nor does the proposed legislation authorized under the 14th and 15th amendments. Those amendments only extend to State action and do not cover the actions of private persons who commit violent crimes. 
   While the 13th amendment reaches private conduct such as individual criminal conduct, it is difficult to argue that one's sexual orientation, disability or gender identity constitutes a badge and incidence of slavery. Aside from the constitutional defects of this bill, it purports to federalize crimes that are being effectively prosecuted by our States and local governments. 
   FBI statistics show that the incidence of so-called hate crimes has actually declined over the last 10 years. Only six of approximately 15,000 homicides in the Nation involved hate crimes. 
   As the Washington Post stated in a previous editorial, ``Rape, murder and assault--no matter what prejudice motivates the perpetrator--are presumptively local matters in which the Federal Government should intervene only when it has a pressing interest. The fact that hatred lurks behind a violent incident is not, in our view, an adequate Federal interest .....'' 
   Unfortunately we cannot legislate away the hatred that some feel in their hearts. We need fewer labels and more unity in our country. For all the reasons I have mentioned above, I oppose the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is straightforward. It seeks to protect America's senior citizens and those who serve in our Armed Forces. 
   My colleagues on the other side contend that a new law is needed to cover crimes against persons based on race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and disability. The motion to recommit makes sure that seniors and our military personnel are added to the list of protected groups. 
   We all care greatly about the safety and security of our senior citizens. We all understand that they are particularly vulnerable to crime. Criminals who prey on our senior citizens because they are senior citizens should be vigorously prosecuted and punished. 
   The statistics paint a disturbing picture of violence against senior citizens in our country. A recent Justice Department study found that each year over the last 10 years, for every 1,000 persons over 65, four are violently assaulted. This includes rape, sexual assault, robbery and aggravated assaults. Approximately 65 percent of these crimes against senior citizens are committed by strangers or casual acquaintances. In my hometown, the San Antonio police report rising crime against the elderly, with over 6,200 crimes just this last year. 
   We were all horrified by the recent videotaped robbery in New York City committed against 101-year-old Rose Morat. Rose was leaving her building to go to church when a robber, who pretended to help her through the vestibule, turned and delivered three hard punches to her face and grabbed her purse. He pushed her and her walker to the ground. Rose suffered a broken cheekbone and was hospitalized. The robber got away with $33 and her house keys. Police believe the same man robbed an 85-year-old woman shortly after beating Rose. 
   These are horrible crimes that strike fear into the hearts of America's senior citizens and make them wonder whether they will be victimized next. 
   This motion to recommit also adds the category of current or former members of the Armed Forces to the list of groups in this bill. We honor our men and women of the military because of their patriotism, their commitment to protecting our freedom and their service to our country. In times of controversy surrounding the use of our military, we have seen unfortunate acts by those who use their hostility towards the military to further their political agenda. 
   With the rising debate over the Iraq war, we are seeing increasing threats to Iraqi war veterans. Recently, a Syracuse woman pleaded guilty to spitting in the face of a Fort Drum soldier at an airport. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to make it clear to everyone that we honor our veterans and current members of our Armed Forces. Congress can make the message clear that hate of our Armed Forces will be punished at a heightened level, just like the other groups under this act. 
   If Congress rejects this motion to recommit, who will explain to the thousands of victims who are senior citizens or military victims that their injuries are less important than those of others protected under the hate crimes law? Are we really prepared to tell seniors and our men and women in uniform across our country that crimes committed against victims because of race, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability are, as a rule, more worthy of punishment than those committed against seniors and military personnel? 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF EFFECTIVE STATE-BASED ALCOHOL REGULATION -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is more symbolic than substantive. It will not  change the way the alcohol industry distributes their products, and it will not change the way States regulate alcohol distribution. But regrettably, it does celebrate the ``successful system of alcoholic beverage regulation, distribution and sale.'' 
   My opposition is not a reflection on those who support this resolution; it is just that I am uneasy about Congress considering a resolution with this purpose. 
   Certainly, the alcoholic beverage industry is a legitimate one. I have hardworking business owners in my district who create jobs and pay taxes. Most brewers, distributors and retailers try to ensure that alcohol is made, transported and sold in a safe and legal manner. However, the abuse of alcohol causes incalculable pain and suffering. It has cost thousands of lives, devastated families, and ruined the mental and physical health of many Americans. For the same reason, I would voice concerns about a resolution celebrating the ``successful distribution'' of cigarettes and tobacco products. 
   According to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, alcohol ranks as a leading cause of death among young people age 10 to 24 due to motor vehicle crashes, unintentional injuries, homicide and suicide. Vehicle accidents have become the number one cause of death for teens in the U.S., over one-third are alcohol related. 
   And although States have passed laws to prevent individuals from driving while under the influence of alcohol, a huge number of alcohol-related deaths occur on roads across the Nation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that last year drunk driving killed almost 13,000 people. 
   I do appreciate efforts of the alcoholic beverage industry, small businesses and distributors to keep alcohol out of the hands of minors. However, reports tell us that 33 percent of 12th graders still drink beer on at least a monthly basis and over 70 percent say that beer is easy to get. 
   When Congress can attest that alcohol is no longer easily accessible to teens, that alcohol no longer contributes to 13,000 accident deaths each year, and that alcohol no longer devastates families and individuals, then a resolution celebrating the ``successful distribution'' of alcohol might be in order. Until then, I continue to have concerns with this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the ``Second Chance Act of 2007.'' I commend Chairman CONYERS, Crime Subcommittee Chairman SCOTT, along with Ranking Member Mr. FORBES, and Representatives CHRIS CANNON, DANNY DAVIS, HOWARD COBLE, and STEPHANIE TUBBS-JONES for their commitment to the issue of prisoner re-entry. 
   I also want to thank Minority Whip ROY BLUNT for his tireless dedication to this legislation. Congressman BLUNT and his staff devoted countless hours to bicameral and bipartisan negotiations to reach a consensus on this important legislation. The new bill, which is modeled on prior versions, is an excellent example of bipartisan cooperation on important criminal justice matters. 
   This bill represents a common sense approach to addressing the problems posed by prisoner reentry. 
   President Bush stated in his 2004 State of the Union address: ``We know from long experience that if [former prisoners] can't find work, or a home, or help, they are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison....... America is the land of the second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.'' 
   The Second Chance Act of 2007 implements the President's initiative. 
   I believe in tough enforcement of our criminal laws. Public safety is essential to a free society, and criminals must be aggressively prosecuted and incarcerated to protect our communities. However, once criminals are incarcerated, we have an obligation to make sure they are rehabilitated and treated humanely.  
   The Second Chance Act creates a framework of strategic policy innovations to provide effective re-entry services. 
   The demand for innovative solutions is obvious--it is conservatively estimated that approximately 650,000 inmates will be released from State prisons in the next year. In the absence of action, 67 percent of these individuals will be rearrested and over half will return to prison in the 3 years following their release from prison. States are being crushed by an overwhelming financial burden of correctional costs. 
   We need to help State and local governments implement innovative programs to ease the transition for offenders, to bring families together once again, and to make sure that offenders get the necessary support so that they can truly have a second chance to live a law-abiding life. 
   Successful reentry protects those who might otherwise be crime victims. It also improve the likelihood that individuals released from prison, jail or juvenile detention facilities can pay fines, fees, restitution, and provide family support. 
   The Second Chance Act expands existing demonstration programs to improve coordination among service providers, supervision services and re-entry task forces, and between State substance abuse agencies and criminal justice agencies. The Act also strengthens reentry services and authorizes grants to operate State and local reentry courts, and to establish local re-entry task forces to develop comprehensive reentry plans during each phase of transition--from incarceration, to transitional housing, to release in the community. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today is day 11 without the Protect America Act and so our Nation continues to be at greater risk of attack from terrorists. 
   Yesterday I submitted an amendment to the Rules Committee to attach the Senate-passed FISA bill to H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. House Democrats once again refused to bring this commonsense, bipartisan bill to the floor for a straight up-or-down vote. 
   Last year, Admiral McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, warned Congress that the intelligence community was missing two-thirds of all overseas terrorist communications, further endangering American lives. Congress enacted the Protect America Act to close this loophole for terrorists. 
   The Senate, working with the administration, drafted legislation to modernize FISA and give our intelligence agencies a long-term law under which they could operate. It has been 2 weeks since the Senate overwhelmingly approved their bill by a vote of 68-29. We should vote on it immediately to better protect American lives. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also oppose H.R. 5351, the Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation Tax Act of 2008. H.R. 5351 contains some beneficial provisions, such as creating incentives to make energy efficiency improvements to new and existing homes and extending tax credits to encourage the production of alternative forms of energy. But while it is well and good to encourage alternative energy development, Congress should not do so by damaging our domestic oil and gas industry.     
   According to the Department of Energy, in 2006 all renewable energy sources provided only 6 percent of the U.S. domestic energy supply. In contrast, oil and natural gas provided 58 percent of our domestic energy supply. The numbers don't lie. Oil and natural gas fuel our economy and sustain our way of life. 
   Furthermore, almost 2 million Americans are directly employed in the oil and natural gas industry. Punishing one of our Nation's most important industries does not constitute a national energy policy. 
   The answer to lowering gas prices and reducing our dependence on foreign oil is not to remove $17.6 billion in tax incentives from the oil and gas industry. The answer is to utilize our domestic resources, including ANWR. 
   According to former Interior Secretary Gale Norton, ``ANWR would supply every drop of petroleum for Florida for 29 years, New York for 34 years, California for 16 years, or New Hampshire for 315 years.'' It could also supply Washington, D.C. for 1,710 years. 
   The answer is also to build new refineries and to develop more nuclear energy, as most European and Asian countries have already done. But no  new major refinery has been built in the United States in the past 15 years. And no new nuclear facility has received a construction license in the United States for 30 years, even though safe technology is now available. 
   Mr. Speaker, instead of penalizing the oil and gas industry, Congress should pass real energy reform, expand domestic exploration of oil and gas, build more refineries, and construct more nuclear facilities.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (MEDIA FAIRNESS INITIATIVE: MEDIA DONATIONS FAVOR DEMOCRATS -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the story of the 2008 election is being told by a partisan media. If you have any doubt, just follow the money. 
   An analysis by Investor's Business Daily shows that journalists contributed 15 times more money to Democrats than Republicans during this election cycle. While 235 journalists donated to Democrats, just 20 gave to Republicans, a margin of more than 10-1. And journalists who gave to Senator Obama outnumbered those who contributed to Senator McCain by a 20-1 margin. No wonder nearly seven in 10 Americans say the media wants Senator Obama to win the election, according to a recent poll. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to promote fairness and objectivity in journalism. Only then we will restore Americans' faith in the media.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (RELIGIOUS WORKER VISA EXTENSION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), who is the ranking member of the Immigration Subcommittee, for yielding. 
   I am happy to have played a part in the creation of the Religious Worker Immigrant Visa Program back in 1990. These visas enable American religious denominations, large and small, to benefit from committed religious workers from other countries. 
   However, I have also long been concerned about the high level of fraud that has been evident in this visa program. Like Mr. King, I feel regulations can only go so far in preventing fraud and we do need additional statutory changes in the program. 
   The Office of Fraud Detection and National Security at the Department of Homeland Security has conducted a Fraud Benefit Assessment. It found that of 220 religious worker visa cases selected at random, 33 percent had ``a finding of fraud,'' the highest of any visa program. 
   Fraud involves everything from bogus churches and bogus jobs to ``religious workers'' who are found driving taxis soon after they arrive here. 
   So I especially appreciate the steps that the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, has taken to address these concerns. She agreed that we would extend the expiring religious worker green cards for 7 years as long as the Department of Homeland Security issues long-needed regulations to address some types of fraud. In addition, she agreed to have the Inspector General complete a report on the effectiveness of the anti-fraud regulations. The Inspector General also will conduct an audit to determine to what extent religious workers continue to work for the religious institutions that sponsor them. 
   Madam Speaker, although the bill does not contain all of the provisions I would have liked, I want to express my thanks to Ms. Zoe Lofgren for her comity in drafting this legislation, which I support.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, I would like to say to my colleagues that beginning last night in the early evening and continuing and extending to this morning, a number of us have been in touch with each other about the provisions of this bill with the hope and expectation that we might be able to resolve our differences. I have been in touch with the White House. I have been in touch with the principal sponsors of the legislation; and I think we had engaged in some good-faith efforts to try to, as I say, resolve our differences. 
   Specifically, I had been hopeful that the other side would accept some of the provisions that had been in an amendment that I had hoped to offer today. Unfortunately, that amendment was not allowed by the Rules Committee. So Members of the House are not going to be able to vote on that amendment, which, in my judgment, would have improved the bill. There were a couple of provisions in that amendment, though, that I thought would be of interest to the sponsors of the bill and to the other side, and I regret that we were not able to come to a meeting of the minds, because I think that would have improved the bill and also yielded a better result when the bill perhaps becomes law.  
   Mr. Speaker, I also want to say to my colleagues that, if anything, I have a sympathy for the media, for the press. Long ago and far away, I was a newspaper reporter and spent 2 years writing articles, and so I have stood in the shoes of those who are reporters today. After being a reporter for a couple of years, I went to law school; and while in law school I actually wrote an article for the Texas Bar Journal called ``Politicians Versus the Press: Libel in Texas,'' and I actually came down on the side of the press. So that is where my sympathies lie. 
   However, in the case of this bill, I am afraid I cannot support it. And because we were not able to reach a compromise on the bill, I remain opposed to the bill, the White House remains opposed to the bill, the Director of National Intelligence remains opposed to the bill, and the Department of Justice remains opposed to the bill. Unfortunately, it is still so flawed that we cannot support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, a free press strengthens democracy. In our Nation the first amendment of the Constitution guarantees the press their freedom to report. And for 200 years in this Nation, the press, in fact, has flourished. Information has flowed freely. And that is why I believe this bill is simply a solution in search of a real problem. 
   Members of the private sector and law enforcement officials believe H.R. 2102 diminishes legal rights, public safety, and our national security. We must ensure that whistleblowers can expose crimes, waste, and wrongdoing. But we should not create a protection so broad that those who would destroy people's reputations, businesses, and privacy can hide behind it. 
   The Federal Government defends our national security; so we must weigh the benefits of a reporter's privilege with the problems it may cause for those who protect our country. 
   I thank the primary authors of H.R. 2102, Mr. Boucher and Mr. Pence, for working with the Department of Justice, interested groups, and Members to develop alternative language to address legitimate concerns of industry and law enforcement authorities. Despite efforts to accommodate their concerns, the Justice Department and the acting Director of National Intelligence, as I mentioned a while ago, still oppose this bill for very good reasons. The White House also opposes the bill and a veto is likely. The President's senior advisers, in fact, have recommended a veto of this bill. They believe the stakes are too high in a post-9/11 world to support the Free Flow of Information Act. 
   For example, they have pointed out that the exceptions language fails to address misconduct that the Justice Department confronts on a daily basis. To illustrate, neither the bill nor the manager's amendment that will be offered contains exceptions language allowing DOJ to obtain the identity of a new source with the knowledge of a child prostitution ring, an online purveyor of pornography, gang violence, or alien smuggling, all examples. 
   And the text governing source disclosure exceptions only addresses prospective events, not past events. For example, the Department may be able to acquire information about a source's identity to prevent a terrorist attack like September 11; but if al Qaeda decides to tell a media outlet on September 12 how it planned and carried out the attack, DOJ could not compel that media outlet to reveal its terrorist sources while conducting an investigation. 
   If a child molester spoke to a journalist and revealed that he molested a child yesterday, under this bill Justice officials could not compel that journalist to reveal his sources and cooperate in the investigation. The Department of Justice will be hamstrung as it goes about the business of conducting investigations and prosecuting criminals. 
   Yes, numerous States have shield laws, but they run the gamut; and many are not near as broad as the Federal shield law proposed today. But the key difference is that the States are not entrusted with the responsibility of defending our country; the Federal Government is. Under the bill, DOJ carries the burden of trying to establish a national security imperative which can still be negated by a judge's subjective notion of what constitutes the public interest in news gathering. The bill's terms will be subject to the different opinions of hundreds of Federal judges across the country. 
   The bill is simply a solution in search of a problem. It has been 35 years since the Supreme Court ruled that the first amendment does not shield journalists in grand jury proceedings. The Justice Department has issued only 19 subpoenas to reporters seeking confidential source information since 1991. Only 19 subpoenas since 1991. The system is not broken. So why are we trying to fix it? 
   I simply believe we must err on the side of caution and not support legislation that could make it harder to apprehend criminals and terrorists or to deter their activities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to a colleague, I want to yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, what I want to do is read an excerpt from the Statement of Administration Policy that might respond to some of the points that have been made. 
   The administration said that if H.R. 2102 were presented to the President in its current form, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill, and here's one of the reasons why: 
   ``The bill would impose an unreasonable and unjustified evidentiary burden on prosecutors seeking to issue a subpoena to a member of the news media, placing authorities in an untenable position. 
   ``In order to satisfy the bill's requirements, prosecutors essentially must prove the existence of specific criminal activity in a hearing before a judge, with notice to the subjects of the investigation, before they will be able to undertake the necessary investigative steps to determine whether a crime has occurred. Thus, in many cases, prosecutors will have to conduct a minitrial before their investigation has concluded, and in some cases, even before their investigation has gotten off the ground.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I am now happy to yield to the gentleman from Missouri, the minority whip (Mr. Blunt).

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to read an excerpt from the Department of Justice's letter in opposition to the bill we are discussing: ``Given the extensive safeguards already in place, the Department strongly opposes H.R. 2102 and similar legislative efforts to provide a `journalist's privilege' that would prevent the disclosure of relevant testimony and evidence critical to the fair disposition of investigations and trials. 
   ``H.R. 2102 would make it virtually impossible to enforce certain Federal criminal laws, particularly those pertaining to the unauthorized disclosure of classified information, and would seriously impede other national security investigations and prosecutions, including terrorism prosecutions. 
   ``H.R. 2102 would undermine national security and other law enforcement investigations by permitting compelled disclosure of a media source only when necessary to prevent a terrorist attack against the United States and only when the bill's other burdensome prerequisites are satisfied.'' 
   But the problem here is that it would not allow us to get to the information after the fact. You could not force a journalist to disclose information, for instance, after a terrorist attack when you want to find out who was involved  in that attack. For that reason, we should oppose the bill.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to read for my colleagues an excerpt of a letter we received from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence: 
   ``We are joining the Department of Justice in opposing H.R. 2102, the Free Flow of Information Act of 2007. We share the Department's strong opposition to H.R. 2102 articulated in its letter of July 31, 2007. 
   ``The government must retain the ability to obtain information from the press that would both prevent harm to the United States and its citizens and to identify and bring to justice those who cause such harm. Unfortunately, press reports on U.S. intelligence activities have been a valuable source of intelligence to our adversaries. Former Russian military intelligence Colonel Stanislav Lunev wrote: `I was amazed, and Moscow was very appreciative, at how many times I found very sensitive information in American newspapers. In my view, Americans tend to care more about scooping their competition than about national security, which made my job easier.'' 
   What an indictment. 
   Finally, and I am quoting from the letter: ``The bill, as drafted, would require that identification of the source be necessary to prevent an act of terrorism or other significant and specified harm to the national security. It would not, however, allow the government to compel the identification of a source if it was necessary to identify the perpetrators of a completed act of terrorism or an act that harmed the national security. Similarly, the bill could authorize the government to compel the identification of a source in order to prevent imminent death or bodily harm, but would not allow the government to compel disclosure of a source in order to identify a murderer. 
   ``For these reasons and for the reasons set out in the letter from the Department of Justice, we urge the Congress to reject this bill.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is a letter from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with my friend from Indiana (Mr. Pence). I have a question I would like to ask him. 
   The bill states that the determination as to whether the testimony or document is critical to the underlying matter is to be made ``based on information obtained from a person other than the covered person,'' the covered person being the journalist. There has been some confusion as to what is meant by ``information from the covered person.'' 
   In the Washington Post on October 4, Patrick Fitzgerald, who was the U.S. Attorney in the Scooter Libby case, wrote, ``The bill puzzlingly requires that agents prove that the leak occurred without relying on the newspaper article.'' 
   Is Mr. Fitzgerald right? Does this provision mean that the party seeking the subpoena cannot use the very newspaper article at issue in the lawsuit to show why the reporter's testimony is needed? 
   I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me summarize the objections to this legislation. The White House, the Justice Department, the Acting Director of National Intelligence and many law enforcement officials oppose H.R. 2102 because they believe it diminishes legal rights, public safety and endangers national security. The Department of Justice is concerned that this legislation will impede its efforts to conduct investigations and prosecute criminals. 
   For 200 years, information has flowed freely to the press. Congress need not enact H.R. 2102, when the status quo is working and the legislation's potential harm to our national security is so significant. 
   Our Founders created a legal system where no one is above the law. But if the media shield bill passes, we will be carving out a special exception to that rule for reporters, tabloids and bloggers.     
   This is not what our Founders intended when they created a free press. No one should be above the law, not even the press. We must err on the side of caution and not support legislation that could make it harder to apprehend criminals and terrorists or deter their activities. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I support the manager's amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Boucher). The provisions of the amendment do improve the bill by addressing some of the Justice Department's concerns. Despite this, it still does not cure the bill's fundamental flaws. 
   The legislation will still make it impossible to enforce certain criminal laws and will impede national security investigation. While I commend the sponsors of the amendment for trying to address the Justice Department's concern, even if the amendment is adopted, the bill should still be opposed. So I urge Members to support the amendment and oppose the underlying bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2102 presumes that a journalist is entitled to a reporter's privilege unless the government can show a court otherwise. The government can only do this by meeting certain threshold requirements set forth in the bill. 
   After all those requirements are met, the judge must then apply a balancing test. The judge must find that ``the public interest in compelling disclosure of the information or document involved outweighs the public interest in gathering or disseminating news or information.'' 
   My motion to recommit provides further guidance to the judge as to what criteria should be considered in weighing that decision. 
   The motion to recommit simply states that the judge may consider the extent of any harm to national security. It does not dictate any result. 
   The manager's amendment partly addresses this issue by creating an additional exception to the privilege that excludes from the privilege leaks of classified information that harm national security in criminal cases. I agree with that idea as far as it goes. 
   This motion to recommit, though, goes further. It allows the judge to consider this factor in any case, not just a criminal case. It allows a judge to consider any leak that harms national security, not just a leak in violation of the laws on classified information. 
   There are many kinds of information that can harm national security. One example is grand jury information. Suppose that the government is conducting a grand jury investigation of a suspected terrorist ring. If a grand juror were to reveal that to a reporter, it might allow the terrorist to escape to strike another day. 
   Another example is information covered by various common law privileges like the attorney/client privilege. Suppose that an attorney knew his client, a former terrorist, was cooperating with authorities to avoid prosecution. If he revealed this to the press, it could reveal to the terrorist's former compatriots that they needed to change their plans. 
   Another example is confidential business information that is protected by contractual relationships. Employees of a computer company might know and reveal without authorization that a certain new chip is coming to the market in a matter of months. This might allow a foreign enemy to stop their research on that type of chip and devote their resources to some other project. 
   The problem is that any of these kinds of information could harm national security. If they do, a judge ought to be able to consider that in deciding what the public interest requires. 
   In short, I think we are going in the same direction, but the manager's amendment does not go far enough. The motion to recommit protects national security against harmful leaks in all cases, not just criminal cases. When national security is threatened by leaks, we must protect ourselves in all cases, not just criminal cases. 
   I urge my colleagues to adopt this motion and protect our national security. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could use my time today to discuss the bill before us because it does some good things, as the gentleman from North Carolina has  pointed out. For example, it clarifies a definition of ``Internet access'' to ensure that States do not tax Internet access, including the acquisition of transmission capabilities. But instead, Mr. Speaker, I'm going to talk more about what this bill does not do. 
   This bill does not permanently ban taxes on Internet access and e-commerce. Only by making the ban on Internet access taxes permanent can we give businesses the certainty they need to spend billions of dollars to construct, maintain and update the broadband Internet infrastructure throughout the country. And only by extending the moratorium permanently can we continue to keep the cost of Internet access down so that low-income individuals, those who are most sensitive to cost, can continue to use the great informational tool that is called ``the Internet.'' 
   More than 240 Members have cosponsored bills H.R. 743 and H.R. 1077, which provide for a permanent extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. This support is broad and bipartisan. A permanent extension is also consistent with the past actions of the House, which passed a permanent ban in 2003. 
   Hundreds of companies and groups, including AOL, Apple, Americans for Tax Reform, AT&T, Comcast, eBay, Electronics Industry Alliance, Level 3 Communications, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the National Taxpayers Union, Sprint/Nextel, Time Warner Communications, T-Mobile, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Telecom Association, U.S. Internet Industry Association, Verizon, Yahoo, the Business Software Alliance, and the Hispanic Technology & Telecommunications Partnership, among many, many others, have called for a permanent ban on Internet access taxes; but this bill contains no such provision. 
   At the markup of this bill at the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, the gentleman from Virginia, offered an amendment to extend the moratorium permanently. Even though 21 members of the committee, a majority, cosponsored H.R. 743, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act of 2007, five of the six Democratic cosponsors reversed themselves and voted against the permanent extension.     
   Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase a one-time Presidential candidate, I guess they must have been for permanence before they were against it. 
   After the Democrats defeated that amendment, Mr. Goodlatte offered the next best thing, an 8-year extension of the moratorium. The 8-year amendment subsequently failed on a more or less straight party-line vote as did a similar amendment to extend the moratorium for 6 years. If we are going to have a healthy economy in America, if we are going to continue to create jobs, if we are going to continue to enjoy a high standard of living, if we are going to continue to increase productivity, we have to do everything we can to encourage and help the high-tech industry. 
   To that end, I, along with Republican Leader BOEHNER, Republican Whip BLUNT, Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Cannon, sent a letter to the majority leader on Friday urging him to bring this bill to the floor under a rule that allowed for a vote on permanence. By denying the 242 Members who cosponsored a permanent ban on Internet taxes, Republicans and Democrats alike, the opportunity to vote for permanence, the Democratic leadership has shown that they oppose a permanent Internet tax moratorium that would help high-tech companies and that they want to leave the door open for taxing the Internet in the future. 
   I hope the American people and high-tech employers are watching today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm pleased that we are considering a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium another 7 years. With only 2 days left until the moratorium expires, it's high time that Congress passes this important legislation and gets it to the President's desk for his signature. 
   Two weeks ago, the House approved H.R. 3678, a bill to extend the Internet tax moratorium for 4 years. I supported  this legislation because it accomplished several positive things. For example, it clarified the definition of Internet access to ensure that States do not tax Internet access, including the acquisition of transmission capabilities. 
   However, I was disappointed that it did not permanently ban taxes on Internet access and e-commerce and that the House Democratic leadership refused to allow a vote on permanency, even though over 240 Members are cosponsors of a permanent extension. 
   Today, by passing H.R. 3678 with the Senate amendments, we are taking a step in the right direction. This legislation extends the moratorium for 7 years, almost doubling what the House approved only 2 weeks ago. 
   The Senate amendments to H.R. 3678 also made several other important changes to the law. The Senate extended the coverage of the moratorium to all e-mail, regardless of whether it was bundled with Internet access. With respect to the original grandfathered States, the Senate added a new ``use it or lose it'' provision that says that if one of those States repeals or otherwise does not enforce its tax on Internet access, it loses its grandfather protections. 
   I think these are good changes to the original House-passed bill, and I am happy to support them. 
   By extending the ban on Internet access taxes for a longer period of time, we give businesses the certainty they need to spend billions of dollars to construct, maintain and update the broadband Internet infrastructure throughout the country. 
   This legislation will help keep the cost of Internet access down so that all individuals can continue to use the great informational tool that is the Internet. 
   While I'm disappointed that we're not making the ban permanent, which has wide support in the House, we are certainly moving in the right direction by passing H.R. 3678 today. 
   Hundreds of companies and groups, including AOL, Apple, Americans for Tax Reform, AT&T, Comcast, eBay, Electronic Industries Alliance, Level 3 Communications, the National Association of Manufacturers, National Cable and Telecommunications Association, National Taxpayers Union, Sprint/Nextel, Time Warner Communications, T-Mobile, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Telecom Association, U.S. Internet Industry Association, Verizon, Yahoo, the Business Software Alliance, and the Hispanic Technology and Telecommunications Partnership, among many, many others, have, in fact, called for a permanent ban on Internet access taxes. 
   While H.R. 3678 doesn't get us all the way to the goal line, it is a step forward that will benefit the economy and the consumer. 
   Madam Speaker, if we are going to have a healthy economy in America, if we are going to continue to create jobs, if we're going to continue to enjoy a high standard of living, if we are going to continue to increase productivity, we have to do everything we can to encourage and help the high-tech industry. 
   To that end, I support H.R. 3678, but I still would like to see Congress pass a permanent moratorium.

   From June 28 through July 14, the papers wrote far more stories about Senator Obama than Senator McCain. And while most of the 15 articles about Senator Obama were positive, not a single one of the nine articles about Senator McCain was positive. That is a huge slant in favor of Senator Obama.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is widely recognized that patent litigation is too expensive, too time consuming, and too unpredictable. H.R. 34 addresses these concerns by authorizing the establishment of a pilot program in certain United States district courts that is intended to encourage the enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district judges. 
   The need for such a program becomes apparent when one considers that fewer than 1 percent of all cases in U.S. district courts, on average, are patent cases and that a district court judge typically has a patent case proceed through trial only once every 7 years. These cases require a disproportionate share of attention and judicial resources, and the rate of reversal remains unacceptably high. 
   The premise underlying H.R. 34 is simple. Practice makes perfect, or at least better. Judges who focus more attention on patent cases can be expected to be better prepared and make decisions that will hold up under appeal. 
   This bill is the product of an extensive oversight hearing which was conducted by the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property in October 2005. The authors of H.R. 34, Representatives DARRELL ISSA and ADAM SCHIFF, introduced this measure on January 4, 2007. This legislation is identical to H.R. 5418, a bill that passed the House unanimously last September. Unfortunately, the clock on the 109th Congress expired before the other body could take up this bipartisan measure. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 34 will require the Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts to select five district courts to participate in a 10-year pilot program that is to begin no later than 6 months after the date of enactment. 
   The bill specifies criteria the director must employ in determining eligibility of districts. It contains provisions to preserve the random assignment of cases and to prevent the selected districts from becoming magnets for forum shopping litigants. 
   The legislation also requires the director, in consultation with the director of the Federal Judicial Center and the chief judge of each participating district, to provide the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate with periodic progress reports. 
   Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the superb job that the bill's sponsors did in seeking out and incorporating the advice of numerous experts as they developed this bipartisan legislation. Congratulations go to Congressmen DARRELL ISSA and ADAM SCHIFF. Their success and cooperation have resulted in a worthy bill that deserves the support of the Members of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (HONORING AND PRAISING THE NAACP ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 98TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I support House Concurrent Resolution 44, which recognizes the 98th anniversary of the NAACP. 
   For almost a century, the NAACP has fought to bring justice and racial equality to all parts of America. In 1917 the NAACP won a legal victory in the Supreme Court which held that States could not restrict and officially segregate African Americans into residential areas. The same year the NAACP fought for the right for African Americans to be commissioned as officers in World War I. In 1920 the NAACP held its annual conference in Atlanta, which at the time was one of the most active areas for the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, the NAACP showed the world it would not be intimidated by racial violence.     
   In 1935, NAACP lawyers Charles Houston and Thurgood Marshall won a legal battle to admit a black student to the University of Maryland. 
   During World War II, the NAACP led the effort that resulted in President Franklin Roosevelt's ordering a non-discrimination policy in war-related industries and Federal employment. 
   And in 1948, the NAACP convinced President Harry Truman to sign an executive order banning discrimination by the Federal Government. 
   In 1954, under the leadership of Special Counsel Thurgood Marshall, the NAACP won one of the greatest legal victories in Brown v. Board of Education. 
   In 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, members of the NAACP Youth Council launched a series of nonviolent sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. The segregation ended, and all Americans could finally break bread together. 
   The history of America's modern struggle to live up to our constitutional principles was often written by the NAACP, and it continues to champion the cause of social justice today. The NAACP has served as the voice of those who were mute with fear. It has served as a key for those who were handcuffed and jailed under segregationist policies. And it carried the weight for those whose backs were broken by brutal beatings. It did so peacefully, and with dignity; and, as a result, America can hold its head higher. 
   It is with great pleasure that I support this concurrent resolution, which I hope raises even higher the awareness of this organization's historic contributions to the cause of civil rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Issa), and would ask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control said time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, section 621 of H.R. 1 requires the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress how it plans to implement an automated biometric entry-and-exit data system. 
   A decade ago, Senator Alan Simpson and I authored the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 which required the Federal Government to develop such an automated entry-and-exit system. This would enable us to know who is entering the United States and when they leave. 
   Forty percent of all illegal immigrants come to the United States legally but overstay their temporary visas. We can never begin to solve the illegal immigration problem if we don't deal with overstays, and we can never deal with overstays until we have a functioning exit control system. 
   Instead of mandating completion of the exit component of a U.S. visit, this bill simply requires that the administration submit a report, a report already required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The failure to fully implement an  exit control system is more evidence that it will be a long time before our country has secure borders. Instead of helping to change that, this bill only requires a report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed that we have missed an opportunity to better secure our homeland.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the national media continue to devote a disproportionate amount of news coverage to the Democratic Presidential campaign. 
   For example, on the day before the Republican primary in Michigan, NBC's Today Show gave almost 7 minutes to the race between Democrat Senator BARACK OBAMA and Senator HILLARY CLINTON, compared to about 30 seconds to the close Republican race. 
   NBC isn't the only network giving more coverage to the Democratic campaign. The January 7 edition of ABC's Good Morning America devoted almost 15 minutes of coverage to analyzing the race between BARACK OBAMA and HILLARY CLINTON. Just 30 seconds were given to the Republican side. 
   We must continue to encourage the media to report with fairness rather than partiality. Only then can the American people get the balanced coverage of this important Presidential campaign that they need and deserve.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3992, the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act. 
   This legislation addresses the unique challenges that mentally ill offenders create for our criminal justice system. 
   I commend Chairman Conyers, subcommittee Chairman Scott, subcommittee ranking member Gohmert, and the many advocacy groups for their dedication and hard work to address this problem. 
   Madam Speaker, 16 percent of the prison or jail population, or over 1 million prisoners, have a serious mental illness. The Los Angeles County Jail and New York City's Rikers Island Jail house more people with mental illnesses than the largest psychiatric inpatient facilities in the United States. The problem is more than one-fifth of jails have no access to any mental health services at all. 
   Many criminal justice agencies are unprepared to address the treatment and needs of individuals with mental illness. Jails and prisons require extra staff and treatment resources for inmates with mental illness. In addition, mentally ill offenders can be affected psychologically by incarceration. 
   H.R. 3992 represents an innovative and new approach to the challenge of mentally ill criminal offenders. This legislation is an important step toward treating mentally ill offenders in a humane and appropriate way. 
   H.R. 3992 reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act, which encourages early intervention for individuals with mental illness, reauthorizes the mental health courts program, and maximizes alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent offenders with mental illness. 
   The legislation also encourages training on mental health and substance abuse issues, establishes new State and local planning grants to address the needs of mentally ill offenders, and facilitates communication, collaboration, and the delivery of support services among justice professionals, related service providers, and governmental partners. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I support House Resolution 852 and commend the sponsor of this legislation, my friend and Texas colleague, Representative Ted Poe, for his dedication and commitment to this issue. 
   The goal of this resolution is to raise awareness and encourage prevention of stalking by establishing January 2008 as National Stalking Awareness Month. 
   Stalking, conduct intended to instill fear in a victim, is a crime that occurs in every State in our Nation. Stalkers pursue and harass victims and, in some cases, use the Internet to cyberstalk victims. Cyberstalkers can systematically flood their target's e-mail inbox with obscene, hateful, or threatening messages. 
   Cyberstalkers may also assume the identity of their victim and post information, fictitious or not, to solicit unwanted responses from others. Although cyberstalking does not involve physical contact with the victim, it is still a serious crime. The widespread use of the Internet and the ease with which hackers can find personal information has made this form of stalking more accessible. 
   According to the National Center for Victims of Crime, over 1 million women and almost 400,000 men are stalked each year in the United States. In fact, most victims, 77 percent of women and 64 percent of men, know their stalkers. These statistics are a jarring reminder of the scope and seriousness of this crime. 
   By establishing January 2008 as National Stalking Awareness Month, Congress educates Americans about stalking, recognizes and applauds law enforcement officials and victim service providers for their efforts to combat stalking, and increases awareness of services available to stalking victims. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I support H.R. 3971, the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2007, and commend Chairman Conyers, Crime Subcommittee Chairman Scott, and Crime Subcommittee Ranking Member Gohmert for their commitment to this bipartisan legislation. 
   The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 directed the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics to collect data on deaths that occur in the process of arrest or during transfer after arrest, as well as deaths that occur in jails and prisons. 
   H.R. 3971 reauthorizes this data collection program and directs the Attorney General to commission a study to determine how to reduce deaths in custody and to examine the relationship between deaths in custody and the management of jail and prison facilities. 
   The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that between 2001 and 2005 there were 15,308 State prisoner deaths. The bureau also reports that there were 5,935 local prisoner deaths and 43 juvenile deaths between 2000 and 2005. 
   Half of all State prisoner deaths are the result of heart disease and cancer. Two-thirds involved inmates age 45 or older, and another two-thirds are the result of medical problems that were present at the time of admission. 
   Although illness-related deaths have slightly increased in recent years, the homicide and suicide rates in State prisons have dramatically decreased over the last 25 years. That is positive news, but we still need to collect data to monitor these trends. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a time and place for politics and partisanship. But there are in fact important issues that transcend politics. The security of our Nation outweighs politics, especially when our country is at war. 
   One of the finest moments of bipartisanship in Washington came after one of the darkest days in our history. On the evening of September 11, 2001, Members of Congress stood shoulder to shoulder on the steps of the Capitol as a symbol of strength and unity in response to the terrorist attacks. In that moment, we stood together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans resolved to protect our Nation. However, as we stand here today, that same spirit of bipartisanship we shared on 9/11 no longer exists. 
   We began in August to address a very specific and very urgent issue facing our intelligence community. We learned from the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, was outdated for today's technology. But the bill we are considering today does not modernize FISA; it weakens it. Why, after 30 years of lawful foreign intelligence collection, does the Democratic majority suddenly object to a law that their party originally enacted in 1978? Why make it harder to gather intelligence on terrorists after 9/11 than before? 
   Now, after only a few hours' notice, we are considering the RESTORE Act, which actually restores little. Rather, it undermines our national security and increases the risk of a future terrorist attack on our country. It prevents our intelligence community from gathering critical intelligence information. It ignores the need for legal protection for communications companies that assist law enforcement and intelligence officials. We are at war with terrorists who spend every day plotting attacks against us. Our intelligence community needs to detect and disrupt these plots. To deny this ability could have catastrophic consequences. 
   Admiral McConnell testified in great detail before the Judiciary Committee about the specific needs of the intelligence community and the need to reform FISA. Admiral McConnell's recommendations are ignored, unfortunately, in the RESTORE Act. Instead, it requires the intelligence community to obtain FISA court orders for all communications of persons reasonably believed to be outside the United States. FISA has never applied to persons outside of the United States. 
   Under the RESTORE Act, FISA court orders will be required for the first time ever for thousands of overseas terrorist targets. Also, section 18 of the  manager's amendment is bluntly titled: ``No Rights Under the RESTORE Act for Undocumented Aliens.'' That is what it says. But the practical effect of the RESTORE Act will be to allow unregulated, warrantless wiretapping of illegal immigrants in the United States. Is this really what the Democratic majority intends? 
   Finally, the RESTORE Act omits any liability protection for telephone companies and other carriers that assisted the government after September 11, 2001. These companies deserve our thanks, not a flurry of harassing lawsuits. Communications technology has changed since 1978. We can no longer gather foreign intelligence without the assistance of private communications companies. Extending commonsense liability protection to communication providers who acted in good faith to protect the United States from another terrorist attack is completely appropriate. If we fail to provide this protection, we risk losing the future cooperation of communication providers in gathering foreign intelligence. 
   Democrats made a promise to the American people in 2006 that Members of Congress would put aside politics and work together to find bipartisan solutions to issues facing the American people. That promise has apparently been broken.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit says ``promptly,'' because the bill needs to go back to committee immediately. Members were given almost no notice of what was going to be in this bill. There are many questions remaining about the text because it has not gone through the regular committee process. 
   This motion addresses a major problem created by the manager's amendment. Under existing law, court orders are required to conduct certain surveillance of illegal immigrants within the United States. Section 18 of the manager's amendment strips away any rights that illegal immigrants have under FISA, stating clearly that there will be ``no rights under the RESTORE Act for undocumented aliens.'' 
   If that is really what the Democratic leadership wants to do, then we should ensure that the legislation does not treat terrorists more favorably than illegal immigrants. To fix this problem, the motion adds ``state sponsors of terrorism and their agents'' to section 18  to ensure that they are treated equally. There is no reason that the law should provide greater protection to terrorists than to illegal immigrants. 
   Also, the motion preserves the ability of our intelligence community to conduct surveillance of Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, and other terrorist organizations to protect America from an imminent terrorist attack. When faced with a life-or-death situation, a ticking bomb, an imminent threat of attack, do we really want to subject intelligence agents to unnecessary legal hurdles in order to protect our country? 
   The RESTORE Act hinders our intelligence community's ability to collect foreign intelligence needed to prevent al Qaeda and other terrorists from attacking our country. It requires the government to obtain court orders to conduct surveillance of overseas terrorists. The implication of this requirement, Mr. Speaker, could be catastrophic.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (PATENT REFORM ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I strongly endorse H.R. 1908, the Patent Reform Act of 2007, and I urge my colleagues to support American inventors, American businesses, and the American people by voting for this bill today. 
   Last year we laid a substantial foundation for patent reform. It was a good start, but we need to finish the job now. The Patent Reform Act is the most significant and comprehensive update to patent law since the 1952 act was enacted. The Judiciary Committee has undertaken such an initiative because changes to the patent system are necessary to bolster the U.S. economy and improve the quality of living for all Americans. 
   There are two major reasons the committee wrote the bill: first, too many patents of questionable integrity have been approved. Second, holders of these weak patents discovered a novel way to make money, not by commercializing the patents but by suing manufacturing companies whose operations might incorporate the patents. This combination of weak patents and ``seat-of-the-patents'' litigation has hurt the economy. 
   Most companies don't want to risk shutting down their operations in response to a questionable lawsuit. Nor do they have much faith in a legal system in which juries and even judges become confused by the complexities of patent law. The result: legalized extortion in which companies pay a lot of money to use suspect patents. 
   The bill will eliminate legal gamesmanship from the current system that rewards lawsuit abuses. It will enhance the quality of patents and increase public confidence in their legal integrity. This will help individuals and companies obtain money for research, commercialize their inventions, expand their businesses, create new jobs, and offer the American people a dazzling array of products and services that continue to make our country the envy of the world. 
   All businesses, small and large, will benefit. All industries directly or indirectly affected by patents, including finance, automotive, manufacturing, high tech, and pharmaceuticals, will profit. 
   Given the scope of H.R. 1908, it is impossible to satisfy completely every interested party. But the committee has made many concessions to accommodate many individuals and many businesses.     
   The bill has not been rushed through the process. Over the past 3 years, our committee has conducted 10 hearings with more than 40 witnesses representing a broad range of interests and views. 
   The Patent Reform Act was amended at different stages of the process to address criticisms of the bill. Still, not all interests have endorsed the bill. I think their response is mostly resistance to change, any change. 
   This bill is not intended to favor the interests of one group over another. It does correct glaring inequities that encourage individuals to be less inventive and more litigious. 
   Supporters of the bill run the educational, consumer and business spectrum. The Business Software Alliance, the Information Technology Industry Council, the American Association of Universities, the American Bankers Association, the Consumer Federation of America, the Computer and Communications Industry Association, and the Financial Services Roundtable, again, they all endorse this bill. 
   Article I, section 8, as the chairman mentioned a while ago, of the Constitution empowers Congress, ``to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' 
   The foresight of the founders, in creating an intellectual property system, demonstrates their understanding of how patent rights ultimately benefit the American people. Nor was the value of patents lost when one of our greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln, himself a patent owner, Lincoln described the patent system as adding ``the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.'' 
   Few issues are as important to the economic strength of the United States as our ability to create and protect intellectual property. American IP industries account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of the  country's economic growth, and employ 18 million Americans. A recent study valued U.S. intellectual property at $5 trillion, or about half of the U.S. gross domestic product. 
   The Patent Reform Act represents a major improvement to our patent system that will benefit Americans for years to come. 
   Madam Chairman, this bill has been a bipartisan effort. We would not be here now without the steady hand and gentle suggestions made by our chairman, Mr. Conyers. 
   I also want to acknowledge the indispensable contributions of Congressman HOWARD BERMAN and Congressman HOWARD COBLE, among others. All three of us have been chairmen of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee over the past number of years, and we have worked together on developing this bill. But it is Mr. Berman's good fortune and a testament to his legislative ability that we are on the House floor today, and I congratulate him for that achievement.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the African National Congress has played a significant role in history. Nelson Mandela and the ANC for many years fought against the unjust apartheid system in South Africa. 
   Through a largely peaceful transfer of power, apartheid is a thing of the past and South Africa now has a representative democratic government. Many ANC officials are now, in fact, officials of South Africa's government. 
   South Africa provides hope that genuine reconciliation between historically opposed groups can, in fact, be achieved. However, real terrorist acts were committed as part of the struggle against apartheid. There were deadly bombings of civilians. There were so-called ``necklacings'' in which car tires were put around persons' necks and set on fire. 
   I am pleased that the bill's sponsors, Mr. Berman, Ms. Lofgren and Chairman Conyers, were willing to ensure that this bill will provide appropriate relief for the African National Congress without excusing the perpetrators of terrorist or criminal acts. 
   First, the ANC is added to the list of organizations not considered terrorist  organizations for immigration purposes. Such a list was created to shield certain organizations from the broad reach of the Immigration Act of 1990. 
   Under the 1990 legislation, any guerilla group would find itself under the definition of a terrorist organization. The groups currently on the exempt list include the Hmong, who fought alongside U.S. soldiers in the Vietnam War, and groups that are fighting against the repressive Burmese Government today. It is understandable that the ANC be added to that list. 
   Second, the administration is granted the authority to waive the criminal grounds of inadmissibility with respect to aliens for activities undertaken in opposition to apartheid rule in South Africa. Congress already granted the administration waiver authority for the terrorism-related grounds in last year's omnibus spending bill. 
   Third, the bill contains a sense of Congress that the administration should immediately exercise ``in appropriate instances'' the authority granted under the bill to waive grounds of inadmissibility for the anti-apartheid activities of aliens who are current or former officials of the Government of South Africa. I am confident that any administration will use this power wisely. 
   Finally, the bill directs the administration to ensure that government databases used to determine admissibility to the U.S. be updated to reflect any waivers granted. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Again, I want to thank Chairman Berman and Chairman Conyers and Chairman Lofgren for working in good faith to address concerns with the bill as it was introduced. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, at the outset I want to recognize Chairman Conyers, Subcommittee Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Howard Coble of the subcommittee, each of whom I have enjoyed working with in developing and advancing this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when many Americans are facing a slowing economy and increasing costs of food and fuel, it is imperative that Congress put aside any differences we may have and work together to promote the interests of U.S. entrepreneurs and industry. 
   Over the past 25 years, perhaps no group of industries has contributed more to the tremendous and sustained growth in our economy than those who rely on strong patent, trademark and copyright protections. 
   American intellectual property industries, including entertainment, high-tech and pharmaceutical industries, account for over half of all U.S. exports, represent 40 percent of the country's economic growth and employ 18 million American workers. 
   American technology, entertainment and productivity-based enterprises serve as the cornerstone of our economic and export strength. 
   Because of the important role IP industries play in our economy, we cannot take these innovations, or their creativity and investment required to bring them to life, for granted. 
   Unfortunately, the tremendous success of these innovators, creators and rights-holders has made them prime targets for thieves who seek out items protected by patent, copyright, trademark or trade secret designation. These thieves not only steal the creations of others, but also reap the monetary benefits by reproducing and distributing the products themselves. 
   And the losses attributed to counterfeiting and piracy affect more than the inventor. According to the U.S. Government, American businesses lose approximately $250 billion each year to pirated and counterfeited goods. 
   The theft of intellectual property has also cost nearly 750,000 Americans their jobs. Given the current state of the economy, preventing these crimes and enforcing IP laws must be a top priority for the Federal Government. 
   H.R. 4279, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, which is also known as PRO-IP, is a measure designed to respond directly to these challenges. 
   Specifically, the bill strengthens our laws against counterfeiting and piracy; provides new resources to key agencies involved in the enforcement of IP rights; and mandates a new and unprecedented level of coordination and leadership on IP enforcement issues from the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, the incentive to innovate and the ability to profit from the creation of new intellectual property cannot be sustained without enforcing the rights that protect the ownership of such valuable, intangible property. 
   And while our government agencies are doing more today to protect intellectual property than ever before, the reality is that we must do much more. We must make it increasingly difficult, and costly, for counterfeiters and traffickers, some of whom are connected to organized crime, to steal and profit from American innovations. 
   Because intellectual property is such an important asset for both the inventor and the economy as a whole, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that IP enforcement is made a permanent priority of every administration. 
   By supporting the PRO-IP bill, the House will send a clear message that there is a bipartisan commitment to ensure the next President and succeeding administrations have the resources, organizations and strategies required to protect our vital national and economic interests. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, H.R. 4279.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this resolution recognizes the 100th anniversary of The Christian Science Monitor newspaper on November 25, 2008. 
   Thanks go to Congressman Mike Capuano (MA), who agreed to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan resolution and whose district includes the Boston headquarters of The Christian Science Monitor. Rep. Capuano's public service is appreciated by all those who know him. 
   I also want to thank Ranking Member Tom Davis (VA) of the Government Reform Committee, who was an active supporter of this resolution. His energy and knowledge will be missed, since he is retiring at the end of this session. 
   Congressman Henry Waxman (CA), Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, offered his essential endorsement of this resolution. Without his assistance, this resolution wouldn't be on the floor today. 
   I happen to have a personal interest in commemorating the 100th anniversary of The Christian Science Monitor because I worked at the paper in Boston for two years shortly after graduating from college. 
   Starting out as a copyboy, I then became a clerk and eventually a staff writer for the Business and Financial page. 
   So I was able to witness the high standards of journalistic integrity maintained at The Christian Science Monitor, which has rightfully gained a reputation for fair and objective news reporting. The Monitor has earned that reputation because of its dedicated and committed editors, reporters and staff. 
   This resolution highlights some of the ways in which The Monitor serves as an exceptional newspaper. 
   Established by Mary Baker Eddy 100 years ago, The Monitor remains the oldest surviving paper in the U.S. founded by a woman. 
   Its mission was and continues to be ``to injure no man, but to bless all mankind.'' 
   And the Monitor has won worldwide respect for its international news coverage and been awarded seven Pulitzer Prizes for excellence in journalism. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the 100th anniversary of The Christian Science Monitor.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, first of all, credit goes to the gentlewoman from Florida, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, for introducing this bill in the House and for advancing this piece of legislation to the point where we are considering it today. 
   Child pornography is a reprehensible, yet profitable, global criminal enterprise. And it is growing rapidly in technical sophistication in response to efforts to detect and disrupt these criminal operations. It is a despicable and vicious victimization of children. 
   The Internet is a virtual playground for sexual predators who satiate their desire for child pornography with relative anonymity. Law enforcement officials have identified nearly 500,000 individuals trafficking in child pornography over the Internet. However, due to the lack of resources at the Federal, State and local levels, law enforcement officials are able to investigate only about 2 percent of these child pornographers.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (MILITARY PERSONNEL CITIZENSHIP PROCESSING ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by my Texas colleague, Mr. Rodriguez.  
   Mr. Speaker, the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act creates an Office of the  FBI Liaison within U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This office will monitor the progress of naturalization applications filed by veterans and military personnel. 
   It will also monitor the progress of naturalization applications filed by spouses of active duty soldiers stationed abroad. And the Liaison Office will track the naturalization process for the soldiers and their spouses and children who are eligible for citizenship under the provisions that grant posthumous citizenship to military personnel who die in service to the country. 
   The intent behind the establishment of this Liaison Office is to address the delays that often occur in the processing of the necessary background checks for these categories of applicants. 
   The haste under which this bill was added to the suspension calendar precludes any meaningful assessment of the need for such an office. However, I do not object to measures that facilitate the processing of naturalization applications of those who have honorably served our country or their spouses and children. 
   This bill also requires USCIS to make a decision on these applications within 6 months of filing or, in circumstances in which that is not possible, to provide the reasons why. This is not an onerous burden since USCIS will still have the flexibility needed to be sure that all required security checks and eligibility criteria are met before granting citizenship. 
   In this Congress, we have already passed legislation to ease the processing of naturalization applications for our soldiers. The Kendall Frederick Citizenship Assistance Act became law on June 26th of this year. That law permits soldiers to use the fingerprints they provided at the time of enlistment for their background checks. 
   That law also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of the FBI to take steps to ensure that soldiers' naturalization applications are adjudicated within 180 days after the background checks have been completed. This bill furthers those goals. 
   The bill provides, but does not require, an earlier target date of 6 months after the filing of the application. But in cases in which that time frame cannot be met--even with the new FBI liaison office created under this bill--USCIS will need to explain why. 
   I have no objection to these measures, which are intended to ensure the timely adjudication of naturalization applications filed by those who have served our Nation, and urge my colleagues to support the bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Texas again for his efforts on this legislation.  
   Mr. Speaker, as we stand here today, dangerous drug traffickers are surreptitiously moving tons of cocaine across our oceans and into America. Cocaine traffickers operate with stealth and are virtually undetectable thanks to their use of self-propelled submersible and semi- submersible vessels or SPSS. 
   These submarine-like vessels have unusual construction. They are typically less than 100 feet long with most of their bulk under water. They can carry up to five crew and as much as 12 metric tons of cocaine from the north coast of South America to the southeastern United States without refueling.

   The greatest threat our country faces is not an economic recession; it is a partisan bias. The media should give the American people the facts, not tell them what to think. Otherwise, we will lose our democracy, which is a greater danger than the economy. 
   The media is hurting its credibility for the future. They should instead adhere to the highest standards of journalism and report the news fairly and objectively.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (PROHIBITING RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN DEFAMATION JUDGMENTS -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, my Texas colleague described the merits of this legislation so well, I will simply make my prepared statement a part of the Record.  
   Mr. Speaker, in the wake of 9-11, the American media has become increasingly alarmed over a phenomenon called ``libel tourism.'' The term refers to the subject of a critical news story suing the American author or reporter of the story in a plaintiff-friendly overseas forum. 
   This mostly occurs in the United Kingdom, since English libel and slander laws offer less protection to journalists compared to the U.S. system that features the protection offered by the First Amendment. 
   Persons identified in news stories as terrorists or terrorist sympathizers have brought some of the higher-profile suits. In fact, H.R. 6146 is a legislative response to a New York case in which a Saudi billionaire sued an American author in the UK for defamation, based on the author's allegations that he had subsidized terrorist activities. 
   What is the legal hook that allowed a British court to claim jurisdiction over the case? Twenty-three copies of the author's book detailing the billionaire's activities were purchased online in Great Britain. 
   The reporter chose not to appear before the court, which subsequently found her liable and ordered her to pay $225,000 in damages, apologize to the plaintiff, and destroy any remaining copies of the offending book. 
   Such a result is doubly troublesome. First, an author must worry about satisfying a judgment that would bankrupt most Americans. And second, an author must contend with the fall-out of being shunned by the publishing community. 
   This is not an imagined result. It is a real threat to anyone wishing to earn a living by reporting and commenting on controversial subjects. And it's an outcome incompatible with our constitutional history and its commitment to the free-flow of ideas and to the robust debate contemplated by the First Amendment. 
   H.R. 6146 combats libel tourism by proscribing enforcement of any foreign defamation case if it is not ``consistent with the First Amendment .......'' This proposal tracks U.S. case law, which holds that a foreign judgment will not be enforced in an American court if the foreign judgment is offensive to State or Federal law. 
   H.R. 6146 does not overreach. It constitutes a straightforward and sensible response to the practical legal problems caused by libel tourism by codifying a principle already reflected in U.S. law. 
   Mr. Speaker, I commend the primary authors of the bill, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Representatives Steve Cohen and Darrell Issa, for their hard work and persistence in addressing this important subject. 
   I also want to acknowledge our colleague, Representative Peter King, the Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Committee, for his work on the issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6146.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I support this bill. 
   I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the gentlewoman from California, Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren, and I will include my entire statement as part of the Record.  
   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, teachers and students at Virginia Tech gathered to mark the 1-year anniversary of the campus shooting that killed 27 students and 5 faculty members. We now know that the shooter was a mentally-disturbed young man who was able to purchase two handguns. He brought those handguns to the campus and began a shooting spree that spanned several hours and occurred in both dorms and classrooms across campus. 
   Sadly, in February of this year, a gunman stormed a classroom at Northern Illinois University and opened fire, killing 5 students and wounding 16 others before killing himself. 
   In the wake of the tragic shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University and a recent rash of violence in public schools across the country, it is appropriate for Congress to act to provide resources to schools and law enforcement officials to help protect our schools. 
   School and college campuses should be safe environments for students to learn. Today, campus security requires much more than ever before, including campus police, emergency alert systems, and emergency response plans. 
   H.R. 6838, the CAMPUS Safety Act, authorizes the Department of Justice to establish a National Center for Campus Public Safety to award grants to colleges and universities and other nonprofit organizations, provide education and training for campus public safety agencies, and promote research to improve the security of colleges and universities. 
   The center may coordinate with other Federal agencies to prevent and respond to natural disasters, incidents of campus violence, or other emergencies. The center may also promote the development of an effective behavioral health threat assessment to prevent campus violence. 
   It is my hope that through this legislation and other programs across the country, we can do our best to prevent violence on our college and university campuses. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 6838.  
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill extends a program that has successfully brought doctors to medically underserved areas in the U.S. The Conrad Program allows foreign doctors who have been here on exchange programs to stay at the conclusion of their residencies if they agree to practice medicine for at least 3 years in health professionals shortage areas. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it.  
   This bill extends a program that has successfully brought doctors to medically underserved areas in the U.S. The ``Conrad'' program allows foreign doctors who have been here on exchange programs to stay at the conclusion of their residencies if they agree to practice medicine for at least 3 years in health professional shortage areas. 
   In May the House passed legislation to extend the program for an additional 5 years. And Senator Specter introduced legislation in the Senate to also extend the program for 5 years. Our medically underserved communities deserve a long-term reauthorization of this program so that they can better plan for the future. 
   I support this bill today. However, it only reauthorizes the Conrad program for about 5 months. Why such a short reauthorization? Well, the reason is that the Democrats on the other side of the Capitol are holding the reauthorization of another vital immigration program hostage. 
   The E-Verify program provides tens of thousands of American employers who want to do the right thing with an effective way to ensure that they are hiring a legal workforce. The authorization for E-Verify expires in November, so the House passed a 5 year reauthorization by the overwhelming vote of 407 to 2. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrats in the Senate have refused to pass an extension of E-Verify for longer than 5 months. They refuse to pass a longer extension unless we accede to their demand to increase immigration to the U.S. by over 500,000 persons. 
   Such a demand goes against the clear preference of the American people who oppose an increase in immigration levels already at a record high. It goes against the interests of American workers in these unsettled economic times. And it goes against the interests of American employers, who want to count on E-Verify being available to them for the long term. 
   The House is right to reject the demand of the Senate Democrats. Unfortunately, since they will only extend E-Verify for 5 months, we will only get a five month extension of the Conrad program. Thus, we will need to address this issue again after the 111th Congress convenes next winter. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER TREATMENT AND CRIME REDUCTION REAUTHORIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I don't know if I'd call it a habit, but I find myself again agreeing with the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Zoe Lofgren. 
   This is a bill that has already passed the House in a similar form, I believe, last January. 
   I will include my entire statement in the Record.  
   I support S. 2304, the Mentally III 0ffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Reauthorization and Improvement Act. The House passed companion legislation, H.R. 3992, last January. 
   This important legislation addresses the unique challenges that mentally ill offenders create for our criminal justice system. It is estimated that 16 percent of the prison or jail population in the country suffers from a serious mental illness. 
   More than one-fifth of jails have no access to any mental health services at all. Many criminal justice agencies are unprepared to meet the comprehensive treatment and needs of individuals with mental illness. 
   Jails and prisons require extra staff resources for inmates with mental illness. In addition, mentally ill offenders can be affected psychologically by incarceration differently than general population offenders. 
   H.R. 3992 reauthorizes the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act; encourages early intervention for individuals with mental illness; reauthorizes the mental health courts program; and maximizes diversion opportunities for nonviolent offenders with mental illness and co-occurring disorders. 
   The legislation also promotes training for treatment professionals on criminal justice processes and mental health and substance abuse issues; establishes State and local planning grants to address the needs of mentally ill offenders; and facilitates communication, collaboration, and the delivery of support services among justice professionals, treatment and related service providers. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this measure.  
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the principal purpose of S. 3325, the Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act of 2008, or PRO-IP Act, is to improve the government's response to the threats posed by counterfeiting and piracy. 
   At the outset, I want to recognize Chairman Conyers, IP Subcommittee Chairman Berman, and IP Subcommittee Ranking Member Coble, each of whom helped to advance the House version of this legislation, H.R. 4279, which passed the House in May by an overwhelming vote of 410-11. 
   I also want to say at this point that I happen to agree with the concerns expressed by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren). And while I agree with their concerns, particularly their objection to the provision that was changed by the other body, I am still going to support this legislation as it stands and hope to make a change in the future that will address their concerns. 
   Over the past 25 years, perhaps no group of industries has been more responsible for the sustained growth in our economy than those who rely on strong patent, trademark and copyright protections. Today, our technology, entertainment, and productivity-based enterprises stand as pillars of our economic and export strength. They employ 18 million Americans and account for 40 percent of our economic growth. 
   The successes of our IP rights-holders--family-owned small businesses and Fortune 500 companies alike--make them prime targets for international pirates and counterfeiters. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, this criminal activity costs U.S. citizens up to $250 billion every year, and has contributed to the loss of up to 750,000 jobs. 
   The PRO-IP Act is a measure that is designed to respond to these challenges. The bill contains provisions that; one, strengthen our laws against counterfeiting and piracy; two, provide new resources to key agencies involved in the enforcement of IP rights; and three, require a new and unprecedented level of coordination and leadership on IP enforcement issues from the White House. 
   Mr. Speaker, while our government agencies are doing more today to protect IP than ever before, the reality is that we must do even more if we are to increase the cost of doing business for counterfeiters and traffickers, some of whom are connected to organized crime. 
   With competing priorities and limited resources, our government agencies must work in a cooperative and coordinated fashion to leverage our IP enforcement efforts. By statutorily elevating these issues to the White House level and requiring the continuous and systematic development of an unprecedented national strategy to target IP theft, the PRO-IP Act represents an important first step towards ensuring our government agencies work efficiently and in concert to develop a joint response to this pervasive threat. 
   Congress has a duty to ensure that IP enforcement is made a permanent priority of every administration. This  measure, while not containing all of the provisions that were in the House measure, is a first step towards achieving our goals. 
   By supporting S. 3325, the House will send a clear message to the White House and future administrations that there is a bipartisan and bicameral commitment to the protection of our vital national and economic interests. So I urge my colleagues to support S. 3325.

These provisions will provide justice for the American people as well. 
   The Judicial Conference is the policy-making body of the Federal judiciary, and through its committee system, it evaluates court operations. The conference endorses all of the provisions in this bill, which the other body passed by unanimous consent.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I just want to reply and say that I agree with the points made by the gentlewoman from California. They are excellent ones, and we might also add that in a bill like this like, so many bills that are considered by the House and that have been marked up and approved by the Judiciary Committee, sometimes we're talking about sort of arcane subject matter, and yet so much of what is incorporated in this bill and so much of what is part of many other bills do help the judicial process. They do help the American people get better justice. They either save the American people time or they make sure that there's a more ethical result as a result of the actions of the court, and in this particular bill, as a result of the actions of the juries themselves. 
   So bills like this may seem, at first glance, to either be somewhat technical or somewhat even incomprehensible, but at the bottom line they do improve the justice system of the United States, which can give everybody, I think, a sense of confidence that not only does the system work, but it works in this case in a bipartisan way since Members of both parties do support this legislation which improves the justice system. 
   I would be happy to yield to the gentlewoman from California again if she would like.

   But in addition to that, she was formerly, before coming to Congress, an immigration attorney. She happens to be chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee today, and so she brings to that subcommittee, as she does the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, a number of talents and skills that benefit the House as a whole and benefit the Judiciary Committee, in particular. 
   So I would just like to thank her for her work these last few years on those subjects and so many other subjects that she brings these skills to and has helped promote both on the floor and in the Judiciary Committee itself.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am happy to have played a part in the creation of the Religious Worker Immigrant Visa program in 1990. These visas enable American religious denominations, large and small, to benefit from committed religious workers from other countries. 
   Last April, the House passed legislation to extend the program for an additional 7 years. Senator Specter introduced legislation in the Senate to extend the program for 3 years. I support this bill today. However, it only reauthorizes the religious worker visa program for about 5 months. 
   Why such a short reauthorization? 
   Well, the reason is that some Democrats in the Senate are holding the reauthorization of another vital immigration program hostage. The E-Verify program provides tens of thousands of American employers who want to do the right thing with an effective tool to ensure that they are hiring a legal workforce. 
   The authorization for E-Verify expires in November, so the House passed a 5-year reauthorization by the overwhelming vote of 407-2. Unfortunately, Democrats in the Senate have refused to pass an extension of E-Verify for longer than 5 months. They refuse to pass a longer extension unless we accede to their demand to increase immigration to the United States by about a half a million people. 
   Such a demand goes against the clear preference of the American people who support current or reduced levels of immigration. It goes against the interest of American workers who compete with foreign workers for the same jobs, and it goes against the interest of American employers who want to count on E-Verify's being available to them for the long term. 
   This body is right to reject the demand of the Senate Democrats. Unfortunately, since they will only extend E-Verify for 5 months, we will only get a 5-month extension of the religious worker visa program. So we will need to address this issue again after the 111th Congress convenes next January. 
   I do appreciate the language in this bill that requires the Department of Homeland Security to expeditiously issue needed regulations to address fraud in the religious worker visa program. I have long been concerned about the high level of fraud that has been evident in this program. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation, and I want to give credit to the gentlewoman from New York, Congresswoman Maloney, for taking the initiative for introducing this legislation and for advancing it to the point where we are considering it here tonight.  
   Mr. Speaker, this is the second time that the House has considered this bill. The House passed an earlier version last July. The Senate recently passed this more streamlined version of H.R. 5057, which I hope our colleagues will support once again. 
   As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, I joined Chairman CONYERS as an original co-sponsor of this legislation, which was introduced by Congresswoman CAROLYN MALONEY. 
   This bill reauthorizes a tremendously important program: the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Elimination Grant Program. H.R. 5057 reauthorizes the grant program through fiscal year 2014 at $151 million per year. 
   The Debbie Smith Program provides grants to state and local governments to reduce the DNA backlog of samples collected and entered into the national DNA database. The program, originally authorized in 2000, expires at the end of fiscal year 2009. 
   DNA has become an invaluable tool in identifying and convicting criminal suspects. At the same time, the increased use of DNA evidence in criminal prosecutions has also increased DNA collection and processing requests. The result is a substantial backlog in processing DNA evidence across the country. 
   Since 2000, DNA backlog grants live assisted state and local governments with the collection Of 2.5 million DNA samples from convicted offenders and arrestees for inclusion in the national DNA database. The backlog grants have also funded the testing of approximately 104,000 DNA cases between 2004 and 2007. 
   While the Debbie Smith program has been successful in reducing the backlog, there is still work to do. A 2003 Department of Justice report indicated that a backlog existed of 48,000 DNA samples. The current backlog is expected to be just as high. 
   Congress has a responsibility to assist states with investigating, prosecuting and punishing criminals and to provide justice for victims. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act protects victims by providing Federal funding to process the DNA evidence needed to take violent criminals off the streets. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

   The Internet is constantly evolving. A decade ago, email was the revolution that connected people in the workplace, on college campuses, and across the country. Today, chat rooms and social networking sites boast users in the millions from around the world and attract young children who may not be aware of the risks involved with sharing personal information online.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of servicemembers serve with distinction and honor, and are never subjected to disciplinary action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But when disciplinary action is necessary, the UCMJ and the military justice system provide a high degree of protection for the accused. In many cases, these protections extend well beyond those provided by the civil justice system.  
   But from time to time, policymakers ought to review and contemplate proposals for change. I am told the particular section of the code this bill would amend has not been altered or subjected to a congressional review in a quarter of a century. And yet the bill before us proposes far-reaching and significant changes in terms of expanded appellate rights for servicemembers convicted of wrongdoing. 
   I would support consideration of this measure in the regular order. But the regular order requires a review and consideration of the relative merits of the legislation by subcommittee and committee members with subject matter expertise; a hearing with witnesses who can present expert testimony and offer guidance as to the necessity, effect and scope of any proposals in the bill; a markup or markups after notice to the public and the stakeholders most likely to be impacted by changes; and a committee report that is written and made available to the public and future Congresses that explains the intent and rationale of the proposed changes. 
   Regrettably, the committee and House leadership have decided to short-circuit the process and dispense with every single one of these steps. This is despite the fact that the bill was introduced by its sponsors and referred to the Courts Subcommittee, with no action, more than a year ago. 
   The regular order did not fare any better in the other body where the committee of jurisdiction took up the measure just 2 weeks ago and reported it without a hearing, a report, or any other substantial process or record. 
   Because of the haste with which this proposal is being considered, one might infer there are no questions that ought to be addressed or there are questions that might expose this bill as bad policy if Congress wasn't rushing to judgment. 
   The truth is when a similar measure was introduced last Congress, the general counsel of the Department of Defense raised major questions about the wisdom and necessity of that bill, as well as its likely impact on the department. 
   In a letter dated February 6, 2006, General Counsel William J. Haynes, II, wrote that the Department of Defense ``opposes the proposed legislation.'' 
   He noted the department's view that ``there is demonstrable inequity that needs to be rectified''; that ``opening this additional avenue of Supreme Court appeal will require legal reviews and briefs from numerous counsel on the military departments' Government and Defense Appellate Divisions, the Department of Defense Office of General Counsel, as well as within the Office of the Solicitor General and the Supreme Court,'' and that the legislation provides no ``clear safeguards'' to preclude the possible abuse by petitioners of this new avenue for appellate review.     
   I am particularly concerned by this last point as well as the fact that the bill is written to permit an appellant to repeal the case to the Supreme Court even when the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has declined to review it on the merits, let alone to issue a final decision. 
   Unfortunately, by refusing to permit the subcommittee and committee members to study the issues and properly discharge their responsibilities, the House leadership is forcing Members to make assumptions without any evidence. Just as a court should not convict someone of an offense without due process and evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, Members of Congress should not be placed in the position of changing long-standing policies without some formal process and actual consideration of the evidence for and against the proposal. 
   The Democratic leadership increasingly has resorted to extraordinary tactics to move legislation. In so doing, they do a disservice to the Members of the House and of the people we represent. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, the unasked questions and lack of process compel me for the time being to oppose this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (PROTECTING COURT OFFICIALS OFF SUPREME COURT GROUNDS -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is very similar to the legislation we passed in the House a week ago, H.R. 6855.  
   The bill addresses an issue affecting the safety of the Justices and other officials who work at the United States Supreme Court. 
   First, the legislation extends the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court Police to protect Court officials off the Supreme Court grounds through 2013. The current authorization expires on December 29, 2008. 
   This provision is necessary and noncontroversial. Congress created the original authority in 1982 and has renewed it regularly. The last authorization was 4 years ago. 
   Failure to extend the authority places the Justices and other Supreme Court employees and officers at risk. In light of heightened security threats, it is vital that the Supreme Court Police be empowered to carry out this service without interruption. In fact, Justice Souter was attacked off grounds while jogging in May 2004, the same year we last extended the authority. 
   As with previous authorizations, it is contemplated that the authority extends to the immediate area in the District and surrounding environs. The Marshall Service would provide protection to the Justices when they speak or travel out of the D.C.-Virginia-Maryland metropolitan region. 
   Finally, the legislation prohibits Federal judges from accepting honorary memberships to clubs that are valued in excess of $50. The last item is the only distinction between S. 3296 and the House bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, S. 3296 acknowledges an unfortunate but realistic problem: sometimes the Justices must be protected off Supreme Court grounds. This is a legislative exercise that the Congress has regularly undertaken on behalf of the Court since 1982. 
   I urge the Members to support the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7084, the Webcasting Settlement Act of 2008, grants limited statutory authority to SoundExchange, the government designated entity responsible for disbursing webcasting royalties. Specifically, the bill gives SoundExchange the ability to enter into and negotiate agreements with webcasters for the performance of sound recordings over the Internet. 
   As background, the Copyright Royalty Board last year issued its final rate determination in a webcasting proceeding. That decision, which was the product of a lengthy and extensive adjudicatory process open to all parties, has withstood all legal challenges in the D.C. Court of Appeals. 
   In issuing its final ruling, the CRB established the market rates and terms for the performance of statutorily licensed Internet streamed music for a 5 year period that ends December 31, 2010. 
   Preferring voluntarily negotiated settlements to the continuation of adversarial legal proceedings, SoundExchange and representatives from both the commercial and noncommercial webcasting operators have been attempting to craft a compromise that might end this litigation and provide certainty to sound recording copyright owners and webcasters alike. 
   While progress has reportedly been made, the law does not permit a successfully negotiated agreement to be given effect after the CRB has issued its final ruling. To provide the needed flexibility, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2008 provides a limited window of time to enable the parties to try and reach a voluntary accord. 
   In supporting this legislation and approach, I believe it is particularly important that SoundExchange reach out and expand the number of webcasting representatives with whom they have been meeting. This will ensure all legitimate points of view are considered in negotiating settlements. This authority will accomplish little in the long run if the interests of the public and all significant stakeholders are not carefully weighed and reflected in the final agreements. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I note this proposal is similar to the manner in which Congress resolved a webcasting royalty dispute in 2002. 
   While there are significant differences between H.R. 7084 and the earlier law, this bill is needed at this time. If this authority is utilized properly, it will benefit the public. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7084. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   With the current antitrust exemption for need-based educational aid expiring on September 30, our timely action is necessary. Congressman Delahunt, the sponsor of this bill, has successfully guided it through Congress, and without his efforts, we might not have extended this extension before it expired. 
   I appreciate Mr. Delahunt's leadership because this issue has long been of interest to me. I was a sponsor of the bill that extended the exemption in 1997 and in 2001, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill as well. 
   The bills in 1997 and 2001 were like the bill that passed the House last April, a permanent extension of the moratorium. Both times, the Senate amended those bills, as they did again this year, to a term of years. This exemption originated because Congress disagreed with a suit brought by the Department of Justice against nine colleges for their efforts to use common criteria to assess each student's financial need. Twenty-seven colleges and universities currently are members of the 568 Presidents' Group, which utilizes this antitrust exemption. 
   They include Amherst College, Boston College, Brown University, Claremont McKenna College, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Davidson College, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, Grinnell College, Haverford College, MIT, Middlebury College, Northwestern University, Pomona College, Rice University, Swarthmore College, the University of Chicago, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt University, Wake Forest University, Wellesley College, Wesleyan University, and Williams College. 
   Several other colleges, including Yale and Harvard, participate as advisory members of this group. 
   To my knowledge, there are no complaints about the existing exemption. In fact, a recent GAO study of the exemption found that there has been no abuse of the exemption, and it stated that there has not been an increase in the cost of tuition as a result of the exemption. 
   This bill, as amended by the Senate, would extend the exemption for another 7 years. It would not make any change to the substance of the exemption. I had hoped that Congress would have been able to extend the exemption permanently, but I'm aware that some in the Senate objected. 
   The need-based financial aid system serves a worthy goal that the antitrust laws do not adequately address--making financial aid available to the broadest number of students solely on the basis of demonstrated need. 
   No students who are otherwise qualified should be denied the opportunity to go to one of these schools because of the limited financial means of their families. This bill helps protect need-based aid and need-blind admissions. It has been noncontroversial in the past, and it is supported by a number of higher educational groups. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am an original cosponsor of H.R. 4081, the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act. And I want to thank Congressman Weiner from New York for working hard to bring this legislation to the floor today. 
   This bipartisan bill will help combat cigarette trafficking, which is a growing problem in America. Combating cigarette trafficking is an issue both Congress and the manufacturers want to address together. 
   Taxes on cigarettes vary greatly from State to State. This difference in tax rates creates a market for criminals and organized crime syndicates to purchase cigarettes from one State and smuggle them to another State to resell them below market value and without paying local taxes. 
   The PACT Act closes loopholes in current tobacco trafficking laws and provides law enforcement officials with ways to combat the deceptive methods being used by cigarette traffickers to distribute their products. First, the legislation strengthens the Jenkins Act, a long-standing law that requires vendors who sell cigarettes to out-of-State buyers to report these sales to the buyer's State tobacco tax administrator. The PACT Act makes it a Federal felony for anyone to sell cigarettes by telephone, the mail, or the Internet and not comply with all relevant State tax laws. 
   The PACT Act requires Internet cigarette sellers to verify the purchaser's age and identity through easily accessible databases. This measure protects children and ensures that they cannot anonymously purchase cigarettes from the Internet. 
   The PACT Act also empowers the Attorney General to compile a list of delivery sellers who fail to comply with State tax laws. Any seller who lands on that list will be prohibited from using the U.S. Postal Service or common carriers like FedEx or DHL to deliver their products. 
   The PACT Act creates reasonable procedures to ensure that the Attorney General's list of noncompliant tobacco delivery sellers is both accurate and complete. 
   In summary, Mr. Speaker, the PACT Act prevents the loss of tax revenue, combats cigarette smuggling, and limits children's access to cigarettes; all worthy goals. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill addresses the issue of the disclosure of campaign contributions bundled together by lobbyists. The Judiciary Committee addressed this issue in the last Congress when we adopted an amendment by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) by a vote of 28-4. 
   As a principal supporter of these provisions, Mr. Van Hollen signed the following statement in last year's committee report: ``At the markup, we were able to develop a bipartisan provision concerning the areas of Judiciary Committee jurisdiction, principally the Lobbying Disclosure Act.'' 
   So I'm glad to see a provision brought to the floor today that is so similar to what we did last year. However, I do find it ironic that we are bringing this bill to the floor with little advance notice. 
   Yesterday we received notice that this bill would come up less than an hour before the Rules Committee was to start. That hardly gave us a fair opportunity to offer amendments to the bill. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill and the other bill that we consider today on lobbying reform are supposed to be about open government, but the process by which this bill has been rushed to the floor shows how this House sometimes lacks a fair and open process.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, the base bill addresses the same bundling issue that the Judiciary Committee dealt with in a bipartisan fashion last year. Mr. Van Hollen, the principal supporter of these provisions, signed on to that compromise. 
   I offer this motion to recommit because there is a difference between what was covered by the Van Hollen amendment that was adopted in committee last Congress and what is contained in this legislation authored by Mr. Van Hollen in this Congress, a very big difference. 
   This legislation does not require that bundled contributions to political action committees, often referred to as PACs, be disclosed. Why are PACs omitted from the disclosure requirements in this legislation? 
   As has been recently reported in the BNA Money & Politics Report, ``Democrats' new-found majority status has made them the biggest recipients of campaign money from lobbyists and others, a fact that could increase their wariness about passing strict new rules.'' 
   ``For example, a new analysis posted on the politicalmoneyline.com Web site, and based on Federal Election Commission reports, found that in the first quarter of 2007, Federal political action committees, that is the PACs this legislation exempts, reported giving all Federal candidates $27 million, of which almost $17 million, or 62 percent, went to Democrats, and only 38 percent went to Republicans. The Democrats' newfound fundraising prowess could cause them to have second thoughts about such proposals as increased disclosure of bundled contributions arranged by lobbyists, some observers said.''     
   It appears these observers were correct. The majority has let the color of money dampen their desire for more openness and reform. The loophole in this bill that exempts bundled contributions to PACs is big enough to ride a Democratic donkey through. 
   If we are requiring the disclosure of bundled contributions to political party committees, those same disclosure rules should also apply to contributions to PACs. Party committees represent all members of that party affiliation. PACs, on the other hand, represent more narrow, special interests. Why should the former be exposed to more sunshine, but not the latter? 
   The fact that PACs give more money to Democrats is not a serious answer. Time and again the majority party finds itself presenting legislation that picks favorites, when what the American people want is more honesty and more accountability. This motion to recommit would achieve that by including bundled contributions to PACs under the same provisions that cover Federal candidates, other PACs, and political party committees. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit so that we can have a more open and honest government. To put it another way, what was good for the Democrats last year should be good for the Democrats this year. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people want and deserve a government that operates in the sunlight and not in the shadows.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, we all deplore unethical conduct by Members of Congress and their staff. Each party has their share of examples. The public wants and deserves clean government, and today we finally bring before the House a bill that seems very familiar. That is because the increased disclosures required in the bill we are addressing today are largely those that were contained in H.R. 4975, which was introduced by Congressman David Dreier in the last Congress and passed the House then. 
   Last year's H.R. 4975 contained all of the following provisions: a requirement to disclose postemployment negotiations with private entities; a prohibition on partisan influences on an outside entity's employment decisions; and increased quarterly electronic filing in a public database of lobbyist campaign contributions linked to Federal Elections Commission filings. 
   The legislation also increased civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply, required disclosure by lobbyists of all past executive branch and congressional employment, and contained a prohibition on lobbyists' violation of House gift ban rules. Similar provisions, of course, are included in the legislation before us today. 
   At the Judiciary Committee's markup, I was glad to see that several Republican amendments that would strengthen this bill were adopted by voice vote. One was an amendment offered by Representative Chris Cannon that provides for a 1-year revolving-door ban that would prohibit private lawyers and law firms who enter into contracts with congressional committees from lobbying Congress while under contract to such committee and for 1 year thereafter. 
   Republicans passed nearly identical reform provisions over a year ago. I am pleased to finally see legislation come before the House this Congress that substantially mirrors Republican efforts from the last Congress. 
   The concepts of greater transparency and more accountability are not the property of any one political party, but it just so happens that Republicans led the way in the last Congress by writing a reform package very similar to the one we are considering today. A simple comparison of the provisions in this bill with those in H.R. 4975 from the last Congress will show that what we see on the House floor today is a clear reflection of what we saw on the House floor last year. 
   I had hoped a vote on these measures would have occurred much earlier in this Congress, but I am happy to cast my vote again today for these reforms.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, this bill should be opposed by anyone who wants to protect America from terrorists. 
   It is a pitiful sight to see the majority denying the Director of National Intelligence the tools he needs to protect our country from terrorist attacks. The director warned Congress that ``the House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment.'' 
   According to the Director, the current Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, or FISA, does not allow the intelligence community to be effective. Specifically, the Director is unable to collect crucial information involving foreign terrorists. 
   Neither the Constitution nor Federal law restricts the ability of law enforcement or intelligence agents to monitor overseas communications; however, the bill would require the Director to obtain a court order to monitor calls from a foreign country to the United States. For instance, a foreign terrorist in Iraq who calls another terrorist in New York City would require or could require a court order. That jeopardizes American lives. 
   We are a Nation at war with foreign terrorists who continue to plan deadly attacks against America. We have an urgent need to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   Telecommunications technology has evolved dramatically over the last 30 years. Terrorist tactics are constantly changing in response to our efforts to disrupt their plots, and essential tools that we use must be modernized to keep up with this changing environment. 
   The safety of Americans depends on action by Congress. Al Qaeda recently released a video promising a big surprise in coming weeks. This threat, along with other activity, has heightened the concern among our intelligence agencies. Unfortunately, this bill fails to provide the fix that the Director has repeatedly told us is urgent. 
   First, the bill sunsets in 120 days. In 4 months, we will be right back where we started, dealing with the issue once again. 
   Second, the bill imposes bureaucratic requirements on the FISA process that will hamper efforts to protect America. 
   Third, the bill will interject the FISA court into a role that it has never had before. The bill will make it harder for the Director to do his job. 
   The majority could have solved the problem months ago. In April, the Director submitted to Congress a comprehensive proposal to modernize FISA. That proposal should already have been enacted. The majority failed to do so. 
   I hope, Madam Speaker, that there are no attacks before we revisit the issue and do what we should have done today. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic leadership calls the RESTORE Act of 2007 a compromise. Well, I agree. It compromises our national security. 
   Why do Democrats want to make it more difficult to gather intelligence  about terrorists after 9/11 than before Ð9/11? Since the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was enacted 30 years ago, our terrorist fighting agencies have been able to gather information about terrorists without obtaining a court order. Why burden our intelligence agencies now? Why make it harder to find Osama bin Laden? Why protect terrorists? 
   This bill, for the first time, requires a court order to monitor foreign persons outside the United States. If Osama bin Laden makes a call and we don't know who it is to, a court order must be obtained. That takes many hours and could well mean we miss an opportunity to stop an attack. 
   The bill omits liability protection for telephone companies that provided the Federal Government with critical information after 9/11. These companies deserve our thanks, not a flurry of frivolous lawsuits. 
   The bill sunsets in 4 years, yet our agencies need certainty and permanence so they can develop new procedures and train employees.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the deplorable crime of human trafficking exploits the innocent while it promotes illegal immigration. 
   The legislation we are considering today builds upon the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. That historic legislation combated the trafficking of persons into the sex trade and slavery in the United States and countries around the world through the prosecution of traffickers and through protection and assistance to victims of trafficking. 
   As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Immigration and Claims Subcommittee in 2000, I worked closely with the sponsors of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act to ensure that it protected victims of trafficking without encouraging the smuggling of illegal immigrants. 
   The legislation created a new nonimmigrant T visa for victims of severe forms of trafficking who have cooperated with U.S. law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of traffickers. 
   The William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act judiciously expands on the immigration provisions of the 2000 Act and also adds reasonable protections for unaccompanied alien minors apprehended by our immigration officers. 
   When I reviewed the original bill, my goal was to modify certain provisions that I was concerned would encourage illegal immigration and immigration fraud and leave us vulnerable to dangerous juveniles. 
   I want to thank Chairman CONYERS and Chairwoman LOFGREN for addressing those concerns. 
   I also want to thank Chairman CONYERS for addressing my concerns with the criminal provisions of the original bill. 
   The bill now lessens the burden on prosecutors to prove that criminals forced victims to work in sweatshops or as prostitutes. 
   I do remain concerned about increasing the Federal role in prosecuting cases involving pimping and pandering. These crimes are traditionally prosecuted at the State and local level and I believe that Federal jurisdiction is unnecessary. However, I will not oppose this bill on that basis.

   Mr. Speaker, last month the House considered a similar piece of legislation. As has become the Democrats' antidemocratic custom, no amendments were allowed. The language of the bill was changed hours before it came to the House floor, and Republicans were allowed only a motion to recommit. 
   Today, we are back again to consider legislation to unconstitutionally give D.C. residents a voting representative in Congress. Since the wording of the legislation has been changed without approval by the committee of jurisdiction, we will not have an opportunity to give D.C. residents the right to possess weapons to protect themselves and their families. And the reason we cannot give them that right is the same reason the bill was withdrawn last month: The Democratic leadership is afraid Congress would approve it. 
   It is a shame that a bill that supposedly supports democracy is being brought up in such an undemocratic manner. The majority waived its own rules and will pass a separate tax increase, all to ram through the House an unconstitutional bill they rewrote at the 11th hour with no amendments allowed. 
   At the Judiciary Committee hearing on this bill, Professor Jonathan Turley, someone the majority consults frequently for his views, said: ``Permit me to be blunt. I consider this act to be the most premeditated, unconstitutional act by Congress in decades.'' 
   This legislation was constitutionally suspect last month and it is constitutionally suspect today. The Constitution explicitly says that Members of Congress can only be elected by people who live in States. Article I section 2 reads, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States.'' 
   Judges and legal experts agree that since D.C. is not a State, it cannot elect Members of Congress. In fact, a Federal district judge here in D.C. already has spoken on this point stating clearly, ``We conclude from our analysis of the text that the Constitution does not contemplate that the District may serve as a State for purposes of the apportionment of congressional representatives.'' 
   And the House Judiciary Committee also has spoken on this point. When the House Judiciary Committee under the leadership of Democratic Chairman Peter Rodino in the 95th Congress reported out a constitutional amendment to do what this bill purports to be able to do by statute, the report stated, ``If the citizens of the District are to have voting representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is essential. Statutory action alone will not suffice.'' So what is being attempted with the legislation before us today is something long recognized as requiring a constitutional amendment. 
   Further, this bill unfairly subjects many citizens to unequal treatment. It grants Utah an additional Representative who will run at-large or statewide rather than in the individual district provided for in the redistricting plan the Utah legislature passed last year. The at-large provision creates a situation this country has not seen since the development of the Supreme Court's line of cases affirming the principle of one man, one vote. 
   Under this provision, voters in Utah would be able to vote for two Representatives, their own district Representative and their at-large Representative, whereas voters in every other State would only be able to vote for their one district Representative. The result would be that Utah voters would have more voting power than the voters of every other State. 
   The new bill the majority drafted at the 11th hour even fails to strike the current position of the Delegate that represents Washington, D.C. Currently, that delegate can vote in committee. So this bill not only grants voters in Utah two voting Members when every other voter only gets one, but also gives District voters two votes in committee, one vote for the D.C. Delegate and one vote for the new D.C. Member of Congress. Congratulations to Utah and D.C. voters. 
   Some feel sincerely that the Constitution can be pulled and stretched a  little and interpreted otherwise, but at least we can agree that it is by no means certain that the bill is constitutional. What is certain is that congressional voting for D.C. residents could be obtained by a constitutional amendment. 
   In 1978, Congress approved such a constitutional amendment, but only 16 of the 38 States necessary ratified it. As I mentioned, at the time the Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee said the only legitimate way to give D.C. residents the right to vote in Federal elections was a constitutional amendment as opposed to this kind of legislation. 
   Why is that process being ignored now? Is it because of the fear of failure again? 
   Like many Members of Congress, I favor giving D.C. residents the right to vote for Members of the House and the Senate; but this bill doesn't do that. It limits D.C. residents to voting only for House Members. This bill does not allow D.C. residents to vote for Senators. Why are we considering a bill that gives D.C. residents only half their rights? Isn't that ``taxation without representation''? Or maybe it is ``taxation with half-representation.'' Maybe we should refund D.C. residents half their taxes if this bill passes. 
   There is a solution, and it treats the residents of D.C. better than this bill. It is constitutional. It is more likely to succeed in a constitutional amendment, and it will give D.C. residents the right to vote for both House Members and Senators. 
   D.C. was originally carved out of Maryland. If D.C. were given back to Maryland, except for the Capitol and some Federal buildings, D.C. residents would be residents of a State and have the same voting rights. It has been done before. That part of D.C. that was once part of Virginia was returned to Virginia in 1846, so the precedent is there. Such legislation would only require a majority vote in Congress and in the Maryland legislature. Both are controlled by the Democratic Party. 
   Why are we waiting? Why not the best for D.C. residents? Why are we spending time on a bill that is constitutionally suspect and would be challenged in court? Why are we not acting now to return the District to Maryland and assure D.C. residents the right to vote in all Federal elections as quickly as possible? 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. Any Member who votes for this bill is voting to grant D.C. residents more voting power in the House of Representatives than any of their own constituents now enjoy. That is because this latest version of the bill fails to eliminate the position of D.C. Delegate.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, after nearly a year of delays and months of negotiations, the House today will finally vote on compromise legislation that gives our intelligence community the tools that it needs to protect America. I join my colleague, Mr. Hoekstra, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, and Chairman Reyes, as an original cosponsor of this compromise bill. 
   America's enemies take on many forms, terrorist groups, foreign governments and spies who all pose serious threat to America and its allies. Last August, Congress passed the Protect America Act which provided a temporary solution to the problem. The PAA expired in February. As a result, our intelligence community could not gather two-thirds of the foreign intelligence they needed to protect American lives. 
   From day one, we insisted that any legislation passed by Congress must not interfere with our fundamental ability to collect foreign intelligence. This legislation accomplishes that goal. H.R. 6304 does not extend constitutional protections to foreign terrorists and other foreign targets overseas. The bill does allow the intelligence community to target a foreign person overseas without a court order if critical intelligence would be lost or not collected in a timely manner. 
   We insisted that any legislation passed by Congress include strong liability protections for telecommunications carriers that assisted the government following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, as well as protections for their assistance in the future. H.R. 6304 provides these important protections. 
   We insisted that Congress enact long-term FISA legislation. The bill we have before us today will not sunset until the end of 2012. This compromise legislation also provides strong civil liberties protections for Americans both within the United States and abroad. And it mandates congressional oversight and detailed reports to the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence committees and requires a review by the Inspectors General of the Department of Justice and the intelligence agencies. This compromise is long overdue. It is supported by both the Department of Justice and the intelligence community. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6304 may well be one of the most important pieces of legislation we pass this Congress. 
   For 4 months America has been more vulnerable to attacks by our enemies, because of the refusal by some to bring a commonsense bill to the floor to help the Intelligence Community protect Americans. 
   Many of us would have preferred the bill passed by the Senate. Although this bill may not be ideal, it does represent a compromise between House and Senate Republicans and Democrats. This compromise preserves our ability to conduct a strong, effective foreign intelligence program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague from Texas, Congressman Sessions, for yielding. And, Mr. Speaker, I oppose the conference report to H.R. 1, and I oppose this rule that provides for its consideration as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the conference report claims to protect Americans from foreign terrorists, we should be aware that in fact it does just the opposite. Specifically, changes in the Visa Waiver Program can do us great harm. 
   The Visa Waiver Program enables citizens of certain countries to travel to the United States for tourism or business for stays of 30 days or less without obtaining a visa. To qualify for participation in the Visa Waiver Program, countries must meet certain established criteria which include security standards for their travel documents, and a very low rate of nationals whose visas are denied.  
   The conference report language needlessly lowers the standards of the Visa Waiver Program. How can we consider the expansion of this program knowing that it has already been abused by two terrorists? 
   Peter Gadiel, president of 9/11 Families for a Secure America whose son was killed on 9/11, says, ``As family members of Americans who were murdered on 9/11, we are deeply concerned that some in Congress are working to expand the Visa Waiver Program. It is reckless and irresponsible to consider expanding the program in these perilous times, especially to accept countries that do not even meet current standards. Congress cannot and should not pass a law that would leave the door wide open for more terrorists.'' 
   Lowering the standards for the Visa Waiver Program threatens national security and makes a mockery of our efforts to combat illegal immigration. Many illegal immigrants come to the U.S. legally on a temporary basis and never return to their home country. The conference report allows the administration to permit countries with a history of visa overstayers to participate in the Visa Waiver Program, guaranteeing an increase in illegal immigration. 
   The administration plans to admit countries to the Visa Waiver Program that come nowhere close to meeting current standards. They want to reward countries that have cooperated with us in the war on terror, and we all appreciate the assistance of our allies, but this is no way to conduct foreign policy. 
   It is irresponsible to lower the standards for the Visa Waiver Program and make it easier for terrorists to get into the U.S. This is no way to protect American lives. 
   It is bad enough that the administration doesn't enforce many current immigration laws. It is inexcusable that it would intentionally change the law knowing that it will endanger American lives and increase illegal immigration. It is so obvious that this change in the Visa Waiver Program will result in more illegal immigration and the inevitable entry of terrorists that the administration must now take responsibility for the predictable results. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the conference report as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. SMITH of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Madam Speaker, first of all, I want to thank my friend and colleague from New Jersey for yielding me time. 
   Madam Speaker, this nonbinding resolution is really a nonsensical political statement. It would deprive our troops of the reinforcements they desperately need. Let us trust their judgment and give them the reinforcements they want. 
   How would you feel if you were an American soldier in Iraq and Congress passed this resolution? It is like telling you to fight with one arm behind your back, and that is no way to defeat a terrorist. 
   It is our responsibility to assist our troops, not discourage them by ignoring their needs. This political resolution shortchanges our generals and their troops. Instead, we should support those who are sacrificing their lives to protect ours.     
   Our men and women in uniform desire only to serve their country with honor. Rather than deny them what they want, we should give them the resources they deserve. 
   Unfortunately, many terrorists hate our country, our citizens, our freedoms and our way of life. The global war on terror is fierce; this is no time to appear weak. London, Moscow, Madrid and six other cities around the world have suffered terrorist attacks since 9/11, but there is a reason no terrorist attack has occurred in America since 2001. It is not because some would second-guess our military; it is because our troops want to win, and we should give them that opportunity. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and send the troops this message: We are here to help you.

   Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, in a shocking turn of events, Senator Obama is not the focus of Time magazine's cover story this week. Since the beginning of the Presidential campaign, Senator Obama has been featured on the cover of Time eight times, compared to only three times for Senator McCain. 
   This week's magazine cover has a small photo of Senator Obama with the caption that reads ``Anger Management: Why Obama is Keeping Cool.'' Also in this week's Time is a story titled ``The Lying Game,'' which accuses Senator McCain of negative campaign ads. Of course, the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project found that 77 percent of Senator Obama's recent ads have been negative, far more than Senator McCain's. But Time magazine omitted that crucial fact. 
   Time's cover stories and inside articles explain why Americans by a 5-1 margin believe the media are trying to help Senator Obama win the presidency. Clearly voters recognize biased reporting, and I hope will not be persuaded to support the media's favorite candidate.
