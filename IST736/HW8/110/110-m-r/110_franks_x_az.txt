   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, jihadist terrorism is an existential threat to human peace. Our Terrorist Surveillance Program is the most powerful tactical weapon we have against terrorists. If we knew where every terrorist in the world was tonight, we could end the war on terror within weeks. Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, has repeatedly asked this body to update this critical tool, and he has been met only with stalling from Democrats. 
   This tool only allows us to target America's enemies on foreign soil with electronic surveillance, and it continues to protect those that are on foreign soil including, Madam Speaker, if Osama bin Laden was in a hotel on Capitol Hill, we could not target his phone or e-mail with electronic surveillance without a FISA warrant. 
   This continues to protect Americans. And if we cannot pass this critical legislation in the day in which we live, we not only fail our primary purpose as a Congress; we fail the American people in future generations. 
   Madam Speaker, we need to pass this.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, because the end of the hour grows close, I would now come before this body with a sunset memorial. We intend to repeat this from time to time to chronicle the loss of life by abortion on demand in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is January 29, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand just today. 
   Exactly 35 years today, the tragic judicial fiat called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million children. Mr. Speaker, that is more than 16,000 times the number of innocent lives lost on September 11. 
   Each of the 4,000 children that we lost today had at least four things in common. They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. And each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, those noble heroes lying in frozen silence out in Arlington National Cemetery did not die so America could shred her own Constitution, as well as her own children, by the millions. It seems that we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the genocidal crimes of past generations, those who allowed their courts to strip the black man and the Jew of their constitutional personhood, and then proceeded to murderously desecrate millions of these, God's own children. 
   Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blindness and invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn. 
   Perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: ``No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.'' 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the Declaration, not the casual notion, but the Declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our 
   commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. 
   And yet today, Mr. Speaker, in this body we fail to honor that commitment. We fail our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 innocent American babies who died without the protection we should have been given them. 
   And so for them in this moment, Mr. Speaker, without yielding my time, I would invite anyone inclined to join me for a moment of silence on their behalf. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this discussion tonight presents this Congress and the American people with two destiny questions. 
   The first that all of us must ask ourselves is very simple: Does abortion really kill a baby? If the answer to that question is ``yes,'' there is a second destiny question that inevitably follows. And it is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we allow ourselves to be dragged by those who have lost their way into a darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the predatory survival of the fittest prevails over humanity? Or will America embrace her destiny to lead the world to cherish and honor the God-given miracle of each human life? 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said that every baby comes with a message, that God has not yet despaired of mankind. And I mourn that those 4,000 messages sent to us today will never be heard. Mr. Speaker, I also have not yet despaired. Because tonight maybe someone new, maybe even someone in this Congress, who heard this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill a baby, that it hurts mothers more than anyone else, and that nearly 50 million dead children in America is enough. And that America is great enough to find a better way than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on another day yet to come, may that be the day that we hear the cries of the unborn at last. May that be the day we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   This is a sunset memorial, Mr. Speaker. It is January 29, 2008, in the land of free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is July 30, 2008 in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Madam Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,973 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least 4 things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Madam Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Madam Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Madam Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   So Madam Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,973 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Madam Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, nearly 100 years ago the Department of War made a contract with two all-American men who would revolutionize human life as we know it. Those Ohio-born Wright brothers had a starry-eyed vision, tenacity, and brilliance that transformed their vision from theory to reality when they contracted with the United States Army to build a flying machine for the use of the United States Armed Forces. 
   Since then the United States Air Force has proven that mortals can  break the sound barrier many times over in heavier-than-air, high-powered aircraft defying, it seems, the very forces of gravity and transcending the previously incontrovertible dimensions of human capacity. Even at this very moment, the Air Force is working to defend our assets in a new frontier of national security: space itself. 
   Mr. Speaker, this year marks the 60th anniversary of the year in which the United States Air Force became an official separate military service within the Department of Defense. Since then, the ability to protect the forces of freedom all over the world through flight in air, space, and cyberspace has transformed warfare in a way that perhaps only can be truly appreciated by the enemies of liberty. 
   Air power was born through the courage and resilience with which our noble men and women in the Air Force overcame in the crucibles of World War I, World War II, and the Cold War. And today the courageous airmen and women of this generation are shaping history still as the enemies of liberty feel the just fury of the Air Force in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The U.S. Air Force has risen to meet the challenge of international terrorism by attaining a new level of technological capability to surveil a battle space virtually encompassing the entire planet. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have the precious honor of representing the Second Congressional District of Arizona, which includes Luke Air Force Base, a vital strategic asset to our national security and the largest fighter wing in the United States Air Force. Luke Air Force Base trains over 95 percent of all U.S. Air Force F-16 pilots and over 50 percent of all U.S. fighter pilots. The commanders at Luke are entrusted with the solemn mission of effectively equipping the Nation's greatest F-16 pilots and maintainers to be deployed as mission-ready war fighters. It is a center and symbol of excellence to the Air Force and a beacon of courage, honor, military strategy, and effectiveness for our armed services throughout America. 
   As the Nation commends 60 years of noble and selfless service in the cause of the freedom and security of these United States, it is an honor for me to stand here on the floor of the United States House of Representatives and thank Luke Air Force Base and the entire United States Air Force for their selfless dedication and their commitment to the cause of human freedom. None of us can ever fully convey the gratitude that we owe to these warriors who have answered liberty's call to service and sacrifice. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, may I pause this moment and offer my deepest and heartfelt gratitude, and that of the entire Nation, to the gallant men and women of the United States Air Force who have now, for these 60 years, borne upon their noble wings of freedom the cause of America and the hope of humanity. 
   God bless them all, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.

We failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have been given them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this discussion presents this Congress and the American people with two destiny questions. 
   The first that all of us must ask ourselves is very simple: Does abortion really kill a baby? If the answer is ``yes,'' there is a second destiny question that inevitably follows. 
   And it is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we allow ourselves to be dragged by those who have lost their way into a darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the predatory survival of the fittest prevails over humanity? Or will America embrace her destiny to lead the world to cherish and honor the God-given miracle of each human life? 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said that every baby comes with a message, that God has not yet despaired of mankind. And I mourn that those 4,000 messages sent to us today will never be heard. Mr. Speaker, I also have not yet despaired. Because tonight maybe someone new, maybe even someone in this Congress, who hears this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,825 days spent legally killing nearly 50 million children in America is enough, and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust, is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, according to Secretary of Defense Gates, Iranian weapons have begun to flow into Afghanistan in recent months. We know this much for certain. What we do not know is if indeed this is an official sanction of the Iranian government. 
   However, some in the intelligence community believe that this effort is on the part of a branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which are responsible for shipping these deadly weapons to the Taliban. If this is true, Mr. Chairman, the implications must be realized by this Congress, because it means that Shiite Iran is disregarding sectarian differences with Sunni Taliban in order to unite with them in an effort to undermine U.S. efforts for peace in the nascent democratic Afghanistan. 
   Mr. Chairman, this means that the nation of Iran is determined to back non-state Muslim militants to terrorize countries who desire peace, tolerance and stability. We saw them do this last year in Lebanon through their proxy Hezbollah against the nation of Israel. We now see this happening in Iraq as well. 
   There are two major elements, Mr. Chairman, when we consider the danger of an enemy to this Nation. We first have to assess their intention or the will of an enemy to harm the U.S. or our allies. It is clear that the Taliban, Hamas, Hezbollah and groups like them hate governments like ours that uphold the rule of law and uphold the effort to protect freedom of action, thought and religion. They hate the United States because of this, Mr. Chairman. They hate a tolerant Europe, they hate the new democratic Afghanistan, they hate pluralistic Israel and they hate Lebanon. They have an insidious and determined will to tyrannize. They need only the means or the capacity to bring that hate to fruition. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is the second element. A true threat exists to this Nation's freedom when those who are committed to tyranny and to disrupt peace are met with the means and the capacity to do so. Iran is providing the means to non-state terrorist actors who possess the will to use them.     
   We must not let this continue. My amendment requires that the Secretary of Defense provide Congress with a semiannual report that informs us of the Iranian-made weapons being provided to the Taliban, and any evidence that the sale is endorsed by the government of Iran. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is vital that this body understands the intention of Iran  because they may some day very soon possess a very frightening capacity that threatens the potential future of the world and the peace of free people across the world. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I would now like to yield to the distinguished ranking member of the committee, Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (WAR IS UGLY BUT TYRANNY IS UGLIER -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. As usual, he's always more kind than he should be. 
   Mr. Speaker, today, as we embrace the grave responsibility of discussing an issue that will have a profound impact on future American generations, it seems very appropriate to remind ourselves of the ideal that gave birth to the United States in the very first place. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   It puts us all on even ground, Mr. Speaker, but, whether we realize it or not, most of the important discussions in this Chamber, including the one in this moment, center around whether we still believe those words. 
   In these hours, America finds herself at war with an inexpressibly dangerous ideology that is the antithesis of those words and everything that is the American ideal. What concerns me most, Mr. Speaker, is that this is a war between an ideology that is committed to the death and destruction of freedom and the subjugation of the entire world and is one waged against the world's free people who still remain primarily asleep. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ideological war did not begin on 9/11. It began many years ago when certain Muslim extremists embraced a divergent Islamist dogma that dictates that all infidels must die. It was called then, as it should be now, Jihad. 
   This is the same Jihadist ideology that murdered Israeli athletes in 1972; that took American hostages in Iran; that murdered Marines in their barracks in 1983; that bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, Riyadh in 1995, the Khobar towers in 1996, the embassy in 1998, the U.S.S. Cole in 2000; and that brutally murdered scores of little children on their opening day of school in Beslan, Russia. And then, Mr. Speaker, this same dark ideology massacred nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11. 
   The ideology of Islamist Jihad leads to the practice of decapitating humanitarians with hacksaws on television while the victims scream for mercy. Just last month, one of those most recent videos on the Internet showed a member of the Taliban beheading a man accused of spying. That member of the Taliban was 12 years old. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is a wake-up call to this planet if we will only listen. This same hatred causes Islamic Jihadists to cowardly hide behind women and children while launching rockets deliberately targeting innocent civilians, and continually breaking treaties of peace, and forcing children to blow themselves to pieces to effect the murder of other innocents, and all this while their mothers scream for joy. 
   As we anticipate future actions of the Jihadists, we should consider, as Mr. Wamp has so eloquently said earlier today, the words of the terrorists themselves. And at the risk of repeating some of the things that Congressman Wamp said, I believe that these kinds of words are so important for America and for the people in this body to hear. 
   Al Qaeda's Al-Zawahiri said this. He said, ``The Jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even within the Crusaders' own homes.'' 
   Al-Manar said on BBC, ``Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan, America, is absolute. Regardless of how the world has changed after 11 September, Death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America.'' 
   Al-Zarqawi said this of America's leaders, ``They are aware that if the Islamic giant wakes up it will not be satisfied with less than the gates of Rome, Washington, Paris, and London.''  
   Al-Muhajir, Osama bin Laden's latest lieutenant in Iraq, said this. He said, ``The fire has not and will not be put out and our swords, which have been colored with your blood, are thirsty for more of your rotting heads.'' 
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said this, ``We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are the most vulnerable. The Jews love life, so that is what we shall take away from them. We are going to win because they love life and we love death.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, then we hear Democrats in this body say things like, ``The savagery of the terrorists is not relevant,'' or even the most senior Democrat in this House is quoted as saying, ``I don't take sides for or against Hezbollah, or for or against Israel.'' The senior Democrat in the other body said, ``This war is lost.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that kind of blind relativism that deliberately ignores all truth and equates merciless terrorism with free nations defending themselves and their innocent citizens is more dangerous to humanity than terrorism itself, and it is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face. 
   Osama bin Laden's deputy, Al-Zawahiri, said this. He made it clear in his book, Knights Under the Prophet's Banner, al Qaeda's most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of a state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world. He wrote, ``Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching Jihad against them require a Muslim authority, established on Muslim land. Without achieving this goal, our actions will mean nothing.'' 
   For God's sake, I hope we're listening to people like that. Mr. Speaker, such a Jihadist state would be the ideal launching pad for future attacks on the West. 
   Bin Laden himself has stated, ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It's either victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the terrorists regard Iraq as their central front in their war against humanity; and if we're to understand our enemy and this war, we must recognize Iraq as the central front in our war against Jihad. Our courageous and noble soldiers understand that, and our enemy certainly understands that. 
   Osama bin Laden himself said, ``The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this Third World War. It is raging in the land of the two rivers, Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that this struggle in Iraq is not crucial to winning the war against Islamist Jihad, then for God's sake I wish they would explain that to the terrorists, because they don't understand it. 
   Brink Lindsey put this all succinctly. He said, ``Here is the grim truth: We are only one act of madness away from a social cataclysm unlike anything our country has ever known. After a handful of such acts, who knows what kind of civilizational breakdown might be in store?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot deny that we are fighting a war against an insidiously dangerous and evil ideology that is bent on the destruction of the Western World, and they would like nothing better than to decapitate this country by detonating a nuclear blast 100 yards from here. To allow Jihadists to declare victory in Iraq will serve only to hasten such a day. 
   The free nations of the world once had opportunity to address the insidious rise of the Nazi ideology in its formative years when it could have been dispatched without great cost. But they delayed, and the result was atomic bombs falling on cities in the world, 50 million people dead worldwide, and the swastika's shadow nearly plunging the planet into Cimmerian night. 
   Mr. Speaker, Jihadists believe they have a critical advantage over the free world. They believe their will is stronger than ours and that they need only to persevere; and, Mr. Speaker, the words of neutrality and retreat have only encouraged them in that belief. 
   We must realize that this is a war that is fundamentally a battle between good and evil, between light and darkness, between individual freedom and totalitarian repression; and we must realize that our enemy is absolutely blinded with an absolute hate for all the Western World. 
   They also recognize that America is the flagship of human freedom, and if America allows terrorists to conquer us both on the battlefield and in our will to fight the result will be that humanity will be left to face a future that is dark beyond expression. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think that probably Ronald Reagan could close this in the best way. He said to our soldiers who nobly fought in Vietnam, ``Let us tell those who fought in that war that we will never again ask young men to fight and possibly die in a war our government is afraid to win.'' 
   And I'm afraid sometimes that we forget the heroism of the past. So let me just close with a prayer that one of our great Presidents, Franklin Roosevelt, said many years ago, as today we mark the 63rd anniversary of the D-Day invasion to liberate Europe from Hitler's fascism. U.S. forces alone sustained over 6,500 casualties in that 1 day, twice what we've endured in 5 years in Iraq. Knowing the gravity of the operation, Franklin Roosevelt, one of the Nation's most liberal Presidents, said and allow me to close in those words: 
   ``Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the haven of home. Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom. And for us at home, fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of great sacrifice. And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. Thy will be done, Almighty God. Amen.''

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (INTRODUCING THE DALIT RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon I introduced a resolution calling for the United States to address the ongoing problem of untouchability in India. Last December Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recognized the similarities between untouchability in his country and Apartheid in South Africa. It is now time for this Congress, Mr. Speaker, to speak out about this ancient and particularly abhorrent form of persecution and segregation, even if it is occurring in a country many consider to be one of America's closest allies. This Congress must urge an end to the social discrimination and injustice faced by the nearly 250 million people known as Dalits and Tribals in India. 
   Although the Indian constitution guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms for all Indians, the untouchables continue to face widespread social and caste injustices. Article 17 of the Constitution outlaws untouchability. However, despite numerous laws enacted for the protection and betterment of the Dalits and Tribals, they are still considered outcasts in Indian society and are treated as such. 
   At best, untouchability involves social segregation, including separate educational facilities and drinking water and restaurants. This is a sad and familiar tune to many of us familiar with the history of our own country. At worst, untouchability entails widespread violence against untouchable women, especially in the form of rape with impunity, being targeted for abortions, and comprises the majority of temple prostitute and women trafficked from India. 
   The untouchables are poor, Mr. Speaker. Their most basic needs are not fulfilled, and they face great difficulties in accessing employment, education, food, and health care. Most are among the poorest people on the face of the Earth, living on less than $1 per day. Moreover, Dalit women are often sold into bondage, prostitution, and there is an increasing religious persecution against the Dalits and untouchables who change their faith. In 2005, USAID stopped funding an organization after it was revealed that they were preventing many of these women from leaving prostitution. In a recent instance, a whole Dalit village was forced to leave their tribal land because they had converted to Christianity in a state that had laws against conversion. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a direct statement by the United States Congress that untouchability is an unacceptable practice on the part of America's largest trading partner and close ally. We appreciate that Prime Minister Singh and many others have recognized that this is a serious social problem that needs to be confronted, and we urge the rest of Indian society and American diplomats, aid workers, and businesses working in India to do the same and to work toward the eradication of casted discrimination in India. 
   This resolution encourages our government to work with India to find new approaches to an age-old problem. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this resolution will ensure that we as a government and we as an American people in no way encourage or enforce caste discrimination and untouchability through our policies with India or through foreign aid or direct aid in any way. 
   And I urge my colleagues to join me in calling on the Indian government and the world community to look with compassion upon India's untouchables and reach out to one of the poorest and most oppressed peoples on the face of the Earth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, before we vote on this bill, we need to remind ourselves one more time, the jihadist terrorism is what this debate is all about. 
   Brink Lindsey put it in such succinct terms when he said, ``Here is the grim truth: We are only one act of madness away from a social cataclysm unlike anything our country has ever known. After a handful of such acts, who knows what kind of civilization breakdown might be in store?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as we anticipate future actions of jihadists and our place in Iraq, we would do well to consider their words very carefully. Al Qaeda's al-Zawahiri said this: ``The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even within the crusaders' own homes.'' 
   Osama bin Laden himself said: ``The most important and serious issue today for the whole world is this third world war. It is raging in the land of the two rivers,'' Iraq. ``The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that the struggle in Iraq is not crucial to winning the war against jihadism, then for God's sake, I wish they would explain that to the terrorists. Instead, we hear the most senior Democrat in this House quoted as saying, ``I don't take sides for or against Hezbollah, or for or against Israel.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a blind relativism that deliberatively ignores all truth and equates merciless terrorism with free nations defending themselves and their innocent citizens is more dangerous to humanity than terrorism itself, and it is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face. 
   Because of this kind of relativist neutrality, jihadists now believe they have a crucial advantage over the free world and its people. They believe their will is far stronger than ours, and that they need only to persevere to prevail. 
   Mr. Speaker, the passage of this bill will only encourage them in that belief. And if liberals in this body are willing to see freedom defeated in Iraq, they must also be willing to take responsibility for almost certainly what will follow. 
   Mr. Speaker, finally, we can have peace with jihadists tomorrow if we are willing to surrender today. And that kind of surrender will be on their terms, and it will ultimately bring a nuclear jihad to our children. Future American generations will despise this one. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is still time to defeat this bill. Let us not take this ominous step in this direction.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. I certainly add my own feelings toward the words that you just spoke on behalf of CHARLIE NORWOOD. None of us know when we have to step from this floor for the last time. This man, while he was here, maintained a sense of honor. He was always committed to doing those things that would bring better hope to future generations. He was honorable among us, and we can certainly salute that kind of brotherhood that he represented to all of us. 
   I certainly pass along my own condolences and also congratulations to his family, because in a sense CHARLIE NORWOOD's dreams were fulfilled in that he dreamed to be a statesman, and he certainly rose to that occasion in every way. 
   I suppose it is in a sense a little bit of a statement to all of us that the brief moments that we have here should be spent debating those things that would truly make a difference, not only for this generation, but for whatever generations remain to America. 
   Madam Speaker, tonight I think that is what I would like to talk about. There is an old Indian Iroquois quote that says that the secret to the universe is in the true naming of things, and as we debate tonight, it is easy for us to see each other as the opposition or as the enemy. 
   I think tonight, if all else should fail us, we must consider who the real enemy here is. This one is a little different than those that we faced in the past, because even though there are parallels, this is an ideology. This is not just a group of people that we face in Islamic jihadism. It is an ideology that I believe has the seeds of danger in it for the entire human family. 
   I think it becomes very, very important for us all to understand that one thing, because in a sense right now the battle that goes on across the world related to terrorism is a battle between those who are deeply committed with their lives to the destruction of the Western World on one side of the equation, and on the other side of the equation the opposition is largely asleep, and I think that nothing represents a greater danger to us than not only knowing what we face, but being completely oblivious to its potential. 
   I believe that the ideology of jihad has the ability and even the propensity to germinate and one day threaten the entire human family. And even though America is engaged in some type of fight against terrorism and jihadism in nearly 70 countries across the world, whether we realize it or not, in the eyes of the leaders of jihad, Iraq is the frontline of that conflict, and it becomes profoundly important that we recognize it from their perspective, because in any ideology, one must understand that to grow, it must somehow take root and resonate in the hearts of the potential recruits. 
   One of the things that causes this ideology to grow is a sense of victory on the battlefield, and leader after leader in the jihadist movement have said that Iraq is critical to the survival of their ultimate goal.     
   I know that we have faced dangerous ideologies before. There are a lot of people who have parents and family members that faced the Nazis down in World War II, and yet just a cursory glance at history helps us understand that the parallel here is real. 
   There was a time when the Nazis were just a bunch of lunatics riding bicycles across France, and nobody paid much attention to them. They spewed a hate and a sense of superiority over their fellow human beings and even a sense of being willing to subordinate the innocent life of others for their own ideology. We did not pay much attention to them until it began to grow and the fires of this ideology began to spread across Europe. 
   In the final analysis, the Western world and people of freedom did not wake up until this thing had become a monster, and when we finally did engage it, the ensuing war was so difficult and so horrible that at the end of the day, 50 million people had died. 
   I will just say this, Madam Speaker, Winston Churchill warned us in a way that I think is pretty profound. He said, If you will not fight, then you can easily win without bloodshed. If you will not fight, then your victory will be sure and not too costly. You may come to the moment when you will have to fight and all the odds against you with only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse moment. You may have to fight when there is no hope for victory because it is still better to perish than to live as slaves. 
   I submit in the ideology that we face tonight that is the equation that is before us.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (RELIGIOUS FREEDOM -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Garrett for this privilege of this time. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe the cornerstone of all human freedom is that of religious freedom. Indeed, a small separatist church congregation in England possessed a desire so strong to practice their faith freely that it compelled them to cross the ocean in a little wooden ship called the Mayflower. 
   While theirs was a quest to be able to practice the faith of Christianity, a central tenet of their Christian faith was the belief that all human beings were given the right by God to embrace whatever religious conviction they truly held in their hearts, and that human beings should protect that right for each other. 
   Madam Speaker, today we considered and passed H. Res. 847, ``recognizing the importance of Christmas and the Christian faith.'' Of course, Madam Speaker, there will be those who will criticize any effort to recognize a particular faith or holiday. However, Madam Speaker, aside from the debatable aspects of this resolution, or any other, those who are even slightly acquainted with history know that the Bible, the founding document of the Christian faith, was the essential rationale and substance that inspired our Declaration of Independence and was, further, the bedrock foundational document of the Western world. 
   The objective of this resolution is to honor those Judeo-Christian principles that have shaped American history and policy since the founding of our Nation and that have informed and influenced our ideas of justice and equality 7 years into the 21st century. Indeed, Madam Speaker, it was the Christian principles hailed in this resolution that led our country to be the very first beacon of religious freedom in the history of the world and, further, to finally reject the practice of human slavery that had plagued civilization across the world for nearly 7,000 years. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that it would be wrong for this body to ever pass any law that would compel or forbid any person in this Nation or any other nation to accept or reject any article of faith, so long as they did not deprive their fellow Americans or human beings of those same constitutional rights. However, in recognizing the influence of Christianity upon Western civilization, we are also commending the unshakable commitment of Christian principles, the very ones that compelled our Founding Fathers to resolutely declare that all men are created equal by God himself, and that because they are created equal, they are also created free, Madam Speaker, and that includes being free to embrace the religion of their own conviction. 
   Religious freedom is a central component of the Christian faith this resolution references. Indeed, the message of the one born on Christmas Day was from a savior who came to offer every member of the human family ultimate and eternal freedom, even at the cost of his own life. 
   Madam Speaker, as we enjoy our religious freedom in this season of peace, may we not forget that at this very moment American men and women in uniform are fighting a battle across the world so that all Americans might continue to freely exercise their faith, and that that right might ultimately some day be extended to all of mankind. President Roosevelt probably said it best, Madam Speaker. He said in his Christmas Eve Nation message to the Nation, December 24, 1941, ``Our strongest weapon in this war is that conviction of the dignity and brotherhood of man, which Christmas Day signifies more than any other day or any other symbol. Against enemies who preach the principles of hate and practice them, we set our faith in human love and in God's care for us and all men everywhere.'' 
   So, Madam Speaker, with those feelings in mind and with love in my heart for people of every faith, let me here on this floor exercise my own religious freedom and wish you and everyone else under the sound of my voice a happy, holy, and merry Christmas.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (ABORTION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Well, I thank the gentleman for his courageous and noble leadership on the part of the unborn for so long. 
   Madam Speaker, Planned Parenthood is the world's largest promoter and provider of abortion on demand for any reason or for no reason. With almost 900 clinics in this Nation alone, it is by far the largest abortion provider in America and accounts for one in five of all abortions performed in this country. But because this giant, billion dollar, death-dealing organization operates under the disguise of a ``family planning'' charity, it receives over $330 million of American taxpayers' money every single year. 
   Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, has long since passed away, but the legacy of her work lives on, Madam Speaker. She once said, ``We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population.'' 
   Her insidious vision of a world where her ideal of the ``survival of the fittest'' is advanced through race-targeted abortions continues to thrive through the deliberate expansion of Planned Parenthood clinics in the high minority populations of this country. 
   Both the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the Centers for Disease Control have reported that a huge majority of abortion clinics are located in minority neighborhoods, and some experts estimate that number to be higher than 75 percent. 
   While African Americans represent approximately 13 percent of our population, more than 35 percent of abortions are performed on African Americans. In fact, more than one in three abortions performed by Planned Parenthood are performed on little African American babies. 
   Recent Internet postings reveal Planned Parenthood's willingness to accept donations specifically earmarked for the abortion of an African American baby. In other words, Madam Speaker, a willingness to accept money specifically designated to kill a baby for no other reason than that he or she was black.     
   One hundred and fifty years ago, the infamous Dred Scott decision in the United States Supreme Court declared that the black man was not a person under the Constitution. That decision put the Supreme Court's legal imprimatur on a practice that had brutally enslaved more than 4 million innocent human beings from Africa. It took a horrible civil war to reverse that despicable decision. It also took the courage, and ultimately the life, of President Abraham Lincoln, who had guided America through those dark moments because he believed in a day that would one day come when the black man and the white man could walk together in the sunlight of human freedom. 
   And more than a century later, Dr. Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the memorial dedicated to President Lincoln and gave a speech that would forever change the course of history because it reminded America of her creed that all men are still created equal, and it helped Americans to finally begin, once and for all, to put away the evil of bigotry and prejudice against their fellow human beings of a different skin color. It was a great day, Madam Speaker. But only 10 years later our memories would wane again and another Supreme Court decision called Roe v. Wade, along with the help of Planned Parenthood, precipitated the murder of more than 12 million African American babies. 
   Madam Speaker, every victory gained in the battle to defeat slavery, every accomplishment that came through the civil rights movement is being completely overshadowed by this unspeakable tragedy. 
   It is time that Americans stood up together again and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and worked to overturn decisions by our own courts, whether in the Dred Scott decision of 1857 or the Jim Crow laws that continued through the 1960s. And we are still courageous and compassionate enough to stop the funding of a bigoted organization like Planned Parenthood. 
   Madam Speaker, it has been said that a government is what it spends. For this government to continue to appropriate one more penny of the American taxpayers' money to an organization that kills unborn children on the basis of race or for any other reprehensible reason is a disgrace that undermines the core essence of America and betrays everything that our soldiers lying out in Arlington National Cemetery died to preserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is April 23, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,875 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood  of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, died and screamed as they did so, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, no one could hear them. 
   And all of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution, it says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. And it seems too sad to me, Mr. Speaker, that this Sunset Memorial may be the only acknowledgement or remembrance these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber. 
   So as a small gesture, I would ask those in the Chamber who are inclined to join me for a moment of silent memorial to these lost little Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard this Sunset Memorial tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,875 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is April 23, 2008, 12,875 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children, this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (TRIBUTE TO MARGUERITE FREEMAN, TEACHER OF TRUTH AND LOVING ENCOURAGER TO CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, this last Sunday one of America's grandest ladies turned 97 years old. And tonight it is a sincere privilege for me to stand here in this well to speak a few words of heartfelt tribute to a woman whose impact on three generations of children will be felt in the human family I believe even after this Chamber is dust. 
   I knew this special lady as Mrs. Freeman. Four decades have passed since I gathered my belongings as a fourth grader and left the warmth and safety of her classroom for the very last time. As we all reflect on our childhood, I suppose each of us has that one teacher in our memory who affected our lives more than any other. My memory of her is always that of a truly warm and elegant lady who completely personified class, dignity, and grace. 
   Mrs. Freeman was the model teacher that I believe every teacher truly aspires to be. She made books come alive in class. She made every lesson exciting, every life was important. She made us realize that each of us had an important part to play that only we could play. This gracious lady encouraged us to pursue a standard of integrity simply by the way she lived. And in those times when we disappointed her, Mr. Speaker, she never failed to correct us truthfully but gently, and she was always willing to forgive us and to affirm that we were fully restored in her eyes. 
   While there were so many ways that the guidance of Mrs. Freeman prepared me for life, perhaps the greatest gift I ever received from her and have carried with me through all these years was that of her words of encouragement. I may never have come to this Chamber at all, Mr. Speaker, without some of the soul-lifting things that she said to me. And I am convinced that not a day goes by that I am not affected by those words. 
   And I can say to you, Mr. Speaker, that not a day ever went by in her class that did not include a moment when Mrs. Freeman looked into the eyes of one of her students and, with a warm smile and a loving wink, she would utter those simple words ``You can do it.'' I know without a doubt that mine was only one of hundreds of lives that were changed forever by those magnificent words, not only because they empowered and encouraged but because we each knew that she meant those words from the depth and core of her soul. 
   There were many other lessons she left us with that I have greatly cherished on this road to the United States Congress. When one of us would be left out, she would come along beside us and encourage us with that authentically gracious and generous spirit that characterized her life. When my home burned down, Mr. Speaker, taking nearly every material belonging I had, including my school books, and leaving me feeling a little lost, it was Mrs. Freeman that reminded me that God had spared all of my family and that the rest really didn't matter. And I knew then and I know now more than ever that she was so very right. 
   She also taught me through school plays just to speak my lines sincerely from my heart, and I seek to do that even tonight, Mr. Speaker. Few gifts could have served me better over these many years. 
   When I first ran for the United States Congress, this sweet lady made the trip to attend one of the major events supporting my candidacy. She made a campaign contribution and included a note that ended with those words, ``You can do it.'' 
   But a narrow loss in that election, Mr. Speaker, was a deep disappointment. And still I received a letter from her shortly afterward, and once again she offered hope and encouragement that I will cherish as long as I live. But it was her last five words that I remember most. They were the hallmark phrase of Marguerite Freeman, teacher of truth and loving encourager to children. Her letter closed with those words, ``You can still do it.'' 
   Mother Theresa once said, ``Kind words can be short and easy to speak, but their echoes are endless.'' Mr. Speaker, if Mrs. Freeman could be here in this Chamber tonight, I would say to her something like this: that words fail me to express the loving impact that you have had on my life and so many others. And I truly believe that this generation and many generations to come will inherit the beauty and legacy of those endless echoes of your encouragement that you cast into the hearts of so many of those children whose priceless gift it was to call you teacher. Beloved and gallant lady, may God bless you forever.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is October 3, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of . innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 13,038 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   So Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 13,038 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is October 3, 2008, 13,038 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children; this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, it is March 5, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand--just today. That is more than the number of innocent American lives that were lost on September 11th, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,826 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million children. And all of them had at least four things in common. 
   They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. And each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. 
   All the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, those noble heroes lying in frozen silence out in Arlington National Cemetery did not die so America could shred her own Constitution, as well as her own children, by the millions. It seems that we are never quite so eloquent as when we condemn the genocidal crimes of past generations, those who allowed their courts to strip the black man and the Jew of their constitutional personhood, and then proceeded to murderously desecrate millions of these, God's own children. 
   Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn. 
   Perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: ``No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion Declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. 
   And yet another day has passed, Mr. Speaker, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them.  
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this discussion presents this Congress and the American people with two destiny questions. 
   The first that all of us must ask ourselves is very simple: Does abortion really kill a baby? If the answer is ``yes,'' there is a second destiny question that inevitably follows. 
   And it is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we allow ourselves to be dragged by those who have lost their way into a darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the predatory survival of the fittest prevails over humanity? Or will America embrace her destiny to lead the world to cherish and honor the God-given miracle of each human life? 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said that every baby comes with a message, that God has not yet despaired of mankind. And I mourn that those 4,000 messages sent to us today will never be heard. Mr. Speaker, I also have not yet despaired. Because tonight maybe someone new, maybe even someone in this Congress, who hears this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,826 days spent legally killing nearly 50 million children in America is enough, and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust, is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn. May that be the day we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is March 5, 2008--12,826 days since Roe v. Wade--in the land of free and the home of the brave.

And that's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number that were killed on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day.

So as the smallest gesture, I would ask for those in the Chamber who are inclined to join me for a moment of silent memorial to these lost little Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,930 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank Mr. Forbes, and I thank the Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, if, indeed, our Founding Fathers were right, that all men are created, then it follows that all men of reason much surely sense their duty to reverently acknowledge their Creator. 
   In the modern world of abundance in which we live, I am afraid that we have become arrogant and often educated beyond our own common sense to the extent that we have forgotten sometimes that self-evident truth. But Mr. Speaker, how fortunate we are that those who went before us did not forget that foundational truth and they held it in their hearts. 
   President George Washington, on the very same day that Congress finished drafting the first amendment, declared, ``It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to Obey His will, to be grateful for His benefits, and to humbly implore His protection and favor.'' William Penn, one of our great champions of liberty and founder of what would become Pennsylvania said, ``Those people who will not be governed by God will be ruled by tyrants.'' And President Andrew Jackson said, ``The Bible is the bedrock on which our Republic rests.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, today the secular left often seeks to destroy any vestige of this Nation's religious heritage in history. They seek not to prevent the establishment of religion, but rather, to relentlessly destroy the free exercise thereof. Indeed, they are determined to rewrite America's history, devoid of any mention or trace of the very ideal that gave birth to this Nation in the first place. If left unchecked, they will not stop until they have pulled down the very last Christian cross or Star of David out in Arlington National Cemetery. But, Mr. Speaker, they will not succeed. Because, you see, there is something in the heart of every human being that knows that beyond this world, beyond the stars, and beyond life itself is an Almighty God that holds each one of us in His hands. Our Founding Fathers knew that truth, Mr. Speaker. They knew that America herself was proof that indeed there is an angel that still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm. I pray for the sake of America and all that made her great tonight that this generation does not forget this great, immutable, self-evident truth that for more than two centuries has been the bedrock foundation of the greatest Republic in the history of mankind.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, in an age of sophisticated missile development and rampant nuclear proliferation, the United States must continue to invest its attention and resources in developing and fielding defenses to stay ahead of the ominous threat of ballistic missiles. 
   It is critical that the United States continue to work with our friends and allies who wish to cooperate in our mission to develop a robust ballistic missile defense against our common enemies. 
   The United States is currently working with NATO and negotiating with European countries about the possibility of placing a ballistic missile interceptor site in Europe. This is an example of a missile defense opportunity that could offer protection for the U.S. homeland and our European friends from a perilous threat that we share, ballistic missiles potentially carrying nuclear warheads, being launched from rogue nations such as Iran. 
   Mr. Chairman, incidentally, Iran is projected to have missiles capable of reaching the United States homeland within 7 years. 
   As it currently stands, this bill prohibits funds made available under the NATO Security Investment Program from being obligated or expended to conduct studies on missile defense. My amendment would strike this section. Mr. Chairman, in the midst of the current debate regarding the need for greater international support of missile defense, we must not arbitrarily prevent our allies from joining with us to pursue these vital and common goals. 
   For the sake of defending our cities and our freedom, I encourage our colleagues to support our Nation's policy to build a robust, layered ballistic missile defense; to support our allies against common threats; and to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would only add that it is vitally important from our perspective that NATO countries be encouraged to cooperate with the things that we're doing there and some of the countries that we're working with for the European missile site. We understand that everything you said is correct. We also believe that it doesn't make sense to single out missile defense as the only study that would be prohibited under this section. 
   And there may come a day when we will have to apologize to the American public for putting so much emphasis on building expensive missile defense capabilities, and if that happens, I will be willing to stand here and do that, but it would be far harder for me to apologize to the American people for failing to do everything that we could on every front to protect the homeland and our European allies and our soldiers and warfighters abroad from the most dangerous offensive weapons that have ever come upon humanity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, in the very earliest days of this Nation, Edmund Burke said, ``All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.'' 
   That belief became the personal creed and call to action of Officer Rob Targosz. Mr. Speaker, this man was a hero and a model human being determined to utilize every ounce of his mind, soul, and body to protect the lives of thousands of his fellow Americans so that we could all live in a safer, more peaceful Nation. Rob Targosz was a second lieutenant in the 12th Airborne Special Forces. He was a member  of the SWAT team, and he was a police officer of the Gilbert Police Department in Gilbert, Arizona, for 12 years. He served there on the DUI Task Force because Rob felt that one of the greatest purposes of his life was to combat and prevent drunk driving. 
   The license plate on the back of his police motorcycle displayed the title ``Agent of Justice.'' He defended our citizens and our laws, and he sought justice with a determination so real that it led him face to face with the very tragedy he had dedicated his life to protect others from. In one of life's great paradoxical mysteries, while on duty, Rob Targosz was killed by a drunk driver. 
   Mr. Speaker, drunk driving is the embodiment of apathy, callousness, and selfishness, which is the very opposite of everything that personified Officer Rob Targosz. The enemy that took Rob's life was the very thing that broke his heart and fueled his desire to battle against it. But it did not defeat him, because Rob Targosz was a man of abiding faith in Jesus Christ, whom he held as his eternal Savior. And Rob left behind him in this life a legacy of heroism, love for America, and countless Americans whose lives are preserved because he protected them with his own. 
   Therefore, his battle continues and his search for justice pulsates in the hearts of other Americans, who, like him, continue to defend and protect us all. Rob's life also continues in the lion heart of his beloved wife, who walked by his slain body, picked up his armor and weapons, and continues his fight by educating the public about the unspeakable destruction caused by drunk driving. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the many reasons that human life is so precious is because it allows the world to see when a single man can live and do and live his life, however short it might be, so that others may be the better for it. Americans are alive and families are whole because of the life and work of Officer Rob Targosz. And the world is better because he showed us an example of a truly noble and excellent soul. May his example fire the souls of us all to continue his enduring quest to protect the innocent. 
   God bless Rob Targosz and his family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word and to speak in favor of the gentlelady's amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, Fred Bastiat said in the dawn of this Republic that government is that great fiction through which everyone endeavors to live at the expense of everyone else. I am not sure if there are too many subjects other than earmark transparency being debated here today that hold more relevance to such a comment, and I am afraid that Members of both parties are unwilling to admit that. 
   It is critically important that we do because it comes down to the very core of who we are as Americans and whether or not we are still capable of self-governance, and whether or not we will allow the fabric of liberty that has been so carefully woven throughout the years to be torn asunder while we all stand by and watch. 
   So to that end, Mr. Chairman, let me remind Members of this body of some of the promises made by those in the majority only a few short months ago. 
   One prominent Member said explicitly, ``We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks.'' Another said, ``We are going to adopt rules that make the system of legislation transparent so that we don't legislate in the dark of night. We need to have earmarks subject to more debate. That's what debate and public awareness is all about. Democracy works if people know what's going on.'' Of course this was after campaigning on the pledge to, quote, ``make this House the most honest, ethical, and open Congress in history.'' 
   But, Mr. Chairman, these promises, though unequivocally made, have been unequivocally broken. Reforms designed to ensure openness, transparency and accountability have been trampled underfoot by the very Members who so vocally called for their enactment. We saw this most egregiously in March of this year with the emergency supplemental legislation, when funds were desperately needed to provide for our men and women in uniform and instead they were laden with $21 billion in irrelevant pork-barrel spending. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am afraid we are seeing it again today in this capricious decision to blatantly shut the American public out of one of the most important and necessary duties of this House and our representative form of government, that of allocating taxpayer funds for the general good of the American people. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has arbitrarily decided that a few select Members of Congress are more capable of ascertaining the public good than the public is itself. Their actions imply that these Members should be allowed, behind closed doors, to decide where tax dollars are spent without being indebted in any way to the collective intelligence and scrutiny of the general public, the press, the media, the blogosphere, and the American people themselves, of course, who are given the charge to keep their elected Representatives accountable. 
   Mr. Chairman, in any other case, this would be called an oligarchy, the bureaucratic rule of the few over the many. It was this very arbitrary confiscation of power that once caused our Nation's founders to throw off the yoke of the Crown of England. A single glance at the footnotes of history demonstrates clearly that breaching that dam sets up a dangerous and degenerative historical precedent. 
   James Madison in the Federalist Papers presaged this misappropriation of power that we are witnessing today when he said it this way: ``The apportionment of taxes on the various descriptions of property is an act which seems to require the most exact impartiality. Yet there is no legislative act in which greater opportunity and temptation are given to a predominant party to trample on the rules of justice.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge every Member of this body to recall our commitment to God and the people we serve, to preserve the rules of justice. Hidden slush funds, overseen by a very few people in the dark of night, that is not justice, Mr. Chairman. Camouflaged tax increases that could be the largest in history, that is not justice. 
   We come here in a moment of contention, but we can turn that moment of contention into a time to restore the transparency and accountability to this appropriations process, and I hope we do that, Mr. Chairman. I hope we vote for the gentlelady's amendment.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, it has been a profoundly significant day in the House of Representatives. And I suppose one of the things I would like to say first, Madam Speaker, is that the world will go on. We have made a decision today, I believe, that will ultimately serve the United States well. I believe the economic challenges before us in this country are significant. I also believe that we should always prefer temporary failure at that which will ultimately succeed than temporary success at that which will ultimately fail. And I believe that market factors were put in place long before this President came into office that are ultimately responsible for the challenges that we face today. However, I also believe that we're going in the right direction. 
   Senator John McCain empowered House Republicans in a very significant way a few days ago. And we made tremendous improvements, I believe, to move this toward a market-based bill that will call upon the private sector to capitalize the recovery of this economy. And I believe we're going in the right direction. And for those, Madam Speaker, that would question the commitment of this Government to make sure that we stabilize our economy, I would say to them, just wait. We will come up with something that will be far better than anything that we've discussed heretofore. And I believe that ultimately we will succeed and that America will be stronger and better for the fact that we have stepped back and chosen to regroup and come together to make an even better plan.          
   Madam Speaker, tonight I come really not to talk about the economy. I come to talk about something that in my judgment can affect the economy, the national security, and each one of the citizens of this country, and even the freedom of the world in a very significant way. I would remind us that as we talk about economic challenges, we have to remember that we are talking about a $700 billion bill today, and yet remember that two airplanes hitting two buildings cost this economy $2 trillion. September 11 certainly was more than just an attack on the Trade Center. 
   But the fact is that it had a profound impact on our economy. And we need  to understand that as we deal with the economic issues that plague this Nation, they have always been there. But so have issues of significant national security. 
   And so tonight I want to address this body on something that I have wanted to address it for a long time. Because I believe that a nuclear Iran represents one of the greatest threats to peace facing the human family. 
   So, Madam Speaker, let me begin first by saying that there are millions of innocent, freedom-loving citizens in Iran who are truly good and gentle people suffering under brutality and oppression. They long for true freedom and partnership with the international community. To them, I first want to say that America stands with you. To them I first also want to say that we long to see you become a true democratic ally in the Middle East that rejects the ideology of jihadist terrorism and upholds the protection of the innocent and equal human dignity. America will do everything in our power to hasten the day when Iran and its proxies will no longer threaten the world with nuclear jihad, and when we will have the privilege of walking together, I pray, Madam Speaker, in the sunlight of human freedom. 
   And, Madam Speaker, almost exactly 3 years ago, I stood at this podium and called upon the United States to clearly define its position towards what is now the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, the Islamic Republic of Iran is, in my judgment, the world's largest sponsor of state terrorism. And I called upon the IAEA to refer Iran to the Security Council at that time because I believed then, and I believe now, that Iran is systematically pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. 
   At that time, while Iranian President Ahmadinejad had made very clear his intentions to pursue nuclear capability, to eradicate the nation of Israel and to offer material support to Hezbollah and other nonstate terrorist actors, the nation of Iran had not yet been referred to the United Nations Security Council. 
   Since then, Iran has been the object of two U.N. American resolutions that ban trade and freeze assets of Iran's nuclear and related entities. Beginning from August, 2006, Iran has blatantly ignored deadlines established by the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, and refused to comply with repeated Security Council deadlines to cease its uranium enrichment.          
   Meanwhile, the lack of regard by the Government of Iran for innocent human life has continued to be horribly demonstrated in its own human rights violations that currently plague the entire nation that are causing the Iranian people to suffer. Ahmadinejad's tyrannical regime continues its brutal suppression of dissension by routinely employing torture, executions, kidnappings and arbitrary arrests and detentions. 
   Despite claiming to desire peace, Iranian President Ahmadinejad has undermined every advancement toward peace and emerging democracy in the Middle East by actively supporting terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Shiite insurgents and militias in Iraq that are responsible for killing and maiming U.S. and Coalition forces and countless innocent citizens. 
   Iran, Madam Speaker, has now catalyzed a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. Previously there was only one nuclear aspirant in the Middle East. That was Iran. Now there are ten. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, the coincidence of jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation represents the greatest immediate threat to the peace of the human family in the world today. Iran, because of its ideology, represents a significant danger. The past 2 years have provided incontrovertible evidence of the conclusion reached in the March, 2006, ``National Security Strategy'' report. Let me quote it verbatim, Madam Speaker.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this body with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is April 3, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand--just today. That is more than the number of innocent American lives that were lost on September 11th, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,855 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of our own children. 
   Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over their vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. 
   They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. Each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: ``No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion Declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. 
   And yet, Mr. Speaker, another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection that we should have given them. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude, in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard this sunset memorial tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,855 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust, is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn. May that be the day we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to urge support for my amendment to restore funding to the Missile Defense Agency to fund against short and medium-range ballistics missiles. My amendment restores $719 million in funding to the Missile Defense Agency, to return the President's budget request to $9.3 billion. My amendment directs that this $719 million be specifically targeted toward the Theater High Altitude Area Defense System and the AEGIS Ballistic Missile Defense Systems and the test and targets necessary to test those systems. 
   I agree with the Democrats, Madam Chairman, which is pretty unusual. I agree with the Democrats that we need to be concerned about the threat of short and medium-range ballistic missiles to our forward-deployed troops on the Korean peninsula, North Japan, and throughout southwest Asia. Today, these forces are at risk of attack by thousands of lethal ballistic missiles that may carry conventional, chemical, or, in some cases, nuclear warheads. Our close allies, South Korea, Japan, Israel, and Turkey are held at risk by these missiles as well. 
   Deployed Patriot batteries provide some limited point defense to shield some, but not all, of our key command and control centers. We can improve upon this very limited defense and offer a larger umbrella of protection against ballistic missiles to our forces with area defense. Both the land-based Theater High Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, as well as the sea-based AEGIS Ballistic Missile system, offer significant area missile defense capabilities to our theater commanders. 
   I want to applaud the entire House Armed Services Committee for increasing funding for both of these programs. Unfortunately, I fear these increases do not do enough for our theater commanders, who cannot get these systems deployed fast enough because they simply are not yet available to apportion. The House Armed Services Committee has received testimony from Admiral Keating, Commander of U.S. Pacific Command, and General Bell, Commander of U.S. Forces in Korea, to this effect. 
   The administration should accelerate production of THAAD fire units and interceptors, as well as the AEGIS 3 standard missile 3 interceptors to adequately source the combatant commands with area defense against short and medium-range or theater class ballistic missiles.     
   The committee has authorized $75 million above the President's budget for each of these programs, but I am concerned that this increase will not deliver capability to the warfighter soon enough in the most expeditious manner. The short and medium-range ballistic missile threat exists today, and we can procure more interceptors to defend our troops in harm's way. 
   Mr. Chairman, very simply, probably one of our best hedges against proliferation of nuclear arms today in the world is missile defense, and it is very important that we do everything we can to be prepared for any eventuality. So I offer this amendment and urge the support of my colleagues. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, the $75 million increase to the Aegis BMD that the Democrats have spoken of here does not even fund the necessary upgrades to the Aegis weapons systems BMD signal processing capability necessary to keep pace with the evolving short-range and medium-range ballistic missile threat. So we are definitely not doing enough there. 
   This $75 million increase to the Aegis ballistic missile defense budget that they speak of does not even cover the expenses incurred by the Missile Defense Agency to conduct a shootdown of the U.S. 193 satellite. This cost the agency approximately $100 million. 
   My Democrat friends have often stated that far-term systems are much less important than near-term systems. So I believe it is reasonable to assume that the RTD&E accounts are the appropriate offset for such an amendment. 
   The bottom line is this: A $9.3 billion request budget from the President has been decreased by $719 million. And in an age of missiles, as the ranking member mentioned, this is not a time to cut our missile defense capability. Missile defense is not only the last line of defense against an incoming missile, perhaps with a nuclear warhead representing the most dangerous weapon in the history of humanity, it is the first line of defense against proliferation. And, Mr. Chairman, proliferation I believe, given the examples that Mr. Lamborn mentioned of Iran and others, represents the greatest threat to human peace in the world today. 
   Missile defense is an opportunity for us to devalue those programs in the hands of such enemies, and perhaps help this generation and others to walk a little bit longer in the sunlight of freedom. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we have told ourselves time and time again, the first purpose of this body is to help this government defend its citizens against external national security threats. I believe that the most dangerous threat to peace on the planet today is the danger of Iran gaining nuclear capabilities. Yet the majority of this Congress has prevented us from even voting on a military contingency plan to prevent Iran from gaining this deadly capability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reality is that Iran is moving inexorably toward the capability to have nuclear weapons. If they gain those weapons, we will see proliferation across the world, and I am convinced that terrorists will gain this deadly technology. If one such weapon is detonated in the United States of America, it will change our concept of freedom forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, there should be an opportunity for this body to vote to make it clear that if Iran continues to pursue that, that the military option is on the table. There are only two reasons, in my judgment, ultimately that Iran will not pursue this capability: that is a military intervention, or the conviction on the part of Iranian leaders that that will indeed take place if they do not desist from this effort to gain nuclear capability. 
   Mr. Speaker, the highway of history is littered with the consequences of strategic ambiguity. And this is a danger here today. We tell Iran that it is our policy that they will not gain nuclear capability, and yet we do nothing to make it clear to them that the military option is on the table if they proceed. 
   The best chance for us to prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear capability and at once to prevent war with Iran is to make sure that they know that we will not avoid the military option if it becomes necessary. It is the best hope of doing both of those things, Mr. Speaker. We must proceed to do everything in every way, diplomatically and otherwise, to prevent this, but we must not take the military option off the table.

That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,904 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, died and screamed as they did so, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, no one could hear them. 
   And all of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution, it says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here.

Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are.

We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard this Sunset Memorial tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,904 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this body with another sunset memorial. 
   It is February 14, 2008, Valentine's Day, in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And before the sunset today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That is more than the number of innocent lives that America lost on September 11, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,806 days since the tragic judicial fiat of Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of America's own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   And all of them had at least four things in common. They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their other mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never quite be the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet, even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blindness and invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's more important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.'' 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the declaration, not the casual notion, but the declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And every conflict our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the whole world. It is who we are. And yet, Mr. Speaker, another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that commitment. We failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died without the protection that we should have given them. 
   But perhaps tonight, Mr. Speaker, maybe just one someone new who has heard this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill a baby, that it hurts mothers in ways that we could never express, and that 12,806 days spent killing nearly 50 million children in America is enough, and that this Nation is great enough to find a better way than abortion on demand. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are numbered, and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet other day to come, may that be the day when we hear, when we finally hear the cries of the unborn. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is February 14, 2008, 12,806 days since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. This, on Valentine's Day, in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, praise is due to certain Members on the Appropriations Committee on both sides of this aisle who had the foresight and the wisdom to fund key missile defense systems in the President's budget. 
   We must remind ourselves that in 2006 alone there were close to 100 foreign ballistic missiles launched around the world. In an age of terrorism, when rogue states and non-State entities can acquire these dangerous missiles, we must prepare a defense for our homeland, for our deployed war fighters and for our friends and allies. 
   The Appropriations Committee preserved the Airborne Laser, which is a system often deemed futuristic or far-term, but as many of us know, ABL is a magnificent ballistic missile defense system that has now been built and continues to successfully meet its knowledge points. And thanks to the ingenuity and hard work of dedicated Americans, Airborne Laser will soon play a critical role in helping us to meet the evolving threat of ballistic missiles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, that may be. Let me go ahead and finish here with my comments, and then I'll ask the Appropriations chairman what he feels like would be appropriate at that time. 
   I'm also grateful, Mr. Chairman, that we've taken vital steps for greater cooperation with Israeli ballistic missile defense because I believe that will play a critical role in future pieces of the human family. 
   Having said that, I'm incredibly concerned tonight that the $97.2 million that was cut from the only existing active defense system this Nation has against intercontinental ballistic missiles is a dangerous cut. This is not a far-term system. In fact, this is not a near-term system. It is a current system and the only one we have to defend this Nation against intercontinental ballistic missiles. This $97.2 million cut is inconsistent with even the Democrats' view on the House Armed Services Committee for their support for short-term programs and near-term programs, and it directly conflicts with the legislation passed in last year's National Defense Authorization advocating Department of Defense focus on near-term capabilities. 
   This amendment would restore the $97.2 million for ground-based, mid-course defense without increasing any dollars to the Defense bill. The offset is from research and development defense-wide, which has over $20 billion in the account. 
   Mr. Chairman, this country must plan on being surprised by our enemies. In 1998, intelligence experts indicated that North Korea was years away from fielding multistage rockets. That very next month they demonstrated that capability when, on July 4 of the American Independence Day, North Korea brazenly launched a long-range ballistic missile. 
   Americans witnessed for the first time that day their country activate a missile defense system to protect our  homeland against intercontinental ballistic missiles. It is clear that North Korea was using these missiles for coercion and intimidation, and I would ask that we neutralize their ability to do that and bring critical protection to Americans and our homeland by fully supporting the GMB system we currently have. 
   Now, I would yield to the chairman if he has any thoughts.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, 9/11 is the ultimate reminder of the countless innocent American lives at stake when we miss critical or e-mail communications between foreign terrorists in foreign countries. If our national intelligence community is to effectively anticipate future threats, it must be allowed to keep up with the rapidly evolving world of telecommunications technology. 
   Mr. Speaker, last night in this House, Democrats chose to blatantly disregard the appeals of both the Director of National Intelligence as well as those of the FISA courts who have pleaded for a modernization of the system in order to reduce the needless burden of FISA court orders for foreign terrorist surveillance. 
   Instead, Democrat Members passed a bill that only further immobilizes our outdated foreign intelligence system. 
   Mr. Speaker, whether or not liberal Democrats acknowledge the threat that we face, that threat is very real, as terrorists themselves continue to remind us. Al-Manar recently said on BBC: ``Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the great Satan [America] is absolute ..... Regardless of how the world has changed after 11 September, death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, tonight is the last opportunity before leaving Washington for Members of this House to address the imminent possibility of a terrorist attack by effectively modernizing our FISA regulations to provide for the defense of the American people. 
   One thing is absolutely clear, Mr. Speaker: Al Qaeda will not rest when this body adjourns for the August recess. If we do not address the critical loopholes in our foreign surveillance system tonight, our children may some day face nuclear jihad, perhaps even in this generation. And what we will tell them, Mr. Speaker, when they look back on this day and condemn this generation for unspeakable irresponsibility in the face of such an obvious threat to human peace. We must pass this critical bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (THE SCOURGE OF ABORTION IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, today was a very important day. Today, the United States Supreme Court handed down a decision upholding the Federal law protecting unborn children from partial-birth abortion. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to first remind ourselves again of why we were really all put here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is indeed why we are all here. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the belief that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to this core foundational belief on our part that every life, from the smallest child to the elderly widow, from the strongest and bravest soldiers on our front lines, to the weakest and most frail in our society, every human soul is of infinite worth and entitled by God to pursue liberty, prosperity and happiness. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, for 34 years, Roe v. Wade has been a desecration of that bedrock foundation upon which America stands, and Roe v. Wade sets itself apart from all of the other egregious decisions made by our courts in that its result is 45 million dead American children. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is 15,000 times the number of lives that were lost to terrorism on September 11; and the land of the free and the home of the brave now stands awash in the blood of 45 million of its own children. And it will never cease to totally astound me how we, as Americans, fail to grasp the enormous and terrifying threat to our Nation's survival economically, militarily, morally and spiritually that this tragedy represents. 
   We have made it illegal to throw away polystyrene diapers, while it remains for the last 34 years legal to throw away babies. How can we be so blind to such a cataclysmic, soul-crushing tragedy? 
   G.K. Chesterton said once that ``Men can always be blind to a thing as long as it is big enough.'' And, Mr. Speaker, at this very moment, this cataclysmic heartbreak continues. 
   Arthur Cohen, who is perhaps the world's leading scholar on the European Holocaust, used a Latin term to describe abortion in America. He called it ``mysterium tremendum,'' which means an utter mystery to the rational human mind, a mystery that carries with it not only the aspect of vastness, but the resonance of complete terror, something so unutterably diabolical as to be literally unknowable to us. 
   Mr. Speaker, following the invasion of Germany into Poland in 1939, a Jewish man named Yitzhak Katzenelson was trapped by the Nazis in the Warsaw ghetto. He was later transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he and his son were brutally murdered. 
   Before his death, he buried under a tree a song that encapsulated the entire Nazi regime in one verse. He stated that, ``The first to perish were the children. From these a new dawn might have arisen.'' What a profound lesson for the rest of the world to hearken unto. A new dawn might have arisen from those children that perished in the Holocaust. 
   No matter the rhetoric, Mr. Speaker, we must not ever be so blind to the fact that each time an abortion takes place, a nameless little baby dies a lonely death; a mother is never quite the same, whether she realizes it or not; and all of the gifts that that child might have brought to humanity are lost forever. 
   It is often said, Mr. Speaker, that a society is measured by how it treats those in the dawn of life, those in the shadows of life, and those in the twilight of life. Because unborn children are hidden both in the dawn and in the shadows of life, we kill thousands of them every day in America, using sometimes methods like partial-birth abortion that cause so much agonizing pain that the child that is being killed, if they were an animal, it would be illegal under Federal law to do it the way we do it. 
   If we, as a human family in America, cannot find enough humanity within ourselves to change that, if this human rights atrocity of dismembering our own children alive is truly who we are, then the ``invincible ignorance'' Henry Hyde spoke of in this Chamber so long ago will indeed finally prevail, the patriots' dream will be lost, and those lying out in Arlington National Cemetery will have died in vain and twilight will have fallen upon us all. 
   Mr. Speaker, that day may come in America indeed. But, sir, that day has not come yet. It is not this day, because today, Mr. Speaker, the world changed. Today the United States Supreme Court upheld a law protecting unborn children from the barbaric, nightmarish procedure of partial-birth abortion. And with this ruling comes a brilliant, piercing ray of hope, because even though this ruling only upholds a law that protects a small number of  late-term babies from this horrifying procedure called partial-birth abortion, it represents the day that America changed direction and turned her heart toward home. 
   I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this decision is part of a growing awareness on the part of all Americans of the simple truth that abortion takes the life of a child, and the United States of America is bigger than abortion on demand. We are beginning to look within ourselves and we are beginning to understand that the foundation of this Nation is within our own hearts. 
   Our Nation is beginning to understand that whether it is flying airplanes into buildings or blowing up buildings in Oklahoma City, or whether it is raping and pillaging in Bosnia, or whether it is violence in our streets or kidnapping little girls in broad daylight or murdering innocent unborn children, all of these have one inescapable common denominator, and that is the lack of respect for innocent human life. 
   Americans are beginning to understand and realize that the reason crime is so rampant in this country is because we have taught our young people that it is all right to kill helpless unborn children. Should we then wonder why they kill each other on the school playground? 
   Americans are beginning to understand that the same mentality that allows a father to forsake his unborn child to an abortionist also allows him to forsake his born children to the welfare state. 
   Americans are beginning to understand that the abortion mentality is destroying families all over this country, and that if this epidemic of family disintegration continues, that we in this family will bankrupt this Nation in trying to deal with the results. 
   Americans are also trying to understand that there are better ways to help young mothers than killing their children for them. 
   And Americans are beginning to understand that if we, as a society, do not find or possess the courage and the will to protect innocent unborn children, that, in the final analysis, we may never find the will or the courage or the commitment to protect any kind of liberty for anyone of any kind. 
   Mr. Speaker, the pro-life movement often compares the Roe v. Wade decision with the Dred Scott decision that upheld slavery in this Nation. I would remind each one of us that enslaving fellow human beings was once a practice that was perpetuated throughout the world for thousands of years. But when slavery came to America it finally stopped. We had a conscience on that day that changed the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, that part of our history should give us great hope, because even though we face challenges today, when we look back on how America has somehow come through each one of them, I believe that by the grace of God, America will one day lead all nations to restore protection to unborn children throughout the world. 
   Hope is a powerful thing, Mr. Speaker. One of the most powerful messages of hope I ever saw in my life was captured in a picture I saw a few years ago, and I cite the commentary that accompanied it. It should be the picture of the year, or perhaps the picture of the decade. But it won't be because unless you obtained a copy through the Internet or the paper it was published in, you probably never saw it. Somehow the media missed it. 
   The picture is that of a 21-week unborn child by the name of Samuel Alexander Armas who is being operated on by a surgeon by the name of Dr. Joseph Bruner. The baby was diagnosed with spina bifida and would not have survived if removed from his mother's womb. But little Samuel's mother, Julie Armas, is an obstetrics nurse in Atlanta. She knew of Dr. Bruner's remarkable surgical skills. Practicing at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, he performs these special operations while the baby is still in the womb. 
   During the procedure, the doctor removes the uterus via C-section and he makes a small incision to operate on the child. As Dr. Bruner completed the surgery on Samuel Armas, this amazing little baby reached out with his tiny but fully developed hand through the incision and firmly grasped the surgeon's finger. Dr. Bruner was reported as saying that when this little baby grasped his finger, that it was the most emotional moment of his life, and that for an instant during the procedure, he was completely frozen, totally immobile. 
   The photograph captures this amazing event with perfect clarity. The editors titled the picture ``Hand of Hope.'' They said this tiny little hand seemed to emerge to grasp the finger of Dr. Joseph Bruner as if thanking him for the gift of life that he was receiving. Little Samuel's mother said they wept for days when they saw the picture. She said, ``The photo reminds us that pregnancy isn't about a disability or an illness; it's about a little person.'' The operation was 100 percent successful and Samuel was born in perfect health. 
   Mr. Speaker, Winston Churchill said once that Americans always do the right thing after they have exhausted every other possibility. And today, for the first time since the evil disgrace of Roe v. Wade, we have restored the legal protection of a very small number of those little children who are already partially born and only moments away from taking their first breath. It beggars human imagination that such basic compassion and humanity was ever debatable in the first place. 
   But now, today, the tiny hand of hope reaches out a little closer to us than it ever has in the past and only asks for mercy, and I hope and pray that all of us will hear that little voice in our own hearts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank my precious friend Phil Gingrey from Georgia. It is a wonderful thing to have a man here that has the expertise of a doctor and an obstetrician, to be able to speak to an issue like this, and yet one who has maintained his commitment always to being a help to someone, that would always protect human life rather than to ever try to take it from someone. I just think he is a credit to his profession and certainly a credit to this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, I suppose that tonight I would just kind of recap here for a moment. A lot of people have mentioned their family members, and I certainly love every one of mine, but I will bring to mind and to voice one special little boy by the name of Landon Trent Franks. Now, the fact that his name is the same as mine is strictly a coincidence, but I am thankful that his daddy and his mother loved him enough to give him a chance at life, and I think at some point, probably the time he is 21, he will be President of the United States which is a great encouragement to me as well. 
   I understand that we are all proud of our families, but whether a child reaches the great heights in this life or whether they just have a chance to breathe in the breath of freedom and to be able to walk on the free soil of the United States of America or just to have a chance 
   to pursue this thing called happiness in life, it is incumbent upon all of us to recognize that we are all mortal and that this gift of life is the profoundest kind of miracle and that America itself was founded on the basic premise that every life was important, that it was a gift of God, and that each one of us should work to try to protect life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all of our fellow human beings. 
   The tragedy of Roe v. Wade when it came along, it just kind of took us all by surprise, because you see, this was not something that the country voted on. This was not something that the United States people as a whole decided to bring about themselves. 
   This was something that erudite, and might I say, Mr. Speaker, very arrogant and unjust members of the United States Supreme Court took upon themselves to arrogate this thing, to take away the constitutional rights of the unborn child. It is the not the first time that things like that have happened. 
   Back in 1857, in the Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court said that the black man was not a person under the Constitution, and it took a civil war to reverse that tragedy. Today, we all look back on that and we say how could they have ever done that, and yet we have killed 50 million of our own children. 
   In the rise of the Nazi Holocaust, we saw the German high tribunal say that the Jews were subhuman and not persons under the German Constitution, and it precipitated a great tragedy. 
   Then in 1973 we saw the Supreme Court take away the right to live of the unborn child. 
   In all three cases, Mr. Speaker, not only was there a great human tragedy that followed, but there was a greater one that followed as a result. The civil war took more lives than any war in our history. The world war that changed the Nazi Holocaust took 50 million lives worldwide and it saw atomic bombs fall on cities across the world. 
   I have to say to you that I do not know where America will finally end up here. I do not know what the future holds, but I am so encouraged today that we have made a turn and that we have come to ourselves to some degree and said, you know, there is a time when we can protect these little babies in the womb, and I think if we come to that conclusion, that something even greater will happen. We will begin to understand that these little miracles of life in the womb are the beginning of us all and that there is a way that America can come up with a better solution than abortion on demand, that we are bigger than that as a people. 
   I am convinced that the day will come some day, Mr. Speaker, when the warm sunlight of life will break through the clouds and once again shine on the face of unborn children in America. When that day comes it will be people like Phil Gingrey, it will be people like Chris Smith, it will be people like Bill Sali, it will be people like Gresham Barrett, it will be people like Jim Jordan, people like Todd Akin, people like Jeb Hensarling, people like Steve Chabot, people like George W. Bush the history will be most aware of. They will remember that these were individuals that, through all the storm, held tightly to the hand of a little baby until the storm was gone. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I am wrong about that, if somehow America never finds its way back home on this issue, I am still convinced of one thing more than any other, and that is, that the Lord of the universe hears the cries of absolutely every one of his children, no matter who or where they are. And if time turns every star in heaven to ashes, I know in my soul that eternal moment of His deliverance will come to each of them. And I hope that we do the part He has given us to that end.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (25TH ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN'S STRATEGIC DEFENSE INITIATIVE -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, this month will mark the 25th anniversary since President Ronald Reagan gave that landmark speech at the zenith of the Cold War proposing what became known as the Strategic Defense Initiative to protect the United States of America and her allies and her vital interests from ballistic nuclear missile attack. 
   In that speech he unveiled a vision for the research, development, and ultimate deployment of a defensive non-nuclear-layered missile defense system that would give us the means to intercept and destroy incoming strategic nuclear missiles and render the threat of a nuclear attack from the Soviet Union impotent and obsolete. President Ronald Reagan's speech marked the end of a chapter in American history when the policies of appeasement and accommodation formed the basis of our foreign policy and the concept of mutually assured destruction was the only viable solution to the Soviet threat. 
   The apathy that caused democracies to neglect their defense in the 1930s had resulted in the tragedy of World War II. President Reagan reminded the world that it must not allow a similar apathy or neglect to cause that dismal chapter in history to repeat itself. 
   Speaking with that gentle but confident persuasiveness that would set him apart as the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan rejected the specter of mutual retaliation and stood alone among Washington bureaucracy in the belief that our security is based on the ability to meet all threats and that peace must be preserved through strength. He knew that developing this revolutionary capability of ballistic missile defense would not be easy or a short-lived task. He said, ``It will take years, perhaps decades of efforts on many fronts. There will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be successes and breakthroughs; and as we proceed, we must remain constant in preserving the nuclear deterrent and maintaining a solid capability for flexible response.'' 
   It seems that every revolutionary idea or stride toward greater human freedom is marked first by resistance and ridicule. President Reagan's daring SDI proposition was no exception. Indeed, American intelligentsia berated the idea that America should abandon its complacency and embrace a policy towards Communism as clear and simple and unapologetic as what Ronald Reagan stated in four words: ``We win, they lose.'' 
   But hundreds of millions of people now live in freedom because of his clarity and his courage. Less than 9 years after Ronald Reagan gave his Evil Empire and Strategic Defense Initiative speeches, marking the beginning of what would become the United States' ballistic missile defense program, the entire world stood in stunned wonder and witnessed the dissolution of the once unshakeable Soviet Union. 
   Today, under the vigilant and dedicated leadership of the Missile Defense Agency and the United States Armed Forces, ballistic missile defense technology has gone beyond development and testing. It is now operationally deployed by the United States and our allies in different parts of the world. 
   Only weeks ago, on February 21, 2008, President Ronald Reagan's vision, once labeled Star Wars by his deriding critics, was vindicated before the world when a Standard Missile-3 rocket fired from the USS Lake Erie intercepted a disabled satellite tumbling from space toward Earth at over 17,000 miles per hour. 
   The pivotal significance of Ronald Reagan's almost prophetic vision no longer can be tested. More than ever it is vital for this Congress to continue to advance his vision of a layered ballistic missile defense system capable of defending land, air, sea, and space against rapidly evolving missile threats in a now-multipolar world. 
   President Reagan knew that if America was to remain a shining city upon a hill, it must remain secure. If it was to remain secure, it must remain strong. He also knew that the costs for maintaining that strength would be great. 
   But in his SDI speech of 25 years ago, President Reagan himself asked the most important and salient question about America's national security. He said: ``Isn't it worth every investment necessary to free the world from the threat of nuclear war?'' 
   His question is as relevant today as it was then. May we of this generation honor the legacy of President Ronald Reagan, whose courage and commitment to protect the peace and national security of America not only hastened the demise of the Soviet Empire but transformed our strategic defense policy and gave us the means to ensure that America remains the beacon of hope, strength, and human freedom in the world for generations to come.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is September 10, 2008 in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 13,015 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   So Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 13,015 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American  brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is September 10, 2008, 13,015 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children; this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, today, as we embrace the grave responsibility of debating an issue that will have profound impact on future American generations, it seems very appropriate to remind ourselves of the ideal that gave birth to this Nation in the first place. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   Whether we realize it or not, most of the important discussions in this Chamber, including the one in this moment, center around whether we still believe those words. 
   In these hours, America finds herself at war with an expressively dangerous ideology that is the antithesis of those words and everything that is the American ideal. What concerns me most is that this war between an ideology committed to the absolute death to destroy freedom and subjugate the entire world, and the world's free people who still remain primarily asleep. 
   Mr. Speaker, this ideological war did not begin on 9/11. It began many years ago when certain Muslim extremists embraced a divergent Islamist dogma that dictates that all infidels must die. It was called then as it should be called now, jihad. 
   Thomas Jefferson was the first American President to send U.S. military force to war against Islamist jihad. The Marine hymn begins, ``From the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli,'' the latter being a reference to Jefferson's war against the Islamist Barbary pirates based in Tripoli, in present day Libya. 
   This is the same jihadist ideology that murdered Israeli athletes in 1972, that took American hostages in Iran, that murdered Marines in their barracks in 1983, that bombed the World Trade Center in 1993, Riyadh in 1995, the Khobar Towers in 1996, the embassy in 1998, the USS Cole in 2000, and that brutally murdered scores of little schoolchildren on opening day in Beslan, Russia. 
   And then, Mr. Speaker, this same dark ideology massacred nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11. 
   The ideology and practice of Islamist jihad is decapitating humanitarians with hacksaws on television while the victims scream for mercy, cowardly hiding behind women and children while launching rockets deliberately targeting innocent civilians, continually breaking treaties of peace, and forcing children to blow themselves to pieces to affect the murder of other innocents, and this, as their own mothers leap for joy as they do.     
   As we anticipate future actions of jihadists, we should all consider very carefully. Al Qaeda's al-Zawahiri said: ``The jihad movement is growing and rising. It reached its peak with the two blessed raids on New York and Washington. And now it is waging a great heroic battle in Iraq, Afghanistan, Palestine, and even the crusaders' own homes.'' 
   Al-Manar said on BBC: ``Let the entire world hear me. Our hostility to the Great Satan, America, is absolute. Regardless of how the world has changed after September 11, death to America will remain our reverberating and powerful slogan: Death to America.'' 
   Al-Zarqawi said of America's leaders: ``They are aware that if the Islamic giant wakes up, it will not be satisfied with less than the gates of Rome, Washington, Paris, and London.'' 
   Al-Muhajir, Osama bin Laden's latest lieutenant in Iraq, said: ``The fire has not and will not be put out and our swords, which have been colored with your blood, are thirsty for more of your rotting heads.'' 
   Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, said, ``We have discovered how to hit the Jews where they are most vulnerable. The Jews love life; so that is what we shall take away from them. We are going to win because they love life and we love death.'' 
   And then, Mr. Speaker, we hear a Democrat Member of this body say, ``The savagery of terrorists is not relevant.'' Even the most senior Democrat in this House is quoted as saying ``I don't take sides for or against Hezbollah or for or against Israel.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, a blind relativism that deliberately ignores all truth and equates merciless terrorism with free nations defending themselves and their innocent citizens is more dangerous to humanity than terrorism itself, and it is proof that liberals completely misunderstand the enemy that we face. 
   Osama bin Laden's deputy, al-Zawahiri, made clear shortly after 9/11 in his book ``Knights Under the Prophet's Banner,'' al Qaeda's most important short-term strategic goal is to seize control of a state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world. He wrote, quote, ``Confronting the enemies of Islam and launching jihad against them require a Muslim authority established on Muslim land. Without achieving this, our actions will mean nothing.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, such a jihadist state would be the ideal launching pad for future attacks on the West. 
   Bin Laden himself once again has stated: ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the terrorists regard Iraq as the central front in their war against humanity. And if we are to understand our enemy and this war, we must understand that Iraq is the central front in our war against jihad. Our courageous and noble soldiers understand that very well and our enemy definitely understands that. 
   Osama bin Laden himself has said, ``The most important and serious issue today for the world is this Third World War ..... It is raging in the land of the two rivers, Iraq. The world's millstone and pillar is in Baghdad, the capital of the caliphate.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if Democrats are correct that the struggle in Iraq is not crucial to the winning of the war against Islamist jihad, then for God's sake I wish they would explain that to the terrorists. 
   Brink Lindsey has put it all so succinctly. He said, ``Here is the grim truth: We are only one act of madness away from a social cataclysm unlike anything our country has ever known. After a handful of such acts, who knows what kind of civilization breakdown might be in store?'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we simply can no longer deny that we are fighting a war against an insidiously dangerous and evil ideology that is bent on the destruction of the Western world, and they would like nothing better than to decapitate this country by detonating a nuclear blast 100 yards from here. And to allow jihadists to declare victory in Iraq will only serve to hasten such a day. 
   Mr. Speaker, the free nations of the world once had opportunity to address the insidious rise of the Nazi ideology in its formative years when it could have been dispatched without great cost. But they delayed, and the result was atomic bombs falling on cities, 50 million people dead worldwide, and the swastika's shadow nearly plunging this planet into Cimmerian night. 
   Winston Churchill's words of warning far preceded such tragic events. He said, ``If you will not fight when you can easily win without bloodshed, if you will not fight when your victory will be sure and not too costly, you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may be a worse moment. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory because it is still better to perish than to live as slaves.'' 
   If so-called enlightened Germans fell prey to the Nazi ideology, why do we not believe Third World Muslims can also fall prey in large numbers to this jihadist ideology? History does indeed repeat itself, Mr. Speaker, and each time the price goes up. 
   Jihadists believe they have a critical advantage over free people in the world. They believe their will is far stronger than ours and that they need only to persevere to break our resolve. Mr. Speaker, the message of this resolution has only encouraged them in that belief. 
   So today in this Chamber, we each have some grave questions to ask ourselves, and the answers will profoundly affect future American generations. We need to ask ourselves first, not whether the Nation should have gone to war but whether the Nation should lose this war. 
   Will jihadists break the will of the world's free people or not? Will they be able to hide long enough to gain access to nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction? If we do allow nations like Iran to gain nuclear weapons, what will we tell our children when they face nuclear jihad, perhaps even in this generation? If liberals in this body are willing to see freedom defeated in Iraq, are they willing to take responsibility for what will almost certainly follow? If this entire Nation was riveted and heartbroken when two airplanes hit two buildings in New York, how will we  feel when an entire American city is in nuclear flames? 
   If Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats are willing to vote against monitoring terrorist conversations on the telephone, or tracking their financial transactions, or protecting our border from terrorist insurgency, or effectively interrogating terrorists in custody, or sending reinforcements to our troops on the battlefield, then the question that cries for an answer is what are they willing to do to defeat Islamic terrorism? What is their plan? 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no substitute for victory. If we surrender Iraq to Islamist jihadists, we will supercharge their recruitment efforts in the Middle East and all over the planet, and our children will pay an unspeakable price, and history will condemn this generation for unspeakable irresponsibility in the face of such an obvious threat to human peace. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, before we vote on this resolution, may we consider carefully the words of Abraham Lincoln as he sought to steel the resolve of Americans in another great and historic struggle. He said, ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the last generation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is September 8, 2008 in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 13,013 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   So Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 13,013 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is September 8, 2008, 13,013 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children; this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentlemen very much for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I will vote ``yes'' on this bill, but I am really astonished that the Democrats have gutted the European Missile Defense site. We don't seem to understand that the coincidence of jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation represents the greatest existential threat to human peace in the world today. Unfortunately, they seem to think that if they kill it for this year and put it in the next administration, somehow it will be of some political benefit to them. Barack Obama has said that he will cut missile defense spending, and he simply does not understand the gravity of a nuclear Iran, Mr. Chairman. 
   Every day we are in this body, Iran enriches more uranium. They come closer and closer to having a nuclear capability. When they gain that, Mr. Chairman, it won't be long before al Qaeda will have that capability as well. 
   It may not be long that Iran will be able to actually field a weapon that could create an electromagnetic pulse across this country that would be the ultimate asymmetric weapon for terrorists in the world today. And I find it astonishing that when our first purpose in this body is to protect the lives and constitutional rights of the American people, that for some ridiculous political motivation that we would strip the ability for us to be able to intercept missiles coming from Iran that would either hit our allies in Europe or our forward-deployed troops or people here at home, that somehow we think that we have done our job. 
   I would remind us all that Osama bin Laden said these words. He said, It is our religious duty to gain nuclear weapons. 
   Mr. Chairman, if they succeed, if Iran succeeds, al Qaeda will succeed in gaining those nuclear weapons. If that happens, we will revisit this subject on a day in the future and we will have to explain to our children why we let such a profound threat to human peace exist when it was in our power to change it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, since mankind took up arms against his fellow human beings, every offensive weapon has been countered by a defensive weapon. The spear brought the shield. The sword spawned the suit of armor. Bullets brought heavier armor, and each succeeding advancement in offensive weapons has brought a defensive response wherein mankind hopes to buy a little more time. 
   Yet, today, when we are 60 years into the nuclear age and mankind faces the most dangerous weapons in the history of humanity, there is in this moment a debate in the United States Congress as to whether or not the United States of America should fully pursue defending its citizens against nuclear missiles. 
   Madam Speaker, the Rumsfeld Commission report stated that North Korea has developed a missile with a range of 10,000 kilometers, ``placing at risk western U.S. territory in an arc extending northwest from Phoenix, Arizona, to Madison, Wisconsin.'' 
   In this Defense authorization bill, the Democrats cut nearly $800 million from missile defense. This prompted me to offer six amendments before the Rules Committee last night, but under this rule, Madam Speaker, only one has been made in order; and whether or not it will be adopted still remains to be seen. However, under the rule, one Democrat amendment that was made in order was one to cut missile defense another $1 billion.  
   Madam Speaker, if we truly build a layered missile defense system that may one day call on us to apologize to the American people for building a defensive system that proved unnecessary, that I can go home and live with. But God save us from the day when we will have to apologize to the American people for failing to build a system that could have protected them from the unspeakable nightmare of missiles turning American cities into nuclear flames. 
   Madam Speaker, if we build it, maybe they will not come.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Chairman, we currently only have a limited missile defense capability against limited threats. China is utilizing space for weapons testing, Iran is expected to have missiles capable of reaching the U.S. in less than 8 years, and now nuclear North Korea continues to defiantly test long-range missiles. Proliferation throughout the Middle East is rampant, and Osama bin Laden has stated, ``It is our religious duty to gain nuclear weapons.'' 
   Madam Chair, the first job of Congress is to protect this Nation, and because of the day in which we live, that includes an obligation on our part to ensure that the Department of Defense develops and deploys defensive capabilities that protect the American people and our warfighters against nuclear missiles, which remain the most dangerous weapons humanity has ever faced. 
   This bill cuts almost $800 million in funding that would help close the critical gaps in our missile defense system. 
   One of the programs the majority believes is not worthy of the investment is the Airborne Laser. Madam Chair, the Airborne Laser is our primary and most mature boost-phase missile defense system. ABL is a speed-of-light technology that defends against enemy missiles in their earliest phase of flight, before they can initiate sophisticated countermeasures, before they can release multiple warheads, and while they are still on enemy territory. 
   The bill also takes $160 million from the Missile Defense Agency's $310 million request for the European site, which would defend United States homeland and our European allies and deployed warfighters against ballistic missile attacks from Iran. 
   Madam Chair, they completely eliminate even the small $10 million budget for conceptual studies of a space test  bed, which would give the United States the technology to defend space assets and defend against enemy missiles in their critical boost phase of flight. 
   We must, Madam Chairman, have access to space, and we must be able to defend our space assets. It is astonishing to me that this has become a partisan issue. 
   Madam Chair, if we build a truly robust, layered missile defense system in this country, the day may come when we will have to apologize to the American people for building a defensive system that proved to be unnecessary. But God save us from the day, Madam Chair, when we have to apologize to the American people for failing to build a system that could have protected them from the unspeakable nightmare of missiles turning American cities into nuclear flames. 
   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cantor).

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is June 19, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,932 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victim, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. And it seems so sad to me, Madam Speaker, that this Sunset Memorial may be the only acknowledgement or remembrance these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber. 
   So as a small gesture, I would ask those in the Chamber who are inclined to join me for a moment of silent memorial to these lost little Americans. 
   So Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,932 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is June 19, 2008, 12,932 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children; this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Thank you, Mr. Hunter. 
   You know, Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot said tonight about Duncan Hunter. I guess the only thing I can add is simply to repeat that this man served his country in Vietnam as an Army Ranger. He served 26 years in this House, part of the time in the majority, served as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and has now served a total of 28 years in this Congress. His entire life has been about service to this country and the cause of human freedom, and I truly believe that future generations will have a greater hope to live in freedom because this man lived, and I salute him with all of my heart. 
   Mr. Chairman, I also support this bill. I only rise to associate some of my feelings with those expressed by Terry Everett, the ranking member of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, when he was concerned that the amendments that he offered to raise and restore some of the missile defense cuts in the mark had not taken place. 
   He was especially concerned about the European site, the money that was cut there, that it sends a message to Poland and other places like that that are already in a very, very dangerous position politically and in such a delicate situation that they may in fact lose the project because of the message that we send to them.     
   I believe it is very important that we realize that the missile defense site in Poland is not just about missile defense, it is about devaluing an entire nuclear missile program in the hands of an Iranian nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, the very first purpose of this government is to defend its citizens in peace, and I believe one of the greatest threats to human peace in the world is a nuclear Iran. 
   In spite of what we have heard in the media, Iran continues to enrich uranium which could give them an atomic bomb in less than 3 years. The IAEA has reported that in the 9-month period between February and November of 2007, the number of centrifuges enriching uranium operating at its Natanz enrichment facility tripled from 1,000 to now approximately 3,000 centrifuges. 
   The Director of National Intelligence, Mike McConnell, earlier this year said to the Senate Intelligence Committee that he concurred with the Israeli intelligence report stating that this many centrifuges operating continuously would produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon in less than 2 years. We now know that Iran is increasing its number of operational centrifuges from 3,000 to 9,000. Moreover, Mr. Chairman, Iran is now beginning to manufacture its own centrifuge, the IR2, which improves on the advanced P2 centrifuge that was used in Pakistan to build its existing nuclear arsenal. It is capable of producing enriched uranium two to three times faster than the older models. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman has expired.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, some of the most dangerous and lethal weapons our soldiers are facing in Iraq right now are there because Iran gave it to them. Osama bin Laden said: It is our religious duty to gain nuclear weapons. 
   If Iran is allowed to proliferate nuclear weapons into the hands of terrorists, any sense or concept of peace that we have experienced in this country so far could be gone in a blinding flash in the center of one of our major cities, maybe even in Washington, DC. And yet this majority has prevented us from voting on a military contingency plan to prevent Iran from gaining this deadly capability. 
   Mr. Chairman, very simply, the highway of history is littered with the dangers of strategic ambiguity, and I believe our best hope of preventing a nuclear Iran is to help them understand that we are prepared to do whatever is necessary, including a military contingency, if they continue to pursue their nuclear capability.  
   I hope that our children are not faced with the consequences of that strategic ambiguity. We need to be very, very clear. We need to vote on the amendment to improve this bill tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (THE REVEREND JERRY FALWELL -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, sometimes when a man affects the world as much as Jerry Falwell does, there are all kinds of things that are said, both by those who remember him in different ways, and I, today, would like to just point out some basics about Jerry Falwell. I had the privilege of knowing him many years ago, and sometimes I wonder how many of us are in this place because Jerry Falwell lived and did what he did. 
   But just to recap some of the basics, Mr. Speaker, Jerry Falwell was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, to Helen and Carey Hezekiah Falwell. He married the former Macel Pate on April 12, 1958. He had two sons, Jerry, Jr., Jonathan, and one daughter, Jeannie. 
   The church that Jerry Falwell first started was in an abandoned bottling plant in 1956, and it grew into a ministry giant that includes the 22,000-member Thomas Road Baptist Church, the Old Time Gospel Hour carried on television stations across the Nation, and the nearly 8,000-student Liberty University founded in Lynchburg in 1971. 
   He built Christian elementary schools. He built homes for unwed mothers and a home for alcoholics. Through these venues, Jerry's legacy lives on in the lives of thousands of young adults whom he called champions for Christ. And they were American patriots in his heart as well. 
   Jerry Falwell launched the Moral Majority in 1979, and its purpose was to transform a politically sleeping Christian evangelical universe into a force to transform and preserve the very soul of America. It grew into a 6.5-million-member organization and raised nearly $70 million, as it supported conservative candidates and campaigned to protect innocent human life, to work against the debasing of life and pornography and to fight for the religious freedom of students to pray in schools. 
   After a decade of catalyzing a wave of conservatism that culminated in the election and the reelection of one Ronald Reagan, Jerry disbanded the Moral Majority, saying, ``Our mission is accomplished.'' 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, approximately one of every four American voters is a Christian evangelical; and one in four American citizens, those that were the ones that Jerry helped awaken. 
   Not so long ago he said, what we've worked on for nearly 30 years ago, to mobilize people of faith and value in this country, and what we've done in those years is coming to a culmination. 
   The Pew Research Institute, a senior fellow there, John Green, to paraphrase him, he said, Falwell changed the way that evangelicals think about their political responsibility. 
   But it was one of Jerry's friends and colleagues, I think, Mr. Speaker, that put it the very best. His name was Chuck Baldwin. He spoke the following words in tribute, which I think sum up the legacy of Jerry Falwell. He said, ``America has lost a seasoned patriot. Thomas Road Baptist Church has lost a faithful and dedicated pastor. Liberty University has lost a visionary chancellor. The Church of Christ, collectively, has lost a dynamic preacher of the gospel. The Falwell family has lost a loving husband and father. And thousands of people, such as me, have lost a hero, mentor and friend. No matter what his enemies say, America is a better place because of Jerry Falwell. And those of us who were privileged to personally know him will never forget him.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is hard to add to those words. But just in the way that I could, I would simply say this, that Jerry Falwell was a man who loved God, who loved his country, who loved his family and who loved humanity. And more than we all realize, we are very blessed that he came our way. And now that he has stepped over the threshold of eternity, he has found a welcome place. He has looked into the eyes of his Saviour and heard those eternal words of victory, ``Well done, thou good and faithful servant.''

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, as many times before, I stand before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   Madam Speaker, it is now June 10, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, but before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more children, defenseless unborn, were killed by abortion on demand. And that is just today, Madam Speaker. That is more than the number of innocent lives that this Nation lost on September 11, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,923 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them,  Madam Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid going over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common, Madam Speaker. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone; and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death; and each one of their mothers, whether she realized it immediately or not, will never quite be the same; and all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   And yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invisible ignorance, while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Madam Speaker, perhaps it is time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only objective of good government.'' 
   The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' 
   Madam Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. The bedrock foundation of this Republic is that clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our core commitment to this self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world, Madam Speaker. It is truly who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. 
   Madam Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who hears this Sunset Memorial will finally tonight embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express, and that 12,923 days spent killing nearly 50 million children in America is enough; and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Madam Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this Chamber and in this sunshine of life are also numbered, and all too soon each one of us will walk from these doors for the very last time. And if it should be that Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn in our Nation. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny little brothers and sisters in America from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   Madam Speaker, it is June 10, 2008, 12,923 days since Roe v. Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children. This in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, I once again stand before this body with yet another sunset memorial. It is February 25, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand just today. That is more than the number of innocent Americans lost in September 11's tragedy, only it happens every day. 
   Madam Speaker, it has now been exactly 12,817 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Madam Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them.

And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. And all the gifts these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   Yet, even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to a blind invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims yet to date, those unborn. 
   Madam Speaker, perhaps it's important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said: ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.''

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I stand, once again, before this body with yet another Sunset Memorial. It is March 31, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless, unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That is more than the number of innocent American lives that were lost on September 11 times 15,000, the total number that were lost on September 11. 
   It has now been exactly 12,852 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of our own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, died and cried and screamed as they died.

And it seems so sad, Mr. Speaker, to me that this Sunset Memorial may be the only remembrance that these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber. 
   And so just as small a gesture as it might be, I would ask those who are inclined for just a moment of silence at this time for these little, lost Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who hears this Sunset Memorial tonight will finally realize that abortion really does kill little babies, that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express and that 12,852 days spent killing nearly 15 million children in America is enough and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon, each of us will walk through these chambers for the very last time. And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of the innocent unborn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Chairman, abortion on demand in America is the greatest single cause of death in our Nation's history. We have killed nearly 50 million of our own unborn children since the criminal Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973. That is 15,000 times the number of lives lost in the 9/11 terrorist attack. 
   Planned Parenthood is the foremost promoter and provider of abortion on demand for any reason or no reason. In the last fiscal year, this government appropriated more than $300 million to this death dealing organization. 
   Madam Chairman, it has been said that a government is what it spends. For this government to appropriate one penny of the taxpayers' money to an organization that kills unborn children and emotionally impoverishes their mothers is a disgrace that undermines the core essence of the United States of America and betrays everything that our soldiers lying out in Arlington National Cemetery died to preserve. 
   And Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to find the courage to vote for the Pence amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, over the past three decades, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has become increasingly archaic, and our intelligence community has been inhibited from acting with speed and agility to conduct necessary surveillance of foreign targets. The consequence of missing terrorist communications materialized before our eyes on the morning of 9/11; and, Madam Speaker, in the eyes of our enemy, 9/11 is only the beginning. 
   Madam Speaker, if we knew exactly where every terrorist in the world was at this moment, the war on jihad would be, in practical terms, over in about 6 weeks. However, in this 21st century, it is intelligence that is our most critical challenge. Without intelligence, our entire national defense structure is rendered ineffective and the lives of millions of Americans are placed at the mercy of an enemy possessed with a merciless ideology and a relentless vision of the Western World in nuclear flames. 
   Just this week, Madam Speaker, a new al Qaeda propaganda ad appeared on the Internet entitled, ``Wait for the Big Surprise.'' And it closed with these words: ``Soon, God willing.'' 
   Just today, Madam Speaker, the Director of National Intelligence issued an unequivocal statement that the bill we are now considering is an unacceptable solution and one that would keep him from fulfilling his duty to anticipate threats and to protect our Nation. 
   Madam Speaker, al Qaeda will not adjourn when we do. Today, this night, is our opportunity to address this vital issue. If we let partisan bickering cause us to fail, we should start now to write our apology to the children of the next generation who may see nuclear jihad and the generation beyond that that may see dangers beyond our imagination. 
   Madam Speaker, we must not fail.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill here at issue, the so-called RESTORE Act, undermines the existing structure that we put in place to reform FISA only 3 months ago. 
   In the midst of a war, any changes to the way that our intelligence community operates should be understood as a somber and delicate undertaking that requires great care. Our national security hangs in the balance. We cannot afford to get this wrong, Mr. Speaker. 
   My amendment aimed to deal with the seriously flawed provision of the RESTORE Act that will do great damage to the civil liberties of the protections of Americans.     
   My amendment would have stricken section 11 of the bill that directs the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to jointly maintain a recordkeeping system of U.S. persons whose communications are intercepted. 
   Mr. Speaker, this would amount to a big government database that would have individuals' identity attached in every practical way. There is simply no way to have a database like this that does not attach individual identities to verify the process. The Democrats maintain that the identity is not attached. But this is an impractical rebuttal. 
   Mr. Speaker, the proposal's not only misguided, it attempts ostensibly to protect Americans' civil liberties and only undermines them further. And we have to understand that these identities would be attached, even if they have no connection to spying or terrorism. 
   And the bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker, this war on terrorism is ultimately fought in the area of intelligence. If we knew where every terrorist was tonight, in 60 days this war would be over. And if we tie those people's hands who are fighting to protect this country with this RESTORE Act by the majority, I believe that we will some day revisit this issue, Mr. Speaker, because when a terrible tragedy comes on this country, it will transform this debate in the most profound way, and we need to be very, very careful. We need to understand that what we're doing here is of vital importance to future generations.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, it is such a privilege for me to stand in this Chamber to honor and  speak words of tribute to a beloved lady, born Mae Cardella Fox on a cold December day in 1913. Mae was the essential coal miner's daughter and grew up in a small miner's camp close to Habersham, Tennessee. 
   When she was only 11 years old, her mother died of pneumonia. Being the oldest daughter at home, she bravely embraced the crushing challenge at her age of maintaining a household and cooking for her siblings and her father. 
   When she was 16 years old, just as the Great Depression was falling upon America, she married another coal miner by the name of Earl Carr. The two of them were deeply committed to each other, and by themselves alone, using only hand tools, they built their first home, a log cabin on Pine Mountain above Morley, Tennessee. 
   When Mae was still in her twenties, her husband Earl was in a terrible accident when a coal mine caved in, killing many of his friends and breaking his own back and disabling him for life. When rescue workers reached him, he had already begun to dig himself out. 
   To take care of her severely injured husband and family, Mae began to take in laundry and clean houses, and she said she canned every kind of berries that grew in the Smoky Mountains. The older children gathered and sold holly at Christmas time, and the entire family gathered coal that fell from the tipple where the train cars were loaded. They said sometimes the workers would deliberately throw out coal for the families. 
   As the children grew in number and in stature, the family would travel to Florida in citrus season to pick oranges. It was there that my first memories of Mae and Earl Carr were born. I can remember at 4 years old waking up before daylight and climbing into a tarpaulin-covered truck, called a doghouse, and going to the orange groves to help pick oranges with Mae and the rest of her family. 
   To find better work, the family moved to Colorado, close to Juanita Franks, one of Mae and Earl's married daughters. While they were there, a grandson with a missing palate and a cleft lip was born to Juanita. Mae lovingly helped feed this little baby with a pill cup and an eyedropper until surgery could be performed. Madam Speaker, this is only one small instance of all of the acts of love and devotion this precious woman bestowed on every member of her family. 
   Mae Carr loved Jesus and her family more than anything else in life, and in all of the joys and struggles of their lives and 64 years of marriage, Earl and Mae Carr became the patriarch and matriarch of a family that would number 11 children, 47 grandchildren, 76 great-grandchildren, 22 great-great-grandchildren, and two more on the way. 
   A few days ago, in her 94th year of life, I was called to the bedside of Mae Carr, who as it happens, Madam Speaker, is my precious grandmother, and who was called home to meet her Savior on February 7, 2007. 
   Among her last words to me were those contained in a phrase I had heard her say many times before, and expanded just this once. She said, ``Trent, the truth will stand when the world is on fire; and the truth will still be here when the world is gone.'' 
   Madam Speaker, if all of us in this institution and this world could learn the reverence for truth and the love for humanity personified in this four-foot-eleven coal miner's daughter, the entire human family would be nobly transformed. 
   I will cherish those final moments with her for the rest of my life, because her mind at the time was still keen and perfectly lucid, and I was able to tell her not just how much I loved her, she already knew that, but I was able to tell her how much we were grateful for her 94 years of loving all of those about her, for loving life, and for making this world a better place to live. And, most importantly, Madam Speaker, I was able to remind her that indeed her life was a profound victory and that all of her dreams had come true. 
   Because you see, Madam Speaker, Mae Carr's dreams, though profound beyond words, were simple dreams: a family to love and nurture and support, children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and even great-great-grandchildren who would learn her heartfelt love for God and her fellow human beings. Her family now stands as a living testament to her life and her noble dreams fulfilled. And her greatest dream, Madam Speaker, is also now fulfilled as she stands in the presence of her Savior and has heard His eternal words of victory, ``Well done, my good and faithful servant.'' 
   The truth will stand when the world is on fire, and the truth will still be here when the world is gone. Mae Cardella Carr.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is June 20, 2008 in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Mr. Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,933 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Mr. Speaker, cried and screamed as they died, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, we couldn't hear them. 
   All of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeals itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes, our entire Constitution. It says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty of property without due process of law.'' Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth. 
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Mr. Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. And it seems so sad to me, Madam Speaker, that this Sunset Memorial may be the only acknowledgement or remembrance these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber. 
   So as a small gesture, I would ask those in the Chamber who are inclined to join me for a moment of silent memorial to these lost little Americans. 
   So Mr. Speaker, let me conclude this Sunset Memorial in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard it tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,933 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that it is time that we stood up together again, and remembered that we are the same America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust; and we are still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   Mr. Speaker, as we consider the plight of unborn America tonight, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is June 20, 2008, 12,933 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children; this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   Madam Speaker, the coincidence of jihadist terrorism and nuclear proliferation in our world today I believe represents the greatest security threat to the human family. Osama bin Laden said ``our religious duty is to gain nuclear weapons.'' If that quest should succeed, whether it is 100 yards from this Capitol or in one of our major cities, it will change our concept of freedom in a way that almost none of us can comprehend. And our best hope of preventing that is to have effective intelligence capability. 
   I believe that the majority has risked the security of this country by delaying a vote on this important bill for so long; but I am gratified today that at least we are taking the next step in making sure that we can see our children and grandchildren walk in the sunlight of freedom. 
   As we go forward, we should all keep in mind the words of our Founding Fathers and the words especially of Thomas Jefferson when he said, ``The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.''

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (PROTECTING CHILDREN -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, most of my adult life has been related to children's issues. Before I came to Congress, I had the privilege of serving in the Arizona House of Representatives as chairman of the Subcommittee on Child Protection and Family Preservation. 
   Later, I was director of the Arizona Governor's Office for Children, which had oversight of all of the State's programs for children in Arizona. 
   I was also chairman of both the Arizona State Children's Cabinet and the Interagency Study Committee on Children and AIDS. 
   And for another 4 1/2 years, Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of being the executive director of the Arizona Family Research Institute. 
   I later wrote the Arizona scholarship tax credit legislation, a version of which has now gone through five States and serves to scholarship more than 100,000 low-income children who go to a school of their parents' choice. 
   I also wrote Arizona's child obscenity and pornography bill, which became a national precedent and protects children from the insidious harm of both adult and child pornography. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reason I say those things is that there is one critical component of protecting innocent children I have learned over and over again; and that is if you desire to protect children, you must protect the family. Because either families, or government bureaucrats, will ultimately make the decisions about nearly all aspects of our children's lives. 
   The proposed SCHIP legislation funds and empowers government bureaucracies and not families. It is a quintessential example of a misguided and overreaching program that is an entitlement program and affixes itself to a funding mechanism that is a declining revenue source. Not only does it place this generation of children into a Hillary-care, government-run health care system, but it also places the burden of cost on the next generation of children, Mr. Speaker, and those many times who will be forced to pay for it will be those making less money than those benefiting from the program. 
   Mr. Speaker, Americans care desperately about their children. And, unfortunately, in this SCHIP debate, liberal Democrats are exploiting America's love for children for temporary political gain. The majority has cast this entire debate in terms of Republicans being against children and Democrats being for them. For a Republican like myself who has spent their entire life dedicated to children's issues, it is an equation that I have to reject in the strongest possible terms. And it is especially difficult for me, Mr. Speaker, in light of the fact that the same party who says they advocate for poor children leaves the very poorest children of all out of the equation. 
   It is the Democrat Party, Mr. Speaker, that has for decades fought for an abortion-on-demand policy that has allowed thousands of unborn children to be killed in America every day. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, newly elected Democrat Speaker  Nancy Pelosi said, ``We are here for the children.'' And she called the House to order for ``all of America's children.'' 
   But she didn't mean all of them, Mr. Speaker. In fact, most Democrat Members of this body, including Speaker Pelosi, voted against, in the last Congress, allowing unborn children to even receive anesthetic when undergoing abortion procedures so torturous that they would be a felony if performed on an animal. 
   Mr. Speaker, behind me this picture is a little baby who deserves to be protected like every other child in this country, and yet before the sun sets in America today, 4,000 unborn children will be killed through abortion on demand, and, Mr. Speaker, their mothers will never be the same. 
   The Democrat Speaker and the majority of this Congress have to somehow understand that there are better ways to help mothers than killing their children for them. And they must also realize that they can never have credibility as advocates for children while they still support an abortion-on-demand policy that has killed nearly 50 million innocent children. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Members of this body to come together and to truly do the right thing for all of America's children, even those yet unborn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, just today, while debating this new Iraq withdrawal bill, reports continue to surface that al Qaeda is now restructuring its power. 
   Like several other recent actions on the part of Democrats recently, this bill communicates to jihadist enemies that we are weakening and confirms their belief that they have a critical advantage over free people in the world because their will is far stronger than ours and they need only to persevere to break our resolve. 
   Osama bin Laden himself has stated, ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries. It's either victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, if Democrats continue to insist that the war in Iraq has nothing to do with the war on terrorism, then I wish they would explain that to the terrorists because they still don't understand, and they are continuing to be fundamentally committed to the destruction of the Western world and to killing us wherever they find us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the premise behind this bill is that we can have peace tomorrow so long as we are willing to surrender today. Unfortunately, with jihadist terrorism, just the opposite is true. If we surrender to terrorism today, it will only bring greater horror and suffering to all of humanity tomorrow. 
   So vital questions arise to those who would continue to demand that we surrender Iraq to terrorists. Are they also willing to allow the citizens and families of this Nation to face jihad and what may become a nuclear jihad here at home? And what will we tell our children when that day comes? 
   Mr. Speaker, defeating radical jihad in Iraq and throughout the world will require the support, perseverance, patience, wisdom and prayers of the American people. But for the sake of those people and for our children, for our future generation and for people across the world who still hope for freedom, I pray that the Members of this body would heed that warning echoing down through history.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (DRED SCOTT AND ROE V. WADE -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, today marks a tragic anniversary in American history. It was on this day in 1857 that the Supreme Court of the United States handed down the now famous Dred Scott v. Sandford ruling, saying that Dred Scott, a black man born into slavery but living in a free State, was not a United States citizen and could not sue for his freedom in Federal court. 
   In a 7-2 ruling handed down by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, a former slave owner from Maryland, the court found that the black man was not a person under the Constitution; that he was property and not a person; and that as such, he was both prohibited from bringing suit against any citizen in Federal court and was made subject to the fifth amendment of the Constitution which prohibits taking property from its owner without ``due process.'' 
   The court said that all blacks, slaves as well as free, were not and could never be citizens of the United States, and determined that blacks ``had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that the Negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his,'' the white man's, ``benefit.'' 
   By that one ruling, nearly 4 million slaves living in America were deemed by an erudite judiciary as less than human, unworthy to be protected; and it took an entire Civil War to reverse the tragedy of that decision. 
   Dred Scott tasted the freedom that he believed was the birthright of every human soul only a short time because tragically, after his emancipation in May of 1857, he lived in the freedom that he longed for for only 9 months before he passed away. 
   Today we remember the horrendous scar upon the soul of our Nation of slavery and the Dred Scott decision. And we all stand in retrospect and wonder how those people in that day could have been so blind to the unalienable truth that all men are created equal. 
   And yet today, Mr. Speaker, here in the land of the free and the home of the brave, we have allowed almost 50 million of our own unborn children to be killed in their mothers' wombs as a result of yet another Supreme Court decision that denied their personhood and the most basic constitutional right of all, that being the right to live. 
   It has now been exactly 12,827 days since the travesty called Roe v. Wade was handed down by the Supreme Court. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. 
   Yet today, even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims yet today, those yet unborn. 
   Winston Churchill said Americans always do the right thing after they have exhausted every other possibility. Americans are coming to realize that the avenues of heartlessness and selfishness are now exhausted. Americans are beginning to understand that if we as a society do not possess the courage and the will to protect innocent unborn children, that in the final analysis we will never find the will or the courage to protect any kind of liberty or rights for anyone. 
   Mr. Speaker, perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said: ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.''  
   Mr. Speaker, the rise and fall of slavery in America, if it teaches us anything, it is that the evil about us eventually and completely collapses upon itself. The time is long past for Roe v. Wade, the bloodiest court decision in the history of humanity, to take its place alongside the Dred Scott decision in the ash heap of history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. I thank the distinguished gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, because the end of the hour grows close, I would now come before this body with a sunset memorial. We intend to repeat this from time to time to chronicle the loss of life by abortion on demand in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is January 22, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun sets today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand just today. 
   Exactly 35 years today, the tragic judicial fiat called Roe v. Wade was handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million children. Mr. Speaker, that is more than 16,000 times the number of innocent lives lost on September 11. 
   Each of the 4,000 children that we lost today had at least four things in common. They were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone. And each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each of their mothers, whether she realizes it immediately or not, will never be the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. 
   Mr. Speaker, those noble heroes lying in frozen silence out in Arlington National Cemetery did not die so America could shred her own Constitution, as well as her own children, by the millions. It seems that we are never quite so eloquent as when we decry the genocidal crimes of past generations, those who allowed their courts to strip the black man and the Jew of their constitutional personhood, and then proceeded to murderously desecrate millions of these, God's own children. 
   Yet even in the full glare of such tragedy, this generation clings to blindness and invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims to date, those yet unborn. 
   Perhaps it is important for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves again of why we are really all here. 
   Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. It is our sworn oath. The phrase in the 14th amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution. It says: ``No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the Declaration, not the casual notion, but the Declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core self-evident truth. It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. It is who we are. 
   And yet today, Mr. Speaker, in this body we fail to honor that commitment. We fail our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 innocent American babies who died without the protection we should have been given them. 
   And so for them in this moment, Mr. Speaker, without yielding my time, I would invite anyone inclined to join me for a moment of silence on their behalf. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this discussion tonight presents this Congress and the American people with two destiny questions. 
   The first that all of us must ask ourselves is very simple: Does abortion really kill a baby? If the answer to that question is ``yes,'' there is a second destiny question that inevitably follows. And it is this, Mr. Speaker: Will we allow ourselves to be dragged by those who have lost their way into a darkness where the light of human compassion has gone out and the predatory survival of the fittest prevails over humanity? Or will America embrace her destiny to lead the world to cherish and honor the God-given miracle of each human life? 
   Mr. Speaker, it has been said that every baby comes with a message, that God has not yet despaired of mankind. And I mourn that those 4,000 messages sent to us today will never be heard. Mr. Speaker, I also have not yet despaired. Because tonight maybe someone new, maybe even someone in this Congress, who heard this sunset memorial will finally realize that abortion really does kill a baby, that it hurts mothers more than anyone else, and that nearly 50 million dead children in America is enough. And that America is great enough to find a better way than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are numbered and that all too soon each of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on another day yet to come, may that be the day that we hear the cries of the unborn at last. May that be the day we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect the least of these, our tiny American brothers and sisters, from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   This is a sunset memorial, Mr. Speaker. It is January 22, 2008, in the land of free and the home of the brave.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (SUNSET MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Madam Speaker, I stand once again before this House with yet another Sunset Memorial. 
   It is April 10, 2008, in the land of the free and the home of the brave, and before the sun set today in America, almost 4,000 more defenseless unborn children were killed by abortion on demand. That's just today, Madam Speaker. That's more than the number of innocent lives lost on September 11 in this country, only it happens every day. 
   It has now been exactly 12,862 days since the tragedy called Roe v. Wade was first handed down. Since then, the very foundation of this Nation has been stained by the blood of almost 50 million of its own children. Some of them, Madam Speaker, died and screamed as they did so, but because it was amniotic fluid passing over the vocal cords instead of air, no one could hear them. 
   And all of them had at least four things in common. First, they were each just little babies who had done nothing wrong to anyone, and each one of them died a nameless and lonely death. And each one of their mothers, whether she realizes it or not, will never be quite the same. And all the gifts that these children might have brought to humanity are now lost forever. Yet even in the glare of such tragedy, this generation still clings to a blind, invincible ignorance while history repeats itself and our own silent genocide mercilessly annihilates the most helpless of all victims, those yet unborn. 
   Madam Speaker, perhaps it's time for those of us in this Chamber to remind ourselves of why we are really all here. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The care of human life and its happiness and not its destruction is the chief and only object of good government.'' The phrase in the 14th Amendment capsulizes our entire Constitution, it says, ``No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' Madam Speaker, protecting the lives of our innocent citizens and their constitutional rights is why we are all here. 
   The bedrock foundation of this Republic is the clarion declaration of the self-evident truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by their Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Every conflict and battle our Nation has ever faced can be traced to our commitment to this core, self-evident truth.     
   It has made us the beacon of hope for the entire world. Madam Speaker, it is who we are. 
   And yet today another day has passed, and we in this body have failed again to honor that foundational commitment. We have failed our sworn oath and our God-given responsibility as we broke faith with nearly 4,000 more innocent American babies who died today without the protection we should have given them. And it seems too sad to me, Madam Speaker, that this Sunset Memorial may be the only acknowledgement or remembrance these children who died today will ever have in this Chamber. 
   So as a small gesture, I would ask those in the Chamber who are inclined to join me for a moment of silent memorial to these lost little Americans. 
   Madam Speaker, let me conclude in the hope that perhaps someone new who heard this Sunset Memorial tonight will finally embrace the truth that abortion really does kill little babies; that it hurts mothers in ways that we can never express; and that 12,862 days spent killing nearly 50 million unborn children in America is enough; and that the America that rejected human slavery and marched into Europe to arrest the Nazi Holocaust is still courageous and compassionate enough to find a better way for mothers and their unborn babies than abortion on demand. 
   So tonight, Madam Speaker, may we each remind ourselves that our own days in this sunshine of life are also numbered and that all too soon each one of us will walk from these Chambers for the very last time. 
   And if it should be that this Congress is allowed to convene on yet another day to come, may that be the day when we finally hear the cries of innocent unborn children. May that be the day when we find the humanity, the courage, and the will to embrace together our human and our constitutional duty to protect these, the least of our tiny, little American brothers and sisters from this murderous scourge upon our Nation called abortion on demand. 
   It is April 10, 2008, 12,862 days since Roe versus Wade first stained the foundation of this Nation with the blood of its own children, this in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (CONSTITUTION RATIFIED 220 YEARS AGO -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Speaker, today marks the 220th anniversary of the ratification of one of the greatest documents written in the history of man. 
   In fact, Mr. Speaker, it is safe to say that other than the Bible and our Declaration of Independence, no other document has so impacted the course of human history and freedom throughout the world. 
   That is because 220 years ago, the Framers of our Constitution did something singular in the long account of tyrannies, governments, and institutions invented whereby man sought to govern his fellow man. 
   A small courageous set of soldiers, farmers, aristocrats and tradesmen banded together and forever threw off the yoke of the crown of England to ``secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.'' 
   Their resolve was ratified with the Declaration of Independence that was in fact a promise to future generations to never again subject our children to the unchecked tyranny of arbitrary human government. 
   In those tumultuous days, there was perhaps no better or more justifiable case for establishing a permanent monarchy than under the noble and flint-like leadership of General George Washington. Many urged the general to do just that. But, Mr. Speaker, instead those first Americans took it upon themselves to do something completely revolutionary. Those men, who had seized for themselves potentially unlimited power over a nascent state completely vulnerable to the dictates of tyranny, chose instead to place immovable checks and limitations upon their own power and upon all those in government who would follow them. 
   The European model of life said that God gave authority to kings and a government of kings who would hold the rights of men in their hands. The American model encapsulated the divine message of human dignity: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created, that they are all equal, and that they are all endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights and that government exists to secure those rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, those first Americans understood that all men were individually accountable to God and that he first gave each of them the right to live. Without this first right of life firmly secured and clearly understood, they knew that all other rights would become meaningless; but with it, all other rights would follow. 
   They were right, Mr. Speaker. The Constitution of the United States built upon the Declaration of Independence and its proclamation of a self-evident truth that all men are created equal, and laid upon that foundation the rights of freedom of all kinds, of speech and religion, the right to own property, the right of individuals to bear arms, and the right to choose a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States is a statement of eternal truths as much as it is a statement of principles that govern a nation. Now more than ever as we take this day to commemorate the framing and establishment of that Constitution that for 220 years has served as the archetype of free democratic nations and governments all over the world, it is absolutely incumbent upon all of us to desperately remember the meaning of those words and to renew our commitment to guard against every erosion of that document and the liberties it embodies. But most importantly, the protection of the right to live. 
   Daniel Webster's admonition to all of us is so appropriate. He said: ``Hold on, my friends, to the Constitution and to the Republic for which it stands. Miracles do not cluster and what has happened once in 6,000 years may never happen again. If the American Constitution should fall, there will be anarchy throughout the world.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, Senator Webster's voice no longer sounds in these Chambers, but I pray that we hear his message anew in our hearts, and I hope we can renew our own oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States, that miraculous document that has so valiantly and nobly served the cause of humanity for 220 years.

<DOCNO>Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. FRANKS of Arizona. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to see a subject touched on here and would hope that Chairman Obey would be aware that under the State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill for 2008, $200 million of the $1.3 billion military assistance for Egypt will be withheld until the Secretary of State certifies that the Government of Egypt has taken concrete steps to reform its judiciary, to curb police abuses and address concerns about the smuggling of weapons from Egypt to Gaza. 
   I strongly support this provision, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to request that an additional provision, if the chairman would consider it at some  point, be added to ensure that the Government of Egypt also increase protections for human rights according to Egypt's own international human rights commitments, including the religious freedom of members of religious minorities, such as the Coptic Christians and Baha'is, among others. 
   I just hope, Mr. Chairman, that the chairman of the committee would be so inclined at some point, if we could work with him in any way.
