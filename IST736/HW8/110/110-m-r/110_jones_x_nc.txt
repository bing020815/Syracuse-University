<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is 324 days of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These two decorated Border Patrol agents, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11- and 12-year prison sentences. 
   This week, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans began hearing oral arguments for the agents' appeal. During the hearing, one of the three judges on the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly, said, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand.'' 
   The judges in this appeal will need to examine why the judge allowed the smuggler to plead the fifth amendment despite his immunity agreement, and why the jury was not allowed to hear crucial evidence that the smuggler was a repeat offender. The judges will also need to look at why the prosecutor charged the agents under a statute that was intended for violent criminals carrying guns, not for law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty. 
   Nothing can erase the suffering these agents have undergone and the months they have spent in prison in solitary confinement away from their families. However, a judgment in favor of Ramos and Compean in this appeal would be an important victory and the first act of justice these agents have seen since their arrest. 
   Mr. Speaker, the injustice of this case should not go unexamined. Last night, I hand-delivered a letter to JOHN CONYERS, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to request a hearing on this case. Chairman Conyers responded that he would carefully review my letter and my request. 
   In the eyes of the American people, the prosecution of these border agents was not justified. The comments by the appeals judge are justification enough for the House Judiciary Committee to review this case to determine exactly why this case got out of hand. 
   An unbiased review of this case by Attorney General Mukasey, a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee, and a Presidential pardon for these agents are all steps that can and should be taken to rectify this gross miscarriage of justice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the family of these two border agents, Compean and Ramos, that we in Congress will not give up the fight for justice until their loved ones are at home.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (PRESIDENTIAL SIGNING STATEMENTS ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on May 8, 2008, I introduced H.R. 5993, the Presidential Signing Statements Act. This bill would promote congressional and public awareness and understanding of Presidential signing statements. I am very pleased that next Friday the House Judiciary Committee will examine the issue of Presidential signing statements as part of a hearing on the balance of powers in our government. 
   The history of Presidential signing statements dates back to the 19th century. However, on September 17, 2007, a Congressional Research Service report noted that U.S. presidents have increasingly employed these statements to assert constitutional and legal objections to congressional enactments. 
   In doing so, Presidents sometimes communicate their intent to disregard certain provisions of bills they have signed into law. It is for this reason that I have introduced the Presidential Signing Statements Act. Just as the American people have access to the text of bills that are signed into law, they should have easy and prompt access to the content of Presidential signing statements that could affect how those the laws will be executed. To enable a more complete public understanding of our Nation's laws, the Congress should also be able to call for the executive explanation and justification for a Presidential signing statement. 
   According to CRS, President Clinton signed 381 signing statements while in office. Seventy of these statements raised legal and constitutional objections. President George Bush has signed 157 signing statements, 122 of these statements contain some type of constitutional challenge or objections. Because future Presidents are likely to continue this practice, Congress should act now to pass legislation to ensure proper understanding and disclosure of these signing statements. 
   The American Bar Association recently examined the issue of presidential signing statements and appointed the task force on presidential signing statements and the separation of powers doctrine. 
   The task force issued a report urging Congress to enact legislation requiring the President to promptly submit to Congress an official copy of all signing statements he issues and to submit a congressional, to the Congress, a report setting forth in full the reasons and legal basis for this statement. The ABA also recommended that such submissions be available in a publicly accessible database. 
   The bill that I introduced would require the President to provide copies of signing statements to congressional leadership within 3 days of being issued. Secondly, it would require signing statements to be published in the Federal Register; and, third, require executive staff to testify on the meaning and justification for Presidential signing statements at the request of the House or Senate Judiciary Committee; and, fourth, provide that no monies may be used to implement any  law accompanied by the signing statements if any provision of the act is violated. 
   Because it's critical that we preserve the division of power in our government and public understanding of our Nation's laws, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosigning the Presidential Signing Statements Act. 
   I look forward to next week's House Judiciary Committee hearing, and the opportunity to further discuss why this legislation is a much-needed piece of legislation. 
   Before I close, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and Iraq, and ask God to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform, and ask God to continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 512th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12 years, respectively. Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted in March of 2006 for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These agents never should have been prosecuted, yet the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler. I want to repeat that, Mr. Speaker, yet, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas and was permitted to return to Mexico. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I would especially like to thank House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers and his staff for their interest in investigating this case. Last week, I spoke to Chairman Conyers about this case, and I was so grateful to learn that the chairman is seriously considering holding hearings to thoroughly examine the prosecution of these two Border agents. The American people have not forgotten Agents Ramos and Compean, who should have been commended instead of indicted. The hundreds of thousands of Americans who have supported these two heroes will greatly appreciate a decision by Chairman Conyers to hold hearings on this injustice. 
   These two agents have given years of their life in service to this Nation, yet they have been unjustly punished for doing their job to protect our homeland. Those of us--and there have been many on both sides of the political aisle--who have spoken out on behalf of these agents for more than a year are waiting on the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to render its decision in this case. 
   When those who bravely defend our borders are prosecuted, it sends a confusing message to law enforcement, who are trying to protect the American people. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope and prayer that one day soon this injustice will be corrected and these two heroes will be home with their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by saying that we have called on the President of the United States to pardon these two agents, and yet nothing has happened. The last hope for this Congress is in the hands of Chairman Conyers. And I have great respect for Chairman Conyers, he is a man of integrity and honor. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask God to continue to bless these two Border agents and their families. And I will also ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform, and ask God to continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (RENAMING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, as of today, H.R. 346, my legislation to redesignate the Department of the Navy as the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps has 60 cosponsors. Although the language of this bill has already been passed by the full House last month as part of the Defense authorization bill, I want to encourage my colleagues on the floor of the House to join in cosponsoring this legislation. When the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act goes to conference in the fall, a large number of cosponsors of H.R. 346 will show the Senate the House strongly supports this change in name. 
   This is the sixth year in a row that the House has voted to support this change. This year, I hope the Senate will support the House position and join in bringing the proper respect to the fighting team of the Navy and Marine Corps. I am thankful to the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Carl Levin, who has said publicly that he will ``keep an open mind'' on this issue. 
   Changing the name of the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps is a symbolic gesture, but it is important to the team. This change is about recognizing the true meaning of the department. The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy. They are co-equal partners. 
   Madam Speaker, there is no cost to this change. It is the right thing to do for the Marine Corps and the Navy. This legislation has received the support of numerous military leaders in both the Navy and the Marine Corps. 
   Madam Speaker, let me quote the Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs during the years of 1993 and 1998, who voiced his support for the change. I quote the Honorable Wade Sanders: ``As a combat veteran and formal Naval officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamic and the importance of recognizing the contributions of team components. The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that, a dynamic partnership, and it is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership.'' 
   I further would like to quote General Carl Mundy, the 30th Commandant of the Marine Corps. He stated, ``I believe the changes you propose will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibility and functions of the appointed civilian authority over the United States naval services. I believe that any Secretary, present, past, or future, will be proud to bear the title `Marine,' as well as `Navy.' '' 
   Madam Speaker, I have beside me, and I would read very carefully, ``The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting this Silver Star posthumously to Sergeant Michael Bitz, United States Marine Corps.'' 
   Madam Speaker, the reason this is important, this Marine gave his life for his country. He left a wife and three children, twins hat he never saw that were born after he was deployed to Iraq. And yet, as you can see in these orders for the Silver Star, there is the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C., and the zip code and Navy flag. There is nothing in the heading that says ``Marine.'' 
   Madam Speaker, what this bill will do, if the President should sign it, is to say that this Marine who died for this country, that the orders for the Silver Star clearly state the team's name. The name of the team is the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   But what the heading would say in this order for the Silver Star is the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, Washington, D.C., with the flag of the Marine Corps and the flag of the Navy. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues in the House this year will join me, and let's get over 150, maybe 200 of my colleagues in both parties, to sign this legislation so we can say to the Senate in the fall of this year, it is time that the Marine Corps be recognized as an equal to the Navy. They both are equal in the services, and it is time that the Department of the Navy carry the name Marine Corps. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform, and may God continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (THE CONSTITUTIONAL WAR POWERS RESOLUTION OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, questions of when and how American military forces should be used have become increasingly complex in the 21st century. Threats to international peace and security continue  to evolve. Today the notion of national self-defense has come to include preemptive or preventive military action against those who are perceived to be a threat. A war on terrorism in which the enemy may not always be a specific nation-state has become the primary defense concerns of the United States. 
   The War Powers Resolution of 1973 was intended to clarify the intent of the constitutional framers and ensure that Congress and the President share in the decision-making process in the event of armed conflict. 
   Yet, since the enactment of the Resolution, presidents have consistently maintained that the consultation, reporting and congressional authorization requirements of the Resolution are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Constitution divides war powers between the legislative and executive branches. Our Constitution states that while the Commander in Chief has the power to conduct war, only Congress has the power to authorize war. Too many times this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty and allowed Presidents to overstep their constitutional authority. 
   As James Madison said, and I quote, ``In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature and not to the executive department.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time for Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility. The framers sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches. Because this balance has been both respected and ignored throughout American history, I have today introduced legislation, H.J. Resolution 53, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution that seeks to establish a clear and national policy for today's post-9/11 world. This resolution is a result of the dedicated work of the Constitutional Project and its War Powers Initiative. 
   The Constitutional War Powers Resolution improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures that the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional approval. It also provides a more robust reporting requirement to enable Congress to be more informed and to have great oversight. 
   By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad. This resolution protects and preserves the checks and balances that framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this legislation. I ask the good Lord in heaven to please bless our men and women in uniform and to continue to bless America. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (FOREIGN SHORTFALLS IN IRAQ AID PLEDGES -- (House of Representatives - March 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House and to the American people a disturbing situation involving a shortfall in Iraq aid pledges. I also brought this issue to the attention of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, for whom I have great respect, during a hearing last month of the House Armed Services Committee. 
   On January 30 of 2008, USA Today reported that allied countries have paid only 16 percent of their pledge. Their pledge was $15.8 billion, and they have only paid $2.5 billion. 
   The article further reports, and I quote, ``The biggest shortfall in pledges by 41 donor countries are from Iraq's oil rich neighbors and U.S. allies,'' namely, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
   Yet, the United States has already spent $29 billion to help rebuild Iraq, and Congress has approved an additional $16.5 billion. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is troubling that some of the countries that may benefit from a secure and stable Iraq, particularly its neighbors in the region, are not providing the money they pledged to help achieve the goal to rebuild Iraq. 
   Unlike the United States, which is borrowing money from foreign governments to pay its bills, many of Iraq's neighbors are running record surpluses because of profits flowing into their government coffers by their national oil companies. These countries have the economic resources to meet their commitments. 
   In a letter on February 8, 2008, I expressed these concerns to Secretary Condoleezza Rice and to President Bush.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, only those who have been to war can truly understand the hell of war. I have not been to war, but I have spoken to those who have served our country in both Iraq and Afghanistan. I know enough to understand that those who serve in harm's way face grave dangers, and they are under extreme pressure. 
   Most of us cannot imagine the stress that those in uniform undergo when they have to make a split-second decision whether to fire or be fired upon, to kill or be killed. 
   In June 2006, seven Marines and one Navy corpsman from Camp Pendleton were charged with murder in an April 2006 incident involving the death of an Iraqi man. The troops were staking out an intersection while looking for insurgents placing explosives along the road. 
   The squad of eight is accused of kidnapping the Iraqi man from a nearby home, killing him, and then staging the scene to frame him as an insurgent planting a bomb. 
   Four of the troops struck plea deals and received sentences of 21 months or less in exchange for their testimony against their squad mates. One of the troops also pled guilty to lesser charges but received an 8-year sentence. The three remaining Marines all face courts martial this summer and life in prison if convicted of premeditated murder. 
   One of these three Marines is a constituent of Congressman BILL DELAHUNT, who brought the details of this case to my attention. 
   Madam Speaker, 3 years ago, I came to this floor night after night to speak about what I felt was an unfair prosecution of Lieutenant Ilario Pantano, a Marine who was charged with shooting an insurgent in Iraq. Not because of my concern, but because the charges against Lieutenant Pantano were not justified, the Marine Corps dropped the charges. 
   Because of my great respect for the men and women who serve in the United States Marine Corps, it is my hope that these Marines will receive the due process and justice they deserve as American citizens and as heroes. 
   President Teddy Roosevelt once said, ``A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards. More than that no man is entitled, and less than that no man shall have.'' 
   The same men and women who risk their lives to preserve the rights of all American citizens deserve the protection of those same rights. Those who fight for justice deserve justice in return. 
   Madam Speaker, our military servicemembers, the military family, and certainly these Marines, deserve no less. 
   And Madam Speaker, with that, I close by saying, God, please continue to bless our men and women in uniform and their families, and please, God, continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I do want to commend Congressman McIntyre for his labors of love and his efforts to bring this to the floor and his support for this. 
   I happen to oppose him on this for several reasons, and I want to say that I'm from North Carolina, as well as Mr. McIntyre. This has been an ongoing issue, as he made reference to in his comments, for years and years. But this issue of the Lumbee should be allowed to go through the existing Federal process. And I believe sincerely that Representatives SHULER and SHAYS offered an amendment in the Rules Committee to allow this to happen, but sadly, it was rejected. 
   The BIA process allows non-biased experts to objectively examine historical evidence and make decisions based on seven strict criteria. If there are problems with the process, then we should fix the process; ``we'' meaning the Congress. But Congress should not start down this slippery slope of hijacking the objective BIA process and start recognizing tribes on its own. This is and would be a serious mistake. 
   Madam Speaker, roughly 250 native groups have applications pending at BIA, Bureau of Indian Affairs. If we pass this bill, all of these groups will come knocking at the door of Congress seeking Federal recognition, and it will be impossible for those of us in Congress to say no. 
   Lumbees' tribal origins are suspect, at best. Over time, they have self-identified themselves as four different tribes: Cherokee in 1924; Cheraw in 1933; Siouan in 1934; and now they are Lumbees. This makes it all the more important for experts to determine their eligibility, not subjective Members of Congress. 
   Madam Speaker, the CBO says Federal recognition of Lumbees would cost $489 million in the first 5 years; $489 million in the first 5 years. I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, who maybe support this legislation, would allow this Congress, on such an important issue, to debate it, to debate amendments, and let's see how we can at least let the American people know that this is an open process and not a closed process. 
   And, Madam Speaker, I will tell you again, in closing, that many people in North Carolina are familiar with this issue and the history of the Lumbees. And their heritage is in question. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will vote against the rule and the legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (THE PROSECUTION OF FORMER U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold a hearing this week to examine mandatory minimum sentencing laws. Included in this hearing will be the opportunity to examine the issue of mandatory minimum sentencing in the case of U.S. Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean. 
   As the Members of this House well know, in February, 2006, the two agents were convicted in a U.S. District Court in Texas for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler. They were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison respectively, and today is the 160th day since the agents entered Federal prison. 
   The law that the agents were charged with violating, 18 United States Code, section 924(c)(1)(A), carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years. As enacted by Congress, the law requires a defendant to be indicted and convicted either of ``using'' or ``carrying'' a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or ``possessing'' a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. 
   However, neither Mr. Ramos nor Mr. Compean were ever charged with specific elements of the crime. Instead, the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District Court of Texas, Mr. Johnny Sutton, extracted from the U.S. Criminal Code a sentencing factor, ``discharging'' a firearm, and substituted that sentencing factor for the congressionally defined elements of the offense. Ten years of each of their sentences were based on an indictment and conviction for a Federal crime that does not exist. The law they were charged with violating has never been enacted by the United States Congress but rather was fashioned by the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
   In this case I can imagine how difficult it would be to obtain an indictment and conviction for ``using,'' ``possessing,'' or ``carrying'' a firearm when the Border Patrol agents were required to carry firearms as part of their job. That difficulty may well explain why this U.S. Attorney's Office unilaterally changed Congress's definition of a crime to a definition that would be easier for the prosecution to prove. 
   When this issue was brought to my attention and to the attention of my colleagues VIRGIL GOODE and former Texas State Judge TED POE, we were pleased to join forces with the Gun Owners Foundation, U.S. Border Control, U.S. Border Control Foundation, and the Conservative Legal Defense & Education Fund to file a friend of the court brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The brief urges reversal of these unjust convictions and 10-year mandatory minimum sentences by spelling out how charges contained in two counts of the indictment against the agents are fatally defective. 
   I want to thank Chairman John Conyers for scheduling a hearing on this issue, as well as the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism and Homeland Security for its willingness to investigate the injustice committed against these two border agents. 
   I encourage the chairman and the committee to take a thorough look at the action of the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas and his aggressive prosecution of law enforcement officers like Ramos and Compean. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I close, I want to let the families of Compean and Ramos know that we are not going to forget these two border agents. They are heroes and should never have been sent to prison.

   To my friend Mr. Rohrabacher, I want to thank him for his passionate feelings tonight. The American people had to feel that. 
   I want to say to you, Mr. Bilbray and Mr. Rohrabacher, that we have for the last 7 months, a large number of us, have been fighting for these two border agents. 
   I am not going to try to repeat anything that has been said. I want to be short in my time because of the limited time that is left tonight. But I want to say that, as Mr. Rohrabacher articulated every aspect of this case, there is nothing I could add to it except this: We have written, at least myself alone, four letters to the President of the United States going back to August 21 of 2006. We have a letter today, which will be the fifth letter. Many of these letters by me personally have been signed by at least 30 to 40 Members of Congress. Mr. Rohrabacher had one back in December signed by 50 Members. And I want to join him very briefly. Why will this administration not listen to the truth? 
   And I am not going to try to articulate anything that has already been said, but these men are heroes in this country. I don't know how these Hispanic Americans, and that is what they are, a great part of America, Hispanic Americans, Compean and Ramos, how their families could believe in America tonight, with their loved ones who tried to fight drug traffickers in this country. Their husbands tonight, Ramos and Compean, are in the Federal prisons. And as was said by Mr. Rohrabacher, Mr. Ramos last Saturday night was beaten up by Mexican nationals. 
   I close my brief comments tonight by saying to the President of the United States, please listen to the Members of Congress. But more important than the Members of Congress, listen to the American people. For the last 8 months they have been calling talk shows throughout this great Nation and saying to the President of the United States please pardon these men. 
   And when I heard Tony Snow answer the question a month ago and said that this is nonsensical, Mr. Snow, wake up yourself. Awaken the President to what has happened. These men deserve to be heroes, not to be crucified by this government. 
   If we believe in justice, Mr. President, and I hope and believe that you do believe in justice, then soon, in the next few days, you will grant a pardon to these two men. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for this brief time. And that is all I needed was this brief time.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, 3 weeks ago, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean never should have been sent to prison. 
   These agents were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern borders into Texas. Members of Congress and countless American citizens have repeatedly petitioned President Bush to pardon these agents. At the House Democratic Caucus last week, the President said, and I quote the President, ``We want our Border Patrol agents guarding the borders from criminals and drug dealers and terrorists.'' 
   Agents Ramos and Compean were protecting the American people from an illegal drug dealer. Mr. President, we are calling on you today, as you pledged you would last month, to take a sober look at this case. 
   Many Members of Congress have warned that if these two border agents enter prison, their safety would be threatened by those who hate law enforcement officers. Madam Speaker, tragically this happened last Saturday evening to Agent Ramos who was beaten in prison by a group of Mexican nationals. 
   Mr. President, the safety of these men is in jeopardy and time is running out. You alone have the authority to correct this injustice by pardoning these two men. Mr. President, please do not delay your review of the facts of this case. 
   Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I will soon be sending a fifth letter to the President concerning these agents. We are asking the President to please expedite his consideration of a pardon for these two men and help these families realize that America is a country that believes in justice. Madam Speaker, I want to repeat that phrase very quickly: America is a country that believes in justice.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, in 1947, when the National Security Act became law, Congress declared that the Department of Defense consists of four distinct military services, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps. But the act spells out the mission of today's Marine Corps and clearly indicates that the Corps is a legal distinct military service within the Department of Navy; that is, the Marine Corps and the Navy are coequal partners. The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy, they are a team. There is not a subordinate relationship between the Chief of Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. They are equal partners of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and it is time the Department of Navy recognizes the equal status. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is why I have again introduced legislation, H.R. 346, to change the name of the Department of the Navy to the Department of Navy and Marine Corps. I am encouraged that this change has been included in the House defense authorization bill for the past several years, but it has not been accepted by the Senate. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this legislation, and I hope this year the House position will prevail in the Senate. This legislation is not about changing the responsibilities of the Secretary or reallocating resources, there is no cost to this change. Instead, it is about showing the Nation the true meaning of the department and recognizing the Marine Corps' extreme importance to our national security. 
   When the President's top military adviser, General Peter Pace, is wearing the uniform of the Marine Corps, it is time to realize that change is long overdue. The Marines that are fighting today deserve this recognition. Sadly, in the past 4 years over 900 Marines have been killed while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. When the Department of the Navy writes the families of Marines who have been killed, their families deserve to receive that letter from the Department of the Navy and the Marine Corps. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have on the floor this afternoon an enhancement of the orders for the Silver Star for Sergeant Michael Bitz of the United States Marine Corps who was killed in the Iraq war for freedom. He was cited with a Silver Star received by his family after his death. I brought this to the floor to emphatically show the difference of what it is today and what it should be tomorrow. 
   The first poster is an enlargement of the actual orders from the Secretary of Navy. And you can see the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C., with the zip code and the Navy flag. Again, this was a Marine who died for this country. 
   If you look at the second poster that is beside me, you will see what it can be if this bill becomes law and is accepted by the Senate and sent to the President for signing. The order should be a flag, the Navy flag, the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps with the Marine flag. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I close, this is all about fairness and equality because there are four distinct services, the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps and the Air Force. I think it is only right and befitting that two great services that have such a tradition and a heritage be treated as partners, and that is what this legislation does, the Department of Navy and Marine Corps. 
   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in this effort, and let's recognize two great services, the Navy and the Marine Corps, as partners and a team. 
   With that, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform and their families. And I ask God to please hold in His loving arms the families who have lost a loved one dying for this country. And I ask God to continue to bless America

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 105th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17 of 2007, two U.S. Border agents entered Federal prison to began serving 11-year and 12-year sentences respectively. Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders into Texas. 
   These agents never should have been prosecuted; yet, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler. The illegal drug smuggler, who received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico and is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. Mr. Speaker, that is a joke. He is not an American citizen, he is a criminal. 
   The same U.S. Attorney's Office in Western Texas also prosecuted another law enforcement officer, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez, who was doing his job to protect the American people.     
   This makes no sense. Mr. Speaker, citizens across this country, and many of us in Congress want to know why does a Federal prosecutor in Western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting illegal aliens who commit crimes? 
   The American people have not forgotten Agents Ramos and Compean, who should have been commended instead of indicted. I am encouraging citizens across this Nation to continue calling the White House and ask the President to use his authority to immediately pardon these two heroes. 
   Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and the justification for the criminal charges brought against these agents. 
   Mr. Speaker, Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy has already approved Senator Diane Feinstein's request for an investigation of this case. And in recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzalez promised to fully cooperate with an oversight hearing on the agents' case. 
   I want to thank Mr. Greg Barnes on the staff of the House Judiciary Committee for taking time last week, at  my request, to meet with Mrs. Monica Ramos, the wife of Agent Ramos and his father, her father-in-law, Mr. Joe Loya. 
   I also appreciate that Chairman John Conyers took time to say hello to Ms. Ramos and her father. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am encouraged that the House Judiciary Committee is seriously looking at holding hearings to investigate the injustice committed against these border agents. And that is why it is so important, Mr. Speaker, that the House look seriously at what happened to these men, who should be rewarded for trying to protect the American people, not serving time in a Federal prison.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today I had the pleasure of meeting with Congressman JOHN CONYERS, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I shared with him information from myself and other Members of Congress who are requesting a hearing on the case of Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean. 
   Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and his decision to bring criminal charges against these agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These agents never should have been sent to prison, yet today is their 62nd day behind bars. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated, and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. Members of Congress and the American people want to know why the Federal prosecutor is on the wrong side in this case. 
   To prosecute the agents, the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to a known drug smuggler. He is not an American citizen, he is a criminal. Drug enforcement reports have confirmed that the Mexican drug smuggler brought a second load of marijuana, 752 pounds, into the United States after he was granted immunity to testify against our border agents, but this information was kept from the jury and the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am certain that Chairman Conyers will review the information that I and other Members of Congress have brought to his attention concerning the prosecution of these two heroes. 
   Before closing, I ask the President to use his authority and pardon these two Hispanic Americans who were doing their job to protect the American people; and, more importantly, I call on the President to listen to the American people and to the thousands of citizens who have asked for a pardon for these two men.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (RENAMING DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will consider the 2008 defense authorization bill. For the sixth year in a row, the bill contains language to rename the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   I want to thank House Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter for their continued support for this change because the need to recognize the coequal status of the Navy and the Marine Corps team is long overdue. I have continued to introduce legislation to rename the department. I hope this year the Senate will support the House position and join in bringing the proper respect to the fighting team of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   Over the years, this name change has received not only the support of the full House Armed Services Committee but also the support of former Navy Secretaries and Marine Corps Commandants. 
   The Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs, 1993 to 1998, voiced his support for the change when he stated: ``As a combat veteran and former Navy officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamics and the importance of recognizing the contribution of team components. The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that, a dynamic partnership, and it is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership.'' 
   General Carl Mundy, the 30th Commandant of the Marine Corps stated: ``I believe the changes you propose will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibilities, and functions of the appointed civilian authority over the United States naval services. I believe that any Secretary, present, past or future, will be very proud to bear the title `Marine' as well as `Navy.' '' 
   Admiral Stansfield Turner, United States Navy, Retired, former Director of Central Intelligence, stated: ``I think this change in title enhances the prestige and pride of the people in the Marine Corps. And it does not necessarily take anything away from the Navy in that process.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, last year an editorial in the Chicago Tribune on April 21, 2006, also supported the change stating: ``No service branch shows more respect for tradition than the United States Marine Corps does, which makes it all the more ironic that tradition denies the Corps an important show of respect: Equal billing with the other services and the branches.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as I begin to close, I want to show the Members of the House, these are the orders from the Secretary of the Navy. Sergeant Michael Bitz, United States Marine Corps, was killed for this country 2 years ago and his family received in his memory the Silver Star for Valor. And yet, Mr. Speaker, you can see that the title of the order says the Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D.C. and the Navy flag. This was a Marine who gave his life for this country. 
   Isn't it proper that the orders for the Silver Star should look like this and say at the top the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, Navy flag, Marine flag, they are one fighting team and they should be recognized as a fighting team. 
   It is about time, after 40-some years, the House, with the Goldwater-Nichols bill, said there are four separate branches: The Marine Corps, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Army, and it is time that the Marine Corps be recognized as one of the strongest fighting teams in this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, too often during wartime, tragedy takes center stage and heart-warming stories never get told. Tonight I would like to share a truly touching story with my colleagues in the House and with the American people. 
   Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee was a United States Marine Corps working-dog handler who was killed in action on March 21, 2007, in Fallujah, Iraq. Corporal Lee and his canine partner, Lex, a 7-year-old German shepherd from Camp Lejeune were a highly trained explosives detection team. Lex, who was due for retirement after his combat tour in Iraq, suffered shrapnel wounds from the same enemy-fired rocket-propelled grenade that took Corporal Lee's life. 
   Following Corporal Lee's death, the Lee family began seeking to adopt their son's canine companion who was with their son during the last moments on Earth. However, after filing the necessary paperwork, contacts at Marine Corps Logistic Base Albany indicated that Lex had been medically evaluated and, although injured, was fit for duty and not yet eligible for adoption. 
   I first learned of the Lee family's situation by reading the short story, ``My Partner Dustin,'' written by John Burnam, author of ``Dog Tags of Courage.'' 
   Madam Speaker, at this time I will submit the text of the story for the Congressional Record. 
   My Partner Dustin  
   I'm a U.S. Marine and the primary element of a two-member team trained to hunt and locate explosives. My partner and I trained as a team for many months honing our expertise to save American lives in the War on Terrorism in Iraq. 
   The date is March 21, 2007 and I was on the job in Fallujah, Iraq when an enemy fired Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) exploded in our midst. I was blasted to the ground. I'm Stunned. My head is ringing and my body feels numb. My eyes can't quite focus on anything. 
   My partner is lying next to me severely wounded and bleeding. I move to him and touch him but he's not responding. I feel sharp pains in my side and back. I'm bleeding but deal with it and concentrate on comforting my partner and protecting him from further harm. 
   Everything happened so fast that it caused disorientation and confusion. My senses pick up the lingering smell of burnt powder and smoke from the explosion. I hear lots of American voices and heavy boot-steps hurrying all around us. They reach our location and immediately attend to my partner. And then they carry him away. I'm separated from my partner for the first time. I'm not clear of thought and then I too am carried way but to a different hospital. 
   I'm in a building lying on a table with lights above and people talking. Still dazed and confused I hear a strange voice say my name, ``Lex!'' I gesture a slight reflex of acknowledgement. ``Lex! You are going to be okay buddy! Just lay still. We are going to take care of your hurts, so stay calm okay, Lex?'' My eyes dart around the room searching for my partner, but he's not there and no one can interpret my thoughts. 
   I'm released from the hospital and well enough to travel so they transfer me from Iraq to a U.S. Marine Corp base in Albany, Georgia. I really miss my partner, Dusty. I know something has happened to him because he would never have left me alone for so long. 
   Yes, my name is Lex. I'm a seven year old German shepherd Military Working Dog. My master and loyal partner is Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee, U.S. Marine Corps canine handler from Mississippi. I'm well disciplined to  my master's commands and expertly trained to sniff out bombs and explosives. Where's my master, Dusty? Where's Dusty, my partner? No one can understand me but Dusty. Where's Dusty? 
   Iraq was to be my last combat tour before retirement. Dusty talked to me all the time about going home and adopting me. I sure do miss my Dusty. He is the best friend I've ever had. I love that crazy Marine from Mississippi! 
   No one can measure the love and unconditional loyalty I have for Dusty. I'd sacrifice my own life for him and he knows it. I just wish I could have stopped that RPG or pushed Dusty away from that powerful blast. It all happened in a blink of an eye and I didn't see it coming until it was too late. Now I sit alone in my kennel-run waiting for the day Dusty shows up.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, since 1947 Congress has twice affirmed that the Marine Corps is a separate military service within the Department of the Navy. In 1947, the National Security Act stated that we have four separate military services: the Army, the Air Force, the Navy, and the Marine Corps. 
   In 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Act formally acknowledged the roles of each service's commanding officer and stated that each branch's commander serves equally as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   For the past 5 years, this House has sent legislation to the Senate that would rename the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. Not only has this change received support from the full House Armed Services Committee and the House itself, but by such notables as Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitz; Assistant Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett, III; Acting Secretary of the Navy Daniel Howard; Secretary of the Navy John Dalton; General Carl Mundy, 30th Commandant of the Marine Corps; General Chuck Krulak, 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Fleet Reserve Association; the Marine Corps League; the National Defense PAC; and the National Association of Uniformed Services. 
   Wade Sanders, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs, 1993 to 1998, also declared his support for this change. He stated: ``As a combat veteran and former naval officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamic and the importance of recognizing the contributions of team components.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, soon the page will bring forward a photo of two border agents who are now in prison. And it is a travesty of injustice as bad as I have ever seen. 
   The portrait is of the two border agents, Mr. Compean and Mr. Ramos. Mr. Compean has a wife and three children, one, his youngest, 4 months old. Agent Ramos has a wife and three sons. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of us in the House have made the House aware of this case. These agents were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. The agents fired shots during a foot chase with the smuggler, who had fled in a van they were pursuing. The van contained approximately $1 million worth of marijuana. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to a known drug smuggler for his testimony against our border agents. 
   This prosecution has been questioned by many Members of Congress and by citizens throughout this country. These men never should have been prosecuted; yet they are now handcuffed in Federal prison. We have repeatedly petitioned President Bush to pardon these agents. 
   Mr. Speaker, after months of silence, the President said in a television interview last week that he would take a ``sober look'' at the case and a ``tough look at the facts'' to see whether these agents should be pardoned. 
   I hope that at this time the President and his staff will take an honest look at the facts of this case. The facts will tell the President what countless citizens and Members of Congress already know, that the United States Attorney's Office was on the wrong side of this case. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents almost exclusively on the testimony of an admitted drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. 
   The drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is now suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. 
   The drug smuggler is not an American citizen. He is a criminal. 
   Mr. Speaker, the extraordinary details surrounding the prosecution of this case ensure that justice has not been served. For the sake of the agents and their families and for the sake of the American people whom they were working to protect, I encourage the President of the United States to obtain the transcripts of this trial and review the facts of this case as soon as possible. 
   Real justice does not fear the truth. Real justice does not fear the truth. By pardoning these two innocent men, the President can immediately reverse an injustice that never should have happened to these Hispanic Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate that Agent Compean and his wife have three children and one, his youngest, 4 months old; and that Agent Ramos, himself, and his wife have three sons. 
   Congressman Poe, who will be speaking in a few minutes on another issue, I am sure, has been outspoken on this--and a number of other Members and even some on the Democratic side. This is an injustice that should never happen to an American citizen, never under any circumstances. 
   Mr. President, please look at the facts of this case. Free these men. They have no business being in a Federal penitentiary for trying to protect the American citizens. 
   And God bless America

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 112th day since a great injustice took place in this country. 
   On January 17, 2007, two United States Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11- and 12-year sentences respectively. 
   Agent Compean and Agent Ramos were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted. Yet, the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and has sued the border patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. And he is not an American citizen. 
   The American people have not forgotten Agents Ramos and Compean, who should have been commended instead of indicted. I encourage citizens across this country to continue calling the White House and ask the President to use his authority to immediately pardon these two heroes. 
   Members of Congress and the American people are outraged and concerned with this administration's indifference to the plight of two honorable men who have been crucified unfairly by a Federal prosecutor. These two agents have given years of their lives in service to this Nation; yet they have been unjustly punished for doing their job to protect the American people. 
   By using the power of his office to pardon these two agents, the President has the opportunity to reverse a grave injustice. 
   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to share part of the comments made by Chairman John Conyers on the floor last week following my remarks on these two border agents, and I quote the chairman: ``It's important that the kinds of concerns you have raised are known to all of our men and women who carry badges and weapons defending us, not just at borders, but in every State in the Union.'' Again, that is a quote from Chairman John Conyers. 
   I want to thank Chairman Conyers for his interest in this issue, and I am encouraged that the Senate Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee will soon move forward with hearings to investigate the injustice committed against these two border agents.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, it has been 336 days since two United States Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. They're serving 11 and 12 years in prison. 
   Earlier this month, the White House released its list of 29 pardons which are traditionally granted around Christmastime. Among the list of pardons were those convicted of conspiring to import marijuana, possessing a stolen motor vehicle and distributing cocaine. 
   Madam Speaker, there are 7 days until Christmas, yet Agents Ramos and Compean, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are still in Federal prison, away from their families and loved ones. 
   There is bipartisan agreement among Members of Congress that the overzealous prosecution of these agents and their excessive prison sentence is a tremendous miscarriage of justice. In recent days, I was pleased to join Congressman ED ROYCE and other House colleagues in writing the President to urge him to ensure that Agents Ramos and Compean are released from jail by Christmas. I was also happy to join Congressman BILL DELAHUNT and others in cosponsoring a resolution calling on the President to commute the agents' sentences to time already served. 
   A ruling on this case from the 5th United States Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans is expected within weeks. Nothing can erase the suffering these agents and their families have undergone and the months they have spent in prison in solitary confinement away from their families; however, a judgment in favor of Ramos and Compean in this appeal would be an important victory and the first act of justice these agents have seen since their arrest. 
   During the appeal hearing, one of the three judges on this case, Judge E. Grady Jolly, said, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this got way out of hand.'' 
   Madam Speaker, in the eyes of many Americans, the prosecution of these border agents was not justified. An unbiased review of this case by Attorney General Mukasey, a hearing by the House Judiciary Committee and a Presidential pardon for these agents are all steps that can and should be taken to rectify this gross miscarriage of justice. 
   Through the efforts of this Congress and the American people, I am hopeful that justice will soon prevail for Ramos and Compean, that the nightmare of their imprisonment will end, and they will soon return home to their families and those they long to be with. 
   Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to ensure the families of Ramos and Compean that those of us in Congress will not forget this injustice until these men are released. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I ask God to bless our men and women in uniform and their families, and ask God to continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on May 8, 2008, I introduced H.R. 5993, the Presidential Signing Statements Act. This bill would promote congressional and public awareness and understanding of presidential signing statements. 
   The history of presidential signing statements dates back to the 19th century; however, a September 17, 2007, Congressional Research Service report noted that U.S. Presidents have increasingly employed the statements to assert constitutional and legal objections to congressional enactments. In doing so, a President sometimes communicates their intent to disregard certain provisions of bills that have been signed into law. 
   It is for this reason that I have introduced the Presidential Signing Statements Act. Just as the American people have access to the text of bills that are signed into law, they should have easy and prompt access to the content of presidential signing statements that may affect how those laws will be executed. To enable a more complete public understanding of our Nation's laws, the Congress should also be able to call for the executive explanation and justification for a presidential signing statement. 
   According to CRS, President Clinton issued 381 signing statements while in  office; 70 of these statements raised legal or constitutional objections. President George W. Bush has issued 157 signing statements; 122 of these statements have contained some type of constitutional challenge or objection. Because it's reasonable to assume that future Presidents will continue this practice, Congress should act now to pass legislation to ensure proper understanding and disclosure of these signing statements. 
   The American Bar Association recently examined the issue of presidential signing statements and appointed the Task Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation of Powers Doctrine. That task force issued a report urging Congress to ``enact legislation requiring the President to promptly submit to Congress an official copy of all signing statements he issues ..... to submit to Congress a report setting forth in full the reasons and legal basis for the statement.'' The ABA also recommended that ``such submissions be available in a publicly accessible database.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill that I have introduced would require the President to transmit copies of the signing statements to congressional leadership within 3 days of issuance; require signing statements to be published in the Federal Register; third, require executive staff to testify on the meaning and justification for presidential signing statements at the request of the House or the Senate Judiciary Committee; and, fourth, provide that no moneys may be authorized or expended to implement any law accompanied by a signing statement if any provision of the law is violated. 
   Mr. Speaker, because it's important that we preserve the provision of power in our government and public understanding of our Nation's laws, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this legislation, H.R. 5993. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and ask God to continue to bless the families, and may God continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 64th day of incarceration for two U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These agents never should have been sent to prison. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated and how the prosecutor's office proceeded in this case. To prosecute the agents, the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to a known drug smuggler. While the Mexican drug smuggler waited to testify against our agents, DEA reports confirmed that he brought a second load of marijuana, 752 pounds, into the United States. But this information was kept from the jury and the public. 
   Over the past 8 months, dozens of Members of Congress and thousands of American citizens have asked President Bush to pardon these agents. In December of 2006, the President granted pardons to 16 criminals, including 6 who were convicted of drug crimes, but he would not pardon Agents Ramos and Compean. 
   The difference, Mr. President, is that these people you pardoned were criminals, and these two Border Patrol agents are Hispanic Americans who are heroes, heroes who were doing their job to protect our borders. Mr. President, it is not too late for you to use your authority to pardon these two men. 
   Not only are there concerns about the U.S. attorney's prosecution of these two border agents, but the same prosecutor's office in western Texas has just persecuted another law enforcement officer. 
   Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez was sentenced this week to a year in jail for shooting at a vehicle that was transporting illegal aliens. Hernandez stopped the car for running a red light and asked the driver to step out of the car, but the driver pulled forward to flee and turned the car toward the deputy. The deputy fired shots at the car's tires to protect himself. 
   Hernandez was charged for violating the civil rights of one of the passengers, an illegal Mexican national who was struck in the lip by fragments of a bullet or other metal. None of the vehicle's occupants were charged. 
   Mr. Speaker, there are many questions and concerns about the prosecutor's office that need to be answered. I want to thank Chairman John Conyers for considering my request and those of other Members of Congress for a hearing on the overzealous prosecution of these law enforcement officers.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   Like others before me, I want to say to Mr. Rangel and to Mr. Levin, to Mr. McCrery and others on our side, thank you for working on this trade agreement. Absolutely I am opposed to it. I have been here for 14 years and for 14 years I have seen the American worker become less than a middle-class person and just trying to pay the bills. I don't know how with this Peru Free Trade Agreement that we can believe we are going to do a whole lot to help with the trade deficit of this nation, with the lost jobs of so many Americans. 
   The United States has lost more than 3.1 million jobs since 2001. The United States is projected to run a trade deficit of over $200 billion with China. We even have a trade deficit with Mexico. 
   Where in the world is this country going? I said yesterday to a friend of mine, ``I'm afraid we are in the last days of a great nation. When the basic Judeo-Christian values begin to crumble, the economy begins to fall apart, where is America going?'' 
   This is not the right trade bill. We could have the right trade bill, just like we should have had with CAFTA. We almost defeated CAFTA on this floor but lost it by five or six votes. Peru has less than one-tenth of the U.S. population, and more than 50 percent of all Peruvians live in poverty. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is absurd to expect Peru to become a major consumer of U.S. finished products. If we really want to do something for America, why don't we do what is necessary and say to China, stop manipulating your currency to combat the predatory practices of trading partners like China; pass legislation to eliminate the $379 billion disadvantage to U.S. producers and service providers caused by foreign VAT taxes. That is something we should be working on. Ensure the safety of foreign-made products sold to the United States from toys to food. We really need to do those kind of things before we start passing these trade agreements that some fat cat somewhere is going to make big bucks while the workers of America continue to go downhill and worry about paying their utility bills, paying for their children to go to school, paying the gasoline prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, one other point and then I am going to close. I am a conservative Republican. I have believed for so long that we could come together and we could work together for the good of the American people, that we are losing the middle class in America. And a lot of that loss is simply because of good-paying jobs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know we will not defeat this, but I pray to God that we will not forgot America's strength, and America's strength is the workers of this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (RENAMING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as of today, H.R. 346, my legislation to designate the Department of Navy as the Department of Navy and Marine Corps, has 60 cosponsors. 
   The language of this bill has already passed the full House of Representatives last month as part of the 2008 National Defense Authorization Act. This is the sixth year in a row that the House has voted to support this change. 
   As a Member of Congress, I have heard for 14 years that the Navy and Marine Corps are one fighting team. If this is true, should not the team carry the name of both the Navy and the Marine Corps? The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy, they are coequal partners. 
   I was very pleased to read a comment by the new Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, CARL LEVIN, in an article by The Hill newspaper last month, May 24, 2007, and I quote, ``When asked, LEVIN said he would 'keep an open mind' on whether to support [language in the House bill to change the name of the Navy to the Department of Navy and Marine Corps].'' 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no cost to this change. Renaming the Department is a symbolic gesture, but is very important to the team. It is the right thing to do for the team. 
   Let me quote the Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs between the years 1993 and 1998. He voiced his support for this change, and I quote, ``As a combat veteran and former Naval officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamic, and the importance of recognizing the contributions of team components. 
   ``The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that, a dynamic partnership, and it is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership.'' 
   I will also quote Admiral Stansfield Turner, United States Navy, Retired, former Director of Central Intelligence, who said, and I quote, ``I think this change in title enhances the prestige and pride of the people in the Marine Corps. And it does not necessarily take away anything from the Navy in that process.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, last year, an editorial in the Chicago Tribune on April 21 of 2006 also supported the change stating, and I quote, ``No service branch shows more respect for tradition than the United States Marine Corps does, which makes it all the more ironic that tradition denies the Corps an important show of respect: Equal billing with the other service branches.'' 
   That again, Mr. Speaker, is from the Chicago Tribune. 
   Mr. Speaker, to further state the importance of this, I have beside me an enlargement of the orders for the Silver Star for a Marine from Camp Lejeune who was killed in Iraq. It says, ``The Secretary of the Navy Washington, DC., Navy flag, the President of the United States take pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to the family.'' I will not read in its entirety. 
   But Mr. Speaker, I'd like to show you what, if the Senate will accept the House position, what this does. With the same orders for the Silver Star for this brave Marine who gave his life for this country, it says, ``The Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, Washington, DC.,'' with the zip code. It still has the Navy flag on one side and the Marine flag. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that the Senate accept the House position. This is the right thing to do for the fighting team. The team is the Navy and Marine Corps fighting team. And I hope that the Senate, and I'm very encouraged by Chairman Levin that he said, ``I'm open to the thought of this possibility.'' 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform and to please bless the United States of America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (THE GROWING U.S. NATIONAL DEBT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last night I spoke on the floor about my concern that allied countries have only paid $2.5 billion of the $15.8 billion they pledged to help rebuild Iraq. While many of Iraq's oil-rich neighbors are not making good on their promises, the United States has already spent $29 billion to help rebuild Iraq, and Congress has approved an additional $16.5 billion. 
   Unlike the United States, which is borrowing money from foreign governments to pay its bills, many of Iraq's neighbors are running record surpluses. While oil is at a record high of nearly $104 a barrel, American taxpayers are facing prices of more than $3 at the pump. Last night on the floor, I heard Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur talk about the possibility of gas going to $4 a gallon. And Congressman Todd Tiahrt spoke about the Air Force's recent decision to award a multibillion contract for a new tanker aircraft to a foreign firm. He made the point that our government is putting the United States at an economic disadvantage by awarding contracts for a French tanker built by Europeans rather than an American tanker built by an American company with American workers. 
   Mr. Speaker, all of these issues tie into my concern over America's economic future. Our national debt is growing by $1.4 billion a day and nearly $1 million by the minute. The total current debt is more than $9 trillion, which means almost $30,000 in debt for each man, woman, child, and infant in the United States. And as our debt climbs, we are borrowing money from foreign governments to pay our bills. 
   It is obvious that our current fiscal policies are not sustainable. On February 26, 2008, during a hearing of the Financial Services Committee, I had an opportunity to question a panel of top economists about when our country's current financial practices will get beyond a point of no return. Dr. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Economy.com, responded that this point of no return will come ``once we get into the next President's term.'' He continued to say that if we're not successful in addressing the economic questions currently facing our Nation, ``we've got a significant problem.'' 
   I've read a lot of history books, and most recently I read Pat Buchanan's book ``Day of Reckoning.'' I agree with his assessment that ``no world power has long survived the levels of debt and dependency America is incurring.'' 
   If America does not get its priorities straight and get a handle on its spending, we will not be able to survive as a great Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, because it is urgent that we turn our economic situation around, I hope that the Congress and the next President will take this issue seriously. Out of fairness to the American taxpayers and future generations, we can no longer delay the need to pay down our debt and work towards sounder economic policies. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and ask God to please bless their families and ask God to please continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (CONSTITUTIONAL WAR POWERS RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week I introduced H.J. Res. 53, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution. Today, every Member of Congress received a Dear Colleague letter on this resolution. I hope that all Members and their staffs will take the time to review this legislation. 
   Too many times, this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty by allowing Presidents to overstep their executive authority. Our Constitution states that, while the Commander in Chief has the power to conduct wars, only Congress has the power to authorize war. 
   As threats to international peace and security continue to evolve, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad. 
   In 1793, James Madison said: ``The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature. The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.'' And that was James Madison, 1793. 
   The Framers of our Constitution sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches. Because this balance has been too often ignored throughout American history, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution seeks to establish a clear national policy for today's post-9/11 world. 
   The War Powers Resolution of 1973 aimed to clarify the intent of the constitutional Framers and to ensure that Congress and the President share in the decisionmaking process in the event of armed conflict. Yet, since the enactment of the resolution, time and again Presidents have maintained that the resolution's consultation reporting and congressional authorization requirements are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority. 
   By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures that the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional authority. 
   It also provides a more robust reporting requirement that would enable Congress to be more informed and have greater oversight. This resolution is the result of the dedicated work of the Constitutional Project and its War Powers Initiative. And it protects and preserves the checks and balances the Framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope many of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this legislation. It is time for Congress to meet its constitutional duty, and it is long overdue. 
   And with that, Mr. Speaker, before I yield back my time, I want to ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and to bless their families, and for God to continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (FORMER U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is the 55th day of an injustice. This injustice began on January 17 of 2007 when two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. 
   Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These two agents were doing their job to protect the American people. They never should have been sent to prison. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated and about how the prosecutors proceeded in this case. 
   To prosecute the agents, the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to a known drug smuggler. Homeland Security officials promised Members of Congress certain information about this case, but they could not provide the information. Reports have also indicated that the prosecutors may have withheld crucial evidence from the defense. The Drug Enforcement Agency reports revealed that the Mexican drug smuggler brought a second load of marijuana, 752 pounds, into the United States. But this information was kept from the jury and the public. 
   Madam Speaker, over the past 6 months, dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to listen to the American people and pardon these agents. 
   I want the two agents and their families to know that we have not forgotten them and we will not forget them. Members of Congress will come to the floor to defend these agents, and we will continue to do so until they are pardoned. 
   On February 7, 2007, Senator DIANE FEINSTEIN wrote Judiciary Chairman PATRICK LEAHY to request a committee investigation of this case. She wrote, and I quote the Senator: 
   ``I strongly believe that the sentences in this case are too extreme given the criminal nature of the smuggler and his possession of large quantities of drugs and given the fact that he physically resisted at least one attempt by Agents Ramos and Compean to bring him into custody. 
   ``In addition, to my knowledge, neither of the agents had prior convictions or any other aggravating circumstances to warrant particularly harsh treatment under the law. Yet these men were given sentences that some individuals who are convicted of murder would not receive.'' 
   Madam Speaker, this is not a Republican or a Democratic issue, but it is an issue of fairness and justice. Chairman Leahy has already approved Senate hearings in this case. On February 23, 2007, I sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers asking for hearings on this case on the House side. I hope Congress will soon hold these hearings because it is time for justice to prevail over an injustice. 
   Madam Speaker, before closing, I want to say to the White House and to the President, please listen to the American people. Please assure the American people that two agents who have done their best to help protect America will not be forgotten in prison, because they have no business being in prison. They should receive justice, not injustice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Democratic side and the Republican side and my dear friend, Mr. Butterfield, for bringing this resolution to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join my friend, Congressman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina, and many of my colleagues to support H. Res. 329, a resolution to congratulate the Barton College men's basketball team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division II men's basketball national championship. 
   Years ago, I attended Atlantic Christian College, which changed its name to Barton College in 1990. Mr. Speaker, I, like many of my colleagues in Congress, have had the fortunate opportunity of playing on a championship team. More than 40 years later, I can still vividly recall in my mind the wonderful memory of the night my prep school basketball team at Hargrave Military Academy won the military league championship. No matter what level, winning a championship is something an individual will remember all of his or her life. My prep school basketball team claimed its championship with a final score of 81-79, so I know the firsthand experience of a close game. 
   How exciting it was to see Barton College basketball make a miraculous comeback from seven points behind in the final 40 seconds to defeat Winona State University of Rochester, Minnesota, an undefeated team and last year's Division II champion, by a score of 77-75. Senior All-American point guard Anthony Atkinson scored the Bulldogs' final 10 points, including a layup at the buzzer; but I am sure that Anthony Atkinson would tell you that the win was a team effort. 
   In David and Goliath fashion, Barton College, a school with just 1,000 students, defeated teams during the Elite Eight from schools with much larger student bodies, Grand Valley State, Michigan, 23,000 students; Cal State San Bernardino, 17,000 students; and Winona State University, 8,000 students, to claim the school's first NCAA championship in any sport. Again, a student body of 1,000. 
   The team's confidence and calm under pressure helped it play and win nine overtime games during the 2006/2007 season to finish the season 31-5 and break a school record by winning its last 21 games. 
   Barton College is located in Congressman Butterfield's district, yet I share part of the county with Congressman Butterfield. I join him in congratulating the coaches and all the members of the 2006/2007 Barton College men's basketball team.

Res. 1183, a resolution calling for the House to observe a moment of silence on the first legislative day of each month for those killed or wounded, as well as their families, in the United States' engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   I am very grateful that the Speaker of the House has written me to indicate her support for this proposal and has agreed that it is important for the House of Representatives to honor America's fallen heroes. It is my understanding that the Speaker will initiate this moment of silence during the first series of votes tomorrow. 
   I am pleased that this month will mark the beginning of the House's ongoing observation of a moment of silence for those killed or wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan. I thank Speaker Pelosi for making this right and fitting tribute a part of the regular order of the House. 
   This moment of silence will serve as a solemn reminder of the more than 4,000 killed and more than 30,000 wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan and a thank you from a grateful Nation. For their courage and selfless commitment to duty, these servicemembers, and their families, deserve our unending support. 
   Again, I want to thank Speaker Pelosi, and Catlin O'Neill on her staff, for working with me to make this remembrance a reality for the families of those who have sacrificed for our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 119th day since a great injustice took place in this country. 
   On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12-year sentences respectively. I am hopeful that this will be the month that House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS and Senate Judiciary Chairman PATRICK LEAHY will hold a hearing to investigate the injustice perpetrated against these two U.S. Border Patrol agents. 
   Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 734 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been persecuted. Yet the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to the drug smuggler and prosecuted the agents who were doing their job to protect our borders. 
   The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico and has sued the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. Many Members of this House, including Congressman TED POE, who is a former judge from Texas, have voiced concerns about the unfair prosecution of these agents. 
   With the troubling revelations surrounding the leadership of the U.S. Justice Department, I believe it is necessary to investigate the U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas and the prosecutor's actions in this case. Never in America should the Congress sit by and allow a breakdown of honesty and integrity in our Nation's judicial system. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the American people cannot have faith in our Federal courts, I am afraid the future of our democracy is in danger. For the sake of these agents and their families and the integrity of our judicial system, I am pleased and grateful that Mr. Conyers and Senator Leahy will be holding hearings to investigate the injustice perpetrated against these two agents.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is the 69th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12 year sentences, respectively. 
   Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted. The U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. 
   Madam Speaker, he is not an American citizen. He is a criminal. 
   Madam Speaker, it is ironic that one of the Federal prosecutors dismissed by the Justice Department, who never should have been terminated, was criticized for not doing more to try cases of illegal immigration. Yet we have a Federal prosecutor in western Texas, Johnny Sutton, who, instead of prosecuting an illegal alien, who was also a known drug smuggler, decided to give immunity to the illegal alien drug smuggler and prosecuted the two Hispanic-American border agents who tried to apprehend the smuggler. 
   Madam Speaker, this makes absolutely no sense. Johnny Sutton also prosecuted another law enforcement agent, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez. Hernandez was recently sentenced to a year in jail for shooting the tires of a car transporting illegal aliens after the driver attempted to escape a routine traffic stop by aiming the vehicle at the deputy. Hernandez was charged with violating the civil rights of one of the passengers, an illegal Mexican national, who was struck in the lip by bullet or metal fragments. 
   Citizens across this country and many of us in Congress want to know why does the U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting the illegal aliens who commit crimes? 
   The President has the power to immediately reverse this injustice by granting a pardon to these two men, who were doing their jobs to protect the American people. But, so far, the President has refused to stand up for justice in this case. 
   Madam Speaker, I hope the White House will agree with many of us in Congress who believe Mr. Sutton's actions in prosecuting these agents raises serious questions and need to be investigated. 
   I thank House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS and his staff for their interest in this situation involving the two border agents, who should have been commended instead of indicted. I am hopeful that the House, under the leadership of JOHN CONYERS, will soon hold hearings to look into this injustice.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the pages are helping me put up the portrait of an injustice. The picture shows two U.S. Border Agents on January 17, 2007, turning themselves in to United States marshals to begin serving 11 and 12 years respectively in Federal prison. 
   U.S. Border Agents Ramos, who is at the bottom of this portrait, and Compean, at the top, were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. These men never should have been prosecuted, yet they are now handcuffed in Federal prison. 
   Mr. Speaker, after months of silence, the President said in a television interview last week that he would take a sober look at the case and a tough look at the facts to see whether the agents should be pardoned. For the agents' sake, I am hopeful that the President will look into this case as soon as possible. The facts will tell the President what countless citizens and Members of Congress already know, that the U.S. Attorney's Office was on the wrong side in this case. 
   The agents fired shots during a foot chase with the smuggler who had fled in a van they were pursuing. The van contained approximately $1 million worth of marijuana. 
   Compelling physical evidence, the angle of the bullet that struck the drug smuggler, makes it clear that the smuggler was pointing something at the agents as he ran away, and the agents fired in self-defense. Yet the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents almost exclusively on the testimony of an admitted drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of an important effort to honor our Nation's Vietnam veterans. 
   The Onslow County Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation in Jacksonville, North Carolina, is a nonprofit organization that was established by veterans and supporters in 1998. It was created to raise funds for the construction of a memorial to honor the brave men and women from all branches of the Armed Forces who served their country in Vietnam. 
   More than 9 million veterans of the Armed Forces served on active duty from August 5, 1964 to May 7, 1975. Of the 3 million men and women who served in the Vietnam theater, 300,000 were wounded and more than 58,000 were killed. The Veterans Administration estimates that nearly 200 of the surviving Vietnam veterans die each and every day. 
   Today, nearly 10 years after its formation, the goal of the Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation is on the verge of becoming a reality. On the grounds of Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune, land has been acquired adjacent to the Beirut memorial, and the first phase of construction is expected to begin later this year. 
   The design of the memorial consists of a gazebo over a reflecting pool and fountain encircled by a glass wall inscribed with the names of all those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our Nation. Hidden within a dark gray granite base, lights will gently illuminate the engraved names on the curved glass memorial. 
   Once completed, the memorial will enhance the Beirut memorial and any further memorials built within the Lejeune Memorial Garden. By creating an environment where relatives and the general public can come to remember and reflect on the men and women who gave their lives in Vietnam, this memorial will attract thousands of visitors to Onslow County each year. 
   The Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation has raised and collected about $1.2 million toward the $5 million estimated cost of the memorial. In support of this worthy project, Mr. Kenji Horn and others who believe in this memorial have organized a fund-raising motorcycle run in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on Saturday, September 22 of this year. It is open to everyone, and all types of motorcycles are welcome. Registrations have come in from Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, and other States around the country; and more than 1,500 motorcycles are expected to participate. 
   Mr. Speaker, in today's world, we all are aware of the debt of this Nation, and we understand the reality that most worthwhile projects must be funded by the private sector. So it is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that people from around this Nation will be interested in learning more about the Onslow Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation. Our Vietnam veterans have earned this honor. 
   And I close, Mr. Speaker, by saying, please God, continue to bless our men and women in uniform, and please, God, continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a public servant who has given a great deal not only to the State of North Carolina but to the country as a whole. 
   Since 1972, Mr. John Montgomery has served the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of our Nation's veterans. Later this month, he will retire from his position as director of the VA regional office in Winston-Salem in North Carolina. 
   Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1944, Mr. Montgomery is an Army veteran who served in an artillery unit in Vietnam from January 1969 to April of 1970. He earned a bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1967 and a law degree from Boston University in 1972. Mr. Montgomery began his VA career in Hartford, Connecticut regional office as a claims examiner in 1972. In 1975, he transferred to the VA central office in Washington, D.C. as a legal consultant, and 2 years later, he was  selected as the adjudication officer at the VA Medical and Regional Office Center in Togus, Maine. Mr. Montgomery was named director of the Providence, Rhode Island VA Regional Office in 1980. 
   In February of 1995, he traveled to North Carolina to begin work in his current position as director of the VA Regional Office in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. In this position, he has been responsible for administering federal benefits to 790,000 veterans and their families living in North Carolina. These services total more than $1.2 billion in annual benefit payments. 
   The Winston-Salem Regional Office provides benefits and services in all program areas to veterans, servicemembers, and reservists residing in North Carolina. These programs include compensation, pension, loan guarantee, and vocational rehabilitation. 
   From 1995 to 2007, Mr. Montgomery oversaw the growth of the Winston-Salem Office from 240 employees to 530 employees. During this period, the office grew to the second largest disability office in the United States. 
   In 2005, he was successful in having Winston-Salem selected as one of only two national benefits delivery at discharge sites at regional offices. This achievement created an additional 55 professional full-time positions and helped to ensure that the regional office would be a key player in the VA for many years to come. 
   As director, Mr. Montgomery has supported the veteran community in hiring practices as well as in claims disability work. Of the 516 employees hired at the regional offices in the last 10 years, 260 were veterans, and of that number, 127 were disabled veterans. 
   Each year, I visit the Winston-Salem Regional Office to learn about the work being done there and, more importantly, to personally thank the VA employees for all they do on behalf of our Nation's veterans. It was during one of these visits that I was struck by a letter I saw hanging on the wall of Mr. Montgomery's office. His family had received a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt after losing a loved one in World War II. And I quote President Roosevelt's letter. 
   ``He stands in the unbroken line of patriots who have dared to die that freedom might live and grow, and increase its blessings. Freedom lives, and through it, he lives, in a way that humbles the undertakings of most men.'' 
   I am so grateful that my friendship with Mr. Montgomery led me to this wonderful quote, which I have since shared in my own letters to families who have lost a loved one in Afghanistan or Iraq. 
   During my visits, Mr. Montgomery has generously acted as my guide and has introduced me to employees and visiting veterans. I have witnessed firsthand all of the great work being done by Mr. Montgomery and his staff to take care of our Nation's veterans. They have excelled in their efforts to reduce the number of pending claims while still maintaining the accuracy of their case audits. 
   In closing, Madam Speaker, I wish to congratulate Mr. Montgomery on his retirement and his long and successful career of service with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Through his work on behalf of our Nation's veterans, he has earned the respect of so many people, and I know he will be missed. 
   John Montgomery, thank you for a job well done. I wish you all the best for a long and happy retirement. May God bless you and your family in the years ahead, and may God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (STATEMENT ON LIBBY COMMUTATION AND PARDON FOR FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, many Americans are outraged by the President's decision to commute the sentence of White House aide Scooter Libby, while at the same time, he refuses to pardon former Border Agents Ramos and Compean. 
   Scooter Libby, an attorney who understands the laws of this country and should know right from wrong, was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice, and lying to investigators. Mr. Libby, who should have served his sentence, did not spend 1 day in prison. Yet, two Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who tried their best to do their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison today. 
   Today is the agents' 176th day in Federal prison. Two heroes sit behind bars while a guilty man walks free. Again, I say, where is the justice? By attempting to apprehend a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking them. For almost a year, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these agents. The President repeatedly responds that there is a pardon ``process'' and ``a series of steps'' to be taken by the Justice Department, ``to make a recommendation as to whether or not a President grants a pardon.'' Yet, Mr. Speaker, the President did not consult the Justice Department in Mr. Libby's case. 
   Mr. President, if there is a process, why did this process not matter when you commuted Mr. Libby's sentence? 
   The President has the power to immediately pardon agents Ramos and Compean, two heroes who were unjustly prosecuted for doing their job to protect our border. I have written the President and called on him to correct a true injustice by using his executive authority to immediately pardon these men.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (A SAD DAY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day in the history of America. Two law enforcement officers who have given years of their life in service to this Nation have entered Federal prison today for shooting a drug smuggler. 
   This is a black mark for the President and his administration. U.S. Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean were found guilty in a Federal court last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. 
   Many of us in Congress have written letters asking the President to consider pardoning these agents, a request that is justified by serious questions about the prosecution of this case, including both the indictment and the process. These agents never should have been prosecuted for their actions last year, yet they have been sentenced to 11 years and 12 years in Federal prison respectively. 
   These agents do not deserve to spend one day in prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were simply doing their jobs to protect the American people. The extraordinary details surrounding the prosecution of this case assure that justice was not served. These agents should have been commended for their actions. Instead, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted full immunity to the drug smuggler for his testimony against our agents. 
   The drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is now  suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. He is not an American citizen. He is a criminal. 
   Although it is clear that the agents fired shots in self-defense, Ramos and Compean were convicted mainly on the testimony of a habitual drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. Despite my repeated requests for an investigation of this case and a request by more than 50 Members of Congress for the President to pardon these agents, this administration has ignored the concerns of countless citizens who have cried out against this injustice. 
   Mr. Speaker, the indifference of this White House will long be remembered by the American people and by those of us in Congress who tried to come to the aid of these two heroes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 49th day since two U.S. Border Patrol Agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our borders into Texas. 
   These agents never should have been sent to prison. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated and how the prosecutor's office proceeded in this case. 
   To prosecute the agents, the U.S. Attorney's Office granted immunity to the known drug smuggler. Homeland Security officials promised Members of Congress information about this case, then they could not provide the information. Recently, reports indicated that the prosecutors in this case may have withheld crucial evidence from the defense. Mr. Speaker, I am going to repeat that. Recently, reports indicated that the prosecutors in this case may have withheld crucial evidence from the defense. 
   Drug Enforcement Agency reports have revealed that the Mexican drug smuggler brought a second load of marijuana, 752 pounds, into the United States. In fact, Mr. Speaker, this drug smuggler is not an American citizen, and he is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million. But, Mr. Speaker, the information I just mentioned, this information was kept from the jury and the public. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have sent a letter to House Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS asking for hearings on this case and, Mr. Speaker, other Members have made the same request of the chairman. And knowing the chairman to be a fair-minded person, I hope that he will hold hearings on this prosecutor in west Texas and how he looked into this case and brought this case to the jury, because, again, these Border Agents are heroes. They are not convicts; they are heroes. 
   Over the past 6 months, dozens of Members of Congress have asked the President to pardon these agents. I myself have sent five letters to the President asking that he pardon these two agents. They are heroes of this country. They should not be in Federal prison. 
   Mr. President, we are calling on you to listen to the American people and to the thousands of citizens who have petitioned you to pardon these men. It is time for justice to prevail over an injustice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this amendment to defund the National Security Personnel System, NSPS. 
   The Comptroller General of the United States, David Walker, and the staff at the Government Accounting Office, GAO has analyzed the development of NSPS. In published reports and testimony before Congress, Mr. Walker has criticized the manner in which the Department of Defense, DOD, has failed to effectively manage the design and implementation of NSPS. 
   On July 16, 2007 GAO released a report supporting Defense unions' contention that DOD has been underestimating the cost of implementing NSPS. According to the report, GAO found that DOD's November 2005 estimate that it will cost $158 million to implement NSPS ``does not include the full cost that the department expects to incur as a result of implementing the new system.'' 
   The report also concluded that the total amount of funds the department spent on NSPS during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 cannot be determined because DOD has not established an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that all these costs are fully captured. Because of this extreme mismanagement, we will never know how much DOD spent trying to implement NSPS, although the total amount likely runs into the billions of dollars. 
   For this, and many other reasons, Congress should not provide funding for the implementation of this misguided endeavor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Murphy for his service to this Nation and for introducing H. Con. Res. 162. 
   Throughout the history of this great Nation, men and women have chosen to put on the uniform and defend the principles upon which this country was built. The dedication of our men and women to our Nation should never be overlooked, and we, as a Congress, should encourage the next generation of Americans to do the same.     
   However, there exists an inequity in pay between those who serve in our Armed Forces and those in the civilian sector. 
   For several years, the civilian pay increase rate has remained 4 percent, which Congressman Murphy mentioned, above that of the military. It is time to end this inequity. H. Con. Res. 162 will help bring this inequity to a close by calling on Congress to voice their support for our servicemembers. 
   This Nation relies on our military to defend its citizens against enemies both foreign and domestic, and have done so with honor and integrity; but they do not fight these battles alone. Our military families provide them much-needed support in these difficult times. As was said earlier, nearly 40 percent of the members of the Armed Forces who are deployed leave their families and children behind them. There are more than 3 million family members and dependents of those serving on active duty and in the Reserve. 
   For far too long, Congress has not made this a top priority. That is why I join with my colleague, Representative Patrick Murphy, and all of those in both parties who want this to be a number one issue for those in uniform and their families. Matching the increase is not sufficient. We must close the gap. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, first, I would like to thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery for including H.R. 418 into the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2007. For several years I have tried to get this measure to the House floor. So thank you, Mr. Neal, Mr. McDermott, and Mr. English. 
   H.R. 418 is a bill that would permit military families who receive the death gratuity to invest the full amount into certain tax-favored accounts. As you may know, a death gratuity is a $100,000 payment paid to survivors of servicemembers whose death resulted from combat-related circumstances. Current tax law limits the amount that recipients of the death gratuity can place in tax-preferred accounts, such as a Roth IRA or a Coverdell Educational Savings Account. This legislation would change that to allow recipients to contribute up to the full amount of the gratuity payment to any of those two accounts. 
   As the families of our fallen heroes try to put their lives back together, they need help. The death of a loved one is difficult enough, without having to worry about saving the death gratuity to pay for retirement, college or other expenses and then have the government come in and tax the interest on that savings. 
   Madam Speaker, the need for this assistance was brought to my attention by Captain Michael Ceres, a constituent stationed at Marine Corps Air Station New River. Captain Ceres, who just returned from serving in Iraq and will soon be redeployed, contacted my office and suggested that Congress institute this change to ease the burden on grieving military families. We owe it to our fallen military heroes to expand the options to the families who receive the death gratuity, families who have paid the ultimate cost with the loss of their loved one. 
   Today, I call on all my colleagues in the House to support this major piece of legislation, known as the Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2007. With that, I want to thank the leadership on the Democratic side, the leadership on the Republican side for this comprehensive bill to help our military and their families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, on December 21, 2007, I had the privilege and honor to visit Marine Corps Base Albany, Georgia to witness firsthand the compassion of the United States Marine Corps. 
   I am extremely grateful to the United States Air Force for making it possible for me to take part in a visit that was so special, I can hardly describe it in words. On that day, the Jerome Lee family of Quitman, Mississippi, was able to adopt their son's canine partner, Lex, who was released from his duty as a military working dog. 
   Jerome and Rachel Lee's son, Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee, was a United States Marine Corps dog handler who was killed in action on March 21, 2007, in Fallujah, Iraq. Corporal Lee and his canine partner Lex, a 7-year-old German shepherd, were a highly trained explosive detection team. Lex, who was due for retirement after his combat tour in Iraq, suffered shrapnel wounds from the same enemy-fired rocket-propelled grenade that took Corporal Lee's life. 
   Following Corporal Lee's death, the Lee family began seeking to adopt their son's canine companion who was with their son during his last moments on Earth. However, after filing the necessary paperwork, the Lee family was told that Lex had been medically evaluated and, although injured, he was fit for duty and not yet eligible for adoption. 
   After learning their story, I spoke with Corporal Lee's father, Jerome Lee, by phone on several occasions. Mr. Lee continued to express the joy and comfort that caring for Lex would bring to him and his family, and he requested my assistance in securing their adoption of Lex. 
   I am so grateful to the United States Marine Corps and Commandant James  Conway for helping me ensure that the Lee family's request was granted. I am also very grateful to Brigadier General Michael Regner and Major General Robert Dickerson for their role in enabling this adoption to proceed. I know that Dustin is in heaven, and happy that his family now has Lex. Allowing the Lee family to adopt Lex was a fitting thank you to parents who gave the ultimate gift of their son for this country. 
   The United States Marine Corps has demonstrated its tremendous compassion and understanding by making this adoption a reality for the parents of one of our Nation's fallen heroes. Again I extend my deep condolences to Mr. and Mrs. Lee, as well as all those in this country who have lost a loved one fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   Although Lex will never replace their son, welcoming Lex into the Lee family and home will keep a big part of Corporal Lee's life alive for their family. Lex loved and protected Corporal Lee on the battlefield, and Corporal Lee's family is now able to love and protect Lex in the peaceful surroundings of their home in Mississippi. 
   May God bless the United States Marine Corps and all of our men and women in uniform, and may God continue to bless America.

   One other quick point. An Army study found that the more often soldiers are deployed, the longer they are deployed each time. And the less time they spend at home, the more likely they are to suffer mental health problems, such as combat trauma, anxiety, and depression. 
   I close by saying again, deployed, depleted, desperate. We have got to pass this legislation. God bless our men and women in uniform. As Barry McCaffrey said in the spring of this year, the Army and the Marine Corps are going to unravel if we don't help them.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (IN DEFENSE OF LUNCHTIME PRAYER AT THE U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, America was built on Judeo-Christian values. No one who knows the history of our nation can deny that freedom of religion played a critical part in its development. Yet there are those in our society who wish to threaten America's long history of religious freedom by limiting public expressions of religion by people of faith. 
   In 2001, the Virginia Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Virginia Military Institute on behalf of two former cadets who opposed the school's nondenominational pre-supper prayer. In 2003, a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals decided in favor of the ACLU and stripped VMI of its right to prayer, a tradition dating back to the school's founding in 1839. After the ACLU eliminated prayer at this State-supported school, the group expressed interest in locating Naval Academy graduates to file a suit similar against lunchtime prayer at Annapolis. 
   In response to this threat, I introduced the Military Academy First Amendment Protection Act, legislation to protect the ability of our military service academies to include the offering of a voluntary, nondenominational prayer as an element of their activities. 
   With the support of other Members of Congress, this legislation was included as a provision of the fiscal year 2006 National Defense Authorization Act which was signed by the President and became law on January 6, 2006. I am so grateful to my colleagues in both parties who stood with me and acted to protect prayer at the United States Military, Naval, and Air Force Academies. 
   Since their founding, America's military academies have instilled in our military leaders the principles of our Founding Fathers and the traditions of our great military services. However, today, the American Civil Liberties Union has threatened to sue Annapolis over its tradition of lunchtime prayer. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an example of why America is in trouble. Prayer or devotional thought has taken place at meals for midshipmen since the Naval Academy was founded in 1845. These prayers are nondenominational and have been rotated among chaplains of different faiths, from the Catholic to the Protestant to the Rabbi. Those who choose to attend the United States Naval Academy know what the rules are from day one. 
   Legal threats by the ACLU are not made in the spirit of religious tolerance but in a spirit of intolerance of any expression of faith at all. 
   Congress has a legitimate role to play in ensuring that the first amendment rights of American citizens are protected. By passing legislation to ensure our service academies' right to offer a voluntary, nondenominational prayer at an otherwise authorized activity of the academy, Congress codifies its belief that decisions respecting prayer should remain in the hands of each service academy's superintendent.     
   I am pleased that the law protects the right of the superintendent of the Naval Academy to continue the long tradition of lunchtime prayer at Annapolis. 
   As mission-crucial institutions, it should be the military authorities, and not civilian courts, that decide what practices are essential to fostering leadership and accomplishing the unique military mission. 
   I am hopeful that my colleagues in Congress will continue to stand with me to ensure the protection of our future military heroes and their first amendment rights. 
   And I must say, Mr. Speaker, in closing, to those nine members of the  Naval Academy who joined the ACLU to sue Annapolis, all I can say is shame on you because America will not survive unless it protects the Judeo-Christian values of this great Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, this Thursday, March 13, 2008, the International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on ``War Powers for the 21st Century: The Congressional Perspective.'' I would like to thank Chairman Bill Delahunt and Ranking Member Dana Rohrabacher for scheduling this hearing. It is my understanding that Chairman Delahunt and Ranking Member Rohrabacher also plan to hold two additional war powers hearings during the month of April. 
   I am extremely grateful for their interest in this very important issue. Along with former Congressmen David Skaggs and Mickey Edwards, who are cochairmen of the Constitutional Projects War Powers Initiative, this Thursday I will testify on the legislation I introduced in October of 2007, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, H.J. Res. 53. 
   Too many times this Congress has abdicated its constitutional duty by allowing Presidents to overstep their executive authority. Our Constitution states that while the Commander-in-Chief has the power to conduct wars, only Congress has the power to authorize war. 
   It is for this reason that in 1999 I joined 16 of my colleagues in Congress to file a suit against President Clinton for unconstitutionally conducting offensive military attacks against Yugoslavia without obtaining a declaration of war or other explicit authorizations from Congress.  
   Now, as threats to international peace and security continue to evolve, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, H.J. Res. 53, rededicates Congress to its primary constitutional role of deciding when to use force abroad. 
   In 1793, James Madison said, `` ..... The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature ..... the executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.'' 
   The Framers of our Constitution sought to decentralize the war powers of the United States and construct a balance between the political branches.     
   The War Powers Resolution of 1973 aimed to clarify the intent of the constitutional Framers and to ensure that Congress and the President share in the decision-making process in the event of armed conflict. Yet, since the enactment of the resolution, time and again Presidents have maintained that the resolution's consultation, reporting, and congressional authorization requirements are unconstitutional obstacles to executive authority. 
   By more fully clarifying the war powers of the President and the Congress, the legislation I've introduced, H.J. Res. 53, the Constitutional War Powers Resolution, improves upon the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in a number of ways. It clearly spells out the powers that the Congress and the President must exercise collectively, as well as the defensive measures the Commander in Chief may exercise without congressional approval. It also provides a more robust reporting requirement that would enable Congress to be more informed and to have greater oversight. And it protects and preserves the checks and balances the Framers intended in the decision to bring our Nation into war. 
   Madam Speaker, I look forward to congressional hearings on this critical issue. The time for Congress to meet its constitutional duty is long overdue. 
   And with that, Madam Speaker, I would like to ask God to continue to bless our men and women in Afghanistan and Iraq, and to ask God to continue to bless the families of our men and women in uniform.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, first, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, if this bill was about Congress or the Federal Government setting salary levels for top executives, then I would be opposed to it. But that is not what this bill does. This is about letting stockholders, the owners of publicly traded companies, have the right, if they want, to render a judgment about whether the compensation for top executives, their employees, is appropriate. 
   I know that this bill is not perfect, but neither is the present system. Corporate directors and executives work for shareholders. I do not see how anyone can look at the present system where sometimes CEOs who have failed their shareholders are getting hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder money, and then say with a straight face that it is bad for shareholders to be able to directly tell corporate directors what they think about these compensation packages. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me remind the House of a few of the outlandish compensation packages that have been made public: Home Depot CEO Robert Nardelli, total compensation for 2006, $131 million; Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, total compensation 2006, $91 million; AT&T CEO Edward Whitacre, Jr., total compensation for 2006, $69 million; Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally earned $39.1 million for 4 months in 2006, $39.1 million for 4 months of work in 2006. 
   Mr. Chairman, numerous people in the Third District of North Carolina, which I have the pleasure and the privilege to serve, have spoken to me and expressed their concerns about these multimillion-dollar packages. Mr. Chairman, many people have said that America is losing its middle class, but in modern America, more and more middle-class families are becoming stockholders. In 1989, just 30 percent of American households owned stock. Today 52 percent of households own stock; 80 million Americans now own shares of directly held stock, mutual funds or 401(k) retirement plans.     
   The right to have an advisory vote would strengthen shareholders and strengthen the capitalistic system. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I support this bill. 
   And, again, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for the time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is day 453 of a terrible injustice in America. Two U.S. border agents, Agents Compean and Ramos, have been languishing in Federal prison since January 17 of 2007.  These men did their job to protect our Nation from an illegal alien, a Mexican drug smuggler who brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our border into Texas. Yet through a questionable prosecution, these two men were convicted for defending themselves and defending our border. 
   It is a sad day that such a travesty of justice could happen to two Hispanic Americans who loved America so much that they were willing to become law enforcement officers, and in this case Border Patrol agents, in order to protect America. Despite the efforts of the American people and Members of Congress, who have brought this to the attention of the White House, nothing, and I say nothing, has been done to reverse this injustice. 
   While outside groups and Members of Congress have filed court briefs to support these agents, we still anxiously await a decision in their appeal. The more time these men spend in prison and the longer it takes for a decision on their appeal, the more frustrated the American people become. 
   The American people have not forgotten agents Ramos and Compean. From time to time, I still hear from constituents who are frustrated that these men are still in prison. The only glimmer of hope for these agents and their families rests with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans. During an oral argument on December 3, 2007, one of the judges considering the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly said, and I quote, Madam Speaker, and this is his quote, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand.'' That is a Federal judge that made that comment. 
   A ruling on their appeal is now expected any day, and millions of Americans are hopeful that the Court of Appeals will reverse this terrible injustice. 
   Madam Speaker, I still call on Chairman John Conyers to hold a hearing to review this unjust prosecution some time before the end of the year. Chairman Conyers is a fair-minded person for whom I have great respect. Justice is crying out for his help. 
   And Madam Speaker, before I close, I want the Ramos and Compean family to know that there are those in both parties in this House of Representatives that are not going to sit back and wait until this injustice is corrected because these two border agents deserve nothing but praise for what they have done for this great Nation.

   I want to start my comments by sharing with the House that I met with a real marine general hero that very few people on the floor know his name; his name is General Gregory Newbold. And I want to quote him from Time magazine, April 9, 2006, ``Why Iraq Was a Mistake.'' I will be brief. 
   Two senior military officers are known to have challenged Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the planning of the Iraq war. Army General Eric Shinseki publicly dissented and found himself marginalized. Marine Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, the Pentagon's top operations officer, voiced his objections internally and then retired, in part out of opposition to the war. Here, for the first time, General Newbold goes public with a full-throated critique. I want to quote this to the House from General Newbold. 
   ``I was a witness and therefore a party to the action that led us to the invasion of Iraq, an unnecessary war. Inside the military family, I made no secret of my view that these zealots' rationale for war made no sense, and I think I was outspoken enough to make those senior to me uncomfortable. But I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat, al Qaeda.'' 
   I mention that, Mr. Speaker, because today this is an important debate. And, yes, my friends on the other side I respect and have great love and affection. But I remember in 1999, when we were on the floor as the majority party criticizing President Clinton for going into Bosnia, that was a nonbinding resolution. 
   That is what the Congress is about: debate, disagreements, agreement, debate. That is our constitutional responsibility. 
   Let me tell you what Karen Hughes, who was speaking for then-Governor Bush, who is now President Bush, said about the nonbinding resolution. This was in The Washington Post, March 27, 1999. I quote Mrs. Hughes speaking for Governor Bush at the time, criticizing President Clinton, and this is a quote. ``If we are going to commit American troops, we must be certain that they have a clear mission, an achievable goal, and an exit strategy.'' 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina, my colleague and friend (Mr. Coble).

   Mr. Speaker, this resolution is, first of all, to thank our men and women in uniform. They are absolutely magnificent.

We appreciate you. We will be with you today, tomorrow, and in the future.     
   The second part is that we are opposed to the surge. Let me read very quickly, before I introduce the next speaker, General Barry McCaffrey before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 18, 2007, and I quote General Barry McCaffrey, former commander of the Southern Command. He said, ``There the current administration is going to try to muscle this thing out in the next 24 months with an urban counterinsurgency plan that I personally believe, with all due respect, is a fool's errand.''

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, first I would like to thank Chairman Skelton and Chairman Lantos for allowing me to be part of this resolution, H. Con. Res. 63. 
   Also I want to thank the 10 Republicans who came to the floor to join me today to support this resolution. In closing, I want to again say this resolution is simple and to the point. The most important point is to say, Thank you, men and women in uniform; you are great, you are magnificent, we are behind you 100 percent. 
   The second part deals with the surge. Two very quick stories. Six months ago Gene Taylor and I went to Walter Reed. We went into a room that we were carried into and saw a mother with tears in her eyes, a father, and we shook their hands. 
   Then the Army colonel took us to the bed to speak to the Army sergeant who had been wounded in Iraq. We thanked him. We told him he was a hero. And he was just great. His fiancee was sitting at the end, at the foot of the bed. We met her. Then he said, I don't know if my opinion matters to you gentlemen. And we assured him it did matter. It mattered greatly. 
   He said, well, let me share this with you. I have been to Iraq three times. He said, I don't care if you are there 5 years or 10 years, you cannot change the people. If you look at the history, he is probably right. But then after he said that you cannot change the people, Mr. Speaker, he pulled the sheets down from his waist and we saw that above his knees his two legs were gone. In his third tour in Iraq he lost his legs. 
   I close by sharing this in this debate. I quoted five generals that have said in the last 6 months this surge will not work, it is not the right policy answer. I don't think anyone can say it any better than retired Army General Jay Garner, the first U.S. official in charge of postwar Baghdad. January 7, 2007. This is his quote. ``I don't know that the Iraqi Government has ever demonstrated an ability to lead the country, and we should not be surprised. You will never find in my lifetime one man that all of the Iraqis would coalesce around. Iraqis are too divided among sectarian, ethnic and tribal loyalties'' he said, ``and their loyalties are regional, not national.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, as I close, and this is my close, let's pass this resolution. Let's work with the President to find an end point to the strategy, and let's not put our men and women in the middle of a civil war to make them referees. 
   God bless America, and God bless our men and women in uniform. Please, God, continue to bless this country.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sadness to note the recent passing of a dear friend and colleague, CHARLIE NORWOOD. I want to extend to his wife Gloria and her sons, and their family, my deepest sympathy for their loss. 
   I know how much CHARLIE loved his wife Gloria and his family.? 
   I join my colleagues today on the floor of the House to honor his service in the House of Representatives, and to honor his memory. 
   CHARLIE and I came to Washington with the class of 1994. We were elected to Congress in the same year and we came with the class that was going to change the way Washington operates. 
   In the seven terms that I have served with CHARLIE, I gained a lasting friendship and respect for CHARLIE.  
   CHARLIE certainly made an impact on the House of Representatives. He always fought for the causes for which he believed, and many times we were on the same side. 
   In the last year of his service, as he was battling illness, he always had a smile for me when I would speak to him. And I know that he had a smile for anyone that came to say hello. 
   As a man of faith, I know that CHARLIE is in heaven. But for those of us who had the privilege to know him, we will miss him until we meet again. 
   He was an outstanding Congressman, and he will be missed.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution that calls upon all people in the United States to conduct appropriate ceremonies, activities and programs to demonstrate support, thanks and appreciation for the estimated 1.5 million very special members of the Armed Forces, past and present, who have been awarded the Purple Heart. 
   The Purple Heart is awarded only for those who are killed or wounded in action against the United States of America. So it is fitting that we honor and recognize their sacrifices on National Purple Heart Recognition Day, as well as recall GEN George Washington's order 225 years ago on August 7, 1782, that established the Badge of Military Merit, the predecessor of the Purple Heart.     
   In 2001, in connection with the announcement of the creation of the National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, my former colleague, Ben Gilman, a New York Representative, a World War II veteran of the Army Air Corps, made the following statement. It is a statement that for me helps to put in context why we should make a special effort on National Purple Heart Recognition Day. Congressman Gilman said: ``The Purple Heart is probably the most recognizable military award in the United States. Every school child knows the medal is awarded to our brave American military who are wounded in the line of duty.'' 
   If we are to ensure that Americans, even down to every school child, continue to recognize the significance of the Purple Heart and the sacrifices of the men and women who earned it, then we must make the effort to commemorate and educate this and future generations. Support for this resolution is one way to begin that effort.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and commend the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Braley) for introducing it. This specific resolution honors and expresses gratitude for the service in Iraq of the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, known as the ``Ironman Battalion'' of the Iowa Army National Guard. Their service has been long and honorable. 
   The soldiers of this battalion mobilized in the fall of 2005, deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2006, were due to come home in April of this year, but had their tour extended until July of 2007. 
   For 15 months, their ``boots on the ground'' made a difference in the al-Anbar Province, one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq. They completed more than 500 convoy security missions, logged over 4 million mission miles, and delivered over one-third of the fuel needed to sustain coalition forces in Iraq. 
   The battalion came home to Iowa on July 25 to welcoming and thankful families and communities, completing a 22-month mobilization. That period of honorable service made the battalion the longest serving Iowa Army National Guard unit since World War II. 
   While serving in Iraq, two members of the battalion were killed in action in September of 2006: Sergeant First Class Scott Nisely and Sergeant Kampha B. Sourivong. 
   For their ultimate sacrifice and for the service and sacrifice of the members and families of the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry, the Nation owes a debt of gratitude. This resolution helps to remind us of that debt. Today, Congress, by this resolution, honors and thanks the men and women of this unit and their families for their dedication and selfless service to the people of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Guam for her very kind remarks and comments. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my resolution that honors the Military Order of the Purple Heart on its 75th anniversary. The Purple Heart was originally conceived as the Badge of Military Merit by GEN George Washington on August 7, 1782. However, it had fallen into disuse after the Revolutionary War. 
   The practice of awarding the Purple Heart was revived in 1932, as the gentlewoman said, at the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth. The organization now known as the Military Order of the Purple Heart was also formed in 1932 for the protection and the mutual interest of all who have received the decoration. This year will mark the 75th anniversary of fostering an environment of goodwill and comradery among combat-wounded veterans. 
   The Purple Heart is a combat decoration awarded to Members of the Armed Forces who are wounded by an instrument of war wielded by the enemy and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of members who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action.  
   Over 1.5 million Purple Heart medals have been awarded to members of the Armed Forces fighting in defense of freedom and democracy. Today, more than 500,000 recipients of the Purple Heart are still living. 
   By this resolution, Congress congratulates the Military Order of the Purple Heart on its 75th anniversary as a national organization whose goals are to preserve and sustain the honor of the Armed Forces. It strongly commends all recipients of the Purple Heart for their courage and sacrifice. Americans should take time to learn about the Purple Heart and the honor, courage, and bravery it symbolizes 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to commend Homes for Our Troops, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, for its remarkable service to military men and women who have returned home with serious disabilities and injuries. 
   Homes for Our Troops was founded in 2004 to assist severely injured service men and women and their families by raising donations of money, building materials and professional labor, and coordinating the process of building a new home or adapting an existing home for handicap accessibility. 
   Homes for Our Troops has been awarded the Seal of Excellence by Independent Charities of America, and all services provided by the organization are at no cost to the veteran it serves. 
   This Saturday, I happened to be fortunate enough to witness firsthand the great work of this organization when U.S. Sergeant Edmundson and his family received keys to their new home in New Bern, North Carolina. 
   Sergeant Edmundson was severely wounded on October 2, 2005 in an IED attack in Iraq. His injuries include shrapnel wounds to his abdomen and right leg, and fractured vertebrae. Sergeant Edmundson has not been able to walk since the explosion, and he still cannot talk. He has worked very hard the past 2 years to regain quality of life, and just recently returned to his family after a 6-month rehabilitation stay in Chicago. 
   After Sergeant Edmundson was discharged, he and his family relocated to New Bern, North Carolina. Sergeant Edmundson and his family were selected to receive a new home after they encountered John Gonsalves, the president and founder of Homes for Our Troops. Sergeant Edmundson was at a  recovery center in Washington, DC, when he met Mr. Gonsalves. 
   Thousands of dollars in donations from businesses and members of the Craven County community poured in to support the efforts of Homes for Our Troops to build a home for this hero and his family in New Bern, North Carolina. 
   This Saturday, my heart was touched so deeply as I saw the joy of Sergeant Edmundson, his wife Stephanie, and his little girl, Gracie, as they were welcomed into their home. 
   This story is only one example of many individuals and groups across this Nation that are doing God's will for our men and women in uniform. I feel humbled to have met Sergeant Edmundson and his family, and all of those who have formed such a caring support system for them. These contributions and acts of service are what truly shows the goodness and the greatness of America. 
   Madam Speaker, with that, I close by asking God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and their families, and ask God to continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is day 247 of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents have now been in prison for more than 8 months. Since the agents' conviction, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these two men. 
   Mr. Speaker, many in this country are disappointed that the prison sentence of Scooter Libby was committed, while these two law enforcement officers are still in prison. Mr. Libby did not spend one day in prison, yet two decorated Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking the laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Judiciary Chairman JOHN CONYERS for his concern and interest in this case. I also want to thank Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman BILL DELAHUNT who, prior to the August recess, held a hearing to examine the Mexican Government's influence in this case. I am hopeful that Chairman JOHN CONYERS will see to it that the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing within the next 30 to 45 days to fully examine this case. 
   While the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this case in July 2007, additional questions remain about how this prosecution was initiated and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. Since that time, it has become clear that not only  did the prosecution prevent the jury from hearing evidence that the smuggler brought a second load of drugs across our border, but this smuggler was also given free access to our country during and after the second smuggling incident. 
   The American people want to know why did the U.S. Attorney's Office continue to produce these border agents even after the credibility of the drug smuggler was shattered. This is a question that U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton needs to answer. By shedding light on the questionable actions of the prosecution in this case, I am hopeful that this gross miscarriage of justice can be corrected. 
   And I want to say to the families of Border Patrol agents Compean and Ramos that this Congress is not going to forget this injustice; and we're going to turn this injustice to justice for these two men. They deserve it. God bless them and their families. 
   And may God bless our men and women in uniform, and may God continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (RENAMING THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, in 1947, with the National Security Act, the United States Congress clearly stated that we have four separate military services, the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps. Too many times people, both in the military and outside the military, do not realize that we have four separate services. 
   The Department of the Navy was created to be the department for two equal services acknowledged by law, the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy. Both the Navy and the Marine Corps have proud heritages. In my service in Congress and in my seven terms on the Armed Services Committee, many times in hearings we hear the Navy admirals and the Marines generals stating for the Record, we are one team, we are one fighting team. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time for the Marine Corps to be recognized as the other three services are recognized. As a great defender of freedom for America with H.R. 346, this is the fourth Congress that I have introduced legislation to change the name of the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and the Marine Corps. 
   Madam Speaker, 121 of my colleagues last year cosponsored the bill. This year the bill is the same language. We are gaining large numbers from both parties who believe in the fairness of this legislation. 
   I would like to share part of an editorial published last year in the Chicago Tribune, and I quote, ``No service branch shows more respect for tradition than the United States Marine Corps does, which makes it all the more ironic that tradition denies the corps an important show of respect: Equal billing with the other service branches.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I submit for printing in the Record the entire editorial from the April 21, 2006, Chicago Tribune.  
   Step Up for the Marines 
   No service branch shows more respect for tradition than the U.S. Marine Corps does, which makes it all the more ironic that tradition denies the corps an important show of respect: Equal billing with the other service branches. 
   The Continental Congress ordered ``two Battalions of Marines'' to be raised in 1775 as landing forces for the Navy. The Marines have remained within the Navy on government organization charts ever since, even though the corps functions through wartime and peacetime as a separate branch in every other way. 
   Like the Army, Navy and Air Force, the Marine Corps has its own command structure. Its commandant holds equal status with other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which happens to be chaired for the first time by a Marine, Gen. Peter Pace. 
   Several Marine veterans and supporters have launched an online petition drive to support a bill proposed by Rep. Walter B. Jones. The North Carolina Republican, whose district includes Camp Lejeune, wants to fix the matter simply by changing the Department of Navy to the ``Department of the Navy and Marine Corps.'' 
   Jones has twice passed similar measures in the House with bipartisan support, but the Senate was cool to them. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, a Virginia Republican, veteran and former Navy secretary, has promised ``fair consideration'' for the legislation. That's Senate-speak for a reluctance to commit. His reluctance seems to be rooted in a sense of tradition. But sometimes it's good to break with tradition. The War Department, for example, became the Defense Department after World War II. The Army Air Corps was elevated in 1941 to the Army Air Forces and in 1947 to the autonomous Air Force. 
   The Marines have not asked for complete autonomy. Nothing structurally needs to change in their relationship with the Navy, which has served both branches well. The corps only asks for recognition. Having served their nation proudly and courageously since colonial days, the leathernecks have earned a promotion.  
   But sometimes it's good to break with tradition. The War Department, for example, became the Defense Department after World War II. The Army Air Corps was elevated in 1941 into the Army Air Force, and in 1947 to the autonomous Air Force. 
   The Marines have not asked for complete autonomy. Nothing structurally needs to change in their relationship with the Navy, which has served both branches well. The Corps only asks for recognition, having served their Nation proudly and courageously since colonial days. The leathernecks have earned a promotion. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to say more emphatically beside me is a poster, is a blow up of orders from the United States Navy to submit to the family of Michael Bitz, a Marine sergeant killed in Iraq. His family received a Silver Star for valor. He gave his life for this country. 
   I have met his family, I have met his children, twins he will never know on earth because he died before they were born. You can see that the orders for Silver Star says at the top, the Secretary of the Navy, Washington D.C., and there is a Navy flag, but there is nothing about the Marine Corps about the heading.     
   We took these orders and we want to show you how, if this bill should become law, how the fairness will show itself. If you take the orders for Michael Bitz, again, a marine who died for this country, his family received a Silver Star, and should this bill ever become law, this is what the orders will say: the Secretary of the Navy and Marine Corps, with the Navy flag and the Marine flag. 
   Madam Speaker, before I close, this is only an issue of fairness. The Marine Corps has earned this distinction to  stand with the other three services and be recognized as a separate service. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I ask God to please continue to bless our men and women in uniform. I ask God, in his loving arms, to hold the families who have given a child dying in Afghanistan or Iraq. And I close by asking God to please continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today many Members of Congress and their families will attend the Congressional Picnic hosted by President and Mrs. Bush at the White House. 
   However, for two imprisoned Border Patrol agents, this day will not be a picnic. Today is day 505 of a terrible injustice in America. Agents Compean and Ramos have been in Federal prison in solitary confinement since January 7 of 2007. 
   These two U.S. Border Patrol agents were convicted in March of 2006 for wounding an illegal alien drug smuggler from Mexico. The smuggler brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our border into Texas, and the drug smuggler was given immunity by  the Federal prosecutor to testify against the two border agents. Since then, the prosecutor's star witness, the Mexican drug smuggler, returned to America with more illegal drugs. He has now been arrested and has pled guilty to four felony counts for smuggling drugs. 
   Ramos and Compean were doing their job to protect the border and to protect the American citizens. Yet, through a questionable prosecution, the agents were convicted and sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison. 
   Many of us in Congress have called on the White House to pardon these two border agents. They are heroes, yet the administration has done nothing to reverse this injustice. 
   Those of us who have been speaking out on behalf of these agents for more than a year are waiting on the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to render its decision in this case. During an oral argument for their appeal on December 3 of 2007, one of the judges considering the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly said, and I quote the judge, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I hope that those attending The White House Congressional Picnic have a wonderful time this evening. I'm sure that Agents Compean and Ramos would also like to be home having a picnic with their family. 
   Madam Speaker, this injustice needs to be corrected. I hope that the American people will continue to care about Compean and Ramos, to let the White House know that these men should be free. 
   It is my hope and prayer that one day soon, this injustice will be corrected and these two heroes will be home with their families, maybe to have a picnic.

Madam Speaker, I am grateful to Chairman Skelton and Chairman Lantos for giving me the opportunity and the privilege to be part of this resolution, first of all, to thank our men and women in uniform for their service and, secondly, to question whether the sending of 20,000-plus troops to be policemen in Baghdad is the right thing or the wrong thing to do. 
   I think this has been a great debate, no matter which side of the aisle you have been on or which position you have had. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to say again, as I did 2 days ago, I know we cannot live in the past, but I will tell you, my heart has ached ever since I went to a Marine's funeral in April of 2003. 
   Michael Bitz died a sergeant, a sergeant who left a wife and three children, twins that were born 2 weeks after he was deployed. He never saw them. At the funeral, the wife read the last letter word for word. She cried, and I cried too, by God. 
   Then I started questioning. The intelligence given to the Congress and the American people, was it verified? Was it true? Then I started speaking out and asking for those who were on the inside, and I am going to read this to you today very quickly.     
   General Gregory Newbold, Marine general, and as far as I am concerned, he is a hero because he gave up a third star because he could not sit there and see the manipulation of the intelligence to send our troops to Iraq, and I quote very quickly from an article that he wrote for Time magazine, April 9, 2006. 
   ``Two senior military officers are known to have challenged Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the planning of the Iraq War. Army General Eric Shinseki publicly dissented and found himself marginalized. Marine Lieutenant Greg Newbold, the Pentagon's top operations officer, voiced his objections internally and then retired, in part out of opposition to the war.'' 
   I further read from his writing to Time magazine. ``From 2000 until October 2002, I was a Marine Corps lieutenant general and director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After 9/11, I was a witness and therefore a party to the actions that led us to the invasion of Iraq, an unnecessary war. Inside the military family, I made no secret of my view that the zealots' rationale for war made no sense. And I think I was outspoken enough to make those senior to me uncomfortable. But I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat, al Qaeda. I  retired from the military 4 months before the invasion, in part because of my opposition to those who had used 9/11's tragedy to hijack our security policy.'' 
   He further stated, ``To be sure, the Bush administration and senior military officials are not alone in their culpability. Members of Congress, from both parties, defaulted in fulfilling their constitutional responsibility for oversight.'' 
   These are not my words. They are the words of two-star Marine General Gregory Newbold who gave up the third star because he could not stay and see what was happening to our military and to this country. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud to be part of this resolution. Debate has never hurt anyone. In fact, at the Armed Services meeting 2 weeks ago, a question was asked, either by my side or your side, Would this demoralize the troops? And General Pace and Secretary of Defense Gates said, no, it will not; they are smart, they understand. This is what freedom is all about is debate, disagreement, and discussion. 
   Madam Speaker, our troops have done a magnificent job, and they cannot afford to continue to be policemen in a civil war. It is not fair and makes no sense at all. 
   Seventy percent of the American people are opposed to this surge, and Madam Speaker, I want to read Retired Army Lieutenant General J. Garner, the first U.S. official in charge of postwar Baghdad. Madam Speaker, he said, ``I don't know that the Iraqi Government has ever demonstrated ability to lead the country, and we shouldn't be surprised. You'll never find, in my lifetime, one man that all the Iraqis will coalesce around. Iraqis are too divided among sectarian, ethnic, and tribal loyalties, and their loyalties are regional, not national.'' 
   Let's pass this resolution, and God bless our men and women in uniform.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (VETERANS GUARANTEED BONUS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina. 
   Mr. Speaker, in July, the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors reported that the Department of Defense was applying a rule that enlistees who leave the service early cannot receive their full enlistment bonus. The Commission was confident that this rule was not intended to apply to servicemen and women whose combat-related injuries forced them to leave the military. At that point, the Commission received assurances from the Department of Defense that this problem would be addressed. Today, the Congress will ensure that the problem is addressed by passing H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007. 
   As Americans, we should never break our promises to our veterans, especially in time of war. To promise a significant amount of money to a young American and then demand its return or refuse to continue distribution when the man or woman is injured in combat and subsequently discharged is unacceptable. In early October, I joined Congressmen Altmire, Stearns and Murphy to remedy this problem. 
   Today, over 270 of our colleagues and 36 veterans organizations have joined us to advance H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007. This legislation guarantees that no servicemember who dies or is retired or separated for disability will be required to repay or forfeit their bonus. We cannot thank our veterans enough for the sacrifices they have made for our country. When our men and women come home from war, the cost of an enlistment bonus is low compared to the sacrifice that is made by our soldiers and Marines. 
   I am certain this House will pass H.R. 3793, the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 237th day of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agent Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents have now been in prison for more than 7 months. 
   Since the agents' conviction, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these two men. Mr. Speaker, many in this country are disappointed that the present sentence of Scooter Libby was commuted while these two law enforcement officers are still in prison. Mr. Libby did not spend one day in prison; yet two decorated Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler, are serving 11- and 12-year prison sentences. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Judiciary Chairman John Conyers for his concern and interest in this case. I also want to thank Foreign Affairs Subcommittee Chairman Bill Delahunt, who, prior to the August recess, held a hearing to examine the Mexican Government's influence in this case. I am hopeful that Chairman John Conyers will see to it that the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing within the next 30 to 45 days to fully examine this case. 
   While the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on this case in July, additional questions remain about how this prosecution was initiated and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. Since that time, it has become clear that not only did the prosecution prevent the jury from hearing evidence that the smuggler brought a second load of drugs across our border, but the smuggler was given free access to our country during and after the second smuggling incident. 
   The American people want to know, why did the U.S. Attorney's Office continue to prosecute these two border agents even after the credibility of the drug smuggler was shattered? This is a question that U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton needs to answer. By shedding light on the questionable actions of the prosecution in this case, I am hopeful that this gross miscarriage of justice can be corrected. 
   Before closing, Mr. Speaker, I call on the White House again to look seriously at the situation. These two border agents are Hispanic Americans who have served this Nation, and they have a right to justice. This is an example of an injustice.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (FOREIGN SHORTFALLS IN IRAQ AID PLEDGES -- (House of Representatives - April 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House and to the American people a disturbing situation involving a shortfall in Iraq aid pledges. This morning during a hearing of the House Armed Services Committee, I also brought this issue to the attention of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, and Admiral Michael Mullen. 
   On January 30, 2008, USA Today reported that allied countries have paid only $2.5 million of the more than $15.8 billion they pledged to help rebuild Iraq. The article further reports: ``The biggest shortfalls in pledges by 41 donor countries are from Iraq's oil-rich neighbors and U.S. allies, namely Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
   Madam Speaker, it is extremely troubling that some of the countries that may benefit most from a secure and stable Iraq, particularly its neighbors in the region, are not providing the money they pledged to help achieve that goal. 
   The United States, on the other hand, has already spent $29 billion to help rebuild Iraq, and Congress has approved an additional $16.5 billion. And unlike the United States, which is borrowing money from foreign governments to pay its bills, many of Iraq's neighbors are running record surpluses because of profits their governments receive from their national oil companies. 
   In 2001 a gallon of gasoline cost Americans $1.42. Today that same gallon costs us $3.36. In 2001 oil was $28 per barrel. Today that same barrel is almost $114. Many of the countries who are falling short on their pledges to Iraq are withholding oil production and causing gas prices to rise on the American consumer. These countries have the economic resources to meet their commitments to Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, in a letter on February 8 of this year, I expressed these concerns to Secretary Rice. Since then I received a response from the Department of State. They say they share my concern that for some countries the pace of their assistance to Iraq has been too slow. The State Department also indicates that top officials continue to urge their government to follow through on their pledges, and with the increased successes, the department is working through multilateral forums to encourage donors to meet their pledges. 
   During this morning's hearing, Secretary Rice also pledged that she will redouble her efforts to encourage allies in the region to pay their way in Iraq. Madam Speaker, out of fairness to the American taxpayer, I am hopeful that these efforts will be successful. It is time for Arab countries that are running surpluses to start paying their share of the bills in Iraq. 
   Madam Speaker, I have said many times and said it today at the hearing that it's our men and women who are in Iraq losing their legs, being paralyzed for the rest of their life, and losing their life for this country. It is the least that these Arab countries can do that are making dollars every time we put gas in our cars. It is time that they meet their obligation to fulfill the $15.8 billion that they pledged to help rebuild Iraq. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, before I close, I ask God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform, and I ask God to continue to bless America.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (MILITARY DEATH GRATUITIES TO TAX FAVORED ACCOUNTS -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman CHARLIE RANGEL and the House Ways and Means Committee for their work in putting together a package of legislation called the Heroes Earning Assistance and Relief Tax Act of 2007, which is designed to help members of the United States Armed Forces and their families. I'm especially grateful, Mr. Speaker, that the committee has indicated plans to include in this legislation a bill that I first introduced in 2005. 
   H.R. 418 would permit military families to receive the death gratuity to invest the full amount into certain tax-favored accounts. A death gratuity is a $100,000 payment paid to survivors of servicemembers whose death resulted from combat-related circumstances. 
   Current tax law limits the amount that recipients of the death gratuity can place in tax-preferred accounts, such as a Roth IRA or Coverdell Education Savings Account. This legislation would change that to allow recipients to contribute up to the full amount of the gratuity payment to these accounts. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the families of our fallen heroes try to put their lives back together, they need all the help they can get. The families should not have to worry about saving the death gratuity to pay for health care, college or other expenses and then have the government come in and tax the interest on that savings. This bill would help ensure that does not happen. 
   Mr. Speaker, the need for this legislation was brought to my attention by Captain Michael Ceres, a constituent stationed at Marine Corps Air Station New River. Captain Ceres, who just returned from serving in Iraq, contacted my office and suggested that Congress should institute this change to ease the burden on grieving military families. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Joint Committee on Taxation has scored this legislation at no cost, meaning that the actual cost of this proposal is less than $500,000 over 9 years. Our men and women in uniform serve this Nation with great honor and distinction; many give their lives for this country. We owe it to our fallen military heroes to expand this option of families who receive the death gratuity, families who have paid the ultimate cost with the loss of their loved one. 
   H.R. 418 has also received the endorsement of The Military Coalition, a group of prominent national military and veterans organizations that represent more than 5.5 million members plus their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, of the 35 organizations that have voiced their support for H.R. 418, let me name just a few: the Air Force association, AMVETS, Fleet Reserve Association, Gold Star Wives of America, Military Officers Association of America, Marine Corps League, Navy League of the United States, and there are many others.  
   I call upon my colleagues to support the inclusion of H.R. 418 in the Heroes Earning Assistance and Tax Relief Act of 2007 in order to expand the options of military families whose loved ones have given their lives in the name of freedom and in defense of this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I close by asking God to please bless our men and women in uniform. I ask God to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform. And also, I will ask God to continue to bless America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, last week, I received a notice from the Chief Administrative Officer and the Architect of the Capitol directing me to remove a memorial located outside of my office that honors fallen Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The notice stated that the Faces of the Fallen memorial does not comply with the new hallway policy of the House. 
   However, memorials to honor the lives of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are respectfully displayed and should not fall under the Hallway Policy's jurisdiction. 
   In 2004, Congressman RAHM EMANUEL and I introduced legislation calling for an exhibit in the Capitol Rotunda to honor U.S. servicemembers who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our legislation was never considered. Instead, House Speaker Dennis Hastert directed the construction of a memorial listing names of the fallen in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office Building. 
   Because we believed more should be done to honor the lives of our fallen servicemembers, I, along with other Members of Congress, began to display more proper memorials outside our individual offices. 
   Hundreds of visitors from my district and others have stopped to view the faces of fallen Marines from Camp Lejeune displayed outside my door. It is seeing the faces of these Marines, the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, the brothers, the sons and the daughters that deeply impact these visitors. 
   Since the media has reported the attempt to remove the Faces of the Fallen memorial displayed outside my office, I have heard from constituents and people across the country who believe these memorials should remain on display. 
   An article published yesterday in the Jacksonville Daily News distributed in the area surrounding Camp Lejeune quoted two women who understand what it means to lose a loved one who has served our Nation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the Members of the House are aware, in February of 2006, U.S. Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean were convicted of shooting and wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our borders into Texas. The agents were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison and now have been in Federal prison, in solitary confinement, for 545 days. 
   On June 18, 2008, I sent a letter, signed by Congressman TED POE, Congressman DANA ROHRABACHER, Congressman VIRGIL GOODE, Congressmen LOUIE GOHMERT, JOHN CULBERSON, and DON MANZULLO, to ask the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the actions of U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton in this case.     
   At this point, we have not received the response from the Justice Department. And I only hope they are thoroughly examining the details of this prosecution. One of the main reasons for our request for this investigation stems from the firearm charges used by his office in prosecuting the agents. The charge carried a 10-year minimum sentence. Without this charge, one of the agents, Agent Ramos, would have already completed his sentence and would be out of prison and with his family today. 
   When you look at the history of why Congress enacted this statute, one reason stands out, to warn criminals to think twice before they put a gun in their pocket on the way to the scene of a crime. The reason for this statute clearly does not apply to law enforcement Officers Ramos and Compean. These men were not carrying guns so they could commit a crime. They were required to carry guns as part of their job. 
   The real criminal in this case, the Mexican drug smuggler, has since pled guilty to smuggling additional loads of drugs. He is scheduled to face sentencing in Federal Court tomorrow. This is the same drug smuggler who the prosecution portrayed as a one-time offender and gave him free medical care, border-crossing cards and immunity to testify against our border agents. 
   While the American people won't wait for the Fifth United States Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans  to render its decision on the agents' appeal, I am hopeful that the House Judiciary Committee will soon hold a hearing to investigate this injustice. I thank Chairman John Conyers and his staff for their interest in investigating this case. 
   This case deserves a hearing because Ramos and Compean were doing their job to protect our borders. They should never have been prosecuted. During oral arguments for their appeal on December 3, 2007, one of the judges considering the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly said, and I quote the judge, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason this one got out of hand.'' 
   I want the families of Agents Ramos and Compean to know that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I will continue to do all we can to see that this miscarriage of justice corrected.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I will be fairly brief. 
   I want to thank Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Ehlers, Ms. Zoe Lofgren, and you, yourself, Mr. Chairman, for working on this legislation. It certainly is something that we don't think about, life and death, as much as maybe we should and be prepared. But it has been explained by Ms. Lofgren and Mr. Ehlers exactly what it does. So I want to quickly say that when my father, who served in the Congress 26 years, passed away and we were trying to settle his estate, the treasurer of his account, an attorney, who didn't really want anything, but he said by law I'm responsible for the distribution of these monies. And so it came to me at that time that it should be made as easy for the family as possible when a loved one, if he or she is serving, or maybe a candidate should pass away in office, and it does happen, sadly, from time to time. 
   So, again, in closing, I want to thank Mr. Ehlers and Mr. Brady and Ms. Lofgren for moving this bill to the floor of the House. And I hope one day that the President can sign this because it's what should be done for the family.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 98th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17, 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11 and 12 year sentences respectively. 
   Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. These agents never should have been prosecuted, yet the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. The illegal drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. 
   Mr. Speaker, he is not an American citizen. He is a criminal. 
   The same U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas also prosecuted another law enforcement officer, Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez, who was doing his job to protect the American people. This makes no sense. Citizens across this country and many of us in Congress want to know why does the Federal prosecutor in western Texas choose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting illegal aliens who commit crimes. 
   The American people have not forgotten agents Ramos and Compean, who should never have been sentenced to jail. Instead, they should be commended for trying to protect the American people. I encourage citizens across this country to continue calling the White House and asking the President to use his authority to immediately pardon these two heroes. 
   Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and the justification for the criminal charges brought against these agents. Senate Judiciary chairman Patrick Leahy has already approved Senator Dianne Feinstein's request for an investigation of this case; and just last week in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Gonzales responded to Senator John Cornyn's call for an oversight hearing by promising to fully cooperate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that the House, under the leadership of House Judiciary chairman John Conyers, will soon hold hearings to look into this injustice. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House will continue to encourage the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, to look into this case, and I ask the American people to continue to call the White House and to complain about this injustice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is day 482 of a terrible injustice in America. Two U.S. Border Patrol agents have been in Federal prison in solitary confinement since January 17 of 2007. Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting an illegal alien drug smuggler from Mexico. The smuggler brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our borders into Texas. 
   The prosecution's star witness, the illegal alien drug smuggler, recently  pled guilty to four felony counts for smuggling drugs while under immunity to testify against the border agents. Ramos and Compean were doing their job to protect America and to protect our border. Yet through a questionable prosecution, the agents were convicted and sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison, respectively. 
   Despite the efforts of the American people and Members of Congress in both parties, nothing has been done to reverse this injustice. Members of Congress and outside groups have filed court briefs to support these agents, and on December 3, 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard oral arguments for their appeals. The only glimmer of hope for these agents and their families rest with the Fifth Circuit Court's decision. 
   The American people have not forgotten Ramos and Compean. The more time these men spend behind bars, the longer it takes for a decision on their appeal, the more frustrated the American people become, Madam Speaker, as millions of Americans eagerly await a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court. My prayers are with the agents and their families. I hope that the judges' decision will rectify this gross miscarriage of justice and faith in our judicial system may be restored. 
   I thank Congressman Rohrabacher for calling for a national day of prayer last Sunday on behalf of these two decorated U.S. Border Patrol agents. In addition to Mother's Day, this past Sunday marked the beginning of National Police Week. This week is a fitting time for the American people to join in prayer not only for agents Ramos and Compean, but for all men and women in uniform who risk their lives each day to protect our communities. Agents Ramos and Compean were willing to risk their lives to defend our border and protect America from illegal drug smugglers. 
   Madam Speaker, before I close, again, we call on this White House to please listen to the pleas of the American people and the Congress to say let these men go for doing their job to protect the American people from a drug smuggler. I pray that justice will finally prevail for these men and their families. 
   And with that, Madam Speaker, again, I call on this White House to listen to the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, tonight I won't take nearly the 5 minutes that I have allotted, but I and many Members of the House have been trying to help two border agents, Border Agent Campion, and Border Agent Ramos, who are now serving 1 to 11 years in Federal prison, the other for 12 years in Federal prison for shooting a drug smuggler. 
   What makes this so sad, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, is these men have had a wonderful record of serving the American people on the borders of this country, trying to help defend America from those who want to come to this country illegally, and especially those who have drugs or may be terrorists, quite frankly. 
   But these two men were found guilty in a Federal court, and I am afraid that all the information that could have been used to help these two men not go to prison was under seal. That is a legal issue, and I won't speak to that, but I will say that I want the people to know tonight, my colleagues here in the House, that the drug smuggler who had a record of smuggling drugs from Mexico to America was the one that they shot when he was trying to escape after his van crashed with 743 pounds of marijuana. These men thought they were doing their duty for this country, and therefore they shot at this drug smuggler as he was leaving. The bullet actually went through the buttocks and went out, and according to the medical examiner that meant that he was turned like he was going to face them and possibly, if he had a weapon, fire at them. They thought he had a weapon.     
   Mr. Speaker, the sad thing is that Agent Ramos 2 weeks ago was beaten in a Federal prison. These men, their lives are at stake, and we call upon the White House to look seriously at this case. 
   We think there are legal questions as to the indictment and to the process itself. We would like for the White House and the Attorney General's office to look seriously at whether these men should at least be given some type of pardon while their hearings are being heard. But we are calling on the White House to please look seriously at giving these two men an opportunity for pardon, because I do not know how we can say to the American people that our law enforcement, who are trying to protect this country from those who are invading this country, whether they be from Canada and Mexico, and yet with our border agents do the best job they can under very, very difficult situations, then they end up spending 11 and 12 years in Federal prison. 
   Again, in closing, and I will be closing, we are asking the administration to look carefully at the possibility of a pardon. There are many Members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, that are concerned about this case. 
   In fact, today, Senator Feinstein from California, a Democrat, called upon Mr. Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to look into this case. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I will close by asking the President to please show the families of Mr. Compean and Mr. Ramos that justice does prevail in America if you are trying to defend the Constitution and defend the people of America.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, 3 weeks ago two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compeon never should have been sent to Federal prison. These agents were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. 
   Members of Congress have, and let me say, not only Members of Congress, but many American citizens, have repeatedly petitioned President Bush to pardon these agents. At the House Democratic Caucus last week, the President said: ``We want our Border Patrol agents guarding the borders from criminals and drug dealers and terrorists.'' 
   Mr. President, we are calling on you today, as you said you would weeks ago, to take a sober look at this case. 
   Many Members of Congress have warned that if these two Border Patrol agents entered prison their safety would be threatened by those who hate law enforcement officers. Tragically, this happened last Saturday night when Agent Ramos was beaten while being in prison. 
   Mr. President, you have the authority to correct an injustice. Please, Mr. President, expedite your consideration of a pardon for these two men and help their families realize that America is a country that believes in justice.

   The United States Constitution, article I, Section 8, clause 11, vests in the Congress the exclusive power to declare war. Many of us in the past few days have put in a resolution, H.J. Resolution 14, to say that the President should not go into and bomb Iran unless he comes to the Congress so that the Congress can meet its constitutional responsibility. 
   James Madison said, `` ..... The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature ..... the Executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.'' 
   I want to thank you, Ron Paul, for always being a spokesman and a protector of the Constitution.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (INVESTIGATING THE PROSECUTION OF FORMER BORDER PATROL AGENTS RAMOS AND COMPEAN -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is day 181st day of incarceration for two U.S. Border Patrol agents. 
   Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. For almost a year, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have asked President Bush to pardon these agents. Many Americans are outraged by the President's decision to commute the sentence of White House aid Scooter Libby, while at the same time he refuses to pardon Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean. 
   Scooter Libby, an attorney who understands the laws of this country and should know right from wrong was convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators. Mr. Libby, who should have served his sentence, did not spend one day in prison. 
   Yet two Border Patrol agents with exemplary records who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler are serving 11 and 12 years, respectively, in prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were enforcing our laws, not breaking the laws. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. 
   I am extremely pleased that Senator Dianne Feinstein will be presiding over a full committee hearing tomorrow to examine the details of this case. This hearing will provide U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton an opportunity to explain to the Senate Judiciary Committee and to the American people why this U.S. Attorney's Office in western Texas chose to go after law enforcement officers while protecting illegal aliens who committed crimes and gave the illegal alien immunity to testify against the border agents. 
   I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her interest in this case and for her leadership in holding hearings to look into this injustice. 
   I am also grateful to Chairman John Conyers, who I hope will hold a similar hearing on the House side sometime this fall. 
   Before I close, I want to say to the families of Border Patrol Agents Compean and Ramos that we, the American people, will not forget your husbands, your fathers, your brothers, and we will do everything we can to see that justice will prevail over an injustice.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, only those who have been to war can truly understand the hell of war. I have not been to war, but I know enough to understand that when our men and women are in harm's way, we should be respectful of the extreme dangers they encounter. Most of us cannot imagine the stress that those in uniform undergo when they have to make a split-second decision as to whether to fire or be fired upon, to kill or be killed. 
   Recently in Afghanistan, the vehicle convoy of U.S. Special Operations marines stationed at Camp Lejeune was struck by a suicide bomber during an ambush. After the incident, why I do not know, an Army official felt compelled to speak out in the press. Whether intentionally or not, this Army officer implicated the marines in the killing of Afghanistan civilians by stating, ``Americans have killed and wounded innocent Afghan people.'' 
   His comments were irresponsible and without respect for his fellow comrades. The four branches of the military are a family. No one in the military family should be in the newspapers criticizing a fellow member of that family who has been faced with death. And, because of his comments to the press, these marines have been publicly indicted as indiscriminate killers. 
   Mr. Speaker, President Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``A man who is good enough to shed his blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterwards. More than that no man is entitled, and less than that no man shall have.'' 
   To ensure due process for these marines, all military officials should refrain from making public comments or expressing their opinions about the incident until the investigation is complete and all the facts are verified. Mr. Speaker, our military servicemembers, the military family, and certainly these marines deserve no less.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Skelton for giving me this great privilege of honoring these fine Americans. 
   Today we join together in support of H. Con. Res. 47, as the United States House of Representatives, to honor what is arguably the most select group of Americans to ever wear the uniform of this great Nation. 
   The Medal of Honor is this Nation's highest award bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Services who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States. 
   The Medal of Honor confers special privileges on its recipients, both by tradition and by law. 
   By tradition, all other soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen, even higher ranking officers up to the President of the United States, initiate the salute of the Medal of Honor and its recipient. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss briefly the history of the Medal of Honor. The first award of the Medal of Honor was made March 25 of 1863 to Private Jacob Parrott and five others. Since then, there have been 3,463 Medals of Honor awarded for 3,456 separate acts of heroism performed by 3,443 individuals, including nine unknowns. 
   Today there are 112 living recipients of the Medal of Honor, out of a population of more than 301 million Americans. Forty-six percent of the living earned their medals more than 50 years ago while serving in World War II, 36, or Korea, 15. There are 61 living who performed actions in Vietnam. The youngest recipient is Gordon R. Roberts, age 56. He was born June 14, 1950. He was 19 years old when he earned this high honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to yield to Dr. Burgess, the gentleman from Texas, for 4 minutes.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, since I have been in Congress, America has presented this award on behalf of an extremely grateful Nation a total of 22 times, 13 of which were presented posthumously. 
   Some recent heroes include Tibor ``Ted'' Rubin for actions in Korea, between 1950 and 1953. He received the award on September 23, 2005. 
   Before that, the medal was awarded posthumously to the family of SFC Paul R. Smith on April 4 of 2005. For his actions in Iraq in 2003, bravely holding the enemy at bay so that the wounded could be safely carried out. 
   Before that, the Medal of Honor was awarded posthumously to Army MSG Gary I. Gordon and SFC Randall D. Shughart for action in Somalia in 1993. 
   Most recently, Cpl Jason Dunham, U.S. Marine Corps, was posthumously  recognized with the Medal of Honor on Thursday, January 11, 2007 for sacrificing his life for his fellow Marines. Corporal Dunham bravely fought hand-to-hand with the enemy and selflessly hurled himself on a live grenade to protect fellow Marines. 
   Just yesterday, President Bush awarded LTC Bruce P. Crandall the Medal of Honor in a White House ceremony. It was just this morning when several members of the DAV, Disabled American Veterans from my district, stated very simply, after meeting Colonel Crandall, and they said this was his comment when they said congratulations; thank you for what you did for our Nation. His comment was this, he just did what his country asked him to do. He was a volunteer. 
   Throughout the history, there have been 19 double recipients who have twice received this high honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, as this resolution so clearly states, the designation of a National Medal of Honor Day will raise the awareness of the American people regarding the significance and the meaning of the Medal of Honor, and help focus the effort on our national, State and local organizations striving to foster public appreciation and recognition of Medal of Honor recipients. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Medal of Honor has touched the lives, directly or indirectly, of millions of Americans, but there are many more firsts or lone recipients of this award. For example: 
   Douglas Munro was the only Coast Guard recipient. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Point Cruz, Guadalcanal, on September 27 of 1942. 
   Mary Walker was the only woman awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor at Bull Run on July 21 of 1861. 
   Today, Mr. Speaker, there are four Medal of Honor recipients currently living in the State of North Carolina. Throughout its history, there have been 19 Medal of Honor recipients from my great state of North Carolina. 
   Before I close, I would like to take just a couple of minutes, Mr. Speaker. There are many who have won this award, Medal of Honor, who are the heroes of this great Nation. One I would like to bring to mind is a friend of mine whose name is Walter Joseph Marm, Jr. 
   I will not read the entire citation. I just want to read part of it before I close. 
   Joe Marm, First Lieutenant, Army Company A, First Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). Place: Vicinity of la Drang Valley, Republic of Vietnam, 14 November 1965. Entered service at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Born 20 November 1941. 
   And I want to read just two or three paragraphs from the citation, Mr. Speaker, as he received the Medal of Honor. 
   Realizing that his platoon could not hold very long, and seeing four enemy soldiers moving into his position, he moved quickly under heavy fire and annihilated all four. 
   Quickly, disregarding the intense fire directed at him and his platoon, he charged 30 meters across open ground and hurled grenades into the enemy position, killing some of the eight insurgents manning it. 
   Although severely wounded, when his grenades were expended, armed with only a rifle, he continued the momentum of his assault on the position and killed the remainder of the enemy. 
   Lieutenant Marm's selfless action reduced the fire on his platoon, broke the enemy assault, and rallied his unit to continue toward the accomplishments of this mission. 
   Lieutenant Marm's gallantry on the battlefield and his extraordinary risk of his life are in the highest traditions of U.S. Army and reflect great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of this country. 
   With that, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) for this privilege to be part of this debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is day 404 of incarceration for two former United States Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These two decorated Border Patrol agents who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler have now served more than a year of their 11- and 12-year prison sentences. 
   On December 3, 2007, the Fifth United States Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard oral arguments for the agents' appeal. During the hearing, one of the three judges on the case, Judge E. Grady Jolly, said, ``It does seem to me that the government overreacted here. For some reason, this one got out of hand.'' A ruling on their appeal is now expected any day, and the American people are anxiously awaiting the result. 
   Many of us in Congress and millions of American citizens feel that the United States Attorney's Office in the Western District of Texas was not justified in indicting these agents. 
   Nothing can erase the suffering these agents have undergone and the many months they have spent in prison away from their families. However, a judgment in favor of Ramos and Compean in this appeal would be the first act of justice these agents have seen since their arrest. 
   Madam Speaker, the injustice of this case should not go unexamined. A number of days ago, I hand-delivered a letter to JOHN CONYERS, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a man I greatly respect, to request a hearing on this case. There have been many letters sent to the White House by Members of Congress and the American people calling on the President to pardon these agents. As of this time, the White House has not even responded to any of these calls from the American people. That is why it is critical that Chairman Conyers hold hearings to examine the injustice. The comments by the appeals judge are justification enough for the House Judiciary Committee to review this case to determine exactly why this case ``got out of hand.'' 
   Madam Speaker, as the American people eagerly await a ruling by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, my prayers are with the agents and their families. It is my hope that the judge's decision will rectify this gross miscarriage of justice, and faith in our judicial system may be restored. 
   Madam Speaker, before I close tonight, I would like to say to the families of Agents Ramos and Compean that many of us here in the House of Representatives of both parties have not forgotten this injustice that has befallen your families, and we promise to do our best to see the injustice become a justice for the Compean and Ramos families.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the issue of illegal alien crime. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, over the past year crimes committed by illegal aliens have been at the forefront of our national media. 
   In Los Angeles, an illegal alien has been charged with the March 2008 murder of a young athlete and scholar, Jamiel Shaw. Shaw was gunned down outside his home in a senseless act of violence. 
   In New Jersey, an illegal alien has been charged with the August 2007 execution-style slaying of three New York college students and the shooting of another. This illegal alien suspect was previously granted bail on child rape and aggravated assault charges. 
   And in my home State of North Carolina, an illegal alien has been charged with second degree murder for driving drunk and killing a 22-year-old man in a car crash over last fall's Thanksgiving holiday. 
   While crimes like these are occurring all over the country, the public has no way of knowing the extent of the problem. This is because the Federal Government and the States do not report statistical information on criminal alien crimes. It is for this reason I have introduced H.R. 6192, the Illegal Alien Crime Reporting Act. 
   Last week, I sent a Dear Colleague letter to every Member of the House to inform them of this legislation. The bill would require States to submit in-depth statistics on illegal alien criminal activity in order to receive funding from the Department of Homeland Security. It would also require all Federal agencies to submit data on criminal activity by illegal aliens. And lastly, the bill would require the FBI to compile this information and produce an annual publication similar to its existing Uniform Crime Report with detailed statistics on illegal alien crimes. 
   Mr. Speaker, nothing is more important than the security of our Nation and the safety of our citizens. I hope that my colleagues will take the time to consider the issue of illegal alien crime and join us as a cosponsor of the Illegal Alien Crime Reporting Act.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 128th day since two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in Federal courts for shooting a convicted drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   These two law enforcement officers, who have each given years of their life in service to this Nation, never should have been sent to prison. By attempting to apprehend an illegal alien drug smuggler, these agents were simply doing their job to protect the American people. 
   Although it is clear that the agents fired in self-defense, the U.S. Attorney's Office prosecuted the agents and granted fully immunity to the drug smuggler, who claimed he was unarmed. 
   This case is a black mark on the American judicial system. Despite countless pleas from the American people and Members of Congress, the President has refused to pardon these men. Every day and every hour that these agents spend behind bars is a travesty of justice. Instead of crafting deals to grant mass amnesty to illegal aliens who have broken the law, our government needs to get serious about border security and get on the right side of the law. 
   The prosecutor of this case gave an illegal alien drug smuggler immunity  for his crime, free medical care and issued him a border crossing card to enter the United States of America. The two agents received sentences of 11 and 12 years in prison and now spend 23 hours a day in isolated prison cells. These men are not criminals. 
   Our government needs to wake up and stop sending the wrong message to our Border Patrol agents and law enforcement officers who face bullets in the line of duty and risk their lives to protect the American people. 
   Many of us in Congress are concerned about the Federal prosecutor in this case and his decision to bring criminal charges against these border agents. There are legitimate legal questions about how this prosecution was initiated and how the U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. 
   I am hopeful that this Congress will soon hold hearings to investigate the prosecution of these agents, because it is time for justice to prevail over injustice.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, today is day 274 of incarceration for two former U.S. Border Patrol agents. Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. 
   Two decorated Border Patrol agents with exemplary records, who were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal American drug smuggler, are serving 11 and 12 years in prison. 
   Since the agents' convictions, thousands of American citizens and dozens of Members of Congress have called for justice for these two border agents. You just heard the Congressman from Texas (Mr. Poe) speak about this issue in a 1-minute speech. These two decorated agents were doing their duty to enforce the law and did not deserve to spend 1 day in prison. 
   While these two men appeal their convictions, they continue to languish in solitary confinement. Nine months of solitary confinement is unacceptable. The Bureau of Prisons has violated its own guidelines which state  that administrative detention is intended to be used for ``short periods not to exceed 90 days.'' 
   Although former law enforcement officers face increased safety risks in prison, the harmful effects of prolonged solitary confinement are well-documented. Solitary confinement is not an acceptable long-term solution for ensuring their physical safety. 
   This week, I was pleased to join my friend, Congressman Rohrabacher, and many other of my friends, including Congressman Poe, in signing a letter to Mr. Michael Mukasey. This letter asked that, upon confirmation, the new Attorney General will thoroughly examine the flaws of this prosecution and will put an end to the harsh treatment these agents are receiving in prison. A directive from the Director of the Bureau of Prisons or the Attorney General can correct this unfair treatment. 
   Madam Speaker, with an unbiased review by the incoming Attorney General, I am hopeful that this gross miscarriage of justice will be corrected. 
   I say in closing, Madam Speaker, to the families of Mr. Ramos and Mr. Compean, please know that there are many of us in the United States Congress, the House and the Senate, that are trying to do what is right for your loved ones. This is an injustice that should not be allowed to continue. We need to bring justice to this injustice for these two men. 
   May God continue to bless America and our men and women in uniform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the Members of the House are aware, in February of 2006, U.S. Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean were convicted of shooting and wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought $1 million worth of marijuana across our borders into Texas. The agents were sentenced to 11 and 12 years in prison and now have been in Federal prison for 523 days. 
   Last week I sent a letter, signed by Congressmen Ted Poe, Dana Rohrabacher, Virgil Goode, Louie Gohmert, John Culberson, and Don Manzullo, to ask the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the actions of U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton in this case.     
   One of the main reasons for this request stems from the firearm charge used by his office in prosecuting the agents. This charge carried a 10-year minimum sentence. Without this charge, one of the agents, Agent Ramos, would have already completed his sentence and would be out of prison and with his family today. 
   The office of U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton charged the agents with the discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. Yet, there is no such crime. The law makes it a crime to use or carry or possess a firearm in relation to any crime of violence. The Supreme Court ruled last year in United States vs. Watson that discharge of a firearm is only a sentencing factor for a judge to consider at the conviction, not for the jury to determine if a crime occurred. However, you can imagine how difficult it would be to convince a jury that two Border Patrol agents, law enforcement officers, were unlawfully using, carrying, or possessing their firearms. 
   When you look at the history of why Congress enacted this statute, one reason stands out: To warn criminals to think twice before they stick a gun in their pocket on the way to the scene of a crime. This is the reason the statute clearly does not apply, does not apply to law enforcement officers like Ramos and Compean. These men were not carrying guns so they could commit a crime, they were required to carry guns as part of their job. 
   By focusing the jurors' attention on this nonexistent crime of discharging a firearm, there is reason to believe that Johnny Sutton intentionally manipulated the Federal criminal code to obtain a conviction against these two Border Patrol agents at all costs. 
   The American people must be confident that prosecutors will not tailor the law to make it easier to secure a conviction in a particular case. Federal prosecutors take an oath to enforce the law, not to make it. 
   I want the families of Ramos and Compean to know that my colleagues and I will continue to bring this injustice to the attention of the American people and to the White House. 
   I am most grateful, I am most grateful to Chairman John Conyers and his staff for their interest in investigating the prosecution in this case. I hope that the House Judiciary Committee will soon hold a hearing on this injustice, and I am also hopeful that the Department of Justice will take this matter seriously and will investigate Mr. Sutton's conduct in this case. 
   Mr. Speaker, before closing, I want the family, again, of Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean, that those of us in Congress on both sides of the aisle, we care about their families, we care about these Border Agents, and never, under any circumstances, should they have been indicted and prosecuted. 
   I want to thank Chairman John Conyers for holding hearings on this matter.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, now is a critical time in the case of two United States Border Patrol agents. Last week, the agents turned themselves in to U.S. marshals to begin serving 11 and 12 years, respectively, in Federal prison. U.S. Border Patrol agents Ramos and Compean were convicted last spring for wounding a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our southern border into Texas. The agents fired shots during a foot chase with the smuggler, who had fled in a van they were pursuing. The van contained approximately $1 million worth of marijuana. 
   Mr. Speaker, after months of silence, the President recently said in a television interview that he would take a sober look at the case and a tough look at the facts to see whether the agents should be pardoned. For the agents' safety, I am hopeful that the President of the United States will look into this case as soon as possible. 
   The facts will tell the President what countless citizens and Members of Congress already know, that the United States Attorney's office was on the wrong side in this case. Compelling physical evidence--the angle of the bullet that struck the drug smuggler--makes it clear that the smuggler was pointing something at the agents as he ran away and the agents fired in self-defense. Yet the U.S. Attorney's office prosecuted the agents almost exclusively on the testimony of an admitted drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. Despite claims of insufficient evidence, the fact that the U.S. Attorney's office and Office of Inspector General were able to track down this smuggler in Mexico proves that they had enough evidence to tie him to the drug load, but they chose not to prosecute him. Instead, Mr. Speaker, the United States Attorney's office prosecuted the agents and granted immunity to the drug smuggler for his testimony against our border agents. That is absolutely unacceptable. 
   The drug smuggler received full medical care in El Paso, Texas, was permitted to return to Mexico, and is now suing the Border Patrol for $5 million for violating his civil rights. Contrary to the claims of the United States attorney, there is no law that requires the government to give medical assistance to injured illegal aliens. This drug smuggler is not an American citizen. He is a criminal. Since the agents were convicted, three of the 12 jurors have submitted sworn statements that they were misled into believing that there  could be no dissent in the jury's decision and therefore believed that they had to give in to the majority opinion of guilt. Still, the judge refused to overturn the verdict. 
   Mr. Speaker, the extraordinary details surrounding the prosecution of this case assures that justice has not been served. For the sake of the agents and their families and for the sake of the American people who they were working to protect, I encourage the President to review the facts of this case as soon as possible. In addition to the 250,000 petitions that have been collected on behalf of the agents, the American people and Members of Congress should encourage the President to review this case. I hope that the Members of Congress and the American people will call the White House and ask the President to immediately reverse this injustice by pardoning these two innocent men.

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Armed Services Chairman Ike Skelton for including language in this year's Defense authorization bill to change the name of the Department of the Navy to be the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   I also thank Ranking Member Duncan Hunter who in the past has also included this language in the Defense authorization bill. This will be the sixth year that the House will send legislation to the Senate that supports this change. I hope that this year the Senate will agree that this change is long overdue. 
   Since 1947, Congress has twice affirmed that the Marine Corps is a separate military service within the Department of the Navy. In 1947, the National Security Act stated that we have four separate military services:  the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps. 
   In 1986, the Goldwater-Nichols Act stated that each service's commanding officer serves equally as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. That is, the Marine Corps and the Navy are coequal partners. The Marines do not serve beneath the Navy; they are an equal team. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is why I have again introduced legislation, H.R. 346, to recognize their coequal status by changing the name of the Department of the Navy to the Department of the Navy and Marine Corps. 
   Not only has this change received the full House Armed Services Committee support, but also from former Navy secretaries and Marine Corps commandants. 
   In a statement of support for this legislation, the Honorable Wade Sanders, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Reserve Affairs, 1993-1998, stated, and I quote, ``As a combat veteran and former Naval officer, I understand the importance of the team dynamic, and the importance of recognizing the contribution of team components. The Navy and Marine Corps team is just that: a dynamic partnership, and is important to symbolically recognize the balance of that partnership.'' 
   In addition, General Charles Krulak, 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps stated, and I quote, ``This bill is a perfectly logical evolution in a series of legislative initiatives designed, in part, to clarify and codify the role of the United States Marine Corps. .....I enthusiastically support both the spirit and intent.'' 
   General Carl Mundy, the 30th commandant of the Marine Corps stated, and I quote, ``I believe the changes you propose will do much to clarify the relationship, responsibilities and functions of the appointed civilian authority over the United States Naval services ..... I believe that any Secretary--present, past or future--will be very proud to bear the title `Marine,' as well as `Navy.' '' 
   The Honorable John Dalton, the 70th Secretary of the Navy stated, and I quote ``One of the things for which I am most proud that I accomplished during my tenure was moving the headquarters of the Marine Corps into the Pentagon. It was a controversial decision, but I am convinced it was the right thing to do. ..... Your legislation would be another vital step to give that distinguished service the recognition it so greatly deserves.'' 
   Before I close, I want to point out to the House that I have beside me the Order of the Silver Star for Marines killed in Iraq. Marine Michael Bitz' family received a Silver Star in his memory. Yet when you look at this poster you will see an exact copy of the article for the Secretary of the Navy, Washington D.C., and the Navy flag. 
   All this legislation will do, all this legislation will do, is to make the Navy and the Marine Corps an equal partner. You can see if these orders were issued and this bill had become law, it would say the Secretary of the Navy and the Marine Corps with the Navy flag and the Marine flag for this brave marine who gave his life for this country. 
   I hope this year that the House under the leadership of Ike Skelton will demand that the Senate agree to the House position and change the name to be the Department of Navy and Marine Corps.

   In an interview this Friday, May 18, 2007, with Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News, U.S. Attorney Johnny Sutton again repeated a false claim about this case, stating that the agent shot ``an unarmed guy in the back.'' That is his quote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not know how anyone, especially this Federal prosecutor, would choose to accept the word of a criminal over two law enforcement officers who have sworn to uphold the Constitution and to protect the American people. Yet this prosecutor believed the word of a drug smuggler who claimed he was unarmed. It is a sad day in this Nation when a criminal has more influence over a Federal prosecutor than two law enforcement officers. I am going to repeat that, Mr. Speaker. It is a sad day in this Nation when a criminal has more influence over a Federal prosecutor than two law enforcement officers. 
   Both agents testified that the drug smuggler turned and pointed an object at them while he was running away, and they fired in self-defense. An Army doctor who removed the bullet fragment from the drug smuggler confirmed that the bullet entered into his lower left buttocks, passed through his pelvic triangle, and lodged in his right thigh, not in the back, as Mr. Sutton has repeatedly claimed. At the trial, the Army doctor testified that the drug smuggler's body was ``bladed'' away from the bullet that struck him, consistent with the motion of a left-handed person running away while pointing backward, causing the body to twist. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is only one logical object that the drug smuggler would have pointed at the agents in this circumstance: a firearm. 
   In addition to this physical evidence, an article published by the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin on October 26, 2006, quotes two of the drug smuggler's family members who said, and I quote, ``He has been smuggling drugs since he was 14 and would not move drugs unless he had a gun on him.'' That is his own family that made a statement. 
   The facts have shown what countless citizens and Members of Congress already know: That the U.S. Attorneys office was on the wrong side of this issue and this case. 
   I am pleased and grateful that Chairman Conyers and Chairman Leahy have shown interest in holding hearings to investigate the injustice committed against these two Border Patrol agents. The conviction of these two agents is a travesty that cries out for oversight, and I hope that Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will say thank you to Mr. Conyers and also to Chairman Leahy because they are willing to look for the truth and justice instead of injustice. 
   And I call on the President of the United States to, please, Mr. President, look at this case and pardon these two border agents that were only trying to protect the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (PROSECUTION OF FORMER U.S. BORDER PATROL AGENTS -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the Members of this House well know, in February 2006, U.S. Border Patrol Agents Ramos and Compean were convicted in a U.S. District Court in Texas for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler. They were sentenced to 11 and 12 years imprisonment, respectively, and today is the 153rd day since the two agents entered Federal prison. 
   What Members of this House may not know is that 10 years of each of their sentences were based on an indictment and conviction for a Federal crime that does not exist. The Federal crime they were convicted of does not exist. 
   The law that they were charged with violating has never been enacted by the United States Congress but rather was fashioned by the Office of the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, Johnny Sutton. 
   The law that the agents were charged with, 18 United States Code section 924(c)(1)(a) as enacted by Congress, requires a defendant to be indicted and convicted either of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to the commission of a crime of violence or possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence. 
   However, neither Mr. Ramos nor Mr. Compean was ever charged with the specific elements of the crime. Instead, Mr. Sutton's office extracted from the United States Criminal Code a sentencing factor, discharging a firearm, and substituted that sentencing factor for the congressionally defined elements of the offense. 
   In this case, I can imagine how difficult it would be to obtain an indictment and conviction for ``using,'' ``possessing'' or ``carrying'' a firearm when the Border Agents were required to carry firearms as part of their job. That difficulty may well, very well, explain why this United States Attorney's Office unilaterally changed Congress's definition of a crime to a definition that would be easier to prove by the prosecution. 
   Any change in the elements of a crime amounts to the seizure of legislative authority by a Federal prosecutor. When this encroachment upon the legislative power of Congress was brought to my attention and to the attention of my colleagues, Congressmen VIRGIL GOODE and former Texas State judge, Congressman TED POE, we joined forces with the Gun Owners Foundation, U.S. Border Control, U.S. Border Control Foundation and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund to file a friend of the court brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Court. 
   The brief urges reversal of these unjust convictions and 10 year mandatory minimum sentences by spelling out how changes contained in two counts of the indictment against the agents are ``fatally defective'' because they fail to charge an offense as defined by the statute. 
   Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues and the American people have been greatly concerned about the denial of due process of law to Agents Ramos and Compean. The American people must be confident that prosecutors will not tailor the law to make it easier to convict in a particular case. Federal prosecutors take an oath to enforce the law, not to make the law. 
   It is my understanding that the House Judiciary Committee will soon hold hearings to examine the prosecution of this case, and I want to thank Chairman JOHN CONYERS for his interest in investigating the injustice committed against these two Border agents. 
   I encourage the chairman and the committee to take a thorough look into the actions of the Office of U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Texas and its pattern of aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers, including Ramos and Compean, former Border Patrol Agent Aleman and Deputy Sheriff Gilmer Hernandez. These are legitimate legal questions and concerns about this prosecutor's office, and they need to be answered. 
   And again, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his interest and concern about justice to right an injustice.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act, a bipartisan bill to allow the Federal Government to negotiate the best price on prescription drugs for our seniors. 
   The current Medicare prescription drug law prohibits the Federal Government from negotiating the best prescription drug prices for Medicare's 43 million beneficiaries. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me share with the House a practical example of how severe the problem of rising prescription drug prices is for our seniors. A woman from my district in eastern North Carolina saw her monthly prescription bill go from $6 per month to almost $60 a month. She spoke to a local TV station and said she would not have money for food if she had to pay that much each month. From $6 to $60 a month. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people want us to pass this legislation. In a recent poll, 92 percent of Americans voiced their support for this bill. Ninety-two percent of the American people. 
   I have read reports that the President has pledged to veto this legislation. Sadly, yet again, the President is not listening to the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill with support from both sides of the aisle and the support of the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that this House listens to the American people, and it is time that this administration listens to the American people. And it is time for this House and the President to listen to this woman who represents millions of people across this Nation whose bill is going to go from $6 to $60 a month. 
   Mr. Speaker, I hope that the House will pass this legislation, and I hope that we will have the number of votes to override the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. I thank the chairman for this time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2956. 
   For more than 4 years, our men and women in uniform have faithfully, skillfully served in Iraq. This legislation makes clear that the Government of Iraq must now be responsible for Iraq's future. 
   Mr. Speaker, when Marine General ``Jack'' Sheehan, a former top NATO commander, declined to serve the White House as war czar for Afghanistan and Iraq, he stated his reasons for not accepting this position: ``The very fundamental issue is they don't know where the hell they're going.'' That is what Marine Corps GEN Jack Sheehan said. General Sheehan's statement is why the Congress and the administration need to work together to develop an end point to the war strategy in Iraq. It is time for Congress to meet its constitutional responsibility by defining what victory in Iraq will look like. 
   Stay the course is not the answer. As Colin Powell said last week, ``We have to face the reality of the situation that is on the ground and not what we would want it to be. It is not a civil war that can be put down or solved by the Armed Forces of the United States.'' Colin Powell, I quoted him. That is his statement. 
   We are now in the 5th year in Iraq, and 3,611 Americans have died in the war. Mr. Speaker, to this date I have sent over 6,400 letters to the families and extended families of our men and women in the military who have lost their lives in Afghanistan and Iraq, and every time I sign a letter, my heart aches. 
   Chairman Skelton's plan provides a comprehensive strategy to maintain and advance the diplomatic, political, and economic components of United States national security interests in Iraq. It has taken this country in a direction that it needs to consider. 
   Mr. Speaker, I close by reminding this Congress what Rudyard Kipling said in his writings known as ``Epitaphs of War,'' and we need to all be responsible for this, and this is my quote from him: ``If any question why we died, tell them because our fathers lied.''

   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, today is the 48th day since a great injustice took place in this country. On January 17 of 2007, two U.S. Border Patrol agents entered Federal prison to begin serving 11- and 12-year sentences respectively. 
   Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted last spring for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. The smuggler's van contained $1 million worth of marijuana. 
   These agents never should have been prosecuted, but they are now handcuffed in Federal prison.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (INCREASED BORDER SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, a tragic incident took place along our Nation's southern border. On January 20, 2008, Border Patrol Agent Luis Aguilar was attempting to disable the vehicles of two suspected smugglers who entered this country illegally at the Southern California border. Agent Aguilar was struck and killed by one of the vehicles as it fled back to Mexico. 
   The tragic death of this border agent highlights the need for our government to get serious about defending our borders. As a key step in addressing this need, I recently introduced H.R. 4987, Defense By Date Certain Act. This legislation would mandate and fully fund the completion of a double-layered fence at designated locations on our southern border by June 30, 2009.     
   The fence alone cannot solve the illegal immigration crises, but it is an important step in securing our borders and regaining control of our Nation's sovereignty. The chaos and violence along our southern border is putting the lives of U.S. citizens and law enforcement officers at risk. Our Nation can no longer allow smugglers to cross our borders illegally, ignore our laws, carry guns, intimidate, and even murder our border agents. 
   Mr. Speaker, as Members of the House are well aware, two other victims of violence on our southern border have now served more than a year in Federal prison. Agents Ramos and Compean entered Federal prison on January 17, 2007, and are serving 11- and 12-year prison sentences. These agents were convicted in March of 2006 for shooting a Mexican drug smuggler who brought 743 pounds of marijuana across our border into Texas. Ramos and Compean were doing their duty to protect the American people from an illegal alien drug smuggler. 
   There is bipartisan agreement among Members of Congress that the overzealous prosecution of these agents, and their excessive prison sentences, is a tremendous miscarriage of justice. While our calls for a pardon have gone unanswered, these agents continue to languish in Federal prison away from their families and loved ones. 
   Again I call on Chairman John Conyers to schedule a hearing of the House Judiciary Committee to fully examine this case. I am hopeful that the committee will review the justification for the indictment of these agents, which I sincerely believe have no justification, and how this U.S. Attorney's Office proceeded in this case. 
   Mr. Speaker, when those who bravely defend our borders are prosecuted, it sends a terrible message to illegal aliens and drug smugglers. Our southern borders are threatened, and it is  time for our government to start defending its citizens from these who will cross our borders illegally and threaten the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. JONES of North Carolina. (HALLWAY POLICY AND FACES OF THE FALLEN MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - July 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JONES of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, this week I received a notice from the Chief Administrative Officer and the Architect of the Capitol directing me to remove a memorial outside of my office, which honors fallen marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, because it does not comply with the new hallway policy of the House. 
   The hallway policy states that items such as flags, equipment, furnishings, and trash must be removed from the hallways. The policy defines furnishings, in part, as easels and exhibits and posters. 
   While the Faces of the Fallen memorial displayed outside my office does include posters and easels, I cannot believe that these symbols of service to our Nation could be considered mere furnishings. Discarded office equipment and trash are certainly a hindrance to the public who passes through the hallways of congressional office buildings. However, memorials to honor the lives of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are a welcome tribute that should not fall under the hallway policy jurisdiction. 
   Yesterday, I wrote a letter to Speaker  Nancy Pelosi to explain the history of this memorial and its importance. In 2004, Congressman RAHM EMANUEL and I introduced legislation directing the Architect of the Capitol to establish an exhibit in the Capitol rotunda to honor the memory of members of the United States Armed Forces who have died in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation  Enduring Freedom. Our legislation was never considered. Instead, House Speaker DENNY HASTERT directed the construction of a modest memorial listing names of the fallen in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office Building. 
   Because we consider the listing of names to be an insufficient way to honor the lives of our fallen servicemembers, I, along with other Members of Congress, began to display more proper memorials outside of our own office areas. 
   To fully appreciate the loss of a military hero, I believe it is important to see the face of what might have been the fathers, the mothers, the sons, the daughters. Hundreds of visitors from my district, and others, have stopped to view the faces of fallen marines from Camp Lejeune displayed outside my office door, and they have been impacted deeply by this memorial. 
   Madam Speaker, on one occasion, a mother from Minnesota came into my office with tears in her eyes and thanked me for displaying the picture of her son, who had been killed while serving our Nation. 
   I know that Speaker Pelosi understands the importance of honoring the men and women who have died in service to our country. I am very grateful that the Speaker has honored my request and the request of others that the House observe a moment of silence each month in honor of those killed or wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   As another sign of appreciation for these military heroes, I am hopeful that Speaker Pelosi will support those of us who wish to continue displaying memorials outside of our congressional offices in honor of the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I close by asking God to continue to bless our men and women in uniform and ask God to bless the families who have given a child dying for freedom in Iraq.
