<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   It's a pleasure to be here with my fellow Republican colleagues as we talk about fiscal responsibility. I rise today with new poll numbers in hand regarding the performance in Congress under the Democratic majority. According to a Reuter's/Zobgy poll released earlier today, a measly 11 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. The American public is disappointed with their government, and understandably so. 
   When the Democrats took charge in January, they promised to usher in an age of fiscal responsibility. Instead, they propose to hit 115 million American families with new tax increases totaling $392.5 billion. That is almost $400 billion. 
   In addition, the Democratic Congress has also fallen short on their promise to enact serious earmark reform. As a result, wasteful earmark spending continues to be a problem. This is evident by Democrat Congressman Charlie Rangel's $2 million earmark to pay for a building to be named in his honor. You heard some about that earlier. Ninety-seven percent of Democrats, who only a year ago told the American people they would restore responsibility to government, voted in favor of this self-glorifying measure at the taxpayers' expense. 
   In a time, Mr. Speaker, when the Federal Government faces an $8.8 trillion national debt, this Congress must demonstrate to the American people that we can be fiscally disciplined and that we can spend their hard-earned tax dollars responsibly. 
   I am proud to say that Republicans have been leading the fight for this in the 110th Congress. Increasing the size of the budget and allowing earmarks to go unchecked will not reduce the deficit. I look forward to continuing my work on this effort with my Republican colleagues as we attempt to restore sanity upon the out-of-control spending practices of the Democratic majority.     
   At this point, Mr. Speaker, I would yield back to the gentleman from California.

   Mr. LAMBORN. To the gentleman from Georgia, you have been in Congress for about 3 years now, I believe, if I am not mistaken, and you came from the Georgia legislature. Like you, I  came from the Colorado legislature. And one thing that the great State of Georgia and the great State of Colorado share, as do all 48 other States, is that they have a balanced budget amendment. It is written into the State Constitution of both Georgia and Colorado that every year we have to balance the budget. 
   Now, unfortunately, I think the biggest glaring problem with our national budget is we don't have such a balanced budget requirement every year, and it is so easy to go into debt. If we had strong willpower, we could hold the line, and that is what we are going to talk about here, and I have some questions for you. But in the absence of that strong fiscal strength of character, moral fiber, whatever you want to call it, it is so easy to want to please everybody, spend for the projects, not prioritize, and we run up massive deficits. And I know that in the past deficits have been run up under all kinds of administrations of both parties. 
   But to the gentleman from Georgia, what would be the difference here if we had some kind of balanced budget amendment? I mean until we have that and if it takes a constitutional amendment, which I would favor but that is going to take two-thirds of the House and Senate and three-quarters, or 38 of the 50 States, to ratify that, and until that day comes, we just have to have the strength of will and the commitment to the American people and the taxpayer that we will balance the budget. 
   Could you respond to that?

   Mr. LAMBORN. Thank you. And it is probably a concern to you, as it is to me, that the current appropriations bills, about 12 of them, that are going through the House have an excess of $23 billion over what the President has requested. And if it was me in the President's place, I might have even had that lower. But let's go with that as a base amount to start with. We are going $23 billion over that. And he has said that, with the exception of the military construction bill, he is ready to veto bills that go over his spending requests. So let's say eight or nine of those get vetoed. Doesn't that mean we are going to have to come back? You have been through this process a full cycle, and I have not. Doesn't that mean we are going to have to come back later this summer, go through these bills all over again, and start from scratch?

   Mr. LAMBORN. Thank you for that answer. 
   And as a follow-up to that, I would have to say that in the absence of a balanced budget amendment, at least we have the possibility of sticking to the numbers that the President has given us. Those numbers are still in excess of the rate of inflation. He is asking some departments for a 6 or 8, 9 percent increase as opposed to 2 or 3 percent, which would be the inflationary rate. So his numbers are very generous just right there. But when our colleagues across the aisle are going $23 billion on top of that, I just see a chance for a little bit of fiscal restraint if they would back off $23 billion and say let's stick within what the President has recommended. There are still many things that can be done that are worthy projects within that amount. And I just see that we are missing a golden opportunity here, and I just think that until we have a balanced budget amendment, we have to do it by our own sense of fiscal discipline.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Thank you. And I have another question from the gentleman from Georgia. 
   You were here over the last 2 years before January, when I was sworn in and I came on, although I am new since then. Isn't it true that we had a rule that the Republicans initiated that said it took 60 percent to raise taxes,  not in statute but in rules, and that that was one of the first things that went out the window when we turned control over to the Democrats?

   Mr. LAMBORN. Yes. And then I will turn it back over to you. 
   But you remember the year 2001 in the Georgia legislature. I remember that very well in Colorado. When 9/11 happened, the tragedy involved with that, and then on top of that the subsequent horrendous economic problems that our country had, and each State suffered losses of revenues. We had to look at cutting programs or doing with less. But at the same time, the American public and families had to do with less also.     
   But then when times were better, we had more, and we can spend more, if necessary. 
   So I just think that it's unfortunate that we don't have such a balanced budget amendment. But it's good that we had rules, at least up until January, where we took a supermajority before we had a tax increase, and even now we have an opportunity, if we will all only seize upon it, to say, okay, we'll stick with the President's numbers. I think we can do even better than that in terms of saving money for the taxpayers. But let's say we stick with the President's numbers, that would still be a $23 billion savings over what our friends across the aisle are proposing in these various appropriations bills. And that we would, by going to the President's numbers, we would still be over the rate of inflation in most of the different agencies. 
   So, I just think it's a tragedy that we're not seizing upon this opportunity. I just expected better when I got sworn into Congress because I had heard talk during the campaign that if the majority party would take power, that they would be more fiscally responsible in different ways. And unfortunately, I haven't seen that fully carried out, and I've been very disappointed. 
   At this point, I'm going to yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 395. I am pleased to sponsor this resolution that supports and commemorates the ideals and values of the Olympics. 
   In a few weeks, on June 23, 2007, the United States Olympic Committee will be celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the modern Olympic movement. 
   Specifically, June 23 represents the date in 1896 on which the Congress of Paris approved the proposal of Baron Pierre de Coubertin to found the modern Olympic games. 
   The Olympics emphasize the values and ideals of, among other things, an active, healthy lifestyle for both able-bodied and disabled athletes, personal excellence, good sportsmanship and fair play, without regard for gender, race or age. 
   The Olympic movement and its message of peace and solidarity offer hope during times of tumultuous world events. 
   For over 100 years the Olympic movement has built a more peaceful and better world by educating young people through athletics, by bringing together athletes from many countries in friendly competition, and by forging new relationships bound by friendship, solidarity, sportsmanship and fair play. 
   Presently, thousands of men and women throughout the United States are working hard to prepare for competition to proudly represent our great Nation. Embodying values of health and fitness, Olympic athletes are role models for young people as obesity becomes far too widespread in the United States. 
   These athletes will be participating in one of the upcoming Olympic games: the XV Pan American Games, which will take place in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, later this year; the XXVIV Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, in 2008; and the XXI Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, in 2010. 
   As China prepares to open its doors to the world, the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing could well be a defining event for our generation. 
   The Olympic movement's ideals and values are as relevant today, if not more so, than when the modern Olympic games began more than 100 years ago.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I want to thank my colleague from American Samoa for the words he has just shared and especially for the inspiring example that he recounted to us of Jim Thorpe and Jesse Owens. 
   An Olympic athlete has the potential to galvanize the attention of the entire country, sometimes the entire world, through overcoming adversity through athletic excellence, and I expect that we will be seeing a lot more of that in the future. And that is the kind of inspiration that we as Americans and our young people can benefit from. 
   I am proud that in Colorado Springs we have the headquarters of the United States Olympic Committee and we have a very involved training center in Colorado Springs, in my district. We also have training centers in other parts of the country. I am aware of training centers in California, New York, and Michigan as well. So the Olympics movement is something that we as a Nation can be proud of and can support, and I would hope that this resolution makes a big step in that direction. 
   I want to thank my colleague across the aisle for helping me on this resolution, for the words that he shared.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (PROVIDING THAT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK MAY SERVE ON BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTER-AMERICAN FOUNDATION -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation adds a technical clarification to the Inter-American Foundation Act. By background, this bill would amend the Inter-American Foundation Act to clarify that the President may appoint the U.S. executive director of the Inter-American Development Bank, or IADB, or his alternate to serve as a member of the Board of the Inter-American Foundation. 
   The Inter-American Foundation Act requires that three members of the nine-member board ``shall be appointed from among officers or employees of agencies of the United States concerned with inter-American affairs.'' 
   The authors of this legislation appear to believe the clarification is necessary because some have recently questioned whether or not a U.S. executive director to an international financial institution, or IFI, like the IADB, is actually an officer or employee of agencies of the United States. 
   I would note simply that this question is largely a nonissue. To my knowledge, never before has Congress questioned whether a U.S. executive director could concurrently serve on the Inter-American Foundation's board. 
   Indeed, any experience with the day-to-day operations of the international financial institutions would suggest that the U.S. executive directors to IFIs effectively function as officers or employees of the United States. In this regard the World Bank Web site states that ``the U.S. executive director is an employee of the U.S. Department of Treasury and is supported by an alternate executive director for the United States, as well as a team of advisers representing different executive branch agencies.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2560. The purpose of government in free societies is to protect basic human rights, the most important of which is the right to life. It is because of the need to protect that right to life that I oppose this bill. Misnamed ``The Human Cloning and Prohibition Act,'' H.R. 2560 purports to ban human cloning. 
   I wholeheartedly agree that human cloning should be outlawed. Yet the term ``cloning'' in this bill does not refer, as it normally does, to the simple act of creating a viable human embryo. Here the word cloning refers only to the implanting of a cloned embryo in a uterus and not to anything that precedes implantation. This bill is silent about and so condones the experimentation upon and destruction of human embryos prior to implantation. Even prior to implantation a human embryo has the entire genetic makeup of a new human being and is worthy of protection. 
   Those of us who seek to defend life at all stages have long argued that embryonic research would initiate a downward spiral for the sanctity of human life in this country. The government of the greatest nation in the world cannot treat human life as an expendable resource and allow taking the life of its most vulnerable citizens. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and to support Representative Weldon's ethical and moral alternative, H.R. 2564, of which I am a cosponsor.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, time is running out to send our troops the funds and resources they need to continue their critical mission in Iraq. It is time to pass a porkless supplemental bill aimed at victory rather than defeat. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate released in January warned of the perils of an early troop withdrawal stating, ``If coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly during the term of this estimate, we judge that this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.'' 
   Many on the other side of the aisle urge Congress to heed the other warnings in this document, yet they willfully ignore this particular warning. They prefer a strategy that would tie the hands of our military commanders on the ground, removing our troops and continuing a defeatist policy of cut and run. 
   It is obvious to me that Washington Democrats would exploit our troops to make a political statement rather than work in a bipartisan fashion to provide our brave men and women in uniform the funding they need. 
   Madam Speaker, it is time we vote a clean supplemental to give our troops the support they must have.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, the Wilderness Act is currently unclear as to when motorized access may be used for health and safety reasons in a wilderness area or in a wilderness study area. 
   This motion to recommit removes any ambiguity regarding the legality of responding to health and safety emergencies within the wilderness area designated by this bill. 
   Current law does not specifically authorize the use of motorized or mechanical equipment within wilderness areas in response to health and safety emergencies. The provision in the Wilderness Act dealing with health and safety issues is in parentheses and does not clearly define what types of motorized vehicles may be allowed for emergencies. 
   The fact is that health, safety, and fire concerns merit more than a single phrase in parentheses, as is the case in the Wilderness Act of 1964. There are 3,600 words in the Wilderness Act. A mere 15 words are devoted to health and safety. 
   The bill we are considering, H.R. 1011, designates 15,000 more wilderness acres than what the Forest Service recommended in the Jefferson National Forest. This is far more than what Forest Service professionals think is warranted. So the bigger the area, the bigger the potential fire, the harder it is to find a missing child, for instance, when an Amber Alert is issued. 
   We cannot stand by and risk even a single human life, which is why we must begin to update the law to state clearly that a wilderness designation does not stop motorized access from being used for emergencies. The current ambiguity in the language, which this motion to recommit fixes, is just simply unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. 
   This amendment does not threaten the wilderness designation. It just puts our priorities in the proper order. Human life must always be first. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairwoman, this amendment would eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and increase the funding for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT program. This amendment recognizes the difficult fiscal situation that our government is facing. Many of my colleagues and I are finding opportunities to reduce funding in areas to offset increases in others, and we are working to trim Federal spending wherever possible. The Interior appropriations bill has the largest increase over the President's request of any of these appropriations bills, and I will support efforts to bring the cost down as they arise. 
   Now, the opposition to the NEA should not be perceived as opposition to the arts. True art can survive in the private sector without Federal handouts. The NEA did not even exist before 1965, and look at all the wonderful artists in American history who survived and thrived before that time. Artists have a constitutional right to be creative, but free speech does not mean that the taxpayer has to fund it. Even if I did support the NEA agenda, at a time when fiscal restraint is crucial, we must closely examine how and where we are spending taxpayer money. As such, I feel it is not only appropriate but necessary to question some of the funding in this bill and see if it can be either reduced or redirected to more worthwhile programs. 
   Much of the land contained in the rural counties in Colorado and out west, including much of my congressional district in Colorado, is largely owned by the Federal Government. In fact, more than one-third of Colorado, 24 million acres, is owned by the Federal Government. This removes much of the land in these counties from any ability to generate revenue to pay for basic government services like law enforcement or fighting fires. At a time when we are facing record spending, this commonsense amendment simply lets Americans know that we are willing to make tough choices. 
   My amendment would reduce all of the $160 million in funding for the NEA while offering a modest $52 million increase to this much-needed PILT program. This still reduces the overall cost of this spending bill by over $100 million and sends a message that in this budget environment we are willing to tighten our belts as any American family or business would. 
   I know many of my colleagues support the NEA. I simply believe the government has no business funding art with taxpayer dollars, especially in light of our difficult budget circumstances. My colleagues that support the NEA should put their money where their mouth is by making private donations instead of doing so with the hard-earned tax dollars of working men and women. 
   With that, Madam Chairman, I offer this amendment and I ask for support on it.

   But there is a flaw in this bill that goes even deeper and touches on our oath to uphold the United States Constitution. This bill has a takings with no compensation in it which should not be allowed under the United States Constitution. 
   I thought we had all learned in the aftermath of the Kelo decision that the American people are offended when the government grabs property without just compensation. Yet this bill does exactly that. This bill forces owners of certain oil and gas leases to renegotiate those leases and forces them to forgo all economic benefits from those leases until they do so. This is a clear violation of the fifth amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 855, which would amend H.R. 797, the Dr. James Allen Veterans Vision Equity Act, as amended by the other body. I would like to thank my colleagues, Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, Mr. Boozman of Arkansas and Ms. Baldwin of Wisconsin, for their efforts on this bill. On March 21 of this year, this body  passed H.R. 797 with a unanimous vote of 424-0, and I am pleased to support it. 
   The first title of this resolution would allow veterans who receive veterans disability compensation for impairment of vision in one eye to be eligible to receive additional disability compensation for impairment of vision in the eye that is not service connected. This eligibility includes situations where the impairment in each eye is to a visual acuity of 20/200 or less, or of a peripheral field loss of 20 degrees or less. This is the same definition of legal blindness adopted by all 50 States and the Social Security Administration. 
   Title II of H.R. 797 incorporates several sections of H.R. 2696, the Veterans Dignified Burial Assistance Act of 2007, which I introduced in June to improve VA burial benefits and State veterans cemeteries. 
   From time to time, Mr. Speaker, a State locates the remains of veterans who were not interred at the time of their death for various reasons. When States inter these veterans, they cannot be reimbursed by VA because of the time limit on reimbursement costs. This legislation would repeal this limitation and helps ensure that all veterans will receive a proper interment with the honor and respect that they have earned. 
   Title II would also authorize the Secretary of the VA to make additional grants to States for improving and expanding State veteran cemeteries. States would be required to submit an application to the Secretary for this funding, of which the aggregate amount authorized for all State grants is $5 million. 
   The final provision of title II would provide families with the option of placing a medallion on a deceased veteran's grave denoting veteran status, in lieu of a VA headstone for graves already marked by a private marker. 
   Mr. Speaker, many private cemeteries do not allow a second marker on a grave site because it complicates routine maintenance. Therefore, a medallion would identify a veteran's grave in a manner that would be universally acceptable and would meet the family's desire to honor the deceased veteran and will be one more reminder to everybody of the sacrifices made by veterans. This provision is very similar to an amendment that I offered at the full committee markup of H.R. 797, and I'm very pleased to support it again now. 
   While not the specific intent of the provision, veterans' families may benefit financially from this measure. Currently, VA offers second markers for veterans' graves that already have a privately procured marker. While there is no cost for the markers, mounting of these second markers is at the family's expense, usually several times the cost of the stone itself. Since the new medallion could be applied directly to the current marker with an industrial-grade adhesive, families will be able to apply the medallion on their own, allowing them to avoid significant mounting costs. 
   Mr. Speaker, title III of the resolution extends the use of the New Hires Act and would save the government money by allowing the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services regarding unemployment compensation data in order to determine eligibility for VA needs-based pension benefits. 
   The Congressional Budget Office informally estimates that this section of the resolution would save the taxpayers $30 million over 10 years. I would note that this savings funds the vision, burial and work study provisions in this bill. 
   Also included in title III is a provision that extends work study jobs at VA through June 2009. Current law allows work study recipients to perform a variety of duties throughout the VA, as well as veteran-related paperwork at their schools. 
   Congress extended the provision for 6 months in PL 109-461 to prevent canceling benefits in the middle of the school year. I'm pleased that we're able to extend this provision even further in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 855, which would amend H.R. 797, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise with my colleague, Representative Chris Smith, and others to strongly oppose funding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers with Federal taxpayer dollars. 
   Today, in America, in order for a minor girl to receive an aspirin at school, or to pierce her ears, or to get a tattoo, she must not only inform her parents, but they must give written permission or be there in person. Shouldn't mothers and fathers be involved in their daughter's decision about something as major as getting an abortion? 
   Abortion is a major surgical procedure. It is dangerous and wrong to cut parents out of this significant medical decision. Over half the States have realized the necessity of parental involvement in this life-changing decision and have passed laws requiring parental involvement. 
   In polls, 80 percent or more of Americans want parental involvement in a decision by their minor girl in getting an abortion. 
   Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry, however, seek to remove minors from the guidance of their parents. For example, Planned Parenthood illegally performed an abortion on a 14-year-old girl in Ohio without the knowledge or consent of her parents. As a result, this 14-year-old girl, a victim of statutory rape, had no guidance or support besides that of the abortionist and the 21-year-old boyfriend who had impregnated her. 
   Planned Parenthood is actively working against parental involvement laws. They recently worked with others to defeat a parental notification initiative in California which barely lost. They want to keep mothers and fathers in the dark, while their daughters undergo a life-changing event alone. 
   For these reasons, the Federal Government has absolutely no business funding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, especially not with our taxpayer dollars. Congress must pass H.R. 4133 which would prohibit Federal funding for these abortion providers. 
   I urge Members of Congress to think about their own daughters and ask, Wouldn't you want to be there with your daughter when she's faced with this life-changing decision?

   I rise today in support of H.R. 797, the Dr. James Allen Veteran Vision Equity Act. I would like to thank Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer and my colleague Mr. Hall for their help in bringing this important legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I offered an amendment to this bill which would provide families the option of choosing a bronze V in lieu of a VA headstone for graves already marked by a private marker. I am happy to say that this amendment was accepted with bipartisan support during committee markup. 
   Many private cemeteries do not allow a second marker on a grave, but a bronze V would be accepted by all cemeteries and would identify a veteran's grave in the same manner as a VA headstone. 
   While not the intent of the amendment, it may also lead to a decrease in costs for the Veterans Affairs Department. The average cost of a VA headstone is about $100. Last year, the VA provided 6,534 second markers for a total cost of about $650,000 plus shipping. The cost for the same number of bronze V markers would have only been between $148,000 and $184,000. 
   Mounting of these second markers is at the family's expense, usually several times the cost of the stone. The bronze V, however, will avoid the need for professional mounting, thus reducing significant expenses for the veterans' families. 
   This amendment not only distinguishes our Nation's veterans on their headstones, but it also allows families to demonstrate their loved one's selfless service to our Nation in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 
   It provides a great solution to an unfortunate problem with the added bonus of saving money for veterans' families and the VA. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill will help our veterans, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 797.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, as we continue to wade through these massive and costly spending bills, my commitment to the American taxpayer remains strong. I signed a pledge to uphold a Presidential veto of any spending bill that exceeds the President's requested level of funding. Hopefully, we can contain some of this out-of-control spending and pass fiscally responsible legislation; but if not, I intend to honor that pledge. 
   This appropriations bill would increase spending for energy and water projects by $1.1 billion more than the President's budget request and seeks to increase spending by more than $1.3 billion over last year's fiscal 2007 Energy and Water appropriations bill. 
   We have an opportunity to demonstrate restraint by reducing the amount that the government spends, not increasing it. At a time when the Federal Government faces an $8.8 trillion national debt, we have a real opportunity to show the American people that we can be fiscally disciplined and that we will reduce this deficit. Increasing the size of government or bureaucracy will not help this reduction effort. 
   My commonsense amendment would simply maintain the Policy and Administration account under the Bureau of Reclamation at fiscal year 2007 levels, representing a $1.2 million reduction from $58.8 million to $57.6 million. That is the same as last year's budget. Given that this funding level was appropriate for last year's budget and our Nation needs to reduce Federal spending, this commonsense restraint should be acceptable. 
   This amendment is not critical of the Bureau of Reclamation or its employees, who actually help deliver water to parts of my district and are important to the State of Colorado and to the entire West. It would simply require the Federal Government to operate the way any deficit-laden business would. A private sector company experiencing the same deficits the Federal Government is facing would not increase its deficit. It would simply cut spending or go out of business. A family on a tight budget finds ways to go without, and we should explore every opportunity to be fiscally responsible as well. 
   This amendment is the first step of many necessary steps enforcing fiscal discipline and sanity upon the Federal Government and out-of-control Federal deficit spending. We must restore fiscal discipline and assure the American people that we are doing whatever is necessary to reduce our national debt. To do this, we must find commonsense and innovative new ways to do more with less. 
   The American people have asked Congress to rein in Federal spending and tighten its belt. This reasonable amendment does just that, and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman from California. 
   To put things in perspective for my colleague from New York, it's true that the war in Iraq has cost $600 billion. That is 7 percent of the $8.8 trillion total national debt that we have. So we have to also address the remaining 93 percent of the debt, because the war is 7 percent out of that $8.8 trillion. 
   So, getting back to this amendment that is before us, I would differ with my colleague from New York. We are not cutting any research into energy development. We are cutting the bureaucracy expense. We are cutting the policy and administration portion of the Bureau of Reclamation. We are just keeping it to last year's dollar amount. So the bureaucracy, the administration of the Bureau of Reclamation is what is being kept to last year's figures. There is no cut going on for any research development program whatsoever. So I just wanted to make that correction. 
   Apparently I haven't won over my colleague from New York yet, but I would urge everyone else here to adopt this amendment.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Westmoreland amendment. I would like to point out that the President's budget request came in at $1.1 billion more than what the majority party has requested in the bill that is before us today. Also, the bill before us today is $1.3 billion over last year's bill. 
   Now, $1 billion, that goes to the $23 billion or so that the combination of the 12 appropriations bills will be over what the President has set forward. And even what the President set forward, I might say, is a little on the high side. But when you look at $23 billion in excess spending, $1.1 billion just in this bill, Mr. Chairman, we have to start somewhere with fiscal restraint and fiscal discipline. 
   I am a new Member in Congress, and I heard a lot of talk during the campaign, especially by some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that we were going to have a new day of fiscal discipline. Well, I am still waiting for that day to dawn, and I certainly don't see it today. 
   This bill is higher than what the President has asked, and that means that the President has pledged to veto this bill. If this goes through the House and then through the Senate and comes out in anything like the form that it is in right now, it's going to be vetoed; and then we are going to come back, and we will go through this whole exercise all over again. 
   So I think the way we should avoid that brain damage and that waste of time and waste of expense is just to bite the bullet right now. Let's stick to the amount that the President has requested. That is still over last year's budget. 
   So I think we should support the Westmoreland amendment. He has offered several good amendments. This is one of them. We have to start somewhere, or we are going to be back later this year. 
   So let's have some of the fiscal discipline that I thought we were going to be in store for, and this would be a good place to start. This is as good a place as any. And I urge adoption of this amendment.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of Emily Keyes and the tragic event that touched the community of Bailey, Colorado, 1 year ago today. 
   That morning Emily and six of her classmates were taken hostage at gunpoint by a deranged man as they sat in  class at Platte Canyon High School. After several horrific hours, the gunman ended Emily's young and promising life. This act robbed the Keyes family of their precious daughter and the Bailey community of its tranquil security. 
   Emily was beloved by all who knew her. They described her as ``sweet,'' ``beautiful,'' and ``polite.'' A member of the volleyball, speech, and debate teams, this active, bright, and industrial girl exemplified the Bailey community. 
   She also possessed a beautiful soul, as was demonstrated by one of her final acts. In a moment fraught with terror, Emily chose to express love. This brave woman sent a text message to her father that read simply ``I love U guys.'' 
   Following her death, Emily's family asked for ``random acts of kindness'' because, they said, ``there is no way to make sense of this and it is what Emily would have wanted. 
   This is the legacy for which Emily Keyes shall be remembered. And this is the memory that I rise to honor today.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, like many of my House colleagues, I traveled with a Congressional delegation to Iraq during the August recess, and I  rise now to speak about the successes that I saw and experienced firsthand while in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, the members of our armed services are working tirelessly each day and night in Iraq to rebuild this country and to ensure our national security. While in Iraq, I had an opportunity in Fallujah to meet with marines from Colorado Springs who were upbeat about the progress in Iraq and were certain that their accomplishments during the surge had produced a truly positive result. They were also equally concerned that people at home in the United States did not understand how successful they have been. 
   After my visit to Iraq, I am pleased to say that I am even more sure than ever that their mission has not been in vain. They truly are making a difference for the Iraqi people and for the communities in which these people live. 
   During our visit, we met with GEN David Petraeus who had many positive things to say about the progress that has been made since the surge began. For instance, he mentioned the elimination of safe havens for militia forces and al Qaeda, continued progress in Anbar province, progress in the operation and training of the Iraqi Army and encouraging signs of tactical successes in Baghdad. I look forward, like my colleagues here who've just spoken, to reading General Petraeus' report on the surge with great scrutiny when it is released this month. 
   I'm also delighted to hear that some of my Democratic colleagues have realized and acknowledged that the surge is working. I plan to continue to work with all of my colleagues, as well as the military and the administration, to ensure that the sacrifice our brave men and women are making in Iraq is not abandoned before the mission is completed.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (LEADVILLE MINE DRAINAGE TUNNEL REMEDIATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, today is, an important day for the citizens of Lake County and all residents of Colorado. They deserve to see what the federal government will do to correct problems associated with the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel. 
   The Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel was originally constructed by the federal Bureau of Mines in the 1940's and 1950's to facilitate the extraction of lead and zinc ore for the World War II and the Korean War efforts. The Bureau of Reclamation acquired the Tunnel in 1959 hoping to use the tunnel as a source of water for the Frying pan-Arkansas Project. Although the tunnel was never used for the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, water that flows out of the tunnel is considered part of the natural flow of the Arkansas River.  
   With the passage and subsequent signing into law of H.R. 429 during the 102nd Congress (1992), the Bureau of Reclamation constructed and continues to operate a water treatment plant at the mouth of the Tunnel. 
   Groundwater levels at the tunnel have fluctuated in recent years. In addition, a collapse in the tunnel has increased the tunnel's mine pool significantly, leading to new seeps and springs in the area. Estimates suggest that up to 1 billion gallons of water may have built up within the mine pool. 
   In November 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency sent a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation expressing concerns over a catastrophic blowout, and in February 2008, the Lake County Commissioners declared a state of emergency. 
   We know that the Bureau of Reclamation is completing a risk assessment in the area, and we look forward to reviewing that report. Additionally, some emergency measures are currently being undertaken by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Bureau of Reclamation to relieve water pressure in the vicinity. 
   But many of the problems reported at this site are not new. Legislation addressing this matter and authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to rehabilitate this tunnel dates back to at least 1976. 
   In response to the request for action from the local community, I worked together with Congressman Mark Udall from Colorado and introduced H.R. 5511. This bill would direct the Bureau of Reclamation to relieve water pressure behind certain blockages in the tunnel, permanently manage the mine pool behind any blockage to prevent releases of contaminated water, and manage the tunnel in such a way to prevent failure of the structure. 
   I look forward to seeing this situation remedied so that concerns about human safety and environmental integrity may be appropriately and responsibly addressed. I encourage all members to support passage of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (OUR RICH HISTORY OF FAITH -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in recognition of American Religious History Week, and I thank Mr. Forbes for his leadership. 
   There are traces of America's religious history all across this Nation. And many things, even here in this very room, convince me that our Nation's founders were intent on preserving the religious beliefs and principles upon which our liberty depends. 
   Our Nation's motto, ``In God we trust,'' is enshrined above the Speaker's chair right there. And across the Chamber is a facade of Moses, who gazes on the floor where we today write the law of the land. On the ceiling of this Chamber our State seals are found, one of which bears the motto, ``Nil Sine Numine,'' which was adopted by my great State of Colorado. In English, these words mean ``nothing without providence,'' a phrase that undoubtedly influenced the men and women who labored for the great Republic we have always known. 
   We are greatly indebted to the faith of our founders, which changed history. In fact, in 1818, our second President of the United States, John Adams, shared this reflection on the true American Revolution. He said, ``The Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people, a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations. This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people was the real American Revolution.'' 
   Our Judeo-Christian heritage, unlike any other in the history of the world, is deeply rooted in the philosophy that all men were created in the image of God, endowed with natural rights given to them by God alone rather than by the State. This is the bedrock principle which we must never forget. If we forget this, like many societies before us, we run the dangerous risk of falling prey to tyranny. 
   Early Americans understood that if government was the source of freedom rather than God, then government can also take it way. We declare ourselves ``one Nation under God'' with Him as the source of our rights and our freedom, and that makes us unique among the nations. It is for these reasons we recognize our religious heritage because it is still relevant to our freedom today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time. 
   I rise today in opposition to this amendment which would cut off all funding to study an expansion of the Pinon Canyon maneuver site. This amendment would stop the Army from  providing the soldiers with much-needed additional training space, an action which could have serious negative consequences for the Army and for the brave men and women serving our Nation. 
   By prohibiting these funds, the Army would not even be able to study the area and complete an environmental impact statement. The purpose of an EIS is to assess the environmental, economic and other impacts of a proposed action before a Federal action is even taken up. 
   Private property rights are deeply important to me. Any option to increase the size of the PCMS should be thoroughly studied, and if plans for the expansion were to go forward, it should occur to the greatest extent possible, if not completely through willing sellers. 
   The type of enemy we are now facing overseas is much different than during the Cold War. PCMS contains terrain much like areas such as Iraq and Afghanistan. We are fortunate as a country to have this training area, but the Army has outgrown it. It would be a shame to not even study the possibility of using an existing facility that could easily be transformed into a 22nd-century facility. During the Cold War, divisions consisting of approximately 20,000 soldiers fought in relatively small areas in Europe. Consequently, training could be conducted in areas of approximately 22,000 acres or 5 by 7 miles. Today, brigade-size formations of approximately 3,500 soldiers must now operate in and control areas of approximately 615,000 acres, or 31 by 31 miles. 
   While Army units have gotten smaller, the battlefield has gotten larger. We owe our soldiers proper training for the conditions they will experience in other combat theaters. Not allowing the soldiers to train adequately puts them in harm's way. 
   The Army is simply asking for an opportunity to study an expansion. To deny them this opportunity would be to substitute political pressure for the considered judgment of our military commanders who are charged with training and protecting our troops. 
   It is unrealistic and irresponsible to think other public lands in Colorado or the West, such as roadless wilderness areas or national parks, could be used as a substitute. No critic of PCMS has come forward with a responsible and specific alternative. The longer distances involved would also make that difficult. 
   Over 200 soldiers from Fort Carson have died in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting terrorism. The soldiers and commanders at Fort Carson know what it takes to wage war in the 21st century, and they are serious about it. It would truly be a shame if they don't have the proper training facilities so that they can succeed. The Army should at least be given a chance to study the issue and present their findings. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the committee for the good work he has done and also the ranking member, the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), for the good work he has done in helping shepherd this package of bills and resolutions that are on the floor today paying tribute to our Nation's veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, on House Resolution 392, I want to commend this resolution urging Americans and people of all nationalities to visit the American cemeteries, memorials and markers located on and near the battlefields where members of our Armed Forces fought and died to secure our Nation's freedom, and to actually secure the freedom of the whole world. 
   Properly honoring a veteran's memory is one of our most solemn and sacred obligations. These patriots and their families are due the tribute and thanks of a grateful Nation. 
   The overseas national cemeteries of the American Battle Monuments Commission provide these heroes honored repose in a national shrine far from the homes they left to serve us. These cemeteries are the gold standard in memorializing the priceless gift given us by those who fell in our defense. 
   The Commission oversees 24 overseas military cemeteries that serve as resting places for almost 125,000 American war dead; on Tablets of the Missing that memorialize more than 94,000 United States service men and women; and through 25 memorials, monuments and markers. 
   These memorials and cemeteries are the final resting place for Americans who fought valiantly in battles whose names ennoble our history: Ardennes and Flanders, Belgium; Manila in the Philippines; North Africa, Tunisia, Italy, and Normandy. 
   With Memorial Day less than a week away, this is a most fitting time to consider this resolution. I ask my colleagues to support it. I look forward to its passage.

   I would also like to thank Mr. McIntyre, the sponsor of this legislation, and both Ranking Member Buyer and Chairman Filner for their support. 
   One of the persistent challenges we face in providing benefits to deserving veterans is communicating to them and their families the existence of benefits they may have earned. This bill is a solid example of good federalism. It funds outreach by State and local governments, which have proven to be capable incubators for effective public policy. 
   This legislation also sends VA a signal that Congress expects strong and effective outreach to our veterans. 
   I'm also pleased that Chairman Hall and I were able to work together to improve an already good bill with an amendment that would improve VA's accountability for the taxpayer dollars allocated under this authorization. 
   This amendment would require any State or county veterans agency applying for funds to submit a plan for their use to the VA Secretary and for the Secretary to review their performance annually.

   This bill would authorize the Secretary to build a national cemetery to serve the needs of the veterans and families in southern Colorado. As amended by my own amendment, this bill would place the national cemetery in El Paso County, Colorado. El Paso County is the largest county in Colorado and is home to approximately 100,000 veterans. Southern Colorado is home to more than 150,000 veterans, and that population is expanding rapidly. 
   With the establishment of this new national cemetery, families will have a much shorter and easier commute to visit the final resting place of their loved ones since they will no longer need to travel to Fort Logan National Cemetery in Denver. 
   I understand that this cemetery is not included in the Department of Veterans Affairs 5-year plan, and I look forward to working with our committee's distinguished ranking member, chairman and other members of the committee to ensure that we serve the needs of all veterans and their families as we develop these national shrines.

I especially want to thank the gentleman from Maine for working with me on a bipartisan basis to include my amendment in this bill. 
   One of the provisions of H.R. 2199, as introduced, is a pilot program of mobile vet centers which would provide veterans with readjustment counseling and related mental health services. My amendment would require that these mobile vet centers have trained staff to provide veterans with benefits outreach and help them with their claims applications and questions. 
   Mr. Speaker, much of the trouble associated with the claims processing system is related to a veteran's difficulties in filing a correct and complete claim. Veterans may have an incomplete understanding of the claims system.     
   That could easily lead to an imperfectly completed application. My amendment would help solve this problem by placing qualified VA employees in the mobile vet centers to educate the veteran and help him or her to correctly fill out their paperwork the first time. 
   H.R. 2199 could have significant impact on reducing the growing backlog of compensation and pension claims. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation. It will help veterans with traumatic brain injury get the care they need. At the same time, it will help veterans seeking to apply for the benefits they have earned in service to their Nation.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to just say that American ingenuity and civic involvement have come forward again. The American people are a creative and involved people. And I have here a letter from a blog site called porkbusters.org; let me just read you a couple of sentences from this blog site. 
   ``As you know, Internet technology has made research faster and easier than at any previous time in human history. By releasing your 32,000 earmark request publicly, I, and other taxpayers across the country could work together in a cooperative effort to determine which Members of Congress may have financial conflicts attached to their earmark requests, which local projects may be unworthy of Federal funding, and which may have value to the taxpayers. 
   ``Thanks for your consideration of this matter. I and millions of my fellow taxpayers across America stand ready to help you evaluate these 32,000 earmark requests. After all, we are the ones who are paying for these requested projects; the least we can do is help you evaluate their merit.'' 
   We have volunteers now coming forward that are willing to help the overworked staff on appropriations that apparently do not have the time to look at these earmarks, and haven't had time over the last several months. Although we've had time for a lot of other things to do, but we haven't had time for that. So volunteers are now coming forward, and the American people are standing ready and they will be willing to help. 
   And on another note, I would just like to give a question to the colleagues I have on the other side of the aisle. I hear a lot of discussion about what's in the bill. And the bill has many good things. No one's denying that. There are some problems with the bill. The bill has some really good projects in it. 
   But why not talk about the earmark process that amounts to doing it in secret, that amounts to doing earmarks in the month of August when we're out of session, when we can't debate it, when it's going to be done in conference committee? We will not have a chance to vote one by one on these earmarks. 
   And you know that, generally speaking, past history is that the earmarks will be passed. Even when they're challenged, even when they're brought into the sunshine. They will, generally speaking, be passed. So really what do you have to be afraid of? They're probably going to pass anyway, unfortunately, even the most egregious ones. So you really have nothing to fear, and you really don't need to hide them, but you're doing so anyway, and I think that that's wrong.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, this would reduce by $300,000 the money appropriated by the Office of Secretary and Executive Management. 
   Instead of $6.3 million, it would be $6 million, and this would be in accordance with last year's spending. This appropriations bill in its entirety would increase spending for homeland security by more than $2 billion; that's more than what the President requested, and it will increase spending by more than $4.2 billion over the fiscal year 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. 
   We should show restraint by reducing the amount that the Federal Government spends, rather than increasing the amount. It is simply not prudent. 
   We are at a time when the Federal Government faces an $8.8 trillion national debt. It's important, and this is a step in the right direction. Just as the last amendment saved us some hard-earned taxpayer dollars, this would save hard-earned taxpayer dollars as well. 
   So we can be fiscally disciplined and reduce the deficit if this money is not spent elsewhere. Increasing the size of government or the amount of bureaucracy, as this bill would otherwise do, is not going to help in this reduction effort. 
   I look forward to the debate on this amendment. I hope it's as productive and successful as the debate on the last amendment. 
   Now, by reducing the Office of Public Affairs in the Office of the Secretary and Executive Management account to the fiscal year 2007 level, that is a $300,000 increase, or a 5 percent increase over the amount of last year's budget.     
   That's more than the rate of inflation. So this amendment would be the first step of many necessary steps in forcing fiscal discipline and sanity upon the Federal Government. 
   Now, this is part and parcel of a larger issue, Mr. Chairman, that's very concerning to many of us on this side of the aisle. We have an earmark process that is not subject to sunshine, not subject to sunlight. It is said that sunlight is the best disinfectant. And I'm disturbed. 
   You know, I'm a freshman coming in here, Mr. Chairman, and I expected the better of Congress. I thought that we would have the opportunity to debate earmarks, and I'm very, I'm deeply disturbed about that because apparently we're starting down a road of appropriations bills where the earmarks are going to be saved for the conference committee. 
   By the way, that'll be in August when we're going to be in recess. We're not even going to be here. And apparently there's going to be a list printed, and you get the bill out of conference committee, and you're just going to have to take it or leave it. That's not what I expected when I came here to Congress, Mr. Chairman. I expected better than that. And I'm sorry that we're going down this road. I hope that it can be changed at the last minute, and course can be reversed. 
   The bills that are just scheduled this week would increase spending by $20 billion over last year. Twenty billion dollars is significant, Mr. Chairman, and this is one of the four bills that would contribute to that $20 billion increase. 
   I'm also disturbed, Mr. Chairman, I've heard some reasons thrown around why this might be happening. I can only speculate, but what I've heard is that, for one thing, the Appropriations Committee was just too busy to look at the many, many, many earmarks that were requested of it. However, that reason doesn't really hold water, I don't think, because we just frittered away 3 months going through the Iraq war supplemental process, and ended up where many of us said it should have started out in the first place, and would have ended up and started out that way if we had just applied a little common sense at the beginning, and we would have saved those 3 months, and maybe we would have had time for the Appropriations Committee to look at some of these earmarks. 
   I've also heard it said, Mr. Chairman, that for those Members who vote against this bill, you know, they can pretty much write off any chance of getting an earmark. And I'm not planning on offering any myself. That's probably good. And I'm planning on voting against this bill from everything I know about it so far. But I just think that that kind of retaliation is beneath the dignity of the People's Body, and I think that, once again, that's something I as a freshman am coming in and seeing for the first time, and I'm deeply disappointed by it.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as my colleagues across the aisle try to deceive the American people with this none-of-the-above, no energy plan. H.R. 6899, the Democrat energy bill, does nothing to address lawsuits from radical environmentalists, which means that leases will be tied up in court for years. It allows no drilling within 50 miles of American shores. This alone rules out most of the promising areas in the Gulf of Mexico. It gives no revenue sharing to States that allow offshore drilling. This bill would actually cost these States money. States will have no incentive to allow drilling from 50 to 100 miles. It imposes tax increases on oil companies right when they need to invest in new development. These tax hikes will be passed on to consumers and will raise the price of gasoline and home heating oil. It does nothing to promote oil shale, nuclear power, clean coal, new refineries or Alaskan oil. 
   I am concerned about using oil shale in particular, being from Colorado. According to estimates, there are 1.23 trillion barrels of oil in oil shale deposits just in government-owned lands. This legislation does not provide a solution that advances oil shale development. It is estimated that access to this American supply of energy could supply American domestic gasoline needs for 200 years. 
   In essence, the Democrat bill does not open up offshore drilling as it purports to do. It makes no progress on other major sources of energy. And it actually raises the cost of oil and gas through tax hikes and raises the cost of electricity through its renewable energy standards. This bill is not just a sham and a fraud, though it is that. It will actually damage our economy. It will kill jobs, and it threatens our economic future as a country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and to honor the men and women of the United States Air Force who, today, celebrate 60 years of dedicated service. On a cold December day in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers achieved the world's first powered flight which lasted merely 59 seconds. Today our Air Force possesses an extraordinary global reach and even beyond into space thanks to the men and women who have served or are serving in the Air Force.  
   Mr. Speaker, the United States Air Force has had a long and proud tradition of defending our Nation, as well as being a worldwide leader in aeronautical innovation. Since its early days, the Air Force has been in every military operation, from World War I to our present struggle in the global war on terror. 
   My father, who now is 88 years old, fought in World War II as part of what was then the Army Air Corps. 
   I am proud to have the Air Force Academy, Schriever Air Force Base and Peterson Air Force Base all located in the 5th District of Colorado. Schriever Air Force Base is home to the 50th Space Wing, which is one of the world's best space command and control teams, delivering combat power from space for America and its allies. At Peterson Air Force Base, we have the 21st Space Wing, the Air Force's only organization providing missile warning and space control to commanders and combat forces worldwide. 
   Finally, Colorado Springs has the highly regarded United States Air Force Academy, whose mission is to educate, train and inspire men and women to become officers of character motivated to lead the United States Air Force in service to our Nation. 
   For the past 60 years, Mr. Speaker, the strength, preparedness, and innovative superior air power of the United States Air Force has helped ensure peace in the United States and throughout the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank the United States Air Force today and its airmen and -women for 60 years of service to our great Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment that recognizes the difficult fiscal situation facing our government. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill comes in at $7 billion over last year's level and $10.8 billion over the President's request. 
   As I have and others have said during this process, taxpayers are being asked to pay more in taxes because Congress is not willing to make hard choices and balance our spending with our income. 
   In fact, my Democratic colleagues feel it is necessary to burden the American taxpayer with the largest tax increase in history in order to fund these out-of-control and runaway spending bills. This amendment, in particular, would make the tough choice of maintaining fiscal prudence by eliminating funding in the bill for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, saving $420 million for the taxpayer. 
   The President, in his budget request, asked for zero. The most recent appropriation a year ago was for $400 million. 
   Now, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting gets 85 percent of its budget from sources other than this Federal budget, so only 15 percent of its budget is reliant on what is appropriated here. 
   Also, the appropriation is made 2 years in advance. That's a curious situation. I don't know if it applies to very many other sectors in our budget, but with a 2-year advance notice, the corporation would have plenty of time to make the adjustments necessary to adjust to the zeroing out of this budget amount.  
   Now, where could this money be made up from if the corporation needs that extra funding? There are many sources that it has available. It is very successful in its type of programming, for the most part. I believe that through further corporate sponsorship and commercial sponsorship, through using the popular programming like Sesame Street to generate some income like we do in the free market of our economy, that 15 percent could easily be made up. 
   Lastly, let me make the constitutional argument, I see in the Constitution that there are enumerated powers that our Federal Government is supposed to be doing. The Federal Government is supposed to provide for the common defense. The Federal Government is supposed to regulate interstate commerce, coin money, do the U.S. mail, and there are things like that, but I don't see providing entertainment as part of our constitutional powers and responsibilities that the Federal Government is supposed to do. 
   Hollywood is plenty good at doing that and other sectors of the private part of our economy. I just don't think that that's the Federal role for government, especially when the American taxpayer is being asked in this budget process that we're going through right now to come up with deficit spending. 
   Already, the appropriations bills that have come before this House are $20 billion over what the President has asked, and we are looking at a large deficit in the next year as a result. 
   I ask that this amendment be adopted. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I am not saying that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting should suffer. They can turn around and find corporate sponsorship, commercial opportunities. They could easily make up for that in the free market; and they are successful, and they would easily do that. 
   So I just say that this funding should not be the responsibility of the American taxpayer.

   This bill, were it to stand alone, would enjoy overwhelming bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate. Yet, the Democrat leaders have failed, to this day, to appoint conferees to a conference on this bill. Instead, they joined it to a bloated Labor bill.

   Mr. LAMBORN. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his kind introduction and for his leadership in bringing this issue before the American people tonight. I also thank the gentlelady from Tennessee for her intelligent remarks as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support and recognize the tremendous efforts of the men, women and leaders of our Armed Forces. The progress made in Iraq is undeniable. The surge is working. And as General Petraeus said today before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the men and women of Iraq and Iraqi Security Forces have themselves surged, determined to make Iraq a safe, secure and self-determined nation. 
   The surge in Iraq is working, but America's job is not complete. We must continue our mission until true freedom and stability are obtained in Iraq. To stop or pull back now would be irresponsible and reckless, risking American and Iraqi lives and the national security of both nations. 
   Reducing our presence in Iraq at this point would quickly undo the valuable progress that has taken years to achieve. As General Petraeus said before the Senators, it is a fragile situation, and it is easily reversible. To pull back now would communicate to terrorists that America has given up and does not have the stamina or commitment to persevere in the global war on jihadist terror. 
   The decision on when to reduce the presence of our troops must be based on winning the peace for the people of Iraq, not political whim that overlooks the successes of our military. But it must not be based on artificial timelines proposed by politicians in Washington as opposed to the considered judgment of the commanders in the field. History will not forgive us if we choose to lose a war we can win. 
   Precipitous withdrawal now means future generations of Americans and Iraqis will be forced to pay for our giving up victory at a time when we are not only achieving success, but when the people of Iraq themselves are rising up against the influence of terrorists and sectarian ideals in order to create an Iraqi state based on self-determination and freedom. 
   The right thing to do is to support our service men and women and General Petraeus in their mission in Iraq. I, too, would like to bring our troops home, but not at the price of providing a safe haven for terrorists and allowing terrorists to claim victory. 
   To quit now would be a disservice to those who have sacrificed in so many ways, but especially to America's sons and daughters who have given so much, and in some cases paid the ultimate price for our security and the freedom of the people in Iraq as well. 
   So I join with my colleague from Georgia. I, too, look forward to listening to the two gentlemen tomorrow, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, as they describe what has been going on. And I look forward to the opportunity to ask questions and get to the bottom of things that are going on. But I know that I can say what I've just said now with full confidence because I've been watching what's happening in the news and I've been getting the reports up until now, just as my colleague from Georgia has. 
   I yield back to the gentleman from Georgia.

   The bill in front of us goes $1.9 billion more than what the President has requested and $1.2 billion more than last year's amount. So we have a chance now to do something about building up the deficit. So if we're sincere about being concerned about it, now is the chance to actually do something. 
   A 1 percent cut allows the committee to do the work of prioritizing and making sure that the money goes to the most critical programs and has the chance to reprioritize and take away some of the fat.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I hate to have to disagree with my colleague from Colorado on this issue, but I definitely do so. Oil shale resources in the United States, as was just stated, are tremendous. The potential is that there could be 2 trillion, not billion, 2 trillion barrels of oil in place in the oil shale bands of Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. It is, therefore, a strategically important domestic resource that should be developed on an accelerated basis to reduce our growing dependence on politically and economically unstable sources of foreign oil imports. 
   The Department of Interior has issued the Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and is now working on regulations for a commercial leasing program. Stopping them now in their tracks would be a waste of taxpayer dollars. I should point out, Mr. Chairman, that the research and development of this important resource have been paid for by the private sector at no cost to the taxpayer. 
   The Udall amendment is unnecessary, because oil shale provisions in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 require approval of the governor before commercial leasing can go forward. So it is not yet entirely even in place. Therefore, this amendment would delay development of this important domestic resource. 
   If we commercialize oil shale, that would provide significant public benefits, including increased fuels available, reduced risk of supply disruption, reduced imports, improved balance of payments, new Federal and State royalty and tax revenues, increased domestic employment and increased economic growth. Tremendous benefits will come from this. 
   Further, oil from shale will place appreciable downward pressure on the world prices of crude oil, which would improve America's, and, indeed, the entire world's economies.     
   Oil shale is highly concentrated and gives the greatest yield of oil per acre disturbed of any of the Nation's energy resources. The oil shale resources of the Nation, besides totaling 2 trillion barrels, would yield 750 billion barrels with a richness of 25 gallons per ton or greater with near-term adaptations of existing technology. It is possible that an oil shale industry could be initiated by 2011, with an aggressive goal of 2 million barrels a day by 2020, which would create 100,000 new jobs directly and indirectly, and ultimately the capacity could reach 10 million barrels a day, which is comparable to the oil sands up in Canada. 
   So apart from the energy independence problems that this amendment would cause, that production of oil shale is close to starting, and, therefore, it is not right to pull the rug out from under the private sector companies that have been working on and investing in this resource. 
   In summary, there is no proven need to delay the use of this exciting new source of domestic energy. The environmental concerns have been addressed in a responsible and careful way. Billions of gallons of oil will make our country freer from foreign pressure and our economy stronger, with more energy available, gasoline prices lower at the pump, and more jobs for our working families. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop).

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that recognizes the difficult fiscal situation facing our government. 
   The Interior Appropriations bill has the largest increase over the President's request of any of the spending bills, and I will support efforts to bring the costs down as these opportunities arise. At a time when our budget needs balancing, we must reprioritize our spending. That is why the amendment I am proposing now would eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
   I am disappointed that my earlier amendment yesterday was not accepted as it would have directed some of the funding toward the PLT program, or payment in lieu of taxes by the Federal Government to compensate for lost revenues to local governments. 
   But I still maintain that particularly in this budget environment, taxpayers should not be asked to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. Now opposition to the NEA should not be perceived as opposition to the arts. My wife is an artist, and I support the arts wholeheartedly. But I do feel strongly that it is something that the private sector can fully, and has in the past fully and wholeheartedly supported. 
   True art can and does survive without Federal handouts. Artists have every right to be creative without forcing the taxpayer to fund it. The private sector is the appropriate venue to fund such projects. I know artists who refuse to take money from any level of government because they want to be  independent. They don't want to have any strings attached. They don't want to be beholden to anybody, and they will refuse government funding. 
   While there are certainly projects that the NEA does that are worthwhile, some are objectionable and have been over recent history. And at a time when fiscal restraint is crucial, we must examine closely how and where we are spending taxpayer money. It is not only appropriate but necessary to question some of the funding in this bill and see if it can be either reduced or directed to more worthwhile programs. 
   My amendment would save taxpayers an immediate $150 million in budget authority spending in fiscal year 2008, and allows the remaining $10 million to be spent on shutdown costs. This still reduces the overall cost of this spending bill and sends a message that in this budget environment we are willing to tighten our belts here in Washington just as any American family or business would have to. 
   It is disheartening to think there is an assumption of continued taxpayer support for every single discretionary program. Yet that is exactly what we are hearing today in this debate on funding for the NEA. There are arguments for why we must continue to spend money on an art program when we face budget constraints in trying to adequately provide necessary treatment for our returning veterans and all of the many priorities in our almost $3 trillion budget. 
   I come from a commonsense perceptive that says when my bank account is low, I make tough decisions on where my money must be spent. None of my colleagues supporting this funding seem to fully appreciate this approach, and it is disappointing and it is in large part why we face the budget situation that we are in. 
   I would note that the budget for this appropriations bill is I believe $1.9 billion over what the President has requested. I hear talk about how our deficit is going up every week, every day, every month. This is a great opportunity that we have to stop the hemorrhaging. We can stop the spending. I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are contemplating not extending the Bush temporary tax cuts. They want to end that in their budget plan. That would amount to the largest tax increase in American history. We have this opportunity now to take $160 million and save it for the taxpayer. So I just think this would be a well-considered thing. 
   The arts are valuable in American life and culture. For anyone to say let's do this through the private sector as opposed to the taxpayers does not make them a member of the Flat Earth Society. The arts are valuable, but they are well supported in our society and culture. We just have so many other priorities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   My wife, Jeanie, is an artist. I support, she supports, the arts. I agree with what you said about the importance of arts in our culture. The only question is who should pay for it. Should the taxpayer pay for it or the private sector? The $160 million budget in this bill is $35 million, or 29 percent, higher than last year's budget. Do we need a 29 percent tax increase? I think the arts are great, but let's support it in the private sector. 
   I would urge adoption of this amendment, Mr. Chairman.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for his remaining 30 seconds.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank both of my colleagues for organizing this time tonight in recognition of National Bible Week. 
   My own experience with the Bible began when I was an 18-year-old freshman at the University of Kansas in 1973. I was approached by some people who asked me if I knew what was in the Bible. I said I knew what it was all about. But then I had to admit I had never read it for myself. The only honest thing I could do at that point was to read the Bible for myself. 
   When I read the Gospel of John, I ended up discovering a personal relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and Savior. In that gospel He says: I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father but through Me. 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't know where in their spiritual journey people may be who are listening tonight, but I do know this: It is better to read the Bible for oneself and not just to take someone else's word for what is in it. For me, it made all of the difference in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (EXTENDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON MINORITY VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 674, a bill to amend title XXXVIII, United States Code, to permanently establish the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans which is set to expire on December 31, 2009. I commend my colleague from Illinois, Luis Gutierrez, for introducing this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, in 1994 under Public Law 103-446, the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act, Congress established the Advisory Committee on Minority Veterans. The committee is comprised of veterans who represent their respective minority groups and are recognized authorities in fields pertinent to their needs. The committee's goal is to promote the use of VA programs, benefits, and services by minority veterans, to make benefits and services more accessible to minority veterans, and to evaluate current programs and make recommendations on how the VA can better serve minority veterans. 
   As I said, current authority for the committee is set to expire December 31, 2009. By supporting H.R. 674, we eliminate the expiration date and permanently extend this important committee to ensure the perspectives of minority veterans are considered during the establishment of VA benefits and services. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (VETERANS DISABILITY BENEFITS CLAIMS MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 5892, as amended, the Veterans Disability Benefits Claims Modernization Act of 2008, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to modernize the VA disability benefits claims processing system and to ensure the accurate and timely delivery of compensation to veterans and their families. 
   I commend my colleague from New York, Subcommittee Chairman JOHN HALL, for introducing this comprehensive bill, which has been a culmination of thought and of a great deal of cooperative effort to make substantial improvements to the veterans' benefits claims process. I appreciate the bipartisan manner in which we have worked together to bring this bill to the floor. 
   Not long ago, the VA's health care system was in such a poor state that it was derided in movies like Born on the Fourth of July. Now the VA's state-of-the-art medical care is cited in top medical journals and in a number of other respected publications. I believe the VA can make similar progress on the benefits side of the department. 
   This bipartisan bill is intended to improve benefits claims processing so that our veterans receive their benefits with the speed and accuracy that they deserve. It is comprised of a number of measures that have as their foundation the collective recommendations of Democrats, Republicans, veterans' service organizations, and two blue ribbon commissions on veterans' benefits. 
   These recommendations include the utilization of information technology, a quality and training assessment program for the certification of each VA claims processor, a study of a new rating schedule that reflects the loss of quality of life and the loss of earnings. 
   The VA rating schedule now is a complex set of regulations used to determine the appropriate level of compensation for veterans' disabilities. We must ensure that the rating schedule compensates veterans for both the loss of earnings and for the loss of quality of life. The schedule must also be reflective of the contemporary job market to ensure parity in disability ratings. 
   While the VA has made adjustments over the course of many decades, it is still obviously important that Congress continues to work with VA and with its stakeholders to ensure that the rating schedule is as accurate and is as up to date as possible. 
   In addition, H.R. 5892 will allow an eligible dependent to substitute for a claimant who passes away while a disability claim is pending rather than to begin the claims process all over again. This provision was taken from H.R. 3047, a bill that I introduced, and I'm glad to see it included in this bill. 
   By supporting H.R. 5892, we will initiate steps to ensure that VA benefits and services are of unsurpassed value to veterans. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the energy crisis gripping our country. The time has come for America to unite behind an aggressive campaign to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. Failure to act now will only drive up energy prices and destroy good-paying jobs. 
   Solving this crisis requires producing more American energy. We must lift the moratorium imposed by Congress on offshore drilling. Also, we must remove the roadblocks preventing leasing programs for oil shale on public lands. Finally, we must allow responsible drilling in ANWR. Doing these things will have an immediate impact on gasoline prices. 
   President Bush this week lifted the executive moratorium on new oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. This is an important first step but must be followed by action from Congress to finish the job. Billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas are available to America if we do this. We are the only country in the world not using the energy at its disposal. 
   Congress must act immediately to help lower gasoline prices for all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (COLUMBIA-PACIFIC NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 407 for both procedural and substantive reasons. I am very dismayed that this bill has been  rushed to the floor with no hearing or subcommittee or full committee consideration by the Committee on Natural Resources. The majority might say a hearing was held on the bill last September, and no opposition was present so there is no need for consideration by the committee this year; but I strongly disagree with this logic for several reasons. 
   First, the committee has received a strong letter of opposition to H.R. 407 by one of the largest private property rights groups, the American Land Rights Association, based in Battleground, Washington. 
   That letter states: ``We are curious why no hearings have been held on this bill during this Congress. Congress has the time and energy to congratulate victorious sports teams, but does not have the time and resources to hold a hearing on this bill which affects millions of acres of private property in Washington and Oregon.'' 
   Second, I note that one-eighth of the Members of this body, including me, are new Members of the House and were unable to participate in hearings held in the last Congress on this bill. Although there might be some cases where a consensus bill from the last Congress could justifiably be forwarded to the House for expedited consideration on the floor, this bill should not be one of them. As I said previously, it is strongly opposed by a private rights based group in the area affected by the bill. 
   The substantive reasons to oppose this bill can best be summarized by the American Land Rights Association's May 3, 2007, letter to the Committee on Natural Resources which states: ``Although H.R. 407 is billed merely as a study, history shows the National Park Service rarely does a study that concludes a national heritage area is not feasible. Recent history also shows that national heritage areas cost the National Park Service $10 million during their 15-year life span. Moreover, once their 15-year authorization expires, heritage area proponents come back to Congress asking for even more Federal moneys so they can ultimately become self-sufficient. At a time when the National Park Service has a multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog for such basic visitor services as campgrounds, visitor centers and sanitation facilities, it should not be forced by Congress to create expensive new heritage areas that siphon precious Federal dollars from these higher and better uses.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the letter I just referred to.

   H.R. 1080, introduced by our colleague Congresswoman Barbara Cubin, would modify the boundaries of the Grand Teton National Park to include 49 acres of privately donated land. I commend Mrs. Cubin for her work on this legislation. This highly valuable land, which has been valued at nearly $20 million, is being conveyed to the Park Service at very minimal cost. 
   Representative Cubin and her staff did an excellent job working with the private individuals and groups who are donating the land and with the Park Service. The 49 acres are beautiful and highly desirable land that will enhance Grand Teton National Park. 
   This noncontroversial bill was favorably reported by the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1080. 
   I would also like to add that our thoughts and prayers are with Representative Cubin and her husband, Dr. Cubin. We wish him a quick and speedy recovery.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4 which was hastily drafted without proper committee consideration or any by the minority party. 
   Democrats are fond of citing the Department of Veterans Affairs as evidence that Medicare officials could squeeze lower prices out of drug makers if the government merely used its negotiating clout. 
   However, what they don't tell you is this program from the early 90s resulted in a stark increase in VA prices for drug purchases. 
   Additionally, independent experts at the Congressional Budget Office have said that government involvement in price negotiation will not lead to lower costs for seniors and could lead to significant restrictions in access to necessary drugs. 
   Our seniors can not afford either price increases or restrictions on the drugs they need to stay healthy, both of which are likely if this measure becomes law. 
   That is something I cannot support and I urge opposition to H.R. 4 today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. There are many flaws in this resolution. One of the most serious is that while it gives lip-service to a desire to support and protect the troops, it turns around and disapproves of the plan that is best calculated by the commanders on the ground to bring order to Baghdad. 
   This surge is the best way, in the opinion of the commanders, to clamp down on the insurgency, to protect our troops and ultimately to lead to victory. I don't see how you can claim to protect and support the troops while taking away the best option for victory. 
   That brings up another serious flaw in this resolution: It has no positive alternative. The resolution seems to say that we should go on as before, which I thought my colleagues across the aisle said was unacceptable. 
   Yet another serious flaw is that Members of Congress, who are many thousands of miles away from the battlefield, are substituting their judgment for that of the commanders in the field. This is foolish and arrogant. This gives rise to a constitutional conflict as well. The Constitution gives the President the power of Commander in Chief. President Bush, who was reelected by a vote of the entire American people just 2 years ago, has the duty and authority to conduct the war in Iraq. 
   Congress has the power to declare war and to fund or to not fund war, but does not have the power to conduct a war. This constitutional division of powers is vital, because, among other things, a clear chain of command is better calculated to lead to victory with the least possible loss of life. War by committee, on the other hand, does not best serve the interests of our country or our troops. 
   Because this resolution is so deeply flawed, it will send bad messages if it is passed. It will send a message to our enemies that we are weak and unable to complete a difficult task. It will send a message to our allies that we are undependable. It will send a message to the families and loved ones of our fallen soldiers and marines, to our brave men and women who have been disabled and to the troops in the field, that their sacrifice is in vain because their mission is not worth our commitment. These messages will be destructive, and I urge my colleagues not to go down this road. 
   If America does abandon Iraq, which many of my colleagues across the aisle want to be the ultimate outcome, destruction will spread across the entire Middle East and will be more likely to come to our own shores. 
   I know that the struggle against terrorism is difficult, but we cannot give up. Yes, we must learn as we go, and, yes, we must adapt to changing circumstances. But we must not think that retreat will bring relief. We and the entire world will pay a terrible price if we go down that road. This resolution is the first step down that road. I urge the defeat of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAMBORN. (ROE V. WADE -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for putting this time together and for recognizing me. 
   Mr. Speaker, today marks the 35th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision which legalized abortion in the United States. Elective abortion, a tragic practice, is the most common medical procedure performed in the United States. Let me repeat: Abortion is the most common medical procedure performed in the United States, and is perpetuated by a perverse logic that the life of an unplanned child is somehow not of the same value as that of any other child. 
   A recent study published by the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry in 2006 indicates that women who have had an abortion have a much higher incidence of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviors and substance abuse. Abortion can also cause physical side effects, such as reduced fertility, hemorrhaging, and even death. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize pregnancy care centers around the country, who defend the lives of the unborn and protect the physical and psychological health of American  women who find themselves in unplanned pregnancies every year. Through the support of selfless men and women devoted to a culture of life, these care centers are able to give concrete, practical assistance to women, from pregnancy testing to prenatal vitamins, ultrasound imaging and infant supplies. 
   Tragically, many women in the United States are told and believe abortion is the only way. Pregnancy care centers respect these women and their right to know that there are other options. These facilities offer guidance for mothers faced with heart-wrenching decisions. Whether the woman chooses to give the child up for adoption or raise the baby, pregnancy care centers provide counseling, information and support. 
   Pregnancy care centers across the world have and will continue to reduce abortion rates, save unborn lives, and help women avoid the psychological and physical damages of abortion. 
   Tonight, I mourn the 50 million American lives cut short by abortion, and pray that God continues to protect and strengthen those touched by this tragic practice. I will be among those working to end it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back to the gentleman.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Smith-Stupak amendment. The Mexico City policy does not reduce family planning funding at all. It only requires that funds, support and supplies are directed to NGOs that do not promote abortion as part of family planning. 
   U.S. taxpayers should not be forced to hand their hard-earned tax money over to organizations that practice policies that these taxpayers morally oppose. The Mexico City policy has established that clear bright line that allows us to provide assistance in a morally acceptable manner. 
   President Bush has clearly indicated his intent to veto this bill if it weakens current Federal policies and laws on abortion or that encourages the destruction of human life at any stage. Enough of us, myself included, have pledged to sustain this veto that it will, indeed, be sustained. 
   We must ensure that taxpayer funds do not underwrite organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning. I urge my colleagues to support the Smith-Stupak amendment today.

   Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would have ensured that none of the funds made available in this bill under the West Bank and Gaza program may be made available to any individual or entity that does not expressly recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist. I brought this amendment to the floor to emphasize the strong sense of this Congress and the United States that the peace process in this region requires all participants to publicly acknowledge the fundamental right of the State of Israel to exist. 
   Funding an organization that fails to recognize Israel is not acceptable and should not be tolerated by this Congress. 
   While there have been many opportunities for the Palestinian Liberation Organization in particular to officially recognize Israel's right to exist, it has failed to do so. Until it is held accountable for its failure to make recognition of Israel a formal part of its charter, we as a Nation and in this Congress must be careful not to reward and enable this organization. 
   Because Hamas controlled the Palestinian Authority after the recent elections, the last Congress felt the need to pass a law, the Palestinian Antiterrorism Act of 2006, to ensure that U.S. funds would not be provided to this terrorist regime. This law, however, does not go far enough, because it fails to make Israel's right to exist part of the law as it applies to the PLO. 
   In contrast, my amendment would have created a simple formula for determining where to provide assistance and who would be eligible to receive funds by making the recognition of Israel's right to exist as well as refraining from terrorism a prerequisite for U.S. funding of all organizations. 
   For the peace process to be successful, and everyone here sincerely wants this, it is imperative that all of the parties involved expressly understand and recognize the rights of the other parties. Until this happens, true peace, Mr. Chairman, cannot be achieved.

Dane's mother, Carla, resides in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and his father, John, lives in Miami, Florida. 
   From an early age, Dane dreamed of the opportunity to serve his country. His path to the military began at Sand Creek High School in Colorado Springs, where he joined the Army ROTC program. The assistant principal at Sand Creek remembered Dane as an outstanding person and someone who had an absolute love for the military and serving his country. Immediately following graduation, Dane enlisted in the Army.
