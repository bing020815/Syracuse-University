   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place in the RECORD a listing of the congressionally directed projects in my home State of Idaho that are contained in the report of the FY08 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. 
   I would like to take just a few minutes to describe why I supported these projects and why they are valuable to the Nation and its taxpayers. 
   The report contains $1,200,000 for the Idaho State Police to participate in the Criminal Information Sharing Alliance Network, CISAnet. CISAnet is a fully functional information-sharing network comprised of law enforcement agencies from 10 States, including Idaho. The program focuses on drug trafficking and border security issues. Sharing of criminal law enforcement information by and between these 10 States is vital to securing an area regarded as one of the most vulnerable to our Nation's security. These funds would enable Idaho to continue participating in CISAnet. This program has received Federal funding in previous fiscal years. 
   This project was requested by the Idaho State Police. 
   The report contains $800,000 for the Idaho Department of Corrections to participate in the National Consortium of Offender Management Systems, NCOMS, Sharing Software Development Project. NCOMS is a web-based system allowing States and governmental agencies to share offender information. NCOMS and the CIS system make it a reality to track offenders across State lines and beyond with the use of Extensible Markup Language, XML, global standards and partnerships across the law enforcement and corrections communities. Funding would be used to allow more government agencies and entities to effectively use the system and to modify the ``coding'' of the application to make it more modular, allowing organizations to implement pieces of the application as needed. This program has received Federal funding in previous fiscal years. 
   This project was requested by the Idaho Department of Corrections. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally directed projects in my district and an explanation of my support for them.

   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place in the RECORD a listing of the congressionally-directed projects in my home state of Idaho that are contained the report of the FY08 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. 
   The project provides $500,000 within the Environmental Protection Agency, State and Tribal Assistance Grants to the City of Twin Falls for the Auger Falls Wastewater Treatment Project. 
   Funding such as this is critical to assisting rural Idaho communities in upgrading their water and wastewater treatment facilities. In the case of Twin Falls, this funding is required to comply with unfunded mandates passed down by this Congress and federal agencies. The State of Idaho, under court order, has implemented Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) limits for phosphorus compounds on all significant discharges to the river. The City of Twin Falls Wastewater Treatment Plan, with a daily discharge of approximately 7.1 million gallons of treated wastewater per day, is one of the largest dischargers of phosphorus on the Middle Snake River and periodically exceeds the EPA TMDL limit. The City is planning to meet its TMDL limits through the use of natural treatments on city owned property, in the form of constructed wetlands and habitat creation. 
   This funding will allow the City of Twin Falls to develop the beneficial wildlife habitats that will function as wastewater treatment systems to further reduce nutrients in City wastewater. This will ensure that the wastewater does not exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's Total Maximum Daily Load mandates for the City's wastewater discharged into the Snake River. 
   I am proud to have obtained this funding for Idaho and look forward to working with Idaho's communities in the future to meet their water resource challenges. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my district and an explanation of my support for them.

   Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I wish to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased that this legislation increases the funding  for loan repayment for health professionals within the Indian Health Service. As a dentist, I am keenly aware that the IHS dental program has the highest vacancy rate at 34 percent. The loan repayment program has proven to be a successful recruiting and retention tool for dentists and others. However, there is a related issue that I would like to discuss. 
   Within the next few years, 65 percent of the IHS dental specialists, including pediatric dentists and oral surgeons, will be eligible for retirement. These dentists are in great demand because Indian people have some of the highest oral disease rates in the world. A 1999 IHS survey found that 79 percent of Indian children 2-4 years old had a history of dental decay; 68 percent of adults had untreated dental decay; and 61 percent of elders had periodontal disease. 
   The dental specialists are a vital component in the IHS dental program. In addition to treating patients, they also train the general dentists for treating complex cases that arise daily in IHS hospitals and clinics. 
   I hope it is possible to provide additional support for the dental residency program so they can fill these vacancies before reaching crisis proportions.

   Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Once again this year, the bill before us is the result of a bipartisan atmosphere in the Energy and Water Subcommittee that has been fostered by Chairman Visclosky and Ranking Member Hobson. I want to thank both of them for the manner in which they approached the many issues before this committee and for producing a bill that will pass today, I believe, with little opposition. 
   First, the Energy and Water bill enjoyed unanimous support in the subcommittee and near unanimous support in the full committee for the balanced and thoughtful way in which it addresses the complex energy and water challenges facing this Nation. 
   Second, the bill makes tremendous investments in our Nation's critical science and energy-related programs. Third, the bill promotes two areas that I believe are critical to address the energy supply challenges we face, nuclear and alternative fuels, by employing the vast knowledge and expertise of our national labs that includes the Idaho National Laboratory which is in my district. 
   Finally, the bill continues its pressure on DOE to improve project management, contain costs and stick to schedules which are among DOE's most chronic and persistent problems. 
   In closing, I want to again recognize the bipartisan manner in which this bill was written and acknowledge the tremendous work of all the professional staff on this subcommittee. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this bill.

   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place into the RECORD a listing of Congressionally-directed projects in my home State of Idaho that are contained within the report to the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. I am grateful for their inclusion in this bill. 
   I'd like to take just a few minutes to describe why I supported these projects and why they are valuable to the Nation and its taxpayers. 
   The bill contains $900,000 for the City of Rocks Back Country Byway in my Congressional District. This 16.7 mile long project is located on the popular City of Rocks Back Country Byway in Cassia County, Idaho, and provides the only direct access to the City of Rocks National Reserve. When fully completed, the project will pave a 1.0 mile gravel segment, reconstruct 15.7 miles of deficient roadway, correct deteriorated road and slope conditions, provide a wider road with shoulders and guardrail, and improve the road's alignment by reducing the number and severity of sharp curves and steep grades. These improvements will increase safety for the driving public and provide safer access for bicycle and pedestrian traffic. These improvements will also significantly reduce the amount of on-going maintenance required to keep the route usable. This project has received Federal funding in previous years. This project was requested by the Idaho Transportation Department. 
   The report contains $300,000 for the I-84, Curtis Road to Broadway IC Widening. This project would widen I-84 through east Boise, adding eastbound and westbound fourth lanes. This widening is needed to alleviate congestion and safety issues caused by the continued fast growth in the Treasure Valley. This project was requested by the Idaho Transportation Department. 
   The report contains $500,000 for the Idaho Transit Coalition's program to improve bus and bus facilities all across the State of Idaho. The funding will assist Ada County Highway District's Commuteride, Boise State University, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, the City of Ketchum, the Ketchum/Sun Valley Transit Authority, KART, the City of Moscow, the City of Pocatello, the University of Idaho, and Valley Regional Transit. The majority of these projects are identified in the ``Idaho Statewide Public Transportation Needs and Benefits Study'' compiled by the Idaho Transportation Department in 1996 and subsequent local studies and plans. All projects are identified in the Transportation Improvement and the Statewide Transportation Improvement Plan. The current request represents only a small amount of what will be needed to maintain and expand Idaho's public transportation capital system to meet the demands of the State's rapidly growing population. This project has received federal funding in previous years. The funding was requested by the Idaho Transit Coalition.  
   The report contains $150,000 for the Historic Wilson Theater Restoration Project in Rupert, Idaho. The Wilson Theater was built in 1920 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Theater is also part of Rupert's Historic Business District. Rupert is a predominandy rural community that recently experienced the closure of its largest employer, Kraft Cheese. The restoration of this theater is one aspect of the community's effort to revitalize itself, attract new employers and generate interest in the community. The community thus far has raised over $1 million in private donations to restore the building, and federal funds will be only a small part of overall expenses. This project was requested by the non-profit Renaissance Art Center, Inc. in Rupert, Idaho. 
   The report contains $50,000 for the Custer County Economic Development Initiative in Custer County, Idaho. The vast size of Custer County presents enormous financial challenges for a county that is overwhelmingly owned by the federal government. Custer County has a very small tax base with very large costs for maintaining roads and service over a very large area. This funding will permit the county to purchase and renovate an old middle school in Challis that would become a government and business center housing the offices of the City, County, and Economic Development offices and making them ADA compliant. Additionally, funding would help to provide for improvements to a multi-government complex in the City of Stanley and the rodeo grounds in the City of Mackay. This project would relieve an enormous strain on the limited yearly budget of Custer County and allow it to more efficiently deliver services to residents and visitors alike. This project was requested by Custer County, Idaho. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally directed projects in my region and an explanation of my support for them: 1.) $150,000 for Historic Wilson Theater Restoration Project; Rupert, Idaho; 2.) $50,000 for Custer County Economic Development Initiative; Custer County, Idaho; 3.) $900,000 for City of Rocks Back Country Byway, Idaho; 4.) $500,000 for Idaho Transit Coalition buses and bus facilities; and 5.) $300,000 for I-84, Curtis Road to Broadway IC Widening, Boise, Idaho.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my concern with certain provisions of the Republican Budget Substitute Amendment offered by Representative RYAN. I strongly support the tax provisions included in the Ryan Amendment. Republican tax relief has led to unprecedented economic growth and dropped the unemployment rate. More importantly, tax relief gives back to Americans their own money. The robust economic growth in this Nation over the past few years is proof that individual Americans use and invest their dollars much more wisely than the Federal Government does. I am pleased that the Ryan Amendment makes the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 permanent and recognizes the reality of our Nation's fiscal situation by addressing the out-of-control growth of entitlement spending. 
   However, I want to make clear my views regarding certain budget process reforms included in the Ryan amendment. I am strongly opposed to giving any U.S. President the power to use a line item veto. Our Founding Fathers wisely attempted to curtail the power of each branch of the Federal Government by instituting a system of checks and balances. Granting the President additional power to veto specific portions of a bill instead of the bill as a whole cedes too much authority to the executive branch and could lead to unfair and unilateral power. I am very disappointed that the Ryan Amendment includes a provision granting the President this unconstitutional power. 
   While I strongly oppose the line-item veto provision and other attempts to reduce Congress's constitutional power of the purse included in the Ryan Amendment, it is clear to me that this proposal is preferable to an alternative that raises taxes by an average of $2,597 for each of my constituents.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place into the record a listing of Congressionally-directed projects in my home state of Idaho that are contained within the report to the FY08 Agriculture, Rural Development and FDA Appropriations bill. 
   I'd like to take just a few minutes to describe why I supported these projects and why they are valuable to the nation and its taxpayers. 
   First, the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) grants included below are targeted to our nation's Land Grant Colleges. In the case of Idaho, these funds are used by the University of Idaho to conduct research on a variety of crops important to the Pacific Northwest. I have also supported research in Washington and Oregon because their research is invaluable to my constituents as well. 
   In assessing the value of these requests, there are some important considerations that must be made. World labor standards and costs are far below those of the U.S. Our nation's farmers are subjected to far more stringent environmental regulations than those of many of our competitors. Input costs in the U.S. far surpass those of other nations. And energy prices, including farm diesel, are rising dramatically. 
   So how can a U.S. farmer remain competitive in a global market? He can do it by achieving greater productivity and efficiency, increased yields, and better defenses against diseases. These are the very things that agriculture research funding delivers for U.S. producers--and for U.S. consumers. 
   If you want to rely on foreign nations for our food in the way we rely on them for our oil, then by all means eliminate these important agriculture research programs. But if you believe, as I do, that maintaining a domestic capability to produce our food is a national security issue, then you ought to support these research programs and fight for their continuation. 
   The second entity that receives the bulk of these funds is the Agriculture Research Service (ARS) and its stations across rural America. In Idaho, these institutions are conducting vital research into some of our most important crops--sugar, potatoes, small fruits, and aquaculture. I encourage all of my colleagues to visit an ARS station to see firsthand the value of this research. If you do, you will learn that these researchers are doing amazing things with very limited budgets. These projects are usually small in terms of their funding, but the benefits that flow from that research cannot be measured in dollars alone. 
   Four of the projects below are funded through the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The first program, Potato Cyst Nematode (PCN) Detection and Eradication, provides funding that is critical to saving the potato industry, both in Idaho and across the nation. In August 2006, PCN was discovered in our country for the first time on approximately 1,000 acres in Eastern Idaho. PCN is a major pest of potato crops and is one of the most destructive and difficult pests to control. If left uncontrolled, this pest can result in devastating crop yield losses of up to 80 percent. Without this funding, the pest's significant risk of dispersion could lead to a devastating impact on our nation's agriculture production and exports. 
   The Greater Yellowstone Brucellosis funding is particularly critical to my home state of Idaho. Idaho recently regained its Brucellosis Class Free Status and these funds are critical to continuing a management plan that will allow Idaho to maintain brucellosis free status. 
   The Tri-State Predator control funding is hardly a handout to ranchers. The federal government forced wolf reintroduction on Idaho and other western states and it is duty-bound to pay for the deadly and gruesome impacts of this decision. 
   The funding for the Nez Perce Bio-Control Center will enable the Center to utilize organism-rearing technology to improve mass rearing capabilities for biological control organisms, thus providing long-term management of invasive weeds. 
   Another project on this list is the Idaho One-Plan. The Idaho One-Plan is a unique collaboration of agencies, industries, and associations dedicated to assisting Idaho farmers and ranchers in their continuing natural resource stewardship responsibilities. The program was developed jointly with state and federal resource agencies, the University of Idaho Cooperative Extension program, the Environmental Protection Agency, and local commodity groups. It's a successful program that has enormous value to not only the Idaho agriculture community and the environment, but to other states that might be interested in a similar collaborative process. 
   The final project is the Idaho Food Bank Facility Acquisition and Expansion Program. Currently, the Idaho Food Bank, located in Pocatello, Idaho, cannot process all of the donated food and often turns away delivery trucks and donations due to lack of space. An expansion of the food bank would allow more needy families in Eastern Idaho to utilize the food bank's services. 
   Mr. Chairman, any effort to remove these projects from the bill would not only result in zero savings to taxpayers, it would stop dead these important efforts to enhance and protect our nation's food supply. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my region and an explanation of my support for them.

Madam Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place into the record a listing of Congressionally-directed projects in my home state of Idaho that are contained within the report to the FY08 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill. 
   I'd like to take just a few minutes to describe why I supported these projects and why they are valuable to the nation and its taxpayers. 
   The report contains $300,000 for the Literacy Matters! Program administered by the Lee Pesky Learning Center in Boise. The Literacy Matters! Program is aimed at educating new mothers on the importance of early childhood literacy and math skills and providing them with resources for educating their children. The funding is used to provide every mother of a newborn in Idaho with a book created by the Lee Pesky Learning Center that helps them with teaching early literacy and math skills. The books are distributed through Idaho hospitals and the program has been highly successful. This is the second year of federal funding for the program. 
   This project was requested by the Lee Pesky Learning Center in Boise, Idaho. 
   The report contains $300,000 for the Idaho Caring Foundation's program to provide dental services to low-income, uninsured children who would otherwise have no access to such services. The program will provide access to needed dental care for 600 low-income, uninsured children throughout Idaho. Eligible children will be identified by working in partnership with Idaho schools, health departments, Head Start programs, and YMCA programs. Dental services will be provided by over 90 dentists who are Caring Foundation providers, providing oral health services for reduced fees. Federal funding is only a portion of the total costs of the program. As a dentist, I understand the importance of proper dental hygiene at a very young age. Serious health and self esteem problems can quickly evolve if dental hygiene is neglected early in a child's development. This is an outstanding program that enjoys my complete support. This is the second year of federal funding for the program. 
   This project was requested by the Idaho Caring Foundation in Boise, Idaho. 
   The report contains $250,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho's new facility. The funding will assist with efforts initiated by the Discovery Center and the J.R. Simplot Foundation to build a new model of a ``hands-on'' science center to captivate the attention of and inspire tomorrow's leaders and innovators. The 70,000 square foot Center will be founded on three core strengths, inspiring stories of innovation including Mr. Simplot's story, iconic collection of working steam tractors and DCI's expertise in igniting curiosity, through interactive science exhibits and programs. The center will be a resource for the region, with particular interest in serving rural areas to help break the myth that innovation is a new urban phenomenon--that ingenuity is found wherever and whenever an observant creative human being has a problem to solve. This is a tremendous opportunity to create a new approach to bridging the gap in science and technology education. The $250,000 federal investment is a very small portion of what is expected to be a $40,000,000 project. 
   This project was requested by the Discovery Center of Idaho in Boise, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for the College of Southern Idaho's Pro-Tech Training Program which partners with local agencies and companies to identify training needs in the community and provide for those needs by training talented Idaho students. The College partners with other agencies to identify training needs and to identify potential candidates for employment. The most recent of these ventures are the training programs that were established for Dell Computers and its call center in Twin Falls. In addition, data provided by Region IV of the Idaho Economic Development Agency indicate that manufacturing will be a leading employment area in the Magic Valley with over 250 new jobs expected over the next two years. 
   This project was requested by the College of Southern Idaho in Twin Falls, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for St. Luke's Hospital's Children's Health Services Expansion. The Children's Health Services Expansion project provides essential growth in capacity for Pediatric Medical/Surgical, Pediatric Intensive Care, Neonatal Intensive Care, Pediatric Oncology, and Pediatric Surgical Suites and support areas, to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population in the hospital's service area. The hospital is spending millions on the expansion and federal funds will represent only a small portion of the project's total costs. This is the fourth year of federal funding for this program. 
   The project was requested by St. Luke's Regional Medical Center in Boise, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for Teton Valley Hospital and Surgicenter's Revitalization Project. Teton Valley Hospital & Surgicenter, a 13-bed Critical Access Hospital, provides an emergency room and a full scope of primary care services to the residents in and around Teton Valley, a rural community of just over 7,000 residents, nestled against the Teton Mountains in Southeast Idaho and Western Wyoming. Its population has grown by more than 99% over the past 15 years, ranking it in the top two fastest growing counties in Idaho for the last six years. This population growth has seriously strained the resources of the hospital and necessitated the revitalization project. Federal funds represent only a portion of the project's total costs. 
   This project was requested by Teton Valley Hospital & Surgicenter in Driggs, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for Madison County Memorial Hospital. Madison County Memorial Hospital services a growing area encompassing five counties and quite simply has outgrown its facilities. Increased capacity for obstetrics (Madison County Memorial Hospital has more births than any other hospital of its size in the State of Idaho and possibly the nation) and inpatient and outpatient surgeries are needed. The size of this project is 70,000 sq. feet of new construction and 85,000 sq. feet of remodeling, with an overall budget of $49 million and an equipment budget of over $7 million. Federal funding will be used for necessary medical equipment for the expanded and remodeled facility and represents a very small portion of the overall funding for this project. 
   This project was requested by Madison County Memorial Hospital in Rexburg, Idaho. 
   The report contains $400,000 for a Community Detox Center in Boise, Idaho. The need for a detox facility is both pressing and long-standing. According to a 2002 study by Boise State University's Center for Health Policy, rates of drug and alcohol abuse are worse in the Treasure Valley than in the rest of Idaho. Over 17,000 individuals in Ada and Canyon Counties were deemed at-risk for substance dependence in 2000, and the region severely lacks beds for detox patients, particularly those on limited incomes. To fill this void, hospital emergency rooms are acting as de facto drug and/ or alcohol detox centers which adds to rising health care costs. The proposed facility is a 24-hour medically monitored alcohol and drug sobering station and 36-bed detox center for indigent patients treated by a professional, qualified staff. Typical stays for sobering will be 12 hours and typical stays for detoxification will be 5-6 days; following sobering and/or detoxification, patients will be referred to appropriate education and treatment programs. 
   This project was requested by the United Way of Treasure Valley in Boise, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for the Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory at Idaho State University. This funding will be used to develop an Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory (ACSL) to strengthen nursing education, practice and research in Idaho. The ACLS will enable students, faculty, and practice partners to become actively involved in clinical simulation learning and conducting research related to student learning, effectiveness of clinical education models and improving patient care outcomes. The ACSL will also provide a research and practice laboratory for nurse faculty and clinical educators to learn and update knowledge about clinical educational models and teaching with technology. 
   This project was requested by Idaho State University in Pocatello, Idaho. 
   The report contains $200,000 for Idaho SySTEMic Solution: Plant Early for STEM  Learning (science, technology, engineering, and math) at Boise State University. Idaho SySTEMic Solution is a nationally relevant, hands-on, project-based STEM learning system (science, technology, engineering, and math) designed to spur achievement and confidence among elementary-age learners and their teachers. Key project components will include: (1) a comprehensive teacher training model that includes a one-week summer institute and ongoing site-based follow-up training to boost the ability and confidence of elementary teachers; (2) implementation into demographically diverse schools (grades 1-5/6, urban to suburban to rural, multicultural) of curriculum-aligned learning lab systems that have been shown to improve student scores in math, science, and technology; and (3) research and evaluation of results in accordance with Idaho and national assessment standards to maximize the effectiveness of transplanting this solution to other U.S. states. 
   This project was requested by Boise State University in Boise, Idaho. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my region and an explanation of my support for them: (1) $300,000 for Early Literacy Matters, Lee Pesky Learning Center; (2) $300,000 for Idaho Caring Foundation Dental Project; (3) $200,000 for Children's Health Services Expansion; St. Luke's Regional Medical Center; (4) $400,000 for Community Detox Center, United Way of Treasure Valley; (5) $200,000 for Advanced Clinical Simulation Laboratory, Idaho State University; (6) $200,000 for Idaho SySTEMic Solution, Boise State University; (7) $200,000 for Madison County Memorial Hospital Revitalization Project; (8) $200,000 for College of Southern Idaho Pro-Tech Program, College of Southern Idaho; (9) $200,000 for Teton Valley Hospital Revitalization Project, Teton Valley Hospital; (10) $250,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho Expansion, Discovery Center of Idaho. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Chairman, I strongly support this bill to fund the departments of Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education. 
   I commend Chairman Obey and his staff on their hard work and dedication in putting together a bill that addresses the most pressing needs of American families, including their health and safety and the education of their children. I especially thank the Chairman for his efforts to increase funding for school counselors. This bill provides over $61 million for school counseling programs, a 77% increase over last year's funding. This historic investment will expand counseling in middle and high schools across the nation. 
   School counseling is a profession often treated as an afterthought in school improvement efforts. But counselors play a critical role, especially in high schools. High school is a transition period into adulthood and the world of work. As students make this transition, many lose their way and drop out. But a good counselor can help a student find the right path. No matter how many credits a student is behind or how many personal challenges she might face, counselors can help students at risk develop a plan, access the right help, and graduate on time. 
   Individual attention and follow-up from a counselor can help turn around students' lives. Additional counselors, particularly at the middle and high school levels, will be instrumental in helping schools improve their graduation rates and achieve other goals of No Child Left Behind. 
   Again, I thank the gentleman for his commitment to the education of our young people, and I encourage all my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, in accordance with House earmark reforms, I would like to place into the record a listing of the Congressionally-directed project in my home state of Idaho that is contained within the report to this bill. 
   The project provides $4 million within the Army Corps of Engineers Section 595 program for rural water infrastructure upgrades in Idaho communities. The funding was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act. 
   This funding is critical to assisting rural Idaho communities in upgrading their water and wastewater treatment facilities. In many cases, this funding is required to comply with unfunded mandates passed down by this Congress and federal agencies. 
   Perhaps the most striking example of why the federal government has a responsibility to assist these communities is the burden the EPA's revised arsenic standard is having across America. In addition, these funds help rural communities in Idaho trying to attract new businesses and spur economic development. The vital water funding in this bill will assist rural communities in job creation and affordable housing by offering improved services at lower costs than would otherwise be possible. 
   I'm proud to have obtained this funding for Idaho communities and look forward to working with them in the future to meet their water resource challenges. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my region and an explanation of my support for them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to congratulate the Boise State University Broncos football team on an exceptional football season and a great victory in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. 
   I listened with interest to the last resolution congratulating Florida and the Florida Gators and their national championship game. They truly deserved it. The Florida Gators went into the game against Ohio State as significant underdogs in the minds of most of the media, and so did the Boise State Broncos against the Oklahoma Sooners enter that game as significant underdogs. Nobody really gave them a chance.     
   But when the Broncos defeated the University of Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day, they completed the only, and I will repeat, the only undefeated season of any Division I-A collegiate football team in the 2006-2007 season. More than that, they showed the country what thousands of Boise State fans, known as the Bronco Nation, already know; the Boise State Broncos can play with the best. 
   Some have suggested that maybe Boise State doesn't have as tough a schedule as some other teams. I will tell you that on their schedule this year I think they played six teams that were in bowl games in post season. They had a pretty tough schedule, and they beat them all. 
   The 2007 Fiesta Bowl will go down in the books as one of the best and most exciting games in the history of college football. Both teams played with talents and heart, unwilling to let mistakes or shifts in momentum force their hands. And when, with only moments left in regulation, it looked like it was all over, the Broncos knew otherwise and turned to the back of their playbook. 
   Plays like the ``hook-and-lateral'' and the now famous ``Statue of Liberty'' required creativity, skill and guts. The talented Broncos executed them perfectly, winning the game in the heart-stopping last seconds of overtime. Head Coach Chris Peterson and his players should be commended for their courage, resolve and ability. 
   Last week Coach Peterson was awarded the Paul ``Bear'' Bryant Award and was named 2006 National Coach of the Year. He and his talented coaching staff will continue striving to make a winning program even better. 
   The BSU Bronco football program has taken gifted, big-hearted young men and created an impressive legacy in the making. The Broncos have won the last five consecutive Western Athletic Conference football championships and, with the Nation's top scoring Division I-A football team for the last seven seasons. 
   Their roster includes such talents as quarterback Jared Zabransky, the game's Offensive Most Valuable Player, who completed his college football career with a 33-5 record as starting quarterback; Marty Tadman, Defensive MVP of the game; and Ian Johnson, one of the Nation's most exciting running backs, who scored the game-winning two-point conversion in overtime, and after the game proposed to his fiancee, now a Boise State cheerleader. I don't know if I would have had that much courage, quite frankly, to propose to someone on national television. But it just shows the heart and courage of this team. 
   These stars are just a few examples of the determination, talent and heart that make up the whole Bronco football team. The entire team should be commended for both its success on the field and the character displayed by each individual. 
   The Boise State Broncos football team has made us proud; has made the State of Idaho, the City of Boise proud, and I am glad that we have this chance to recognize them today. 
   And in case anybody wonders if this is just about football, I will tell you, in talking to the President of the University, he said that after the Bronco season, the number of applications for the  postgraduate program has skyrocketed. So this is more than just about football. It is about national recognition for a team and a school, and the outstanding character of that school and the educational opportunities it provides to people from all over this country. 
   Madam Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to speak on this and for bringing this to the floor today. This Saturday they have a parade and a day of recognition for the Boise State team, and I am sure that they will be very honored to have this.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. 
   I have known DOC HASTINGS since I came here in 1999. He has always been kind of a mentor of mine, because we come from adjacent States, and a lot of the issues we deal with are similar. So I have consulted with him and sought his advice on many of the issues that affect our two States. We have done things together. I have known that he has served on the Ethics Committee, has been an honorable member of the Ethics Committee. 
   In fact, at times, we have been out doing a variety of things, whether it is out to dinner or out playing golf or something together, and there is always a case before the Ethics Committee which sometimes is of interest to other Members of the House. And I have inquired of him, how is that going, what is going on there in that case, or whatever. DOC has never failed to look at me and say, I can't talk about that. He has always kept the confidentiality of that committee on everything that has proceeded before it, and I respect him for that, even though many of us would like to know what is going on behind the closed doors. 
   Now, I am not an attorney, but I will tell you, I have been, when I served in the Idaho legislature as Speaker of the House, I care an awful lot about the institution. That is some of the debates we are currently having between the administration and the legislative branch and the rights and privileges of the institution in maintaining the rights and privileges of this institution. 
   So I care deeply about this institution and its future. It is one of the reasons that I had a problem with the legislation that was proposed last night on the ethics reform. As I said, I am not an attorney. What I rely on, and all of us become specialists in some areas when we come here, things that interest us, but what I rely on is the advice of other people. 
   When it comes to the advice of the Ethics Committee and what they do and the role they play and the impact that the legislation that was presented to us last night has, the impact that would have on the way our Ethics Committee works and the ethics of the House, I thought the information that was presented by DOC HASTINGS was not only important, it was vital to me being able to make a decision. And I think that type of information, as the  gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren) said, is vital to the debate on any issue that comes before the House. 
   How can we deny Members opinions from people who are experts in the area, whether we agree with them or not? I might have read all that and said, you know, that is interesting; I hadn't thought about that, but I disagree with that. But Members rely on other people's and experts' opinions on issues that come before the House. We have not only a right, we have an obligation to have that information if we are going to make informed decisions about issues that come before us. And certainly the ethics of this House and how we proceed is an issue for this House to deal with. 
   So, to suggest that somehow the information that DOC HASTINGS gave to the Members of this House so that they could weigh it in making a decision on the legislation presented to us last night was vital. 
   I was very, very disappointed to read what I took to be a threatening letter from the chairwoman of the Ethics Committee suggesting that Mr. Hastings had done something improper. I can find nothing improper that he did. In fact, what he did I thought was advance the debate. We happened to lose that debate last night. That is okay. That is the way the process worked. But to suggest that Members shouldn't have that information is a joke. And to then put out a letter saying that Congressman Hastings did something wrong, as has been mentioned several times, stains the reputation of this good man, and he deserves an apology from the Chair. And to suggest that if this happened again the chairwoman would sanction him brings into question her objectivity in judging him in the future, particularly if an ethics charge were charged against him. I agree with those who suggest that it may have placed in jeopardy her position as chairwoman of the committee. 
   So, I think at the very least she owes this good man from Washington, who has served us and those Members that serve on the Ethics Committee, an apology, and I hope that she would be big enough to apologize. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for the time that he has served on the Ethics Committee. It is kind of a standard joke around here that, yes, I am on the Ethics Committee. Do you want to be on it, because it is not one of those thankful positions to serve on in this House. 
   I thank you for the time you have served on that committee. It is a service to all of us and to this institution.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you, Chairman DeLauro, Ranking Member Kingston, and both of your respective staffs for all of the hard work that has been put in this bill, a bill I expect to support. 
   I would like to address an issue of great importance not only to my constituents, but to the Nation's agricultural industry. 
   In 2006, the potato cyst nematode was discovered in our country for the first time on approximately 1,000 acres in eastern Idaho. PCN is one of the most destructive potato pests, and if left uncontrolled, can result in devastating crop losses of up to 80 percent. 
   This spring, the USDA, the Idaho Department of Agriculture began an aggressive eradication program. Due to the confined area and early detection of the infestation, we are optimistic that the eradication program will prove successful. However, the funding level designated for the potato cyst nematode in this bill falls short of the necessary funding levels to continue this eradication effort. 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee on Agriculture recently recommended that this program be fully funded at $12.8 million. While I appreciate the constraints the House Agriculture Subcommittee has worked under, I hope that the chairwoman would work with me to try to find the necessary funds to fully fund this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today not because I want to take part in this debate, but because I am ashamed that this Congress is engaging in it at all. 
   I've heard a lot of posturing so far this week. I've heard a lot of hyperbole and a lot of revisionist history. I've also heard some things that just don't mesh with reality. I don't think that everything my colleagues say is completely honest. So for a moment, let's be honest--because that is the least we owe to our constituents and to the men and women who are fighting this war. 
   I am willing to admit that if Congress knew in 2002 what it knows today it might not have voted to authorize the war. Knowing that Saddam Hussein apparently did not have weapons of mass destruction, Congress might have preferred to contain him, perhaps bomb him, strengthen international sanctions, and work with our allies in the region to undermine his regime. 
   But we can't go back to 2002 and redo that vote. We have to deal with the situation that is currently before us. And what is before us right now is a Congressional resolution that undermines our troops while they are in the middle of fighting a war that Congress sent them to fight. I do not understand why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't see that. 
   For just a moment, I want to ask my colleagues to put themselves in the positions of the thousands of soldiers on the ground in Iraq. What would you think if you learned that the very people who sent you to fight this war are now saying that they don't support what you are doing? On the ground in Iraq, there are two things that keep you going: the thought of returning home to your family and the knowledge that you are doing something to protect your nation from terrorism. But if Congressional Democrats have their way today, they will take away from our soldiers the support of their Congress and of their country. What a terrible message to send to these brave soldiers. 
   For just a moment, put yourself in the shoes of the terrorists. What would you think when you heard the U.S. Congress is voting against the war? You would think you were winning. You would be encouraged by the news. You would think that everything Osama Bin Laden had said about Americans had been true all along. You would think that Americans cannot stand bloodshed and will cower from the fight. You would think that they don't have the stomach for a long-term battle and if the terrorists just hold on, the United States will eventually leave with its tails between its legs. What a terrible message to send at the exact moment that we are preparing to send more troops into battle. 
   At some point, my colleagues across the aisle have to let go of the fact that their newfound opposition to the War in Iraq is popular in their districts and act in the best interests for the future of our Nation. This resolution isn't a diversion, a side-show, or even a shot across the bow. It is a dangerous message to send. 
   I don't say any of this lightly and I don't say it for political reasons. I say it because I mean it. In 2006, I was the only Republican to vote against the rule when my party tried to embarrass Mr. MURTHA. Then, I thought that my party was playing games with the war and I refused to support that effort. Today, I think that the other party is playing games with the war and I refuse to have any part of this. 
   I would rather we consider a motion to pull all of our troops out of Iraq immediately than vote on this Democrat resolution that undermines our troops while at the same time puts them in harm's way. This resolution is the worst of all worlds. 
   My final thought today is that it is clear to many of us that this resolution is simply a Democratic attempt to embarrass President Bush. My friends across the aisle know they can not impeach him. They know they can not change the fact that many of them voted for the War in Iraq. And most of them recognize the dangers of voting to defund the war. So instead, they are trying to embarrass the President. 
   I say fine, embarrass the President. Send him a message that you are now in charge. Remind him that voters demanded change last November. Do whatever you need to do, but don't undermine our troops in the process. Leave them out of your plans for payback because they did nothing to attract your anger or frustration. 
   Madam Speaker, what we are doing today is wrong. We're better than this. We're smarter than this. We're above using the war, and our troops, for political gain. What the Democrats are doing with this resolution is not just intellectually dishonest, it is morally bankrupt.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (AGRICULTURAL DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND WESTERN STATES EMERGENCY UNFINISHED BUSINESS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate the gentleman yielding time, and I appreciate the leadership of the ranking member from California on this committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the difficulties we often have is you are tasked if you are a member of the party of the administration to sometimes defend the administration. But sometimes the administration, quite frankly, does things that are undefendable. If you read the statement of administration policy and what they would do and why they would veto this bill, I have got to tell you, I believe it is undefendable. 
   I want to thank Chairman Obey for recognizing that even in a time of war, not all emergencies are war-related, that unanticipated circumstances occur that require our attention. Unanticipated floods and droughts and hurricanes occur that require our attention. Unanticipated wildfires occur that require our attention. Unanticipated actions that are taken that  would impact our county schools and road budgets need to be taken into account. 
   If you read the administration's statement of administration policy, I want to read from it, if I could. 
   The Office of Management and Budget, Statement of Administration Policy. 
   The administration strongly supports efforts to increase opportunities for America's farmers and ranchers in rural communities. However, H.R. 2207 would allow almost $7 billion in unrequested spending that is unjustified and not appropriate for an emergency spending bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that if you look at the funding in this bill, it is exactly what emergency spending is for. As an example, if you look at what we have done in the agricultural section of this bill; we have had droughts, we have had problems in the agricultural community. And while the administration talks about how good the ag economy is and how good the 2001 farm bill worked, and that the ag economy is up like $16 billion in income this year, the fact is that, in isolated cases and in isolated situations, you have disasters, you have floods, you have droughts. We have a responsibility to help those people. That's what an emergency is. I don't think the administration recognizes that. 
   When you have wildfires that occur throughout this country that are more than we anticipate, and if you will look at the news any given night, wildfires are occurring now in California and other places, we have to put out those wildfires. If we don't, the costs grow and become enormous. 
   If you look at the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, I don't know if most people understand what that is. Counties used to get a part of the timber sales to help fund their roads and their schools. Timber sales were being reduced so much that those funds were drying up and it was affecting those counties that were predominantly rural counties and had many public lands in them. Mr. Thompson said he has one that is 80 percent Federal land. I've got one that is 96 percent Federal land. 
   What we did was we put this into place 10 years ago. The problem was it said that we will wean the schools off of this and find a way to replace those funds. How do you replace those funds if you are a county that is 96 percent Federal land? You have no private land for taxes. How are they going to find the resources to replace that funding? 
   So we did it in the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Now, the administration says they have come up with a perfectly reasonable alternative to fund this, an offset, if you will. They want to sell public lands. They proposed that last year, selling nearly 250,000 acres in Idaho. The people of this country stood up and rejected that idea. The people of this country do not want to willy-nilly sell public lands. 
   We have a responsibility, when the Federal Government owns an overwhelmingly majority of public lands in a lot of the western States, 64 percent in Idaho, we have a responsibility to help those counties with some of the funds where they don't have the tax base to address these needs themselves. Otherwise, you are going to have schools that, quite frankly, don't have a budget next year. Is it an emergency? Can we wait until 2008? I don't think so. They start school before that, and we have to address it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the fact that the administration is trying to address the deficit, but to suggest that these needs are nonemergency, that we should be able to anticipate them, I think is just wrong. 
   I hope my colleagues will vote for this bill. And again, I thank the chairman of the committee. I thank the ranking member of the committee for the work that they do. It is always difficult when you are trying to address both the deficit and the needs of this country, and they do a very, very good job of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SIMPSON. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Speaker, in accordance witt House earmark reforms, I would like to place in the Record a listing of the congressionally-directed projects I have requested in my home State of Idaho that are contained in the report of H.R. 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2009 Appropriations Bill. 
   I'd like to take just a few minutes to describe why I support these projects and why they are valuable to the Nation and its taxpayers. 
   The report contains $4,000,000 in the NPPD Infrastructure Protection and Information Security account for the Power and Cyber Systems Protection, Analysis, and Testing Program at the Idaho National Laboratory. The program would conduct vulnerability analysis, testing, and protection of power and cyber connected systems for the Department of Homeland Security, utilizing the unique resources available at the Idaho National Laboratory, such as the electric grid, SCADA and control systems, cyber and communication test beds, and the explosives test range. The proposed work entails collaboration with leading universities and other National Laboratories to leverage ongoing research at these institutions and advance the state-of-the-art in building resilience into infrastructure systems. The funding would be used to obtain full-scale systems in sectors of interest to DHS for testing of vulnerabilities, identification of protection strategies, and evaluation of resilient designs; partner with universities and National Laboratories to develop resilient control systems; and establish a program that develops new protection schemes. The INL is uniquely placed to carry out this program, which would leverage its ongoing work in this area sponsored by DoD, DHS, and Intelligence Agencies and its established relationships with industry, universities, and National Laboratories. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is the Idaho National Laboratory, located at 2525 North Freemont St., Idaho Falls, Idaho 83415. 
   The report contains $1,600,000 in the Defense Production Act Purchases account for the Read Out Integrated Circuit (ROIC) Manufacturing Improvement. The United States Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency have been investigating ways to improve manufacturing capabilities and improve cryogenic and  radiation performance of these circuits. The thermal imagers of the future will operate in harsh environmental conditions for longer periods of time and will have increased resolution (through increased pixel count) over the detectors of today. Maintaining a domestic source of this technology as well as working to enhance the manufacturing capabilities of this critical technology are equally as important as increasing the yield. Funds for this project will be used to establish a long-term, known U.S. source; improve yields both by the manufacturer and by the vendors who use the contractor as a manufacturing source; decrease the cycle time required in manufacturing ROICs and a reduction of design cycle time by ROIC designers; and provide a roadmap to meet the future needs of the ROIC designers. When the program is completed, ROICs will be available with twice the number of pixels for less money than the ROIC currently costs. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is ON Semiconductor, located at 2300 Buckskin Rd., Pocatello, Idaho 83201. 
   The report contains $1,600,000 in the Medical Advanced Technology account for the Integrated Patient Quality Program. To directly enhance the patient-provider encounter, the Integrated Patient Quality Program will identify the degree to which physicians utilize consumer content integrated into the DoD Electronic Medical Record (AHLTA) and provide after-visit summaries to patients, and identify the impact this critical medical information has on patients' health and their ability to make informed decisions. This phase of the project will build upon the requirements' definition and technical feasibility study performed within FY08 funding that developed a functional and technical road map, and successfully tested the Integrated Patient Quality concept in a development environment. Additionally, the Integrated Patient Quality Program will explore content delivery options outside of the patient-provider face-to-face interaction to include: secure provider/patient e-mail, online laboratory results, pre-visit/test preparation, surgical decision support, and disease management to at-risk patients. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Healthwise, Incorporated, located at 2601 N. Bogus Basin Road, Boise, Idaho 83702. 
   The report contains $2,000,000 in the Support Systems Development account for the Accelerator-Driven Non-Destructive Testing. The Idaho Accelerator Center (lAC) proposes to continue development of penetrating and nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques utilizing new techniques in positron annihilation spectroscopy with accelerator-based gamma-beams, and the use of monochromatic x-ray beams that are produced by colliding high-power laser beams with high-energy electron beams. Both of these core technologies have been under development at the lAC for several years and have matured to the point that serious in-field commercialization is possible. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Idaho State University, located at 921 South 8th Avenue, Pocatello, Idaho 83209. 
   The report contains $1,440,000 in the Electronics Technology account for the 3-D Technology for Advanced Sensor Systems Project. The military has a need for new three-dimensional (3-D) packaging of electronic systems, particularly sensor systems for portable applications. The team of Boise State University and RTI International has developed 3-D processing techniques on silicon and LTCC platforms, including technologies for die- and wafer-scale bonding and 3-D interconnects. These funds will allow them to apply these techniques to create 3-D integration and packaging solutions applicable to a general category of high performance sensor systems. These funds will be used to support summer salaries for faculty, and provide salaries for research staff, post-doctoral associates, graduate and undergraduate students. Research supplies, capital equipment, and travel will be funded as required to support the objectives of the project. This request is 
   consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Boise State University, located at 1910 University Drive, Boise, Idaho 83725-1135. 
   The report contains $1,200,000 in the Critical Infrastructure Protection account for the Electric Grid Reliability/Assurance project. The effort will operationalize advanced electric grid modeling simulation and analysis capability that links disparate critical infrastructure sector models that run simultaneously and dynamically to share information providing greater understanding of critical infrastructure status before, during or after a destructive event. Funds will be used for the enhanced development of electric grid modeling, simulation and testing capabilities at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Incorporation of both real-time and distributed system modeling capabilities will provide expanded capabilities for analysis of systems critical to DoD. These efforts will provide DoD an enhanced capability to simulate, prove and make recommendations for techniques to sustain mission operations via continued power generation when power from the electric utilities is no longer present. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Idaho National Laboratory, located at P.O. Box 1625, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83415. 
   The report contains $1,200,000 in the Advanced Electronics Technologies for the Hybrid Power Generation System. Research has resulted in a breakthrough technology using compressed magnetic fields which can generate power. The continued research, development, testing and validation of the technology should result in mission extension for dismounted soldiers and considerable savings by reducing the reliance on disposable batteries. Approximately $57,000 is being spent per soldier, per year on batteries alone in theatre. This technology will not only reduce Federal spending needed for such batteries, but will considerably reduce related military logistics costs, reduce the amount of hazardous waste disposal costs (for the toxic substances used in battery materials), and will reduce the man/machine interface by reducing the 20-30 lbs of extra batteries soldiers are currendy required to carry for extended missions. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is M2E Power, Inc., located at 875 W. McGregor Court, Suite 150 Boise, Idaho 83705. 
   The report contains $3,200,000 in the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Account for the Vacuum Sampling Pathogen Collection and Concentration project. Production and commercialization potential of the recently completed basic wet-vacuum pathogen collection system will be further enhanced through completion and integration of current prototype-stage ``sister'' technologies. The combined systems will provide safer, more accurate and faster sample collection and processing capabilities with GPS-RFID sample site documentation and sample identification, plus handling, transport and lab traceability. Current outsourced production activities will be centralized through expanded in-house production facilities for more stringent cost, QC and delivery schedule management and control. Integrated technology systems will improve safety, accuracy and standardization of bio-agent detection methods for our soldiers and civilian end users. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Microbial-Vac Systems, Inc., located at 160 Bridon 
   Way, Jerome, Idaho 83338. 
   The report contains $3,200,000 in the Advanced Spacecraft Technology account for the Ultra Low Power Electronics. Ultra-Low Power (ULP) Electronics is an Air Force Research Lab-sponsored initiative working in collaboration with industry to develop electronics that require less power and provide increased efficiency. A key challenge for DoD electronics applications is the reduction of power consumption in the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)--the technology platform used for advanced integrated circuits. Funding in 2009 will develop a high OPS/Watt ULP platform solution for DoD designers of electronic systems and demonstrate a base technology that can be rapidly scaled to meet general ULP industry requirements for portable electronics. The project is an iterative, multi-lot, fabrication research and development effort that includes design tool and model development necessary to deploy the new technology. A viable scaling method for reducing electronic voltage requirements and the associated ULP products will define an alternative CMOS scaling roadmap specific to portable technology. This program will establish a new technical approach and industrial capability for U.S. electronics. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is American Semiconductor, Inc., located at 3100 S. Vista Ave., Ste 230 Boise, Idaho 83705. 
   The report contains $800,000 in the New Design Ssn Account for the Highly Corrosive-Resistant Alloy Joining for Nuclear Applications. This funding will be used to develop and test novel prototype design-for-manufacturing methods, flexible automated welding and inspection technology for application in submarine nuclear reactor propulsion systems. The research will result in new joining techniques to shape highly corrosive-resistant alloys to meet the requirements of underwater power generation and radiation containment. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is Premier Technology, located at 1858 W. Bridge Street, Blackfoot, Idaho 83221. 
   The report contains $1,800,000 in the Air Force Military Construction Account for the Mountain Home AFB Logistics Readiness  Center. The Existing Logistic Supply is a condemned 53-year-old wooden structure beyond economical repair. The building had to be evacuated and now 60% of base supply functions operate from temporary spaces across base, creating significant delays in troop/equipment mobilization. This negatively impacts the Wing's ability to demolish and relocate from other substandard facilities on base. When funded, the Logistics Readiness Center will provide command and control for all materials in-bound and outbound, including freight processing, packing, crating, pallet buildup shop, and provide bulk and bin storage. The facility will also support secure storage and an armory and will include administrative areas. This request is consistent with the intended purpose of this account. 
   The entity to receive funding for this project is the 366th Wing, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, located at 366 Gunfighter Avenue, Ste. 107, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho 83648. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to provide a list of Congressionally-directed projects in my district and an explanation of my support for them.
