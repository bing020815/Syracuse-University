   Mr. LINDER. As a matter of fact, I was in the Chair and I was accused of shutting down the vote while people were in the well seeking to vote. And the next day the C-SPAN tapes proved you were wrong and I was right. The people coming in to vote were not even not only in the well, they were not even on the floor. They were shouting ``one more.'' But Dick Armey reviewed the tapes to critique me and concluded that you were wrong and I was right.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I was a friend of Charlie's for over 30 years. We met in the early 1970s when he was the president of the Georgia Dental Association and I was a practicing dentist and a young State legislator. 
   Charlie never ever was in neutral, and he rarely ever backed up. It was full go ahead. The great story about him in the Army was he changed the way they were doing business, moving dentists to forward-fire bases. His commander called him and said, I want a daily report of what you are doing there that is out of the ordinary. Charlie said to him, Well, I have got a chair here. You come down here and set your own butt on it and write your own report. I just don't have time. The colonel did come down, and they changed the entire way the Army did business because of Charlie's ideas. 
   When he got involved shortly thereafter in the Georgia Dental Association, he did the same thing. He just took charge and became president. He traveled all over the State of Georgia fighting for important things for patients' welfare. His campaign in 1994 was a joy to watch, just a joy to watch, yard signs everywhere and him moving as fast as he could from one house to the next, from one hand to the next. He was just a remarkably good campaigner. 
   Then he came here and he introduced a very important bill. I didn't agree with him on the bill, but he didn't slow down at all. 
   The fact that the House and the Senate did not sign the patients' bill of rights did not mean it wasn't important. The changes it brought in the relationships between HMOs and patients are there today because of the pressure of that legislation and will be there forever. Charlie was a remarkable human being and one whom I have loved for a very long time and will miss.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, today, I want to pay tribute to the United States Air Force, on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary. This special day provides us with an important opportunity to recognize and honor the men and women who have made our Nation's Air Force the greatest air power in the world. As a former Captain in the U.S. Air Force myself, I shared a willingness to protect and defend the United States of America with all my fellow airmen and airwomen. 
   On September 18, 1947, the National Security Act of 1947 was enacted, and the U.S. Air Force was officially formed. Although it is the newest unit of the four military branches, the U.S. Air Force has rapidly evolved into a segment of our armed services that embodies the fundamental core values and aptitude of our Nation's military foundation. 
   In the fifth century B.C., Chinese military theorist Sun Tzu said that the ``The art of employing troops is that when the enemy occupies high ground, do not confront him.'' Drawing on the teachings of Sun Tzu and nineteenth century military historian and theorist Carl von Clausewitz, military leaders over the past 200 years have sought to perfect their craft in warfare. Until the 20th century, however, the might of a country's military forces was still incomplete. While nation-states throughout the world had successfully developed their ground and sea forces, it was not until the advent of aircraft that the nature of warfare would be altered dramatically and permanently, thus finally permitting our armed services to confront the enemy on high ground. 
   Still, it took time to develop the technology and practice of air power so that it matched its theoretical potential. Even though the technology for capable air power existed for the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam and Korean wars, the United States had not developed the capability of air power thoroughly enough to derive full benefit from its use until the Gulf War. 
   Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel John Warden, the initial architect of the gulf war's air campaign, ``Instant Thunder,'' once theorized that the most important effect that air power would have in war would be its ability to destabilize the will and morale of the enemy's military leadership. The use of American air power in the gulf war and Operation Iraqi Freedom successfully proved Colonel Warden's theory true.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this political effort to fix prices. Dr. Milton Friedman spoke on this issue 31 years ago. He noted that the proponents of increasing the minimum wage are well-meaning do-gooders, but they are playing politics with people's futures. 
   These ideas always have two groups of sponsors, the well-meaning do-gooders and the special interests who are using the do-gooders as front men. 
   Since there is absolutely no positive objective achieved by a minimum wage other than costing beginning workers their jobs, the real purpose is to reduce competition for unions so that it is easier to maintain the wages of their privileged members higher than the others. 
   The minimum wage says that employers must discriminate against those with low skills. If you have a job that is worth $5 an hour, you may not employ that person. It is illegal. 
   So who pays? The 1981 Minimum Wage Study Commission concluded that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduced teenage employment by 1 to 3 percent. From 1981 to 1990, the minimum wage did not rise, and teen unemployment fell from 25 percent to 15 percent. After the 1990 increase, teen unemployment rose to more than 20 percent. The 46 percent rise between 1977 and 1981 cost 644,000 jobs among teens alone. 
   Who else pays? Small business. A small business with five minimum wage positions would face more than $21,000 in additional wage costs. That does not include increases in payroll and unemployment taxes nor wage demands from other employees looking to stay ahead of the minimum wage. For many businesses, small businesses, a higher minimum wage simply equates to a major tax hike. That is what this is.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (CHARLIE W. NORWOOD LIVING ORGAN DONATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   I rise in support of the underlying legislation, and in support of the memory and legacy of its author, my friend and colleague, Charlie Norwood. 
   Many people may remember the story of Nicholas Greene, the 17-year-old boy who was killed during a family vacation in Italy. The tragic and sudden loss of this young boy was turned into a story of hope and love when his parents generously donated his organs. Out of his tragic death sprang life, as seven people received Nicholas' heart, liver, kidneys, corneas, and pancreatic cells. 
   If there is one lesson we can take from Nicholas' great gift to the world and from the strong humanitarian legacy of Charlie Norwood, it is that we must support life whenever we have that opportunity. 
   H.R. 710 specifically excludes kidney-paired donation from the National Organ Transplant Act's valuable consideration clause. The valuable consideration clause has a noble purpose, which is to keep people from buying and selling human organs. In the case of kidney-paired donation, which is held to the highest of medical ethical standards, that purpose is obstructing the ability to save lives. By supporting this bill, we can give countless people a better chance for survival. 
   Let me be clear: paired-organ donation does not constitute the buying or selling of organs. If we believe as much, then we accept the idea that the gift of life has a monetary value. Charlie vehemently opposed this concept, and so should we.  
   Thousands of people die each year waiting on a transplant list, praying for the right match for a kidney. Paired donation will significantly increase the number of available kidneys each year, allowing even more people to live productive, healthy lives. 
   H.R. 710 honors the memory of our friend Charlie Norwood, it honors the memory of Nicholas Greene and his family, and it honors all those Americans who have lost their lives while waiting on a transplant list. As such, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this critically important vehicle for giving the gift of life to others.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In January of 2005 University of Florida scientist Michael Atkinson, a gene therapy advocate, said: ``Two years ago, the embryonic stem cell field was hype, hype, hype. It is still that way in California, but I think that field has hit a bit of a wall.'' 
   Why? Because after 25 years of animal research, embryonic stem cells have produced not one single instance of cure or even a palliative result. Not one. 
   They have produced some results, though. Their versatility is now believed to be a disadvantage. As explained in a letter to Senator JOHN KERRY, signed by 57 noted scientists in the fields of biology, microbiology, chemistry and medicine, they said: ``Embryonic stem cells are difficult to develop into a stable cell line. They spontaneously accumulate genetic abnormalities in culture and are prone to uncontrollable growth and tumor formation when placed in animals.'' 
   Why is this such an important issue for politicians? Why don't we pay some attention to what does work? 
   Multipurpose adult progenitor cells have been or are being assessed in human trials for treatment of spinal cord injury, Parkinson's, stroke, cardiac damage, multiple sclerosis and more. These cells can be taken from the patient so they have no risk of rejection and no ethical problems.

   Mr. LINDER. Would you tell me who changed the ruling from ``appeal'' to ``sustain''? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair would advise the gentleman from Georgia the question on appeal is, as always in the Committee of the Whole, ``Shall the decision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Committee?'' 
   The Chair understands that the display board initially said ``appealing the ruling of the Chair,'' which was incorrect. So for the information of all Members of the House, in case of any misapprehension, the question is on sustaining the ruling of the Chair, not on whether an appeal shall take place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, about 2 years ago, the Government Accountability Office brought before the Ways and Means Committee a study that said if we continue to tax at the current percentage of the economy and continue to spend in discretionary spending at the current percentage of the economy that just 33 years from today the entire Federal revenue stream will be insufficient to just pay the interest on the debt. 
   I know the Democrats will say raise taxes. In 100 percent of the time in the last 60 times that we have raised taxes, we have slowed the economy and slowed revenues. 
   This Congress will not reduce spending. So what is their solution to our dilemma? The problems are, as the GAO said, three entitlement programs, Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid. They propose to give us another one, with no caps, expanding coverage to illegal immigrants, by the language from the CBO, expanding coverage to adults with no children, by the definition of their act, and allowing the States to lift the ceiling on eligibility entirely. 
   This is a back-door or front-door entrance for Hillary care, national health care. You will recall that in that program if a doctor treated a patient for free outside the system, they are liable for criminal fines. That isn't in this bill, yet.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLIE NORWOOD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding his time. 
   I met Charlie Norwood over 30 years ago. We were both young dentists in Georgia. He was the president of the Georgia Dental Association, and I was a young, newly elected dentist in the Georgia legislature. And his enthusiasm blew me away. Irrespective of what he was talking about, he only had two gears: neutral and full speed ahead. And his enthusiasm would capture you. And the bulldoggedness, the way he would put his teeth on an issue and fight for it without ever backing up was astonishing to me. Charlie did not have a coy bone in his body. From the day you met Charlie, you knew what he stood for on whatever the issue was. 
   Respectfully, he and I differed on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We spent many hours talking about it. He was adamant that I was wrong and he was right. But at no point did he ever raise his voice or show any disrespect for a position that I had taken that was different from his. 
   Charlie loved this institution. He loved the give-and-take of it. He loved the formality of it. We talked one day if he ever had any notion of running for the Senate, and he said he would never survive there. He would never survive not getting something done every day. 
   He treated this institution that he loved with great dignity. When he fought his fights, you knew he was going to fight fair. And for 30-plus years when I have been able to visit with him or know him on this issue or that, I always walked away from each encounter saying what a nice man, what a nice man. 
   For Gloria and the family, you are in our prayers. A psalmist has written that the Lord is close to the broken-hearted, and those who are crushed in spirit He saves. 
   May God give you peace.

<DOCNO>Mr. LINDER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   It has been interesting to listen to this debate over several days. Two thoughts stand out. One side says nonbinding resolutions achieve nothing and insult the troops. The other side has retired to opinion polls. The American people want to end this cost of human and financial treasure. They said so in the last election. 
   Thank God John Adams never consulted public opinion polls. There was never a time when more than a third of our Nation was in favor of independence and freedom. Thomas Paine said, ``If there must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have peace.'' 
   World War I was not America's war, no one attacked us; but an attack was made on freedom, and we responded. The doubters wondered why we would spend money on a war so far from our shores which didn't threaten us. The doughboys at Vimmy Ridge knew why they were there. 
   Hitler didn't attack us, he didn't even threaten us; he threatened all that freedom meant to the world. And while we were engaged in Southeast Asia after Pearl Harbor, we still sent troops across the channel on D Day. Many mistakes were made. Troops drowned before getting to the beach. Support aircraft bombed the wrong areas. 9,386 Americans died in the Battle of Normandy and are buried there on that hill. 
   But the Boys of Pointe Du Hoc climbed that ridge under withering machine gun fire. They silenced the machine guns, took out the embankments and walked across Europe, and in 11 months Europe was free. We then spent billions of dollars to rebuild a free Europe. 
   After World War II, we spent 50 years in a war against an idea. It was a battle of the two great religions, communism and freedom. When Whittaker Chambers left communism for freedom, he told his wife that he feared that he was moving to the losing side. He knew that communism could not survive if its people believed in a higher faith; he concluded that freedom could not survive if they did not. He had become a believer; he was unsure if we remained believers. 
   Many of those Cold War years were not pretty. Between 1970 and 1980, the Soviets increased their influence in Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Nicaragua, Grenada, Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, South Yemen, Libya, Iraq and Syria. We watched and were timid. We even had Members of this very body go to some of those nations' dictators to apologize for our defense of what we believed; we believed in freedom. 
   When Israel watched its athletes murdered at Munich, we urged caution. When terrorists continued to kill Israelis, we continued to urge caution. For 21 years we urged that great friend of ours not to respond in kind. We were timid. After the attacks began against America, beginning with the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centers, we remained timid. We chose not to engage all of the opportunities we had to be bold. In the face of a declared war against our government and our people, we were timid. 
   And then September 11, 2001. We stood together on the Capitol steps in solidarity that lasted a good week, and then it became politics as usual. 
   I don't know if this fight for freedom can succeed when about half of our Nation doesn't know we are in it; nor do I know whether our Nation can come to an honest conclusion about what we are engaged in when all they see is the worst side of everything. 
   When I was last in Iraq, a young man told me about going through a city and all the residents came forth to say thank you and throw flowers. He asked the embedded reporter if that was worth a picture; he was told, ``That's not news.'' I don't know how the whole story gets told. 
   I do know this: This President knows that he and his commanders have made some wrong decisions, but he knows, as we must know, that this war has always been about the principle, the virtue, the idea of freedom, and to walk away now will have catastrophic consequences for its future. 
   President Bush believes that our Nation, more than any other, ought to defend the right of people to live free. That is the only victory we can ever have over an ideology that cannot survive in a free society. 
   President Bush knows why Lincoln said that he often found himself on his  knees because there was nowhere else to go.     
   He also knows, as did Lincoln, that a President must continue to fight for posterity, even when it becomes unpopular to do so. 
   If you believe, as I do, that the idea of freedom is still worth defending, you will vote against this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LINDER. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In 1928, two gentlemen in Congress by the names of Smoot and Hawley drafted a bill to reduce tariffs to broadly increase markets, particularly for farmers. And after 4 years, it became not a tariff reduction bill, but a tariff increase bill. And all our trading partners responded in kind, leaving us a dust bowl in the ``Grapes of Wrath.'' 
   If you don't think they're going to respond in kind to this, you're nuts. Toyota is not located in Barbados. Honda is not located in the Caribbean islands. These companies pay huge American taxers and hire millions and millions of our neighbors. They sell product in this country, they sell product for dollars. And the only value that dollar has for them is to spend it in a dollar-denominated economy, and they spend in America and they buy companies. 
   If you don't believe that this 4 to $6 billion tax increase on foreign capital is going to cause a response, you're simply not paying attention to history. 
   Vote this tax increase down.
