<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR MIDWESTERN FLOOD VICTIMS -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 657 was introduced by Mr. Walz of Minnesota on September 17, 2007. The resolution expresses the heartfelt sympathy of the House of Representatives for the victims of severe flooding in the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin during August of 2007. These storms took the lives of 14 people, injured countless others, and damaged or destroyed thousands of homes and devastated businesses and institutions. 
   In addition, this resolution conveys gratitude to local, State and Federal officials and emergency personnel who responded swiftly to the crisis. Their selfless actions saved lives and helped their communities in their efforts to recover from this disaster. 
   Additionally, this resolution is a fitting commendation to the generous and selfless support of local citizens, businesses and volunteer organizations. They have shown their heroism and compassion for their fellow citizens while facing such destruction.  
   The citizens of the States of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin will work hard to rebuild and make every effort to ensure the recovery of their communities. In recognition of their efforts, this resolution reaffirms our support to help the victims of the flooding rebuild their homes and lives. I extend my heartfelt sympathy to all those affected by this tragedy, and to their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3068, introduced by Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton, adds an additional level of security to our Federal buildings by prohibiting the Federal Protective Services from awarding contracts to convicted felons. 
   I would like to commend Chairwoman Norton for her commitment to the security of Federal buildings, government employees and visitors. She probably has more than anybody else in the House. 
   The protection of the employees and visitors at Federal buildings remains a high priority. This legislation will increase the standards of safety and security for Federal properties across this country. 
   The Federal Protective Service serves as one of the first lines of defense for our Federal buildings. We entrust the security of Federal courthouses and buildings and their employees and visitors to FPS personnel. From day-to-day security screening, to protection from riots and terrorist attacks, the FPS force plays a vital role in facilitating the work of the Federal Government. 
   The Federal Protective Service employs more than 1,000 trained employees and more than 15,000 contract security guards. H.R. 3068 prohibits FPS from contracting with security firms that are owned or operated by convicted felons. It's a very simple measure. The security of Federal buildings must be managed by those that have the best interests of the American people in mind. 
   This legislation will ensure the integrity of the forces protecting our Federal buildings, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3068. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a fantastic idea, and again, I want to applaud Chairwoman Norton for the work that she's done on this, again, to push it through. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (GERALD W. HEANEY FEDERAL BUILDING AND UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE AND CUSTOMHOUSE -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Though many have made light of the schedule we have had for the past few weeks, the grueling schedule of naming a lot of Federal buildings, it doesn't mean that any of these individuals are any less deserving or should not be honored. 
   Today in committee in the Transportation Committee, we named a courthouse in Missouri, my home State, after Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Sr., who practiced law in the State of Missouri for over 80 years and was highly revered. Today on the floor, we are honoring somebody that, going through his accomplishments and what he has done in life, is somebody that truly should be recognized. 
   H.R. 187, which was introduced by Representative Oberstar of Minnesota, chairman of the Transportation Committee, designates the Federal building and the United States courthouse and customhouse at 515 West First Street in Duluth, Minnesota, as the Gerald W. Heaney Federal Building and United States Courthouse and Customhouse. The building honors Judge Heaney's dedication to public service. 
   As the gentleman from Minnesota pointed out, he served with great distinction during the Army in World War II and acquired a law degree from the University of Minnesota law school after his time. Judge Gerald W. Heaney engaged in private practice then just after the war, from 1946 to 1966. 
   Judge Heaney's career as a judge began then in 1966 with an appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Judge Heaney had a reputation for championing equal justice for underprivileged and vulnerable citizens. Judge Heaney retired after 40 years of service on August 31, 2006. 
   I support this legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (REPEALING PROHIBITION ON USE OF CERTAIN FUNDS WITH RESPECT TO LOS ANGELES TO SAN FERNANDO VALLEY METRO RAIL PROJECT, CALIFORNIA -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 238 repeals a 21-year-old prohibition on the use of Federal transit funds to tunnel in the San Fernando Valley area west of Los Angeles. 
   In 1985, an explosion of naturally occurring methane gas blew up a department store in the Wilshire Boulevard Corridor in Los Angeles, injuring 22 people. As the gentleman from Minnesota aptly pointed out, concerned about the safety of tunneling in the area of Los Angeles, the city council created a task force to investigate the explosion. The task force identified methane risk zones along the Wilshire Boulevard Corridor. 
   The fiscal year 1986 transportation appropriations bill included a legislative provision that prohibits the use of Federal transit funds associated with the Los Angeles project for tunneling in or through an identified methane risk zone. The appropriations provision was written very broadly, binding future funds provided by Congress and affecting all parts of the Metro Rail subway project, including future extensions. The prohibition prevented any transportation planners in the Los Angeles area from considering any transportation improvements that might involve tunneling in the very broadly congested Wilshire Boulevard Corridor. 
   For me, Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill to be passed simply highlights the dangers of legislating an appropriations bill. H.R. 238 undoes something that should never have been done in the first place. In November 2005, a panel of engineering experts reported that tunneling along the Wilshire Boulevard Corridor can be done safely if proper procedures and appropriate techniques are used. 
   This bill, H.R. 238, will repeal the current prohibition on tunneling in that corridor. This legislation was first introduced by Congressman Waxman in December of 2005 as H.R. 4653 and was passed by the House in September of 2006. However, the Senate failed to act on the legislation, which is the reason we are back here on the floor today. 
   I do support H.R. 238, and I urge its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I would first like to thank Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Chabot from the Small Business Committee for moving forward with this bill. This bill is critically important to small businesses and innovation in this country. 
   The SBA provides startup funding to small businesses in a variety of ways. One such program is the Small Business Innovative Research program, or SBIR, which allocates a specific percentage of Federal research and development grant monies to small business applicants. This program allows for cutting-edge innovative research that may not, in its earliest stages, attract funding from other sources. I strongly believe in the SBIR program and what it does for small businesses. 
   American innovation is what drives this country and economy. As Members of Congress, we need to create an environment that will keep American innovation at the forefront of the global market. 
   As a member of the Small Business Committee, I work to advocate on behalf of small businesses, and the passage of my amendment will have a tremendous impact on the success of those small firms. 
   My amendment addresses a problem that began in 2003. The Small Business Administration reversed a 20-year-old policy by ruling that small business companies that are majority venture capital backed could no longer compete for small business grants, regardless of how few employees a company may have. As a result, small businesses are finding it increasingly difficult to acquire the investment capital necessary to start or grow their businesses. This jeopardizes the development of innovative treatments, therapies, and technologies.     
   Venture capital funding is critical to capital intensive industries. They provide the needed seed money to help get some of those innovative ideas off the ground. Without this investment, some of our most innovative ideas would never develop. 
   My amendment will restore majority venture capital backed small companies' eligibility so they can compete for SBIR grants and receive other small business assistance. 
   Small businesses are providing this country with the ideas and innovation that has become the identity of the United States. Without these thoughts and ideas, the United States will fall behind the rest of the world in innovations and breakthroughs. 
   Creating an environment that will keep American innovation in the forefront of the global market is a priority of this body, and I am very confident this amendment and bill will help us meet those goals. 
   My amendment simply makes a couple of technical corrections in title II of the bill which has the support of both the chairwoman and the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. Simply put, this amendment helps remove barriers to participation in the SBIR program. 
   I would like to thank the staffs of Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Chabot for all of their hard work on this issue. This bill and amendment have been a work in progress for over 3 years, and I appreciate all of the work they have done on my behalf. This is a very important issue to me, my constituents, and small businesses everywhere, and I am glad to see it before the House today. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, while I am not opposed to the amendment, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in opposition. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Ms. Berkley). Without objection, the gentlewoman from New York is recognized for 5 minutes. 
   There was no objection. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Missouri for his amendment and his efforts to improve the bill. Mr. Graves has been a leader in our committee on many issues, and I appreciate his efforts to improve this legislation. 
   This amendment clarifies the availability of venture capital to small companies. It makes sure that we do not end up disqualifying any current participant in the SBIR program. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu).

In many cases it is extraordinarily hard to get the capital that they need, and allowing small businesses to take advantage of venture capital companies is the way. But it is my every intention to direct this completely to small businesses. 
   Again, I appreciate the concerns and I very much thank the chairwoman and Ranking Member Chabot for working with me, and encourage my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT EXPANSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Chairman, I first would like to thank Ranking Member Chabot and Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez for moving forward with this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, this bill is critically important to small businesses. I am glad I could be a part of this very important process. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Access to capital is essential to their survival and growth. I want to thank you for your support and thank them for their support on these provisions. 
   I also want to note the bipartisan nature of how the Small Business Investment Expansion Act passed through committee and is here before us on the House floor. Some initial concerns were brought up over the legislation. I am pleased to report that those concerns have been resolved due to the open and transparent manner in which this bill is being considered. 
   Lastly, I would like to thank the staffs of Chairwoman Vel&#225;zquez and Ranking Member Chabot for all their hard work on this issue. This bill has been a work in progress for roughly 3 years. I appreciate all the work that they have done on my behalf. This is a very important issue to me, my constituents, and small businesses everywhere. I am very glad to see it before the House today. 
   The Small Business Investment Expansion Act improves small business access to capital. Whether it is from the Small Business Administration, SBA, or through private investment, capital helps small companies bring their products to market and succeed. With an economy dependent on the success of small companies and firms, it is essential to pass this legislation. 
   I want to speak to title V of this bill for a brief moment. The language included in this title deals with the SBA affiliation rules and has been an issue of utmost importance to my constituents and to me over the past few years. Private investment in small business is a good thing and should be encouraged, not discouraged. The language will exclude the employees of these private investors when determining the size of a small business, thus allowing them continued access to important programs under the SBA.     
   This is important because many small firms and capital intensive fields rely on private investment to continue the very promising research and development that has attracted such development. The SBA has a number of programs that have proven vital to the success of small businesses and want to ensure our small businesses have continued access to them. 
   American innovation is what drives this country and its economy, and as Members of Congress we need to create an environment that will keep American innovation at the forefront of the global market. As a member of the Small Business Committee, I work to advocate on behalf of small businesses. The passage of this bill is a tremendous help to the competitiveness of those small firms, which is why I support its passage. 
   Again, I would like to thank the chairwoman and ranking member. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say to the gentleman, Mr. Graves, thank you so much for the work that you have done with the committee to work in a bipartisan manner to address the issues that are important to small businesses in this country. Your input and collaboration in putting together this legislation is greatly appreciated. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Chairman, let me begin by thanking the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for working together in a true bipartisan fashion to begin providing a long overdue down payment to special education funding. In particular, I want to thank Ranking Member Walsh for his amendment in committee to provide a $335 million increase in special education funding for fiscal year 2008. 
   When the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was signed into law more than 30 years ago, the Federal Government committed to pay the States 40 percent of the costs of providing services to students covered under this act. However, for three decades the Federal Government has often provided less than half the money promised. 
   What has this shortfall meant? For one, it has meant higher taxes at the State and local levels and less funding for other education programs as States and local governments struggle to make up the shortfall in Federal resources. 
   The amendment I introduce today builds on the bipartisan cooperation of the House Appropriations Committee by providing a further $125 million increase in funding for IDEA part B grants to the States. To pay for my amendment, I offset the cost by reducing a portion of the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund. My amendment helps us fulfill our commitment to funding special education while also providing a small increase in funding to the Global Fund as was provided last year. I don't take this money from any domestic program. These funds are dedicated to an overseas program, and they still see a $1 million increase over last year. 
   My amendment sets the right priorities for our Nation's children with special needs, and I urge support from all of my colleagues. Again, I would thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on this. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   House Concurrent Resolution 308 authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service to be held Thursday, May 15, 2008, as was pointed out. The National Peace Officers' Memorial Service will pay tribute to the 191 officers killed in the line of duty during 2007 and years prior. 
   Since 1962, this ceremony, sponsored by the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police and its auxiliary, has honored fallen Federal, State, and local officers and their families. 
   This year will be the 28th time the memorial service has been held on the grounds of the Capitol. The events of National Police Week lead up to the annual Peace Officers' Memorial Service with honors for the fallen officers. 
   This year, National Police Week will run from Sunday, May 11, through Saturday, May 17, with events around the country and here in Washington, D.C. The families and colleagues of officers killed in duty will gather to remember and honor the men and women who protect our communities. 
   One of the fallen officers who will be recognized this year is Deputy Sheriff Charles Cook from Missouri. Deputy Cook served the Buchanan County Sheriffs Office honorably for 3 years before his death in the line of duty. It is entirely appropriate to honor on the floor of the House the service and sacrifice of Deputy Cook and the other officers who have lost their lives serving and protecting our communities and our country. 
   The service and the other events of National Police Week are valuable reminders of the sacrifices of many of our Nation's police officers and their families. I encourage my colleagues to attend the National Peace Officers' Memorial Service, to pay tribute to the fallen officers, and recognize the individuals nationwide who put their lives at risk every day for the safety of our communities.

   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I introduced this resolution to provide the Members of this body the opportunity to express our common thanks and appreciation for our Nation's teachers. 
   Many people enter the teaching profession as a calling. 
   There are other jobs with much better pay, shorter hours and, often times, less hassle than teaching. 
   However, each year thousands of college graduates choose teaching as a profession, in no small part as the result of a personal experience they had with one of their own teachers. 
   National Teacher Appreciation Week is designed to provide a means for students, parents and entire communities to come together and participate in events and activities that show their appreciation for teachers. 
   Personally, I will be hosting an event in my district to recognize Alesia Hamilton, a first-grade teacher at Edison Elementary School in St. Joseph, Missouri who in accordance with the character and commitment that defines all teachers, has invited into her class as a student Mr. Alferd Williams, a 70-year-old man born into poverty who never had the opportunity to learn how to read, much less receive a formal education. 
   Each day, Alesia Hamilton works with Mr. Williams on reading assignments and other tasks that will ultimately help Alferd Williams earn his GED. 
   Mr. Speaker, what Alesia Hamilton is doing with Mr. Williams is just one example of what teachers do every day to improve the lives of not only their students but the people of our communities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Resolution 444, Supporting National Aviation Technician Day, and honoring Charles Edward Taylor. This resolution was introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner) in honor of aviation maintenance mechanics and their profession. 
   Day in and day out, aviation mechanics ensure the safety of the flying public. They are also critical for the safety of our Armed Forces aviation infrastructure. They keep our military aircraft flying and are key elements in ensuring their security. 
   The aviation mechanics creed embodies their professional philosophy. Words such as ``sacred,'' ``trust,'' ``judgment,'' and ``dignity'' are used to describe their duties and professionalism. 
   Our public confidence in aviation transportation is a direct result of their commitment to these ideals and the unwavering integrity of their work. 
   H. Res. 444 also rightly honors Charles Edward Taylor, who played a fundamental role in aviation history. In 1902, Mr. Taylor began work as a machinist in Dayton, Ohio for the Wright Cycle Company. In just 6 weeks, he built a 12 horsepower engine with only a metal lathe, a drill press, and hand tools. On December 17, 1903, his engine was used on the Wright brothers' first flying machine and propelled the world into controlled flight. Mr. Taylor's career lasted 60 years and earned him a place in aviation history. To this day, he is known as the father of aviation maintenance. 
   The Federal Aviation Administration's Charles Edward Taylor Master Mechanic Award is bestowed upon individuals who have over 50 years of experience in aviation maintenance and is truly an honor to receive. 
   Mr. Speaker, 45 States currently designate May 24 as Aviation Maintenance Technician Day. I encourage my Members to support this resolution to honor  the men and women of aviation maintenance and the life and memory of Charles Edward Taylor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I actually got to hear one of the very original Wright brothers engines, which was built by Mr. Taylor, at Oshkosh just a few years ago. There are still a couple of them that are existing today. They were actually built by hand, very crudely built, and I got an opportunity to hear one of them started up running. It was actually the third engine that he ever built, and it was absolutely a neat thing to see.     
   In my district I have one of the American Airlines overhaul bases which houses a lot of mechanics and aviation technicians who work on those aircraft, and from a base as large as that right down to some of our very small businesses, like Joe Rankin who runs an aviation shop in a little airport in Marionville, Missouri, those aviation mechanics are important to the entire industry. 
   Being a pilot myself, I know just how important good maintenance and those mechanics can be to your aircraft. It really is an honor to have the opportunity to be able to handle this bill for the minority side today. I thank the gentleman from California for his work on it. I think it truly says a lot about aviation mechanics and the reason we are honoring them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 584 designates the Department of Education Building as the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building. Lyndon Baines Johnson was born in Stonewall, Texas, on August 27, 1908, and his connection to education began very early in life when at the age of 4 his mother persuaded the teacher at the nearby one-room junction school to take him as a student. 
   Lyndon Baines Johnson enrolled in the Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1927. He graduated in 1930 and embarked on a teaching career that would eventually lead him to the White House. As was pointed out by the gentlelady, in 1937 he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in a special election. 
   He was subsequently re-elected to the House in each succeeding Congress until 1948 when he was elected to the United States Senate. In 1961, he resigned from the Senate to become the 37th Vice President; and on November 22, 1963, a day we all remember, Lyndon Baines Johnson became the 36th President of the United States. 
   This teacher who would become President pursued numerous education initiatives, as was pointed out. He signed into law education legislation such as the Higher Education Facilities Act, the Library Services Act, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and the Higher Education Act, just to name a few. 
   After leaving office, President Johnson continued to have an impact on education, as he taught students while he was writing his memoirs, and subsequently passed away on January 22, 1973.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5492 authorizes the Smithsonian Institution to construct greenhouses at its facility in Suitland, Maryland. The bill authorizes $12 million to construct the greenhouses. The Transportation Committee has researched the proposed cost of and the need for this greenhouse facility. We have done our due diligence on this project. 
   This greenhouse facility will produce the plants for the entire Smithsonian Institution complex, which is the world's largest museum complex. In addition, the facility will house the orchid collection held in trust by the Smithsonian. 
   The Smithsonian currently conducts these activities at an aging facility located at the Armed Forces Retirement Home here in the District of Columbia. Because the retirement home is redeveloping the site, the Smithsonian will no longer be able to use the greenhouse facility located there. 
   These new greenhouses will enable the Smithsonian to continue producing its own plants after it loses access to the Armed Forces Retirement Home. 
   Satisfying the Smithsonian's requirements for plants on the open market doesn't make sense economically. Given the wide variety of plans required for the National Zoo and museums, it is more cost effective for the Smithsonian to grow its own plants rather than to purchase them. 
   The cost of this project is appropriate given the need for the greenhouse facility, as well as the work necessary to construct this particular type of greenhouse. I support the resolution. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3495, introduced by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Corrine Brown), creates a National Commission on Children and Disasters. First, I thank Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman Norton for working with us to improve this legislation. I believe our bipartisan efforts were necessary to ensure a fair and balanced commission. I think it has resulted in a much better legislative product. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3495 establishes a 10-member commission to examine the needs of children and disasters. The commission is directed to report its findings and conclusions and recommendations to the President and the Congress, as Chairwoman Norton pointed out. 
   The bill specifically directs the commission to build upon the investigations of other entities to avoid an unnecessary duplication of effort. For example, last Congress the House created the Select Committee to Investigate Hurricane Katrina. Former Subcommittee Chairman Bill Shuster served on the select committee. 
   In its final report, the select committee made a number of findings with respect to children. In response to this report, we passed the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, which included provisions creating a national emergency child locator center and a national emergency family registry and locator center. 
   Finally, H.R. 3495 requires both State emergency managers and local emergency managers to be represented on the commission. This requirement ensures the representation on the commission of the people who may very well be responsible for implementing its recommendations.

   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 6627 authorizes construction of permanent structures to serve as Smithsonian research facilities in Edgewater, Maryland, and Gamboa, Panama. The new buildings will replace aging leased and temporary structure, and provide needed research space for the Smithsonian's research mission. 
   As part of a comprehensive facilities management plan, the Smithsonian has identified these two research centers as facilities in need of permanent, modern research buildings. The construction of the laboratories authorized by this bill will enable the Smithsonian to reduce its leased space inventory and consolidate its research operations. This will also allow the Smithsonian to close 80-year-old buildings that are costly to operate and not suitable for renovation. 
   Construction of new facilities in Gamboa will allow the Smithsonian to move out of general office space reconfigured for research and consolidate operations into a government-owned structure more appropriate and less costly for a modern research facility. 
   The Edgewater, Maryland, research facility will finally have permanent structures after working for many years out of temporary trailers. These trailers are expensive to maintain, and have a short, useful life. 
   Because the new buildings will be government-owned and cost less to operate and maintain, this legislation is expected to save money in the long term. The new facilities will be designed to meet the specific needs of the research centers. 
   Government ownership of the structures will save taxpayer dollars by investing in assets that will continue to serve the Smithsonian Institution over time. The dilapidated buildings and trailers currently used consume building maintenance resources and are a liability to the government rather than an asset. Replacement of the old buildings will allow us to shift dollars from maintaining aging structures to creating modern, useful facilities. 
   I am encouraged by the Smithsonian's responsible property management decisions in these two cases, and I ask my colleagues to please join me in supporting H.R. 6627.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. I was going to pretty much just talk about the specific merits of S. 996, but since my colleague pointed out that we should stay on topic, I think I would just expand just a little bit because this is an aviation bill, this is talking about--and it was mentioned--the number of planes flying in and out of Los Angeles International Airport and just how important that part of the transportation system is to this country and how much we are going to lose in this country if pieces of legislation like the un-American energy bill that was passed last night are enacted into law. 
   It's unfortunate because so many things in this country travel. Every single product, every single person in this country travels one way or another, either by train or by plane or by ship or by barge or by pipeline or by truck. Everything in this country travels, and we are a country that is very, very dependent on foreign sources of oil, unfortunately, for those products that we need for gasoline, for diesel fuel. 
   We would like to see, and I would like to see, that dependence reduced. That dependence needs to be reduced, and we have the resources right here in the United States. Unfortunately, the bill that was passed last night locked away the biggest chunk of those resources permanently. That bill permanently put away any opportunity to go after those resources off the Outer Continental Shelf between zero and 50 miles where the biggest chunk of those resources are and where it would be the easiest to go after those resources. 
   It's unfortunate because there are no alternatives in certain areas of transportation, for instance, aviation, which we're talking about today. There are no alternatives but aviation fuel. It comes from petroleum. No alternatives are out there. 
   It will be nice one of these days in this country when we do have alternatives to address some of our issues when it comes to being a country so dependent on petroleum, on gasoline, and diesel fuel.     
   We already have a few great hybrids in this country, whether it's electricity or ethanol or biofuels. We have some great alternatives. But if you're talking about real power to pull a train or to drive a ship or to push a barge or to pull farm machinery or to pull a truck or to fly an airplane, we have to have fuel. And it's unfortunate that we continue to see pieces of legislation brought forth in this Chamber that do absolutely nothing to address our real need in this country. And we're talking about all of those things that are important to us for energy--nuclear power, clean-burning coal technology, coal to gas, more drilling in places like ANWR and the Outer Continental Shelf, and all of those areas throughout the United States that have oil. 
   And we can do it in such an environmentally friendly way. And that's one of the most frustrating parts of this entire argument. We can do it in such an environmentally friendly way because of the technologies today that allow us to do so many different things underground when it comes to those wells and comes to those rigs. We don't have to hurt our environment to be dependent on the United States and to Americanize United States resources. We don't have to harm our environment in any way. We can work with our environment. And we continue to use those resources that are un-American. 
   So it's unfortunate, again, that we passed such an un-American bill in this Chamber last night. Many of us did not support that bill simply because it makes us more dependent on those foreign sources of oil and it locks away the biggest percentage of that oil that we have and those resources that we have right here in the United States. It didn't even address the refining issue that we have in the United States and the capacity problems that we have in the United States. And that's as much a part of this as anything else. 
   So all of these modes of transportation, we're going to be doing a few things here for a little while, talking about different areas of transportation. It's unfortunate because all of those modes of transportation carry those goods and those people from one place to another. And when the price of that energy goes up, it costs consumers money. It costs everyone out there more money when it comes to purchasing those products or just transporting themselves from one place to another. 
   So again, a very un-American energy bill was passed out of this Chamber last night. And we hope that we will be able to have an American energy bill, one that is dependent on American sources, sometime soon before this Congress breaks in October. This Congress continues to break time and time again without addressing this issue, without coming up with a bill that will solve those problems and will go to the President's desk. And it's unfortunate, Mr. Speaker. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution recognizing North Platte, Nebraska, as ``Rail Town USA.'' 
   North Platte is home to Bailey Yard, recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest railroad classification yard. 
   At Bailey Yard, as was pointed out by the gentlelady, an astounding 10,000 rail cars a day are sorted and put together in trains that move freight all across this country. These trains are loaded with commodities that keep our economy going, ranging everywhere from groceries to building supplies, from coal to new automobiles. The yard is home to over 2,600 hardworking railroad employees. And Bailey Yard covers 2,850,000 acres containing 315 miles of track. 
   The Union Pacific Railroad, Madam Speaker, has invested heavily in Bailey Yard, over $100 million in the modern area. This kind of investment in rail infrastructure is exactly what this country needs to keep our economy strong. 
   Railroads are a very important component of our Nation's transportation infrastructure and we should continue to support the rail industry. 
   In that spirit, I urge passage of H. Con. Res. 408, honoring North Platte's contribution to our country's economic vitality.

   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, before I close, I want to thank the gentlelady from Florida for pointing out that passing Amtrak or Amtrak rail service is very important. It is extremely important to be able to move people around in a much more efficient way. And I might remind the gentlelady that Amtrak depends on one thing, and that is diesel fuel. And you can't have diesel fuel if you don't have drilling. As long as we are dependent on nations such as Saudi Arabia and such as Venezuela, we're going to be continually at their mercy when it comes to getting those resources. But we have to have drilling to have diesel fuels to have trains on the track. It is all interconnected, and it's all very important. 
   The gentlelady is exactly right. Rail service in this country can do a whole lot toward taking vehicles off the road. And bringing our rail service back in this country I think is a very worthy goal for the United States. Moving as much goods and people by rail, I think, just makes it more efficient. 
   I mentioned before that every single thing in this country moves. It's either by train or by plane or by ship or by barge or by pipeline or by truck or by car. But every single thing in this country moves. And every person in this country moves. And when we get more efficient and put them on a train, we need diesel fuel. And the only way we are going to get diesel fuel is to have more oil production in the United States and be able to refine it. 
   I appreciate what the gentlelady has done today, particularly with North Platte. North Platte is one big rail facility, a big rail facility out in Nebraska. Obviously Adrian is doing a fantastic job for his area. I want to thank the gentlelady. She has a lot of heart, and she is one of my favorite people in Congress.

   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3986, the John F. Kennedy Center Reauthorization Act, will authorize much-needed funds for the continued operation of the John F. Kennedy Center, which was established to celebrate the arts and honor of the memory of President John F. Kennedy. 
   H.R. 3986, as amended by the Senate, authorizes the Kennedy Center for a 5-year period consistent with the center's facilities management plan. The 5-year authorization will allow the Kennedy Center to manage the center in a responsible manner. 
   The House passed the version of this legislation in December of last year that included a 3-year authorization for the Kennedy Center. The Senate amendment provides a 5-year authorization to allow for a longer-term plan  for the management of that center. With this longer authorization, the Kennedy Center can upgrade and maintain the facility, using a renovation schedule that is both realistic and responsible. 
   While the center has had financial management problems in the past, the management of projects shows great success in facilities management policy. The master plan for the facility provides an aggressive plan for care and repair of the facilities. I believe that the long-term master plan presented by the board of directors lays out a responsible vision for the center. 
   Many of the projects in the center's budget will repair and renovate capital assets and keep the center in good condition. Planned upgrades will make the facility safer and more welcoming to those who visit. Other projects will help maintain the Kennedy Center's unique structure. 
   The legislation also authorizes the Kennedy Center Board of Directors to study the usefulness of a solar panel system for the main roof of the memorial. Before the center can begin construction of a system, the board would be required to report to Congress information about the system. 
   I am very encouraged by the steps that the board of directors has taken to make the Kennedy Center more fiscally responsible. This authorization will give the center the resources necessary to carry out a well thought-out plan for the arts center that honors and remembers President Kennedy. 
   I support the legislation, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   As was pointed out, they are embarking down at the Kennedy Center on a renovation plan, and one of the things they are looking at and one of the things we talked about in committee on various occasions is the photovoltaic plan that is going to be implemented on a lot of buildings around Washington, D.C., government buildings. It is fascinating technology. In fact, it has come light-years from where it was just a couple of decades ago, and I am very confident we are going to see some very interesting things come out of this as we move forward. Obviously, that is a big part of it. 
   Alternative energy sources is a very big part of what needs to be done in this country, whether it is wind power, photovoltaic, hydropower, obviously very, very important, as well as everything else out there that we need to do, which is clean burning coal technology, which is more drilling in the United States to utilize those resources we have right here in the United States, instead of doing what happened last night, which is locking away the vast majority of those resources in this country, at least when it comes to drilling off the Outer Continental Shelf, and not being allowed to drill between 50 and 0 miles of the coast. 
   That is unfortunate, because it is going to take all of the above. It is going to take solar power and wind power. It is going to take turning coal into fuel. It is going to take burning coal in a very clean way. It is going to take drilling for oil in the United States. It is going to take conservation, which is obviously a very big part of this. It is going to take all of those things. 
   What we need in this country is a real energy plan that does just that and that uses all of the above; not just a little bit of the above, but all of the above. 
   So I applaud the Kennedy Center and their plan, and I am looking forward to seeing how photovoltaic moves forward in this. I am very tickled to support this bill, H.R. 3986, and urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 35 that would amend Public Law 108-331 to provide for the Smithsonian Institution's construction of certain facilities in support of the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, or VERITAS. 
   The VERITAS project is a collaboration with the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy as the lead agencies. Universities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland are participants in this work. 
   The goal of the VERITAS project is to increase our ability to view gamma-ray radiation in space.     
   Studying gamma ray radiation from objects like exploding stars and black holes will help increase our scientific understanding of the universe. In 1968, the first telescope was created to observe this gamma ray radiation. VERITAS significantly enhances this technology. 
   In 2004, Congress authorized the Smithsonian to construct a control building to support the VERITAS project. The control building would include space for computers, technical equipment, and other facilities for researchers to carry out their work with the new telescopes. 
   The original legislation authorized the control building to be built in Kitt Peak, Arizona, where the VERITAS project was expected to be located. Site and construction preparation began in Kitt Peak in 2004 on land leased to the U.S. Government by a local Indian tribe. Unfortunately, in 2005, the  project was halted when a lawsuit was brought and the National Science Foundation issued a stop work order. 
   As a result, the NSF and the DOE began to undertake new environmental assessments of the Kitt Peak site and, in 2005, started initial work on the VERITAS telescopes 35 miles away at the Fred Lawrence Base Camp in Mount Hopkins, Arizona. The plan was to move the telescopes to Kitt Peak following completion of the necessary assessments. 
   However, the assessment process continued into 2007 and there were concerns about missing windows of opportunities for joint work planned with NASA's gamma ray telescope satellite. 
   In light of this, the VERITAS team sought and received approval from the United States Forest Service to test the telescopes at the Whipple Base Camp. The testing revealed that the Whipple location produced results comparable with those they expected at Kitt Peak. As a result, the collaborative partners agreed that the VERITAS project should remain at the Whipple Base Camp. 
   The legislation enacted in 2004 authorized the construction of a control building by the Smithsonian for the project; however, it specified Kitt Peak, Arizona, as the project location. 
   The Senate resolution today would amend that law to authorize the construction of the control building at the Whipple Base Camp in Mount Hopkins, Arizona, where the VERITAS project is now located. 
   This resolution does not authorize any additional funds for the project. The resolution simply authorizes the change in the location of the project at no additional cost. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   If the gentlelady does not have any further speakers, Madam Speaker, I would go ahead then and yield back the balance of my time.

   H.R. 478 designates the Federal building and the United States courthouse located at 101 Barr Street in Lexington, Kentucky as the Scott Reed Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The bill recognizes Judge Reed's service to the legal profession. 
   Judge Scott Reed graduated from the University of Kentucky College of Law where he received many honors. Judge Reed's career as a jurist began in 1964, when he became Fayette Circuit Court judge. Five years later, he was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, where he sat for over 7 years. During the mid 1970s, Judge Reed played an instrumental role in the recognition of Kentucky's judicial system, which created the Kentucky Supreme Court. Judge Reed was elected to serve as the first Chief Justice of Kentucky in 1976. His opinions from the Supreme Court of Kentucky have received national acclaim for their content.     
   In 1979 he was named U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, and he served as U.S. district judge until he retired in 1990.

   The gentleman from Iowa pointed out his many contributions to law and obviously to the State of New York. This is another bill, Mr. Speaker, where I think it is a fitting tribute, to say the least, and I wholeheartedly support this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (APPALACHIAN REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, H.R. 799, as amended, reauthorizes and improves the Appalachian Regional Commission, the ARC. The ARC has been a successful program for the last 40 years. It has helped reduce the Appalachian region's poverty rate. It has cut the infant mortality rate. It has increased the percentage of adults with a high school diploma. It has provided water and sewer services to a significant number of households and businesses and created new jobs. 
   H.R. 799, as amended, reauthorizes the ARC for 5 years. The bill includes a couple of very important reforms. It helps focus funding on distressed and at-risk counties, and it includes language that will deter earmarking of the program. 
   Currently, the ARC has four statutory designations which are determined by the unemployment rate, per capita income and the poverty rate of each ARC county. This bill creates an additional designation to assist counties that are at risk and don't fully qualify as distressed. 
   At-risk counties are fragile economies making it difficult to meet the 50 percent match rate to participate in the program. In many cases, at-risk counties are recently distressed and eligible for an 80 percent Federal match. The addition of the ``at-risk'' designation will fund projects in these counties up to 70 percent of the project cost as they continue the transition from the ``distressed'' to the ``transitional'' designation. 
   The ARC is viewed by most as a successful model for economic development. The ability to leverage a large amount of public and private funding makes the ARC a very valuable tool for economic development in Appalachia. We must ensure continuation of this successful program and further express our support for the hardworking people in the Appalachian region. 
   I would encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 799, as amended. 
   Madam Speaker, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I would yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Regional Economic and Infrastructure Development Act of 2007 reauthorizes two economic development commissions, the Delta Regional Commission and the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission. The bill also creates three new commissions, the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the Southwest Border Regional Commission and the Northern Border Regional Commission. 
   First, I want to thank Chairman Oberstar and Subcommittee Chairwoman NORTON for working with me to add several counties in northwest Missouri to the Northern Great Plains Regional Commission and for working with other members of the committee to add their counties to the bill as well. I appreciate it very much. 
   The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission borders my district in the north and the west. The counties added by this bill are contiguous to the counties in the commission. Additionally, these northwest Missouri counties are experiencing problems similar to the counties in the commission already, yet they have higher levels of economic distress. 
   The Northern Great Plains Regional Commission will set the stage for economic growth by creating an effective Federal-State partnership for attracting new businesses, creating new jobs and developing the infrastructure in northwest Missouri. The commission will encourage local economic development by making use of local resources for the benefit of the community. The commission is designed to successfully leverage other public and private funds, providing northwest Missouri with a very valuable economic development tool. 
   Economic development plays a very vital role in maintaining our rural way of life by keeping folks in those communities and keeping that culture alive. A major component to economic development is the build-out of broadband services throughout many regions in the country.     
   No matter where you live, broadband can bring a world of opportunities and possibilities to your doorstep. It is imperative to our rural way of life that we push broadband out to every corner of the country. Where you live should not limit your opportunities for education, commerce, and medical care. 
   Many citizens in rural America's small communities do not have broadband access at a reasonable cost. It should be available to everyone no matter where they live at a reasonable rate. Through this legislation and other efforts that my colleagues and I have taken on, grants will be available to further establish an infrastructure that can support this important tool to rural economic development. 
   Additionally, I must commend two members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. Hayes and Mr. Boustany, who have been tireless advocates for their districts. I would like to recognize Mr. Hayes for his dedication to stimulating economic development and job promotion in the State of North Carolina and leading efforts to create the Southeast Crescent Authority. 
   Additionally, he has championed efforts to recruit new industry and create new jobs while sharpening the competitive proficiency of existing industries in the Eighth Congressional District of North Carolina. 
   Mr. Boustany has also worked tirelessly to promote development and create opportunities for communities in  his district and has been a leader on the issue for the entire State of Louisiana. 
   Again, thank you, Chairman Oberstar and Chairwoman NORTON for working with Members and working with me to bring this legislation to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I know we have a few speakers out there, so I will cut mine short. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany). He has worked tirelessly for his district. And since, not so much Hurricane Katrina, but Hurricane Rita, which devastated his district, he has been working very hard to bring some economic development to his district. 
   I yield such time as he may consume for his remarks.

   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard now from folks talking about Louisiana, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, myself from Missouri; and I think folks can see that we have a lot of areas in the United States that are very economically distressed, and for various reasons. Every one of those regions, and, traditionally the Appalachia region, are distressed for different reasons. This bill allows these commissions to leverage public and private dollars. It is a great partnership. 
   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the chairman for allowing me to add counties in northwest Missouri. It is very important to the folks there. I know he has been working on various aspects of these commissions for a long, long time. I appreciate his expertise and his willingness to be very open in this process and work with us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, the Republican motion to recommit on this legislation is as straightforward as it is reasonable. All you have to do is read it and see exactly what it does. As written, it would simply amend the legislation forthwith to give greater priority for housing decisions under the HOPE VI program to give men and women who have served our country on the battlefield rather than men and women who have acted in violation of our laws. 
   Mr. Speaker, under current law, public housing authorities may use discretion when determining whether or not it is in the interest of the community to provide public housing to certain felons, including those convicted of drug-related criminal offenses. This bill under consideration on the floor, however, incentivizes public housing authorities when applying for HOPE VI grant funding to give convicted felons preferential treatment. 
   There is absolutely, absolutely no reason why we should be encouraging local public housing authorities to place convicted felons at the head of the line, especially when so many, so many of the American veterans live today without adequate housing. We should be encouraging public housing authorities to assist these men and women first and foremost and in a manner that recognizes their tremendous service to this country. 
   Veterans have acute housing needs, Mr. Speaker. According to the most recent Veterans Affairs reports, there are over 310,000 homeless veterans. The frustrating part about this is we are talking about our veterans. These are people that served our country, were willing to give their lives for our country, and I think they deserve to be heard on this bill. 
   The National Association to End Homelessness estimates that veterans represent roughly a quarter of all homeless people in America. My home State of Missouri has an estimated 4,800 homeless veterans and ranks fourth in the Nation of the highest percentage of veterans that are homeless, according to a recent report. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can talk about figures all day long; I can go on and on about this and that. The bottom line is we are talking about veterans. These are  men and women who have served their country, and they served their country with great distinction. They are willing to put their lives on the line, and now they aren't at the front of the list? We would put somebody who has knowingly, knowingly violated our laws ahead of somebody who has stood up for this Nation? 
   To me, Mr. Speaker, it's very frustrating. The motion to recommit includes veterans in the category of those considered hard to house. It helps address the pressing housing needs of America's past and present heroes, Mr. Speaker. 
   There are some out there, Mr. Speaker, that hold our veterans in contempt. That is a fact. There are some that do it, but I don't, and we don't. We don't hold our veterans in contempt, Mr. Speaker, and they should be at the front of the line. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, because that is what it does. Towards that end, I encourage every one of us, every one of us in this Chamber to support this motion so that men and women who step forward in the service of our country and in defense of our freedom and in defense of that flag, Mr. Speaker, are the ones given preferential treatment. They should be the ones getting preferential treatment, not folks who have violated our laws. If there is any preferential treatment to be given, it ought to be given to those folks. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GRAVES. (HONORING THE LIFE, LEGACY AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF LAMAR HUNT -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAVES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of one of Kansas City's legendary figures. 
   Lamar Hunt made a positive and lasting impression on Kansas City. He was a man who seemingly touched every life that crossed his path. He was known for his easy-going, engaging personality. He will be remembered not only for what he accomplished, but for the way he treated people. 
   Mr. Hunt was an innovator. He is credited with making the National Football League what it is today. He coined the term ``Super Bowl'', championed the 2-point conversion and brought American soccer into the mainstream. He was inducted into 3 different professional sports halls of Fame--football, tennis and soccer. 
   His beloved Kansas City Chiefs played in the American Football League and won the Super Bowl in 1969. The Chiefs are as much a part of Kansas City as barbeque and jazz, thanks to Mr. Hunt's leadership. 
   Mr. Hunt though was an innovator in other ways too. He built both Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun as state of the art theme parks in Kansas City. He also built the Subtropolis Office Complex in the limestone caves around Kansas City. 
   Mr. Speaker, simply stated, Lamar Hunt was a giant among men.
