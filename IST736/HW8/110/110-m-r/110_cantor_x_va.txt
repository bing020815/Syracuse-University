<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I, too, would like to congratulate the Speaker and the leader for bringing this bill to the floor with such expediency. I do hope this is the beginning of a year in which we can count on cooperation for strong pro-growth fiscal policy. 
   Now, there is not a person in here who likes everything in this bill, and I certainly would be one who is counted that there are provisions in here I would rather not see. But I want to focus on the provisions that I think work, and they work because they will point towards job creation. At the end of the day, if we are talking about stimulus, the best stimulus is a job. 
   There are two provisions in here, one which is the bonus depreciation and the other, 179 small business expensing, which mean incentives for our entrepreneurs and our small businesses and large businesses to have cash come to the bottom line to be able to create more jobs. 
   If we can imagine the entrepreneurs in our communities at home who are dealing with the question of whether they can deal with an economic downturn or not, whether they have to let off jobs or not, this is real relief to those entrepreneurs and those small businesses. That is why I am excited about these provisions that will create jobs. 
   In response to some of the discussion which has ensued on the floor here, I want to say that unemployment insurance and other things that may or may not be what one is for, if we are talking stimulus, let's call those what they are. Unemployment insurance extension of benefits are enhancing a safety net. I don't think any of us would say that is stimulative because, frankly, it allows individuals a safety net while they are looking for a job. That is not stimulus for our economy. 
   Long term I would like to see this House continue to focus on the uncertainty in the investment environment. My colleague from California was here saying it is about capital, it is about the lack of investment going on. We need to focus long term on lifting the cloud of uncertainty for the investors and families in this economy so they can count on the fact that their allocation of capital from a risk-based standpoint is going to be rewarded, and that means keeping cap gain dividend rates low, lowering corporate rates so that we can reward those who take risks in our economy to create jobs.

   Mr. CANTOR. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   I also want to thank the gentleman from California, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Davis) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Dingell) for their cooperation with me and my office on this bill. 
   As our minority leader said, the scientific community as well as the general public is pretty well steeped in the dangers of smoking. I think all of us can agree it's a legitimate public policy to want to reduce the rate of smoking with our children. This bill, though, in addition to doing some of that, some of the aim behind it is to allow for it to pave the way and in fact to encourage legitimate attempts to make tobacco and tobacco products less harmful. The net result to all of us will be to increase the health outlook for consumers of tobacco and its products. 
   This bill is particularly meaningful to my district, as there are over 6,000 direct jobs related to the tobacco manufacturing. And there has been significant investment in my district and in the area from where I come made towards the research and development on how we make this product less harmful.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (MOTION TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES ON H.R. 2419, FOOD AND ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise around this motion to instruct, which is centered on an objection that I have in the Senate-passed farm bill around one particular provision that certainly raises a lot of questions in my mind and should raise a lot of questions in the minds of my colleagues. 
   In the bill there is, without question, a $200 million earmark that benefits one wealthy landowner. Section 12808 in H.R. 2419, as passed by the Senate, provides for a tax credit bond program. There is a scheme in this bill that was so narrowly crafted that the bonds authorized thereunder can only be used for the acquisition of one, just one, piece of land in the entire country. This piece of land happens to lie predominantly in the State of Montana and is owned by timber giant Plum Creek. According to press reports, the Nature Conservancy would be allowed to issue $500 million in bonds under this bill and then use the proceeds to purchase the land from the timber giant. Even more egregious is that the provision does not even appear to require the protection of a single additional tree or a single additional fish. If this isn't a tax earmark, I don't know what is. Mr. Speaker, this is the ``bridge to nowhere'' of the farm bill. 
   Now, I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will argue that the Montana bond provision does not fit the definition of an earmark under House rules. Their reasoning will be that many taxpayers will potentially own the Montana bonds and then get tax credits from the Federal Government. But make no mistake. This provision is designed to facilitate one land sale by one landowner.  
   Now, Mr. Speaker, here's my question: What in the world are we doing here contemplating the expenditure of $200 million in U.S. taxpayer money to fund the purchase of a tract of land that benefits just one wealthy landowner, all the while American families are struggling with skyrocketing gas prices, food prices through the roof, plummeting home prices, and an economy that is barrel, barely growing? 
   It is time for us, Mr. Speaker, to say ``no'' to these types of backroom deals that have been struck in the middle of the night that benefit a wealthy few. It is time for us, Mr. Speaker, to say ``no'' to business as usual in Washington. And it's time, Mr. Speaker, for us to put the people first. 
   Think about it. Imagine what we could do with $200 million. It would go a long way to help solving the problems that so many people are facing across this country. This $200 million earmark is exactly what is wrong with Washington and why the American people are demanding change. It's time for all of us to insist that the Federal Government start working for the people again. 
   Mr. Speaker, my motion is a very simple one. It asks that the House instruct its conferees on the farm bill to reject section 12808 of the Senate-passed bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I would just say that the Plum Creek Forest tax credit scheme is plumb wrong. This is the ``bridge to nowhere'' of the farm bill. This has no business being in the farm bill. This is clearly, as the gentleman from Louisiana said, an earmark directed at one wealthy landowner. And this is why the American people are sick and tired of the way this town does business. 
   We owe it to the public. They deserve better. Let's call this what it is. The Plum Creek Forest is plumb wrong. This is a ``bridge to nowhere'' in the farm bill. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this motion to instruct the House conferees. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANTOR. So clearly, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the gentleman, I would imagine that the economic times surrounding that article 6, 8 months ago certainly may have been different than they are today. We have been on the floor all day, and will continue to be on the floor tomorrow, talking about the housing crisis and the plummeting real estate values. 
   Let's face it. If you have got 40,000 acres of land today, and that land was scheduled for development and sale of parcels, that land is not worth what it was in the fall of 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman. And I admire him for his valiant effort to defend this provision in the Senate-passed farm bill. He did a great job. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just still believe that if we were serious in wanting to preserve land adjacent to Federal forest and parkland, we would have a provision here, maybe not in the farm bill, but a provision in a program authorizing some legitimate awarding of bonds, wherever the program deemed appropriate, not so narrowly drawn that the $500 million could only be used to purchase one particular parcel. 
   I think anyone looking at this would have to conclude that the aim was to afford the current landowner the ability to sell the land in this difficult climate. 
   So Mr. Speaker, the Plum Creek Forest and the bond programs associated therewith is plumb wrong. This is a ``bridge to nowhere.'' This is where America, once again, will be let down by the actions of this House if this provision is allowed to stay in. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia. It is a very straightforward amendment. It simply applies an across-the-board cut of 1 percent to this bill to send the signal that this Congress gets it; that we understand what the American people said, both during the election of last year and what they continue to say today. 
   As the American public continues to watch Congress, as we have now engaged upon and entered upon the spending season, as the spending and appropriations process is in full bloom, I think we owe it to the American people to do what the gentleman from Georgia says, which is to recognize that these dollars don't belong to the government. They are the hard-earned dollars of the taxpayers of this country. 
   Now, the underlying bill, as the gentleman said, spends considerably more than what this similar bill spent last year and this Congress spent in this bill last year. In fact, the increase in the level of spending is 10 percent in this bill alone. That is triple the rate of inflation and that means $1.3 billion, billion with a B, taxpayer dollars, more on this one bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, what that means in real terms to me and to my constituents, that means more than 3 years' worth of property taxes for every household and every business in my home County of Henrico in the Richmond area of Virginia. That is an awful lot of money. 
   So the public expects us to return Washington to fiscal sanity. The message that was sent last November was that the public expected us to operate differently. Frankly, I don't believe that this bill moves us in that direction. But I do know one thing for sure:  that the spending in this bill, if we don't adopt this amendment, will further erode the public trust, not only in this body but in government as a whole.

   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, recently some Members of the House have proposed using the supplemental appropriations bill to restrict the President's ability to defend our country and its allies from a hostile Iran. Attempts to curtail the bargaining ability and leverage of the United States comes at the precise moment when our Nation must show strength. 
   However, attempts to dampen our resolve and security send the anti-U.S. forces in Tehran a signal that America is weak. If Iran continues to see that America stands determined to prevent it from going nuclear, it will be encouraged to become a responsible member of the international community. 
   If we falter, the Iranian nuclear threat may well become a reality. Mr. Speaker, we must not let that happen.

   Mr. Speaker, some 6,000 miles from here a new plan is underway to secure Baghdad and stabilize an Iraq that 2 months ago was sliding into chaos. Indeed, we should be encouraged by declining levels of violence in Baghdad as well as the beginning of a restoration of trust between ordinary Iraqis and coalition and Iraqi forces. 
   Unlike the gentleman before me, I disagree that this sends the right message. This supplemental undermines General Petraeus' plan before our troops have an opportunity to achieve success. 
   Instead of reaffirming our commitment to victory, this bill concedes defeat while piling on billions in unrelated pork. So while tropical fish get $5 million, our troops get a steady Democratic diet of limitations and pull-out deadlines. We should have few doubts that, if passed, this bill will be a rallying cry for terrorists recently dismayed by our resolve. 
   Our troops march to the order of one Commander in Chief, not 535. While the current Commander in Chief has a plan for victory, it is apparent that the majority party in this House has already thrown in the towel.

   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is designed to be a substantive enhancement to the underlying Secure Maritime and Vessel Workforce bill. 
   I think the other side has demonstrated on two occasions this week that they are inclined to work across the aisle and accept substantive improvements to the bill. 
   What this motion to recommit does, it is intended to protect our maritime workforce, our national security, and ultimately the ports that serve and provide commerce to our great Nation. The language of the motion to recommit ensures that individuals that have been convicted of felonies are not able to board maritime vessels using transportation security cards. Now these felonies includes espionage, treason, sedition, murder, racketeering, crimes dealing with explosives or incendiary devices. These are individuals convicted of these felonies that frankly have an underlying purpose to harm Americans. 
   Clearly, individuals convicted of these type of felony crimes pose a security risk to America and its citizens. 
   We need to keep our ports safe and secure, and to do that, we must keep our maritime vessels safe and secure. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   Along with my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, I too rise with a very heavy heart today as we mourn the passing and reflect on the life of our dear friend and colleague, Jo Ann Davis. In life, Jo Ann amazed so many of us with her determination and her fighting spirit. In politics, as has been noted before, she made history, becoming the first Republican woman from Virginia to serve in this House. In fighting for everything she believed in up until the last day of her bout with cancer, Jo Ann taught us how to make every moment on this Earth count. Jo Ann was a true gentlelady from Virginia. She was a woman of faith and family who had an unshakable commitment to the principles of our Nation's Founders and of our Nation's military. 
   As was indicated by my colleagues before, Jo Ann was a true patriot. And though she spent only a mere 10 years in elected office, she left a profound imprint on national and State politics. The State of Virginia and our country will miss her greatly. All of us talk about the experiences and recall with much sadness, but yet appreciation, that we did have the time we did with Jo Ann Davis. 
   I, like many of my Virginia colleagues, served with Jo Ann in the Virginia legislature. I had 3 years with Jo Ann. We served together on the General Laws Committee in the Virginia House of Delegates. It was there that I first saw this incredibly strong woman with a will to make sure that she did the right thing regardless. 
   We had adjoining districts. We shared many of the same community interests. Jo Ann was a believer and a promoter of the James River. As was noted earlier by my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Scott), she cared greatly about the Ghost Fleet there as well as making sure that Virginia was no longer a dumping ground for out-of-state trash. 
   As has been noted, Jo Ann was a great person of faith. I had the tremendous fortune of visiting the Land of Israel with Jo Ann and Chuck and saw firsthand how much her faith meant to her. Regardless of what you say about Jo Ann Davis, I think we can all agree that Jo Ann Davis was never concerned about being politically correct. She carried the bill to make sure that we recognized the holiday of Christmas and that the issue of faith and God was not taken out of the public realm. 
   Jo Ann spoke her mind when she had opinions about this war in Iraq. When it came down to it, she cared about her troops, her constituents, her family, and her God. We all will miss Jo Ann tremendously. I want to, at this time, also extend to her family, to Chuck, to her two sons, her granddaughter, a great deal of sympathy. We will miss her.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I commend those sponsors of the bill who brought this piece of legislation to the floor. And I rise to recount a story that I was told in August when I was in Israel with several of our colleagues. We visited a young family who was then living in Sderot. And the mother told a story about the pain that her children are living through and about the requirement that her kids now understand that wherever they go throughout their day, they must first know where the safe room is because they will know ultimately that rocket will sound and the kids will have to scurry to safety. 
   But what touched me the most about the story of this young family was the mother, again, explained how 2 years ago they uprooted their family from Gush Katif, a community in the south of Gaza when Israel pulled out of the Gaza Strip. And it was then that her children asked her, why, Mother? Why do we have to do this? And she explained to the children that they have to do this to give peace a chance so that they and the people of Israel could live in peace and live a normal life. And now where are they? 
   Clearly, a contagion of fear has spread across their community. But they should ask, what is it that they've done wrong to live under these kind of conditions? 
   And frankly, whatever conclusion the world comes to, we know now that the only crime they've committed is trying to live in freedom in a Jewish state. And that is what Hamas is going after, because for Hamas and their terrorist allies, the primary objective is to destroy Israel. 
   But important to all of us in this Congress is the fact that what befalls  Israel in its struggle against Hamas, its rockets and other attacks have severe implications for us in America and the rest of the civilized world. The Israeli people are squaring off against an arm of the radical Islamic movement that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, al Qaeda in northwest Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Hezbollah in Iran. Hamas' success and ability to win sympathy from the world will only motivate and encourage these various movements. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as the United Nations engages in its denunciation of Israel's acts of defense, we in America must unite in solidarity with our only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel.

   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentlelady. And I want to commend the committee for bringing this bill forward, but really take some difference in the remarks that were made regarding the gentlelady from Virginia's amendment on the 287(g) program. I couldn't think of anything that would be more effective in helping us enforce the law in the interior of this country than additional funds for this program. 
   As some of the speakers prior to me have said, we need all hands on deck as far as the criminal population that has made its way into this country. We need the ability to go after these criminals, in the words of the gentleman from Kentucky, these rapists, these murderers and these thieves. And there is no more effective way to identify them than to empower the folks, the first responders that are on the ground in our communities across this country. 
   Now, some of the words from the gentleman of North Carolina, the chairman of the subcommittee, were that, in fact, we have too much money in this program and it hasn't been used, and, in fact, they are unobligated funds. Well, then I would say to the gentleman and to my colleagues that we haven't done our job, because we have got to do our job to put the vision out there that we intend to get serious about the illegal immigration population, especially those that are criminals in this country. 
   The American people expect us to enforce the law. This vehicle allows the Federal Government to step up to the plate to provide local law enforcement and our agencies at home the necessary resources and the tools with which to identify and apprehend the illegal population that has run afoul of our law in the interior of this country. 
   Not more than a month ago we saw the individuals in New Jersey; we saw them apprehended, planning a terrorist attack on Fort Dix in that State. Later, we come to find out that those individuals had had various run-ins with the law, and in fact, combined, 75 times had been involved with some type of either traffic violation or other criminal interdiction, but yet these individuals were never identified as being illegal. 
   We have got to make sure that that scenario is not repeated. We have got to empower the most powerful force we've got, which is that on the grounds and in our local community. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to join the gentlelady from Virginia Beach in making sure that we adequately fund this program and insist that our local law enforcement agencies have the necessary tools and the resources that they need to assist in enforcing the law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, in listening to the debate, I can't help but think about 5 1/2 years ago and the 9/11 attacks and the simultaneous bursting of the technology bubble here in this country. It was the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 that provided a desperately needed shot in the arm, lifting us from our malaise and dispelling fears that the economy was sliding irrevocably into recession. But, today, after years of steady economic growth marked by a surging stock market, low inflation and low unemployment, a deflated housing market has shaken confidence in this economy. 
   With the tax cuts set to expire in 2010, the last thing investors and the American people need right now is the largest tax hike in the history of our country, and that is the reality they are smart enough to see, despite claims on the other side of the aisle otherwise. 
   The real difference between the Ryan budget and that of the majority is whether you believe that tax cuts expiring is a tax hike. I do, and I think the American families who will bear the brunt of a $400 billion tax increase will likewise. 
   In my State of Virginia, the effects are particularly acute, with taxpayers on average facing $3,120 in additional taxes each year. Around the country, 45 million families with children will be hit by an average tax increase of $2,864. Again, this is because the majority does not agree that expiring tax cuts are a tax hike. I do. 
   Instead of choking our economy, we need to make the tax cuts permanent. If we let the Democratic tax hike genie out of the bottle, it is going to be awfully hard to put it back in.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Committee on Ways and Means certified that the underlying legislation contained no earmarks, and under the rules there is no other way to challenge that certification, which is one of the reasons why I stand before you today. 
   Provisions in H.R. 6899 calling for the restructuring of the New York Liberty Bonds is clearly an earmark. This earmark is worth $1.2 billion and stands to benefit one entity, which is New York City. 
   I have a letter, Mr. Speaker, dated October 30, 2007, from the chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation in which he determines that the New York Liberty Zone tax incentives is a limited tax benefit and therefore an earmark. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, according to House rule XXI, clause 9, and the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, this earmark should have been disclosed along with the Member that requested the same. 
   From all reports, Mr. Speaker, instead of going through the proper procedure, disclosing that this was going to be included in the bill, this provision was air-dropped into the bill over the weekend at the last minute without any ability for any of the Members to know that this was in the bill. 
   Reports say that it is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Rangel, that has requested this earmark. Yet how are we to know whether Chairman Rangel is the sponsor of this earmark, since there has been no transparency and no notification as required under the rule? 
   Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, this earmark produces no energy for American families, and the way that the majority plans to pay for this earmark is by raising taxes on job creation as well as energy production. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear a lot today during the debate about revenue sharing and the fact that many coastal States, including my State of Virginia, will not be able to share in any of the revenues resulting from energy exploration off our coast. In light of this, in light of the fact that there is no incentive whatsoever to produce energy in this bill, in light of that, when we see that the majority is channeling $1.2 billion to New York City for an earmark for a project that only benefits that locality, I think that we understand now what the intent of the majority is in bringing the bill to the floor in this form. 
   There is zero relationship between increasing American energy production and this earmark, Mr. Speaker, which again underlies my objection and is one of the reasons why I raise this point of order. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I would say in all respect to my colleague from New York, I still don't understand how the insertion of this earmark, this insertion of $1.2 billion, has anything whatsoever to do with this bill, has anything whatsoever to do with increasing American energy production, which is the purpose of this bill, which is the majority's stated purpose, that we want to increase American energy production. 
   But, instead, what the gentlelady talks about, again, is not at all responsive to what it was that I was raising. We don't have to have a vote on this issue if the gentlelady would accept unanimous consent to remove the earmark from the bill to go forward. 
   Again, why are we having this earmark, this $1.2 billion earmark? This is exactly what the American public is so upset with Congress about, the fact that we have a bill that is designed to increase American energy production to help us try and wean off of the incredible reliance that we have on foreign oil. Why? The public has to be asking why in the world would we be inserting $1.2 billion in directed funds to one locality. Why in the world would we be doing that? 
   It does not make any sense. The fact that the Ways and Means Committee has certified that this is not an earmark, to me, flies in the face of the open and honest way that the majority has said they would run this House. 
   Again, I have a letter from the chief of staff from the Committee on Joint Tax which says that the New York City Liberty Bonds and the provisions calling for their restructuring is an earmark. Again, I say to the majority, if we are going to be straightforward in our desire to solve the problem of American energy production, this earmark has no place in the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, all I would say is the histrionics that we have already seen on the majority side of the aisle indicate the sensitivity of the matter of earmarks. 
   We, I think, all have noticed that the public has an increasing awareness of the way that this body operates, and they have a great dissatisfaction aimed towards this process. That's why we raise this issue. It is just completely unfair. It smacks of a smoke-filled room, behind-closed-doors dealings that is not befitting of this institution. 
   Frankly, it is not what the American people want, nor what they deserve.     
   That is the reason for raising this question surrounding the $1.2 billion that has been requested by what reports have said was Chairman Rangel of the Ways and Means Committee. 
   Again, on their own, liberty bonds should stand a test of this House; but it should not be a provision inserted in a bill that is meant to increase American energy production so that we can bring down gas prices. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, first of all I would like to congratulate the gentlelady from California on her election as Speaker and look forward to serving with her. 
   I just ran into a reporter on the outside of the Chamber who asked me about the tone of debate and what I thought the tone would be going forward. I agree with Leader BOEHNER when he spoke in this Chamber just a little bit earlier about the fact that we can debate, we can differ in a nice way, and I think that is what the American people expect.     
   But they also expect rigorous debate here on the floor of the House. I am asking my colleagues to reject the previous question. Because if we look at the message from this election, the American people spoke out: They want change. They want us to change the way that Washington does business. And in fact, a little less than 2 years ago, then Minority Leader Pelosi saw fit to send a letter to the former Speaker Hastert spelling out the way that she thought this House should run, how we should change, a prescription to correct the so-called ills that my friend from Massachusetts mentioned earlier of the 109th Congress. So if we defeat the previous question, we in the House will be allowed to bring up what has been called the minority bill of rights, and this again was the recipe for change that then minority Leader Pelosi saw fit that was the  right prescription for the ills that affected this institution or allegedly affected this institution. 
   So it just doesn't make sense for us to be here today and somehow in spirit of bipartisanship, transparency, civility, to be going back on that pledge to honor the rights of all Americans so that we can have an open debate in this House. It doesn't make sense to follow the adage, ``Do as I say, not as I do.'' 
   So I would urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question, allow there to be light, allow there to be transparency, not just after we pass the first 100 hours of this Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. Frankly, I think that the American people are looking for some common sense when we talk about an energy plan. I don't think there is any disagreement among my colleagues in this House that we certainly ought to be looking at ways to diversify our energy sources. There is no question. 
   But I think that the imperative, and that most Americans would agree, that we must first look to securing our energy independence. I would dare say there aren't many experts out there who would predict that we can establish our energy independence through the tax benefits allowed through this bill. 
   I think most Americans would agree we do have a fossil fuel economy. And given the instability around the globe today, it is imperative that we do all we can to support our domestic production industries so that we do not, do not find ourselves on the receiving end of the global pricing structure or from other countries that we rely on for our global energy supplies. 
   With that, I would posit, Mr. Speaker, that $14 billion in taxes on our production industry will do so much to damage the incentive to see an increase in domestic production, much less do anything to help our constituents and the people of this country when they go to the pump and see prices nearing $3 a gallon. 
   So I don't see the common sense in this bill. My colleagues have already talked about the $6 billion in taxpayer funds that are going to flow to localities unfettered. These are taxpayer dollars. These are not our dollars. This kind of allocation of funds deserves some transparency. This reminds me of some of the hidden funds that we see in many of the other bills, and that somehow this money is going to show up and add to our energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, having returned from a heart-wrenching trip to Virginia Tech yesterday, it is hard to stand here and find words to express the pain and sorrow that has befallen that community. As a parent of a student approaching college age, there is absolutely nothing more upsetting than seeing young people cut down in the prime of their lives. 
   I will never forget, Mr. Speaker, the raw emotions that filled that convocation arena yesterday as I, along with my colleagues from Virginia, mourned with some 12,000 friends and family members of victims, half of whom at least were clad in Hokie maroon and orange. Nor will I forget the sight of a bereaved father who, overwhelmed with grief, simply collapsed. 
   When an act of random cruelty bewilders us and pulls us down, the sort of love, generosity, courage and heroism we have seen in Blacksburg and its response serves as a counterforce. It replenishes us and demonstrates, as the Bible says, that ``love is strong as death.'' 
   We Virginians are resilient people, and I already know that under the strong leadership of President Charlie Steger, our brothers and sisters at Virginia Tech will band together and make it through this tragedy. 
   Mr. Speaker, in response to a moving plea from Virginia Tech's resident poet toward the end of the convocation ceremony, the crowd there erupted into cheers of ``Let's go Hokies.'' It was a moving call to action. Let the healing begin. 
   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I stand here with a heavy heart, and extend my deepest sympathies, especially to the families of those students who lost their lives.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I rise in support of the gentlelady's amendment because, as has been so eloquently said prior, the fact that this amendment simply attempts to cut .5 percent from the extraordinary levels of expenditure in this bill. It amounts to a $107 million reduction in the rate of growth of spending. Again, a $107 million reduction in the rate of growth. So instead of the bill growing, since last year, by 9.9 percent, the bill will then grow by 9.4 percent. That's all we're talking. 
   Points have been made that if the average American family is faced with a requirement that they reduce their budget by .5 percent, I think everyone, everyone who has a job and can do that would do that. And that is the situation we're in. 
   I want to respond to some of the remarks that were made by the chairman when he said that this is just another effort by the GOP to somehow cripple agencies that help poor people, that help people who can't help themselves. You know, that is just not the case. We are in support and have continued to be, our side of the aisle continues to be supportive of American families to allow them to take control of their own future, and for us here in Congress to recognize that the government doesn't spend government money, it spends taxpayer money. That's the bottom line. 
   We cannot just sit here and think that we can solve everybody's problem just by having government step in and do it. So this is taking a very reasonable approach to say, okay, let's go ahead and cut by .5 percent.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I rise in opposition to this bill. 
   And, Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to some of the remarks that were just made about somehow the Republicans are against insuring poor children and offering them access to health care. 
   I can tell you one thing, this Republican was not in this body when President Clinton was in office. So I could never have been against this program before I'm for it. So I take issue with that. 
   I am for, as I believe most of my colleagues are for, a program that provides access to health care for poor children, but what we have here is a 400 percent increase in the SCHIP price tag because what the majority has done has increased eligibility to the 400 percent level over poverty. In many areas of this country, we're well in excess of families who are making $100,000 a year. These are children, 90 percent of whom already have health care coverage. 
   So what that means is the price that we pay for this type of expansion is a dangerous lurch forward toward a Washington-based, bureaucratic-controlled health care system. Which  medicines will we get? Which surgeries will be available? And when? And when? Which disease is worth treating? These are the vital choices that right now American families are able to make, but frankly, the majority wants the government to make. 
   But how do they pay for this? They pay for this largely by cutting Medicare. That's what we're about here, choosing to cut Medicare, cut seniors' ability to have a choice under the Medicare program so we can provide access to insurance for children whose parents make over $100,000 a year. That just doesn't make any sense. 
   Now, secondly, Mr. Speaker, I would say as my colleagues before me, another way that this bill is funded is a brand-new tax on health insurance for all Americans that have health insurance policies. 
   Again, the bill creates a health care competitiveness-affected research trust fund. That's another attempt basically to allow perhaps, if not run right, a government bureaucrat to dictate which therapies a physician can use. 
   The bottom line, this bill is misguided. We need to take a much better look at this, and frankly, the last point I was going to make, Mr. Speaker, is this bill makes it up to the States, optional, whether to require documentation as to anyone who is legal who wants to receive benefits under this. This is another attempt, Mr. Speaker, at allowing our SCHIP benefits to go to illegal immigrants, something that I don't believe the American public is in favor of.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the ranking member, Mr. Ryan. 
   Mr. Speaker and Members of the House, you know, when I sit here in almost astonishment and thinking, it's the fact that even though we are witnessing the massive tax hikes that are embedded in the Democrat budget, in fact, the largest tax increase in American history, what the majority's budget fails to do, it fails to stop the raid on Social Security. 
   In the year 2012, the Social Security fund will be running a surplus of $99 billion. As we know, the Federal Government has experience and has collected more in Social Security taxes than it pays out in benefits since 1984. Instead of using this money to shore up Social Security, instead of using it to do something to honor the contract that this government has made with the seniors, the Democrat budget spends that cash surplus on other programs. 
   What is astonishing is the fact that this very House, last week, in a vote on the Republican motion to recommit to stop the raid on Social Security, this House, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, supported the end of that raid. But here we have the Democrat budget that goes back on that word represented by the bipartisan vote and starts again with the raid on Social Security surplus. 
   In contrast, the Republican budget that was offered several weeks ago does just the opposite, and, in fact, uses the surplus that will exist in 2012 to begin to shore up the Social Security system and to improve and enhance the vitality of that program for today's seniors. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly recommend a ``no'' vote on this conference budget report.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, just as she did this evening, on November 9 of this year, Speaker Pelosi stood on the floor of this House and told the American people that the middle class was long overdue for tax relief. She said that an AMT bill had to be about tax fairness, fiscal responsibility and keeping America competitive. 
   Yet, once again, Mr. Speaker, the current attempt at patching the AMT rings hollow. As the ranking member indicated, we know where this debate is going; and, frankly, we know where this bill is going: nowhere. This attempt, just as others that have failed, illustrates to me the disconnect between this majority in this House and the American people. In fact, it echoes what's been going on in this House over the last several weeks, if not months. Here we are a week and a half before Christmas and we've not finished the work that the American people sent us here to do. 
   But, in fact, it is the disconnect between the majority leadership and middle-class American families that troubles me most. If you look at what's going on out there, families are worried about the flagging economy which has fueled alarming levels of anxiety. In spite of a weak dollar, skyrocketing gas prices, falling home values, and other mounting concerns, the Democrat majority in this House refuses to accept the reality of a $2,000 plus tax hike facing millions of middle-class families. 
   Let's get to work. Let's realize that this bill isn't going anywhere. 
   The House majority refuses to cut taxes or sustain expiring growth, pro-growth tax cuts without first raising other taxes. Their dogged adherence to this policy as it applies to AMT puts them at odds with the American people. 
   The overwhelmingly bipartisan Senate bill, as has been said, rightly abandoned the misguided idea of raising taxes to cut taxes just so Washington can spend more. In this tax fight the stakes for everyday families are high, and the potential consequences are severe. 
   Mr. Speaker, just 4 weeks ago Speaker Pelosi stood here and promised the middle class tax fairness and fiscal responsibility. In light of this attempt, I wonder why we can't just come together, stop the political games, and  support real tax relief for 23 million American families.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Madam Speaker, just 2 days ago, on February 14, Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, posted a speech on an Islamist Web site where he blessed jihad fighters in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Somalia and urged the mujahadeen all over world to remain steadfast since complete victory was near. He made special mention of those in the Islamic jihadist media and thanked them for their blessed efforts which cause the Crusaders to lose sleep. 
   There is no doubt about it, Madam Speaker. We are fighting against an enemy that uses every weapon at its disposal to inflict casualties upon our soldiers in the field. This enemy seeks not just victory in Iraq but the reestablishment of a greater Islamic caliphate that would threaten the security of America and freedom-loving people throughout the world. 
   Today, this House will vote on a nonbinding resolution that disapproves of a surge in Iraq, a resolution that discourages our troops yet fails to satisfy the antiwar movement of America's left. 
   The resolution will likely pass today with near unanimous support of my friends on the other side of the aisle. Yet, Madam Speaker, I am troubled by their seeming unwillingness to accept the real consequences of this outcome. This from the party of John F. Kennedy, who so inspired our Nation when he said in his inaugural address: ``Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe in order to ensure the survival and the success of liberty.'' 
   Madam Speaker, we have come a long way since our Nation's 35th President spoke those words 46 years ago. 
   This debate arrives at an historic time in our Nation's history, not because of the resolution we are considering today but because the results of our efforts in Iraq will have a true impact on the lives of our soldiers and the security of all of us for generations to come. 
   Recently, I received a letter from one of my constituents who expressed some very real concerns about the Democrats' view of the war in Iraq. He writes: ``I am a servicemember that has served in Iraq, training Iraqis. I have 19 years of service. I spent 6 years in the Virginia Army National Guard, and I am entering my 13th year of active Federal service. 
   ``Pulling out of Iraq doesn't send the right message to those we are fighting,'' he said. ``Not enough is being said about what the U.S. will do if we withdraw and what will happen in the midst of a power vacuum ..... '' 
   The soldier went on to say: ``I personally served in the streets of Baghdad in 2006, and I would have felt better serving, thinking that both houses of Congress gave me their full support.'' 
   Madam Speaker, what we debate in this House, how we conduct ourselves, does have real consequences. Some of our country's bravest are on the battlefield and on the streets of Baghdad as we speak. 
   We have seen throughout our history what happens when our resolve is weak. In 1993 this country half-heartedly supported the commitment of troops to subdue the violent warlords of Somalia. The precipitous withdrawal in the face of casualties left a chaotic nation to this day that harbors terrorists and is a feeding ground for instability. 
   The lessons of history must not be forgotten as we face a determined enemy of Islamic terrorists who are waging a war upon freedom. 
   Madam Speaker, the American people want us to fight and win in Iraq and bring our troops home. Our soldiers seek nothing more than the support they require to perform their mission and the knowledge that the American people believe that their sacrifice is necessary and noble. 
   Contrary to some of those on the other side of the aisle who have stood here in this well believing and saying  that this debate is a breath of fresh air, our enemies will be the only ones satisfied by this debate. They will have received all the political rhetoric they require to convince their followers that complete victory is at hand. One can only imagine with horror how many Islamic radicals will be inspired to continue the fight after this House resolves that it supports our troops but not the mission we ask them to perform. 
   To those who support this resolution and oppose any effort to achieve victory in Iraq, I challenge you to be true to your convictions and bring a binding resolution to the floor to cut off funds for our troops, because that is really what this is all about. 
   Madam Speaker, I oppose this resolution and urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and send a message worth hearing to America, our soldiers, and our enemies.

   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the majority's proposal to cut $764 million from missile defense just as a genocidal Iran kicks into high gear its missile buildup and sprints toward the nuclear finish line. The incongruity of this proposal is perplexing. These proposed cuts don't make any sense. 
   Iran has made its intentions clear: the liquidation of the state of Israel and the United States of America. Add to the mix Iran's historic cooperation with terror groups and we have the perfect storm on our hands. 
   Iran, before long, will have the missiles to reach all of Europe and the United States. We must do all we can to ensure that we cannot be hit or held hostage. We must invest in a robust, layered missile defense that can defend America and her allies against immediate, near-term, and long-term threats posed by Iran and other rogue regimes. 
   Madam Chair, amid the dangers, how can we decrease our investment in missile defense? Gambling our national security on the illusion that our enemies won't have the resources, technology and wherewithal to launch that first missile into an American school, shopping mall or sports arena is a risk that we should not take. Failing to prepare for this reality could lead to catastrophe, the consequences unfathomable.

   I, too, rise this evening to pay tribute to a fellow Virginian and a great leader in America's conservative movement. 
   Dr. Jerry Falwell made his mark as an outspoken, passionate advocate for conservative causes. More than any other 20th century Virginian, Jerry Falwell's passion and convictions sparked a new generation of grassroots activism. 
   Recently, as my friend from the Sixth District noted, I visited with Dr. Falwell in his office on the campus of his beloved Liberty University. During that visit, I gleaned a little more and had gained a little more insight into this impressive public figure. 
   Jerry Falwell, a man of faith, was a pastor who loved his congregation. He was chancellor of a growing university, a place that began just as a vision, but one that he built into a thriving reality that has become a major educational and economic force in Virginia. 
   Jerry Falwell was a husband, father, and grandfather who actively engaged in the affairs of this Nation because he, like all of us, wanted to leave behind a country better, more hopeful, and filled with greater opportunity than even the one he inherited from his parents. 
   The people of the Commonwealth of Virginia have lost a son and the American people a true patriot.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, for many hard-working families, the American Dream and homeownership are one and the same, but lately that dream appears increasingly elusive in the face of ballooning costs of homeowners' insurance and rising interest rates on home mortgages. Nowhere is this discomforting trend more profound than in States ravaged by natural disasters. 
   Today we have the ability to help. Congress can enhance the way the law treats mortgage interest, giving American families more buying power when shopping for their dream home. We can also improve how it treats mortgage insurance, assisting those low-income families generally required to pay this insurance to afford better housing. 
   The bill, Mr. Speaker, in its current form, however, has a glaring weakness. When it comes to disaster relief, it only names the victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which would help families stricken by hurricanes in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. There are countless Americans beset by the recent tornadoes and wildfires in other parts of the country. Their plight is indistinguishable from those families of hurricane-plagued regions. A disaster befalls an area, home insurance rates skyrocket, and, together with the rise in mortgage interest rates, the American dream of owning a home is dashed. 
   This motion to recommit sets aside funds for families in districts in Kansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, in the past, the majority has described motions to recommit promptly rather than forthwith as an attempt to kill the underlying bill. In this case, this is categorically incorrect. The minority has in effect been prevented by the Democrat rule from offering this language as a forthwith amendment. 
   As the majority knows, the housing fund in this bill, section 139 on page 127, is a violation of rule XXI, clause 4, because it is appropriating on an authorizing bill. The Democrat rule waives this rule for the underlying bill, but does not provide a waiver for the motion to recommit or any amendments. Therefore, the minority was given no other option than to offer a motion to recommit promptly and comply with House rules. 
   Mr. Speaker, this motion is a genuine effort to improve this bill with the language we can all agree on ought to be included. In its current form, the bill is far too vague. 
   Starting brand new government grant programs to help fund more bureaucracies is not the way to go. Instead, policies that have already worked to create record levels of homeownership is preferable. This recommit inserts new language to offset the cost of subsequent legislation that would enhance, continue and expand policies promoting homeownership, such as the construction and rehabilitation of housing destroyed by natural disasters and wildfires. The motion would provide for programs to enhance, continue, expand policies promoting home ownership by reducing the cost of mortgage insurance, reducing the cost of financing residences for veterans, reducing the cost of mortgage interest and reducing the costs of homeowner insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, while the underlying bill does provide that Affordable Housing Fund money can be used to help victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it is incumbent upon us to recognize the plight of families suffering from natural disasters recently affecting other areas of the country. Families in Kansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana deserve no less. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit.

   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I think what we are hearing across the country today is a collective sigh of relief on the part of tens of millions of American families who now will not be subjected to an over $3,000 tax increase this year. This is real relief for real people and real families to compensate for a flagging economy and the soaring cost of living. 
   Yet with the economic anxiety gripping this country, it is just astounding to me that it took so long to bring a clean AMT bill to the floor. As the majority's concession makes clear, this was the wrong time to raise taxes on the American people. The government never intended to collect the AMT revenue from the 21 million American families who this year would have fallen under the AMT net. 
   So the horror stories that we continue to hear all year long about increasing the deficit was thus only smoke and mirrors for a desire to raise taxes. And thank goodness we are here today because passage of this bill is vindication for those of us who refuse to cave in to tax-and-spend onslaught, and it is my only wish that this day had come sooner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is very simple. It strikes the tax hike from the bill. A vote for this motion to recommit gives us all an opportunity to vote for the underlying bill whose purpose is to provide relief to homeowners impacted by the subprime crisis without raising taxes on America's families. I, for one, don't believe we should raise taxes on one family to cut taxes for another. 
   Contrary to the remarks made by my friend from Oregon who alleges that some are gaming the system, which could or could not be true, there is an instance, and plenty of which occur, that will impact real families. If we don't pass this motion to recommit, there will be a real cost to real people and real families who are relying on the equity built up in their greatest asset, their home. 
   Take, for example, a family that moves to a new area in search of a job. If that family currently lives in an area with a depressed housing market and the family intends to return in the future, they may make the reasonable decision to rent their home instead of selling it. They would do so in hopes of recovering some of the home's value in the next few years. 
   Under existing law, if they later move back to their home and, having lived at least 2 years in the home for the last 5, any gains realized from the eventual sale of the home would be excluded from the tax up to $500,000. The underlying bill, however, will change that. Families that move back into their old house after several years and then intend to sell it could be facing tens of thousands of dollars in additional tax bills when they later sell that home. This is nothing more than a tax increase on those American families, an additional burden on families that are trying to put their children through school, provide health care and live the American Dream. 
   This provision adds another level of complexity to an already complicated Tax Code. Bottom line, Mr. Speaker, the net effect is to take away from some American families a tax benefit that they are currently enjoying. 
   We, in this House, should be making it easier for the American people to comply with the Tax Code, and we should strive to make it easier for them to provide for their families. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the opponents of this motion will argue that because the motion directs the committee to report back promptly that somehow this kills the bill; that simply is not true. Instead, it directs the committee to reconsider the bill. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the Senate is in recess next week and the House schedule is extremely light. If this motion passes, we will have plenty of time next week to improve the bill. And I, for one, pledge to work with the chairman, as I'm sure our leadership will and our ranking member, so that we can have a good bill waiting for the Senate when they return from their week-long recess. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill has a tax increase in it. I urge support of this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the gentleman. 
   First of all, let me respond to some of the assertions made by our friend from Illinois. He tries to portray this as a choice, a budget document that represents a choice between the Iraqi people and the American people. I beg to differ with the gentleman. 
   This budget document is not a choice about that. This budget document represents a choice about the future of where we're going in this country. This represents a choice about whether we here in Washington are actually going to do something for the American people. 
   You know, if you think about the American people right now when they're watching us on TV, you know, I don't blame them when they look at the TV in disgust and say, you know, they just don't get it up in Washington.     
   They believe, and they're right, that Washington is broken and we have got to do something to fix it. Frankly, we have got to get the Federal Government working for the people again. But that means we have got to spend less. 
   The gentleman from Wisconsin talked about the fact that there is absolutely no treatment, no curtailment of anything having to do with the earmark question. Earmarks are just the tip of the iceberg as far as our spending culture is here in Washington. Let's go ahead and take the first step. Let's reform that process because we have got to spend less. 
   Let's face it: gas prices, they're too high. The American public is sick and tired of excuses coming out of Washington. But the way to fix it is not to put more burden on the American family while they are already facing the prospects of $4-a-gallon gas this summer. That's just not what we do. People across this country are worried about their health care. They're worried about their jobs. This stuff about we're going to provide you with middle-class tax cuts, have you looked to see what's in this document? This document will lead us to the largest tax increase in American history. 
   The choice here is not between whether we are going to provide for our national security and the people of America. The choice here is whether we are going to trust in the people to control their own destiny.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (PORK-BARREL SPENDING -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. I thank the distinguished gentleman from Texas for yielding, and I thank him for his leadership on the issue of the Federal budget and what we should be doing to ensure that we are stewards of the Federal budget just as all the families across this country are expected to be stewards of their own family budget. 
   Now, Madam Speaker, as a proud Virginian, I would like to point to a few of the origins of the earmark discussion that occurred many, many years ago, frankly, shortly after the founding of this country. And that great Virginian Thomas Jefferson, he wrote a letter to James Madison, another great Virginian, dated March 6, 1796, challenging Madison's proposition for improvements to roads used in the system of national mail delivery, and it was directed at the idea that we should be, as Members, actually directing public funds, taxpayer dollars, into our States. 
   President Jefferson wrote, in the context of directing Federal dollars, ``It will be a scene of eternal scramble among the Members, who can get the most money wasted in their State; and they will always get most who are meanest.'' 
   I think this shows that the debate around earmarks is not a new one, and I think also that the impression of then Mr. Jefferson is something that we ought to pay attention to and something that we ought to, frankly, pay heed when we are talking about the challenges that we are facing today in this country. 
   The gentleman from Texas talked about the tremendous lack of confidence that the American public has in this Democrat-controlled Congress. It is stunning to see the public opinion numbers of what the American public thinks about the performance of this Congress. Nothing to be proud of. 
   I believe that that dissatisfaction, frankly, is grounded, first of all, in the inability of this Congress and this majority to solve the problems that real people are facing in their lives each and every day in their communities. All they hear are solutions based on the premise that this government in Washington somehow needs more of their hard-earned dollars. And over and over again, we continue to hear the message, and we know that this town, that this Congress, and this majority is broken. We are not rising to the occasion, fixing the problems facing the American people. And yet we continue to see a steady stream of bills making their way to the floor where we continue to see proposals to raise taxes, to take people's hard-earned money, and then we see those dollars turned around and appropriated into the earmark process. 
   My friend from Texas was very accurate in his quotes, right on point. We have heard over and again Members of the majority leadership, when they were in the minority, when they have become the majority leadership, continue to pledge, ``We pledge to make this the most honest, ethical, and open Congress in history.'' That was from then minority leader Ms. Pelosi in 2006.     
   She then went on to say, ``This is a place where we really need to throw up the shades and pull back the curtains.'' And she said, ``We have to have the fullest possible disclosure, and it has to be on earmarks in appropriations, in authorizations and in taxation. And it has to be across the board, with no escape hatches.'' 
   There was another remark made, ``There has to be transparency. I'd just as soon do away with all earmarks, but that probably isn't realistic.'' 
   Now, again, we need to dedicate ourselves to fixing the problems that this country has to try to address their distrust of this government. And the first thing that we ought to do is be mindful that the many, many earmarks that make their way through this Congress frankly are not out, shone in the light of day as the majority had promised. They are not being held accountable for some of these expenditures that are being made. This is at the crux of the public's distrust of Washington. 
   And again, while we are facing the prospects of $4 and $5 a dollar gas at the pump, while families have real issues and their pocketbook is being pinched, we continue to see the unbelievable, unprecedented torrent of billions of dollars going into special interest projects and into pork that, frankly, most American people don't approve of. 
   It should not be about pork. It should be about paychecks. We should be focusing our attention and we should be focusing the investment of taxpayer dollars towards job creation. We ought to be rewarding those people who invest their dollars and give them back more of their hard-earned money so that we can see more jobs created, because we do know that more jobs, longer lasting jobs and a stronger economy will stem from a strong private sector and a free-market system. 
   And with that, I want to again thank the gentleman from Texas for organizing this Special Order tonight on the very important topic of earmarks. And I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this amendment and take issue with the suggestion from the other side that somehow our generals and flag officers are tainted by the offers of employment upon leaving military service.  
   We are talking about individuals who have spent their entire professional lives serving in the United States of America. Our men and women in the uniformed services consistently hold themselves to a higher standard of ethical and moral conduct. They serve as role models for Americans all across this Nation. They deserve our respect, gratitude, and admiration. 
   This amendment imposes employment restrictions on general and flag officers that do not apply to any other officer or employee of the executive or legislative branch. In fact, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania who spoke before said, this amendment would ensure that our Nation's senior military leaders are governed by more restrictive postemployment rules than Members of Congress are. 
   Current postemployment prohibitions and restrictions in title 18 already apply to officers and employees of the executive and legislative branches, including general and flag officers. Current law does not generally prohibit employment, but rather restricts what individuals can do for 1- or 2-year periods following government service. 
   Finally, Madam Chair, this amendment hints of an antimilitary sentiment that will have an adverse impact on military officers serving in military grades below general and flag rank. 
   Our Nation's men and women serving in the military today have made tremendous sacrifices in the service of our country. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and send a message to our Nation's senior military leaders that we appreciate their service, recognize their sacrifice, and honor their integrity.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to just first respond. I rise in favor of this amendment and respond to some of the remarks that were made on the other side of the aisle. 
   I think we can all agree that we must continue as a people to invest in our people, to invest in this country. All of us, all of us were elected by the constituents that we represent to leave an America stronger and more secure than the way we found it, stronger and more secure for our children and our grandchildren. 
   The problem is here, every time we get a chance, every time we turn around, we seem to be raising taxes. There is no way that we can leave an America stronger or more secure if we somehow cut off the economic engine that allows us to continue to make the investments in our people of this Nation and in our security. 
   There were remarks made about the national debt that we are now experiencing. Well, you know what? The national debt, frankly, is 1 1/2 percent of GDP. And from all corners, from the economists to the former Federal Reserve Chairman to the current Federal Reserve Chairman, that 1 1/2 percent of GDP is a lot lower than it has been recently, and it is due to the very forward-thinking economic and tax policies that we have in place which reward risk-based investment which, frankly, don't shun the notion that we should empower the families and the businesses of this country so that they can take care of themselves. 
   And you know what? The revenues in this Federal Government are up beyond that which we've seen before. That's the product of the economic policies. That's our key to success and security of this country. 
   Now, as far as the pay-as-you-go rules that the majority has adopted, you know what that means? That means never cut spending, always raise taxes.     
   That is why we are here opposing this because, yes, this amendment allows us not to have to raise taxes to fund the expansion of the farm bill that the majority has proposed. 
   Again, I would just ask my colleagues to support the gentleman's amendment because the bottom line here is what we are talking about is the difference between raising taxes and raising spending or somehow getting ahold of ourselves, applying some fiscal discipline so that we can show the American people that we hear them when they say there is too much waste and spending in Washington.

   Also what the majority leader just said about our anger, and he understands our anger. Well, you know what? I don't think he understands our anger when he says it does no good to repeat the last 12 years of our feeling aggrieved. Because I can assure you that never once did we in the majority attempt to steal a vote, attempt to steal a vote to make sure, to make sure that illegal immigrants, to make sure that our position, the Republican position to defeat the ability for benefits to flow to illegal immigrants. That is what this is about. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, as the whip said before me, the gentleman from New York admits a mistake and apologizes. We accept that apology. It was a bad call. 
   But the price to pay for that bad call should be to admit that the motion to recommit passed, the bill should go back to committee, the committee does its work, and the bill comes back to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Chairman, today's debate on H.R. 547 ultimately is about finding ways for our Nation to reduce its dependence on petro fuels. I offer this amendment, Mr. Chairman, one in response to an issue that has caught the attention of the American people and is being wildly reported in the press. The subject of this report in the amendment is the request by the office of the Speaker for the use of a luxury jetliner. 
   Today, the New York Post cleverly questioned the ``Airogance,'' that is A-I-R, of a request to use a $22,000-an-hour taxpayer-funded luxury jetliner to fly the Speaker from coast to coast. 
   While citing security concerns, a request was made by the Office of the Speaker for a plane that, according to the Air Force, has a game room, a stateroom, entertainment center, bedroom, shower, and seats 42 to 50 people. 
   Now, Mr. Chairman, I hardly think these amenities help with security, and I personally would describe them at the very least as inappropriate and an unnecessary extravagance. 
   Again, H.R. 547 is about finding ways to shift our Nation's patterns of fuel consumption. We hear a lot of talk about doing everything we can to achieve energy independence. And there is a lot of talk as well about stopping global warming. In this context, Mr. Chairman, these reports and the underlying request by the Office of the Speaker is an extravagance of power. It is something that, frankly, the taxpayers won't swallow. And I urge the passage of this amendment.

   There was one Member on the other side of the aisle who said we ought to get on with the serious business of the day. Well, Mr. Chairman, the ability to fly on a jumbo jetliner is a privilege never before granted to a Member of Congress. And I know one thing, Mr. Chairman; the American taxpayers do expect us to take seriously the decisions surrounding the expenditure of those dollars. They expect us to respect that those tax dollars do not belong to the Speaker, do not belong to any of us. They are just that, the taxpayers' dollars. 
   They also expect us to lead by example, and I would want to pose to every speaker that spoke today and ask them, do they really in their heart of hearts support our Speaker having the access to a 42-seat jumbo jetliner?

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 7321, AUTO INDUSTRY FINANCING AND RESTRUCTURING ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I too rise with a lot of concern over what is about to happen on the floor of this House. Clearly, there are many in this country who are reeling because of job layoffs, insecurity in terms of their economic outlook, insecurity as far as their health care is concerned. We have got a set of problems, I think, unprecedented in this country, at least in our generation. We've got to remain focused on trying to solve problems. 
   And frankly, I think that the bill coming to the floor, otherwise known as the auto bailout, is just not the right way for us to go. I can't think of anything more nonsensical than replacing those in Detroit who have not been able to make a success out of the auto companies and replace them with, frankly, bureaucrats who are subject to the whim of the politicians here in Washington. It just doesn't make sense. 
   If private investors are not convinced of the Big Three restructuring plans, if they don't think they're realistic enough, then why in the world would we ask the taxpayers to step in to provide that kind of assistance? 
   The Big Three restructuring plan and the majority's proposal downright lack accountability. How do we know, what is the guarantee that the taxpayer money, that the restructuring promises will occur? 
   Once the taxpayers enter the game there will be a big incentive for the taxpayers to continue to prop up what could very well be a continuing failed enterprise. That's why we have to lock in the restructuring now. The restructuring shouldn't happen in a matter of months; it should happen in a matter of days or weeks. 
   And as the gentleman from Indiana spoke, there is certainly an ability for us to see this restructuring take place, concessions on the side of management, on labor, on the bondholders. And frankly, we've got a role here in Washington that, if the Big Three are serious in their restructuring efforts, we can provide an alternative, a backstop, a guarantee for debtor-in-possession financing if they were to enter some type of pre-packaged bankruptcy.

<DOCNO>Mr. CANTOR. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CANTOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Democrats' approach to try and patch the AMT, on several grounds. First of all, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Wisconsin to the application of the Democrats' PAYGO rule because it has turned into ``we cannot do anything in this body without raising taxes.'' Someone has likened this approach to tax hikes on speed dial, and I heartily agree. 
   But I also rise in opposition because I believe that this particular bill in the context of the larger bill being proposed by the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee is nothing but a job-killer. One of the statements made by my colleague on the other side of the aisle was that somehow this tax hike targets only some of the wealthiest individuals in the world. You know, that is probably what the Congress said back in 1969 when they were passing the AMT: we only want to tax the wealthy. 
   But when you look at it, this provision, the provision of carried interest impacts not just those famed partnerships in the money centers of this country but it impacts the real estate partnerships, the ``mom and pop'' investment partnerships across this country that, frankly, fuel seven out of ten jobs across America. Where in the world do we think these small businesses are going to come up with the money to pay these taxes? They are going to come up with the money by not creating new jobs; they are going to come up with the money by not offering health benefits to their employees. Let's face it, money does not come out of thin air. 
   The next allegation is no one is going to stop investing in this economy, no one is going on economic strike if we raise the price of investment in this country. Well, have you looked at what is going on in our financial markets today? Look at the announcement from China, shifting $1.4 trillion of their reserves out of the U.S. dollar. Have you looked at the fact that people are not investing in housing any more, the subprime mortgage crunch? 
   Mr. Speaker, I would say it is an understatement to say that this is a job-killer.

   I rise today in support of the Smith-Stupak amendment to strike the language eliminating the vitally important protections of the Mexico City Policy. I just believe it's wrong to force American taxpayers to subsidize organizations who actively promote abortion in foreign nations. 
   In response to some of the arguments on the other side that this is not about promoting abortion or not, I disagree. It's really not about providing contraceptives. This is about promoting abortion. Because as the gentleman from New Jersey was trying to say before he was cut off, there are NGOs that are in compliance with the Mexico City Policy which means that they neither perform nor actively promote abortions as a method of family planning in other nations. It is they who are eligible for assistance under the Mexico City Policy. It is they who should be getting the benefit, not those organizations that are promoting abortions around the world that can substitute the provision of these contraceptives to then use that money available to go and pursue their other agenda.

   Mr. Chairman, in all due respect to my good friend from California who knows I have a great deal of respect for him, this is not a sickening or pathetic amendment. It is not primitive, stupid or absurd, as it was described. It is not an ostrich amendment. And this is not a low blow, nor is anyone saying that the Speaker of this House is not an eloquent speaker and Representative as she goes forward out into the world as Speaker of this institution. 
   Nor would I tell my colleagues, is this an amendment about Member travel. No one says that we should not be about educating ourselves so that we can better effect public policy here in our roles as Members of this Congress and as Representatives of the constituents that elect us. 
   What this is about is about travel by an individual who is second in line to the President of the United States. Like it or not, for the 434 others of us, it does mean something different when the Speaker of the House goes somewhere. 
   As my friend from Iowa indicates, all reports say when the trip to Syria occurred, that somehow it was perceived on the ground and in the region that somehow the United States was embarking upon new foreign policy. 
   Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I would say from Iran's hot pursuit of nuclear weapons to Syria's eagerness to stir violence against our interests in the Middle East, America faces a growing list of terrorist states, as my good friend from California is well aware. And amidst such threats, the United States must speak forthrightly and with one voice. 
   Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, Cuba, they all are feeble states whose interests are diametrically opposed to ours. Their regimes are vulnerable to international sanction, and they will not change until America and its allies apply enough pressure to endanger their regimes. 
   I would just say when the Speaker of the House goes to these nations and it is perceived that somehow we are capitulating, it goes against our interests. That is what this amendment is about.
