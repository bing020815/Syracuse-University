<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I am disappointed--and the people of the 24th District of Texas are disappointed--by the continued misuse and abuse of the suspension calendar. Once again, Democrats bring to the floor a bill that prohibits Members from offering amendments. This comes at a time when we could be working on a comprehensive energy bill that would do far more to benefit the American people. 
   Energy should have been our highest priority this summer, but instead I'm afraid that Congress will leave for a five-week recess without considering real solutions to the energy crisis.     
   When is the Democratic leadership going to put the concerns of the American people before their desire to placate the radical environmentalists?

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (WILLIAM ``BILL'' CLAY POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill designating the facility of the United State Postal Service located at 11001 Dunklin Drive in St. Louis, Missouri as the William ``Bill'' Clay Post Office Building. Representing the people of St. Louis in this chamber for 32 years, Bill Clay was the consummate advocate for Civil Rights, labor, and his community. 
   Born in St. Louis, Missouri in April of 1931, Clay grew up in the city and graduated from St. Louis University in 1953 with a bachelors degree in Political Science. After 2 years with the U.S. Army from 1953 to 1955, Clay returned home to begin his career serving the people of St. Louis. After spending some time as a real estate broker, Clay was elected to the Board of Aldermen in 1959. He held this position, representing the 26th Ward until 1964. 
   When Bill Clay, Sr. was elected to Congress in 1968, he was the first African American member elected from Missouri and one of only two African American representatives from states west of the Mississippi River. Throughout his 16 terms in Congress, he gained a reputation for his streetwise urban politics. A staunch advocate for civil rights and social justice, he also served as one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus. From 1991 to 1995 he chaired the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service and served as the Ranking Member on the Education and the Workforce Committee until he retired. In all that he did while he was serving the people of Missouri in Congress, he still found time to author several books. 
   Bill Clay, Sr. retired from Congress in 2000 but his legacy lives on through his successor whom I am proud to serve with in this chamber. His successor also happens to be his son, the gentleman from Missouri, William Lacy Clay, Jr. 
   I urge my colleagues to support me in this resolution honoring a man who spent over 3 decades serving his community, state, and country.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (JULIA M. CARSON POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, Indianapolis, Indiana, as the ``Julia M. Carson Post Office Building.'' 
   Julia May Carson dedicated her life to the service of this country. Her career in public service began in 1972 when she was elected to the Indiana State House of Representatives. This was the first of many victories to come. 
   In her long and illustrious career, Julia never lost an election. In 1976, Julia ran for the Indiana State Senate, where she served 14 years. In 1990, she became the Trustee for the Center Township, a post she held for 6 years until she ran for the United States Congress, becoming both the first woman and the first African American to represent Indiana in Congress. 
   As a daughter of a single mother who worked as a housekeeper and a graduate of a segregated public school in Indiana, Julia's background was very different from those of her fellow representatives, but in the 10 years she served the Seventh District of Indiana, Julia never forgot her roots. She tried hard to represent the poor and the working class of Indiana, concentrated her energies on women's rights, children's issues, and efforts to reduce homelessness.  
   Throughout most of her time in Congress, Julia battled significant health problems. She finally succumbed to a lifelong struggle with lung cancer in December, 2007 at the age of 69. 
   In honor of her years of faithful service to her country and to the great State of Indiana, I ask my fellow Members to join me in support of this bill and rename the post office located at 2650 Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Street in Indianapolis, Indiana, in honor of her memory and long-lasting accomplishments. 
   I would like to thank Mr. Visclosky for introducing this resolution and express my strong support for this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (CONGRESSWOMAN JO ANN S. DAVIS POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, born in North Carolina but a Virginian since the age of 9, Jo Ann Davis set the standard for Republican women in Virginia. After graduating from high school in Hampton, Virginia, she attended Hampton Roads Business College and became a real estate agent. Prior to her election to the House of Representatives in November 2000, she served in the General Assembly of Virginia. Subsequently, she was the first Republican woman elected in her own right to the United States Congress from the Commonwealth. Congresswoman Davis served honorably for four terms as the representative of the First Congressional District of Virginia. 
   During her tenure, Congresswoman Davis served on the House Armed Services Committee and on the Foreign Affairs Committee. Congresswoman Davis was particularly proud of securing funding for the construction of the Navy's next-generation aircraft carrier, the CVN-21. 
   In 2001, the House passed her first piece of legislation, H.R. 1015, the SGLI Adjustment Act which increased the  amount of life insurance paid to beneficiaries of the Armed Forces who died in the performance of duty between November 2000 and April 2001. 
   In 2005, Congresswoman Davis was diagnosed with breast cancer. Tragically, in 2007, the cancer returned and her condition rapidly worsened. Congresswoman Davis died in October at the age of 57 leaving behind her husband, Chuck Davis, and two sons and a granddaughter. 
   Congresswoman Davis was an inspiration to so many of our Members, as well as her constituents, as she battled breast cancer courageously for over 2 years. Her determination to continue serving the citizens of the First District of Virginia while undergoing treatment set a remarkable standard of perseverance for many of us. 
   I believe that the naming of the postal service located at 6892 Main Street in Gloucester, Virginia, after Congresswoman Davis is a fitting tribute to her years of public service. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (Announcement by the Chairman -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Chairman, my amendment would reduce funding in the bill for the International Labor Affairs Bureau to the President's requested level of $14 million. This would save $58.4 million in this category. 
   The underlying bill provides $72.5 million for this account. This amendment would reduce funding for the International Labor Affairs Bureau by $58.4 million to match the President's request. 
   The bureau was originally responsible for the Department of Labor's overseas research projects and international labor workers' rights, primarily research and advocacy. However, in recent years the bureau has taken on grant-making activities. The bureau's grant assistance is already provided for by the Department of State, and this amendment would restructure the bureau's activities to advocacy and research only. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (HONORING MICHAEL DEAN RAMBO -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Michael Dean Rambo of Colleyville, Texas. 
   Michael was an outstanding husband, father, and scout master for Troop 28. Michael was always looking for an opportunity to give back to the community in which he lived. He loved his family and friends, and they loved him. 
   Michael always had a childlike wonder and awe of the world around him and a thirst for knowledge. His example and enthusiasm made those around him want to learn more and do more. 
   Michael was always up for a challenge and always willing to lend a hand. He was the cubmaster for Pack 254 before taking the lead role for Troop 28. Michael was the guiding light for Troop 28 for 12 years and helped them earn Colleyville's first service award. 
   Among Michael's many accomplishments, he earned his Eagle Scout at age 13. He earned a select student in science and math degree from Stephen F. Austin University, and he went on to earn a master's degree from UT Arlington. His favorite people were his sons, Patrick Rambo and Aaron Rambo, and his wife, Mary Margaret. 
   Michael Rambo selflessly served the community. He loved his family and friends, and he enjoyed life to the fullest. He was a role model of superior citizenship who had a tremendous impact on our lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. MARCHANT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I stand before you today, offering a candid reflection of the tasks before us. As someone entrusted to be a leader in this great nation, I find myself humbled by the decisions we make and the traditions of this institution. In times of hardship, America has often looked to the House of Representatives, the ``people's house,'' as a place for deliberation and decision. Many great leaders have preceded our place in this Chamber, and many more will undoubtedly follow. By design we find ourselves here again today, in the footprints of those who stood so firm against the winds of adversity. It was in this very room that President Franklin Roosevelt so famously addressed the Nation after the tragic events surrounding Pearl Harbor had unfolded; and Members of Congress were faced with the daunting effort of placing our nation in a second world war. 
   America was forged long ago as a beacon of democracy, shining bright onto the shores of the world. Ever since our bold proclamation to others that we would shelter ``your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath free,'' we have called on this body to answer the question: How tired, how poor, how yearning must the oppressed be to warrant our assistance? And so we find ourselves here today, paused at an intersection on the road of democracy. Will we turn back and embolden those that oppress the free and murder  the innocent? After careful consideration, I must vote against this resolution and choose instead to follow the path blazed by those who pledged our commitment to freedom. 
   On September 11, we were forced to witness the consequences of a decade of inaction against a determined enemy. Osama bin Laden and other radical Islamists, have declared war on every American, for no other reason than we practice freedom and democracy. Beginning in the 1970s, radical Islamists began targeting America with a steady campaign of terror. Although the images of that tragic September day remain seared in our minds, it forced us to awaken from our long period of denial and realize the true determination of our enemy. The war in Afghanistan and subsequent invasion of Iraq have discouraged any major terrorist attack from occurring on our soil in the last 5 years. Our enemy is patient, calculating, and determined. However, by supporting Iraq's efforts to become a free and Democratic society, we have forced the terrorists to focus their resources in the Middle East and away from American soil. 
   The only impact this resolution will have: is embolden our enemy and convince them of our weakness. The overall commanding officer in Iraq, General David Petraeus, recently agreed that a resolution such as this would only ``give the enemy some encouragement.'' Although I will continue to be an advocate of free speech, we must remain aware of our speech's impact. One can only imagine the result here at home if we formalize a resolution of no confidence in this body. 
   As a member of this body, I have made clear my support for the war in Iraq and our fighting men and women. I stand behind our military and appreciate the importance of our mission, but am also aware that some mistakes have been made along the way. War is unpredictable and we can do no better than by putting our armed forces in the capable hands of our military leaders. We owe it to the generations of Iraqi's murdered under the reign of Saddam, and our brave country men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, to move forward with our mission. 
   The decision to commit our military to harm's way, is the toughest made of any leader. Some of my colleagues in Congress will argue that we cannot afford to vote in approval of the job our military men and women have done in Iraq. After looking at the facts, I say we can't afford not to. This non-binding resolution being offered by Democrats, is little more than a political sound bite. Although I have respect for many of my colleagues across the aisle, I urge them to consider the negative effect this resolution will have. 
   It should be clear to all that have listened to this debate, that this resolution is the first step by the majority party in their quest to cut off funding for our troops in Iraq. This is not fair to our soldiers on the ground and it dishonors the fallen and injured heroes that have so bravely served this Nation.
