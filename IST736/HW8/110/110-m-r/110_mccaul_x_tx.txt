<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (CAROLINE PRYCE WALKER CONQUER CHILDHOOD CANCER ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, every now and then, as Members of Congress, we have one of those moments, a moment when we feel like we can truly make a difference. This, in my view, is one of those moments, and I want to thank Congresswoman DEBORAH PRYCE for her leadership, her perseverance in this issue. 
   It's been a long, hard fight, but we got here. It's going to pass, and this is a great day. It's a great day for those who have suffered. It's a great day for those who have been in pain. It's a great day for the victims. 
   This bill provides a beacon of light. It provides a voice for the innocents who don't have a voice, for children whose eyes we have looked into who are dying from this dreaded disease, for victims of this disease like my constituents Tim and Donna Culliver who lost their son Adam at the age of 4, to Caroline who lost her life at the age of 9. 
   I think of my own daughter, Caroline, my five children, the countless other children out there who could be a victim of this dreaded disease. This bill will lead the path towards a cure for cancer. 
   And this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This is an American issue. It's an issue for the children, and it's a fitting tribute to you, Congresswoman Pryce, and your daughter, Caroline, for all the hard work and the efforts you've put into this. 
   I've been through the pediatric hospital, as many of us have, and there's nothing more painful than to look into the eyes of a child who is dying from this disease, who's afflicted with this disease, whose parents look at you as a Member of Congress and say: Isn't there something you can do? Can you stop this? 
   I watched my best friend in grade school die from cancer, and we have all been touched, as DEBORAH PRYCE said, by this disease in some way or another. But this is a real monumental moment, a moment where we truly can make a difference. They often say the measure of a man's life or woman's life is the, do I leave this world in a better place than it was before I came in. I can truly say that with the passage of this bill, that this Congress and this brave Congresswoman, through her leadership and her legacy, will leave this world a better place.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (GREEN ENERGY EDUCATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I want to first thank Mr. Lipinski and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their strong support of this bill, which I introduced in the last Congress; and I'm pleased to see it get to the House floor in this Congress. 
   The National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm report echoed the call of many in the academic and business community for greater need to recruit and develop scientific and engineering talent to work on solving problems of national need. 
   Like many Members of Congress, I'm concerned about America's dependence on foreign sources of energy. Our reliance on imported energy only serves to increase our vulnerability to both external events and the actions of regimes that are, in many cases, openly hostile to the interests of the United States. One of the ways we can reduce the need for energy imports is to use our energy more efficiently. 
   Buildings consume more energy than any other sector of the economy, including industry and transportation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, American buildings consume 39 percent of our Nation's primary energy and 70 percent of electricity. However, energy efficient building practices are not being fully utilized, in  part because of a lack of awareness about energy efficient technologies and design practices among building professionals. 
   That is why I introduced the Green Energy Education Act. This legislation authorizes the Department of Energy to partner with the National Science Foundation to support graduate education and curriculum development to advance DOE's broad energy technology development mission. Working through NSF, DOE will help develop the next generation of engineers and architects to produce buildings incorporating the latest in energy efficient technologies. 
   In order to reduce the likelihood of duplicative and wasteful programs, this bill also allows the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to combine their efforts to find workable solutions to the issues surrounding building efficiency that then can be transferred to the marketplace. 
   Specifically, H.R. 1716 will authorize DOE's Office of Science and applied energy technology programs to contribute funds to the NSF's successful Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship program, which is already doing great work in this area. 
   This bill also authorizes the DOE to contribute to NSF's curriculum development activities in order to improve the ability of engineers and architects to design and construct more efficient and durable buildings. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important step towards increasing America's energy independence. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first I'd like to say, as a former Justice Department official who worked on national security, wiretaps or FISAs, I can think of no more important issues facing this country and this Congress than the modernization of the FISA statute. And I hope and I plead with my colleagues to support this measure. 
   I rise today to bring to the House's attention an issue dealing with changes to NASA's account structure required by H.R. 3093 and the challenges this provision will impose on NASA. 
   Title III of this bill increases the number of appropriations accounts that fund NASA from three to seven, and it requires conversion to this new structure in fiscal year 2008. Implementing this change will impose a tremendous burden on NASA's accounting system, at an unknown cost, and it's unclear what the net advantage of such a structural change, what that would be.     
   The current structure with three accounts coupled with customary congressional direction contained in the committee report language provides the agency unambiguous guidance regarding spending levels of the program, project, and in some cases at the activity level. 
   Since 2001, NASA has been implementing a new software package to standardize its accounting and financial software across all 11 of its centers, and at the same time NASA has been putting in place a new means of allocating overhead costs. These efforts have not yet been completed, and to now direct the agency to reformat its basic accounting system is especially burdensome and complex. It may also force the agency to reevaluate the manner in which it calculates overhead rates. 
   In a letter addressed to the House Appropriations leadership last month on the account structure change, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin stated that ``it would have a severe and extensive impact upon NASA's financial system'' and ``would make maintaining NASA's ability to execute in full cost exceedingly complex.'' 
   H.R. 3093 also directs NASA to implement the account structure change in 2008, a task that NASA says it simply cannot do in the time permitted. 
   So I strongly urge the committee leadership to reflect carefully on the concerns raised by Administrator Griffin and to work with NASA in the weeks ahead to reach an agreement on a budget structure that allows for greater transparency without undermining NASA's current accounting system. 
   I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work and for the resources provided to NASA in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the Nation about one of the finest and most dedicated members of America's law enforcement community, and one of the best sheriffs to ever have served in the 10th Congressional District of Texas. 
   For 29 years, the good people of Lee County, Texas, trusted Joe Goodson to be their sheriff. He passed away last month, but left those he protected with a safe, friendly and God-fearing community. 
   Sheriff Joe, as he was known to the thousands of people who called him a friend, worked hard, not just for the people of his county, but for all Texans and for all Americans. 
   His fellow Texas sheriffs chose him to lead the Sheriffs' Association of Texas. He was a member of the Auto Theft Task Force, the Narcotics Task Force, and he was the head of the cold case review people team. 
   But it wasn't just that he was among the finest lawmen in Texas that made Sheriff Joe so well liked and so respected. Sheriff Goodson always treated others the same way he wanted to be treated, and the thousands of people who knew him respected him for it. 
   Law enforcement ran in Sheriff Joe's blood. His dad, Vernon Goodson, served as sheriff in Lee County for 25 years before his son Joe was elected and took over the position. And as Buddy Price, the editor of the Giddings Times and News in Lee County, will tell you, they were both dedicated to their jobs and loved the people they served. While they both enforced the law vigorously, they also used commonsense and resolved situations peacefully whenever they could. 
   One of the things Sheriff Joe is best known for is a responsible, some would even say the conservative way in which he ran his sheriff's office. He saw the money entrusted to him and his deputies as the people's money. He ran a tight ship and accounted for every dollar his department spent. 
   But once again, I have to go back to who Sheriff Goodson was as a person.  As his family will tell you, one of the things he loved most was leading the Blue Santa Program to provide gifts for needy families during the Christmas season. He helped raise money for Blue Santa with auctions, and he even served as an auctioneer. 
   To Joe's wife, Robyn, and Joe's entire family, and to the good people of Lee County, you have the thanks of a grateful Nation. We are indebted to you, and we mourn your loss. 
   So to the good Lord above, I hope you are ready for one more angel up there because Sheriff Joe is on his way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. First, Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for their important work on this bill. As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I certainly see the importance and value of what we are doing here today. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to include in his reporting information the rate of taxation in the United States as compared to other countries and how that would affect the investments examined by CFIUS. 
   And while I support the underlying bill, this amendment improves on the oversight requirements included in it. It requires the report to include information on how taxation affects foreign investment in the United States. Congress will be better informed on how our actions make it harder or easier for foreign countries to invest in our critical infrastructure. 
   The report is also required in the text of the bill, and this amendment merely ensures that we, as a Congress, know all the information we need to perform effective and better oversight. 
   The underlying bill is about how foreign investment affects national security, and there is no way to understand why foreign investments would be made here, or what it would do to our economy, without understanding the economic factors such as taxes. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and support a thorough report that examines all the factors affecting foreign investments in the United States.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to include in his reporting information on the amount of regulation in the United States, as compared to other countries, and how it affects the investments, the foreign investments, examined by CFIUS. 
   I support the underlying bill. This amendment simply improves on the oversight requirements. By requiring the report to include information on how burdensome regulation affects foreign investment in the United States, I believe Congress will be better informed on how our actions in the Congress can either make it harder or easier for foreign countries to invest in our critical infrastructure. 
   It is already required in the text of the bill. This would ensure us better oversight capability. 
   The underlying bill again is about foreign investment. I believe foreign investment affects national security. Issues relating to taxation and regulation certainly impact the foreign investments that are made both in this country and outside. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to simply conclude that, and the chairman is certainly an expert and a leader in terms of financial security issues. Certainly he would recognize that our viability as an economic superpower is vitally important in this country as we look at countries like China and India. 
   So I do believe it is relevant. I believe our ability to globally compete is not just an economic issue, but really is an issue of national security.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment, which requires the Secretary of the Treasury to include in his report information on the net effect of foreign investment on American jobs. 
   While I support the underlying bill, this improves our oversight capability and gives the information to Congress that we need on how jobs will be impacted by foreign investment. Congress will be better informed on how our actions lead to the creation or outsourcing of American jobs overseas. This report is already required in the text. This amendment will ensure we have better oversight. 
   The underlying bill is about, again, how foreign investments affect national security. There is no way to understand why foreign investments would be made here or what it would do to our economy without information, understanding the effect on jobs that foreign investments would have. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   And I would like to respond, if I may, that it is hard to imagine how our taxation and regulatory process is not related to foreign investment. And when we look at taxation, regulatory policies in this country, and when we look at jobs, particularly jobs being outsourced in countries like China and India, when we talk about viability, I appreciate the chairman's arguments and the gentleman from New York and the gentlewoman from New York, but it is hard for me to differentiate and dissect how national security is not impacted by our economic security and economic viability. If we are not a global superpower anymore, if we are not economically viable in this country, if we are losing jobs in this country, if our taxation and regulatory burden is so cumbersome that we are discouraging investment, including foreign investment in this country, I would argue that we are impacting our national security. 
   It is hard for me to conceive why the Congress wouldn't want this kind of information in evaluating our national security policies as they relate to economics. And the chairman, again, is an expert on financial security. I don't understand why you wouldn't want this information.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this is a healthy discussion, a  healthy debate. This bill is about foreign investment. This bill is a reporting requirement, hardly an outrageous request; I think a very sound request to the contrary on, as the gentleman stated, what are the barriers in this country to foreign investment? 
   It is hard for me to completely dissect our security and viability from one of national security, which is apparently what the gentleman from Massachusetts is attempting to do. I think they go hand in hand. I think we need to look at our ability to compete globally in this country. And when we do that, we are talking about national security. And when we talk about that issue, we have to examine our taxation and regulation policies in this country. And we have to look at the impact that these investments are having on jobs in this country. It is hard to tell the American people that their job is not an area of importance; it is important to our economic viability and security, and I would argue, I know the gentleman disagrees, that it is important to our national security.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, just in a very short conclusion, I think we are ready to move on, but it is a healthy debate that we are having. 
   The relevance, as the gentlelady from New York mentioned, of jobs and national security, the relevance of our taxation policies and our economic policies and regulatory policies and our economic security does directly impact our national security in this country. 
   I fully support the underlying bill. It is needed legislation. It is a great piece of legislation. I commended the chairman and ranking member for this bill in response to the Dubai Ports issue. But, again, I don't think we can look at this, and why wouldn't we want this information in the Congress? Our taxation policy in this country or regulatory burden, does that have an impact on foreign investment? Why wouldn't we want that information in the Congress? Wouldn't we want to know whether foreign investment one way or the other impacts jobs in this country? I would argue that is a healthy examination that is useful information for the Congress in examining our economic viability as a superpower, our economic security in this country, which again is a national security issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank my colleague and friend from the Houston area for his support in this resolution. 
   I rise today in support of H. Res. 1315, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, otherwise known as NASA. NASA was founded on July 29, 1958. On May 5, 1961, the first American was launched into space on Freedom 7, and that was Alan Shepard. On July 20, 1969, President Kennedy's dream was fulfilled when Apollo 11 landed on the Moon. Neil Armstrong became the first man to walk on the Moon at that time, and the first space shuttle Columbia launched on April 12, 1981. 
   NASA has inspired generations of interest in science and engineering in young people. I remember taking one of the astronauts through my school district all the way from Houston to Austin, Texas, and just the hope and the dreams that she and NASA's program inspires in our young people, particularly in the fields of math and science, is truly an inspiration, I think, for all of us as Members of Congress. 
   NASA's work has really led to technological and scientific advantages that benefit everyone in society, including satellite communications. We all use cell phones. Lord knows we all use our BlackBerrys here in Congress and elsewhere. We have a great understanding of the human body because of the knowledge gained during man's space flight.     
   This program, based at the Johnson Space Center in Mr. Lampson's district and not too far from mine, is an important part of the Houston area economy. More than 15,000 people are employed at the Johnson Space Center, and NASA's work is an example of how the government and the private sector can work together to make this world a better place. 
   It's vital that the Congress act, in my view, to minimize the gap between the retirement of the space shuttle and the start of Orion, to maintain our leadership role in space exploration. And through the International Space Station, NASA currently serves as a model of international cooperation. 
   NASA's work has greatly expanded our knowledge of our universe. The Hubble Telescope, as my colleague from Houston talked about, launched in 1990, is still providing us with useful data and bringing the schoolchildren the wonders of space. NASA has sent probes to eight different planets in the solar system. 
   We can't think about the space program without the President who launched it, President Kennedy, and when he explained why space exploration is so important and so necessary, he said, ``The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join it or not, and it is one of the greatest adventures of all time, and no Nation which expects to be the leader of other Nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space ..... We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for all people.'' 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let me say once again how proud I am have to have introduced this resolution. I appreciate the support of the gentleman from Texas, my friend and colleague, and the support of the colleagues on my side of the aisle as well. 
   The NASA space program has proven to provide a great return on our investment in terms of Federal research and development dollars, and I would urge this Congress to continue that investment.     
   A recent article in The Washington Post today outlined that the U.S. finds it's getting crowded out in terms of dominance in space as other nations step up their efforts. China plans to conduct its first spacewalk in October. The European Space Agency is building a roving robot to land on Mars. And India recently launched a record 10 satellites into space on a single rocket. We cannot fall behind. That is not the intent, the purpose, the vision of NASA. 
   ``Space, like Earth below, is globalizing. And as it does, America's long-held superiority in exploring, exploiting and commercializing the final frontier is slipping away,'' according to this article, ``many experts believe.'' 
   And although the United States remains dominant in most space-related fields and owns half the military satellites currently orbiting Earth, experts say the Nation's superiority is diminishing and many other nations are expanding their civilian and commercial space capabilities at a far faster pace. 
   Michael Griffin said, ``We spent tens of billions of dollars during the Apollo era to purchase a commanding lead in space over all nations on Earth.'' However, this agency's budget is down 20 percent since 1992. According to Mr. Griffin, ``We've been living off the fruit of that purchase for 40 years and have not chosen to invest at a level that would preserve that commanding lead.'' 
   We have authorized funding for NASA. I was proud to support that; I think we can do better. We need to continue to support this very important program which provides not only great scientists and engineers for this country, but allows us to be competitive globally in all areas, including science and technology and energy, but also in the wonders of space. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Protect America Act, and I urge the Democratic leadership in the House to bring to the floor the bipartisan bill that was passed in the Senate overwhelmingly which brought this act to permanency. 
   Unfortunately, last month what we saw was, on February 15, this act did not come to the floor; rather, it expired. The Democratic leadership failed to bring that to the House floor. And with the expiration of the Protect America Act, our intelligence communities went dark in many parts of the world. 
   This is a game of dangerous politics. It is putting the American people at great risk as every day passes. I urge again the Democratic leadership to bring the bipartisan Senate bill to the floor so that democracy can operate, because the American people support this bipartisan legislation that the Senate passed and we need to pass it now to protect American lives. If I can just step back and give this some context. 
   The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act actually passed in 1978, during the Cold War. It was a time, again, during the Cold War, not the threat that we face today, a very different threat. The FISA Act, because the technology now has outdated the law, needs to be modernized. And that is exactly what the Protect America Act does. 
   The Director of National Intelligence came to the Congress last year to tell us that we needed this modernization because there are dangerous loopholes and intelligence gaps in our collection capability, and that needed to be fixed. Many of us here in the House listened to that warning, answered that call, and voted in a very bipartisan way last August for the Protect America Act. Unfortunately, as I stated, last month, on February 15, the Democratic leadership allowed that act to expire, again placing Americans in grave jeopardy. 
   And what did we hear from the Democratic leadership at that time? Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said, there really is no urgency here; the intelligence agencies have all the tools that they need. Chairman Silvestre Reyes at the time said, Things will be just fine. Things will be just fine. 
   But things aren't fine. And all you have to do is look at a letter that we received in the Congress from the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General pointing out the grave risk that this expiration is giving to the American people. They said: The expiration of the authorities in the Protect America Act would plunge critical intelligence programs into a state of uncertainty, which could cause us to delay the gathering of, or simply miss, critical foreign intelligence information. And then, they say, that is exactly what has happened since the Protect America Act expired days ago without the enactment of the bipartisan Senate bill. 
   This is the Director of National Intelligence, a man who served under Democrats and Republicans. This is the Attorney General of the United States. They said we have lost intelligence information this past week as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Congress' failure to act. I submit that this is not only a failure to act; it is a dereliction of duty to the American people. We have the most solemn obligation first and foremost to protect the American people. Mr. Speaker, we are failing in that obligation in the House today. 
   Intelligence is the best weapon we have in the war on terror. Intelligence is the first line of defense in the war on terror. And, if I could step back to 1993 and tell a story. 
   I used to work in the Justice Department. I worked on FISAs. In 1993, an individual named Ramzi Yousef came in the country with a fake Iraqi passport, and he plotted to bring down the World Trade Center. Fortunately, he wasn't successful that day, although he did kill people. Innocent lives were lost, and he caused great damage to these buildings. He fled, ended up eventually in Islamabad in Pakistan, where he met up with his uncle, Khalid Shaikh Mohammad. Khalid Shaikh Mohammad of course is the mastermind of September 11. There, they talked about the idea of flying airplanes into buildings. 
   Eventually, Ramzi Yousef was caught in Islamabad and brought back to justice. But the intelligence that we missed back then because some of the flaws in the system, the 9/11 Commission studied this and they made several recommendations. And, of course, at the time they analyzed what we passed in the PATRIOT Act to fix this problem, that being the fact that a wall separated the criminal division from the foreign counterintelligence. The left hand literally didn't know what the right hand was doing. This caused great consternation within the Justice Department and within the intelligence community. I remember working before the PATRIOT Act passed and I remember some of these frustrations myself. 
   There is a great quote from an FBI agent who was frustrated with this. He said: You know, someday someone will die and, wall or not, the public will not understand why we were not more effective at throwing every resource we had at certain problems. Let's hope the national security law unit will stand behind their decisions then, especially since the biggest threat to us now, Osama bin Laden, is getting the most protection. 
   I draw this analogy because the same principle applies to the FISA modernization, and that is that if we fail to pass this act, someday someone will die.     
   The biggest threat to us is Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda; and they are, unfortunately, now getting great protections. They are getting constitutional protections that they don't deserve. We are required to go to this FISA Court any time we want to listen to overseas intelligence. Foreign communications from a foreign terrorist to a foreign terrorist, we are required to go to a court in the United States with a showing of probable cause, giving a terrorist constitutional protections they do not deserve and putting not only Americans in the United States at great risk, but the war fighter abroad at great risk. 
   There is a great example last year. Three American soldiers were kidnapped. Because of the FISA restrictions, we had to get lawyered up, go to the FISA Court, apply for a warrant, and show probable cause for an emergency FISA warrant. Many hours expired. In the meantime, one of those soldiers was killed, and two we haven't heard from since. This is a tragic outcome. Again, this is putting Americans at great risk. 
   We talk a lot in the 9/11 Commission about connecting the dots. And the fact of the matter is, if we can't gather and collect those dots, there is no way we can connect the dots. And the gentlelady from New Mexico has stated so eloquently so many times that very point. I want to yield to her. The gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) has been the leader in the House on this issue. She was the one who really brought this issue to the attention of the Congress, and I believe America owes her a great deal of gratitude, so we can fix this intelligence gap we currently have in the law and ultimately save lives.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. That is the absurd result of us failing to pass the Protect America Act in this body. It is putting our soldiers at grave risk. 
   These constitutional protections, to extend them to foreign terrorists, the FISA when it was enacted was not enacted to give foreign terrorists constitutional protections. It was enacted, if you are an agent of a foreign power in the United States, to give some protection. 
   I have quoted before Admiral Bobby Inman who is one of the principal architects of the FISA statute. Again, it was designed to, when we want to monitor an agent of a foreign power in the United States, go to a special court and get a warrant. It was not designed to apply to foreign terrorists overseas talking to terrorists overseas. And these constitutional protections that I suppose our friends on the other side of the aisle would like to extend to the terrorists turns the statute on its head. 
   What Admiral Inman says is to apply FISA to ``monitoring foreign communications of suspected terrorists operating overseas such as Osama bin Laden and other key al Qaeda leaders turns the original intent of FISA on its head.'' This is the man who was principally responsible for writing the statute. 
   He says, contrary to some of the rhetoric coming from the Democrats, it is the members of al Qaeda, not American citizens, as our colleagues will say, it is al Qaeda who is the target of these intelligence-gathering activities. 
   I think the majority of the American people support the idea that we should be able to hear what al Qaeda is saying overseas without getting lawyered up and going to a court to get a warrant. We know this agenda is driven by many on their side of the aisle, the special interests, the ACLU, the trial lawyers, and it is such a dangerous policy.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. You still need a warrant because the fourth amendment of the Constitution applies to persons in the United States. But the fourth amendment of the Constitution  does not apply to foreign terrorists overseas not in the United States. 
   That is the sort of root of this problem is that we are applying constitutional protections to overseas terrorists. Now how absurd is that? 
   I think if the American people really knew what was going on up here and really knew what this debate was all about, and I do think that they are rising by the day. We are getting letters and phone calls by the day, and I believe they are not going to stand for this kind of nonsense that puts the American people and the war fighter at risk.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Reclaiming my time, I would like to add to that, having worked on FISA applications, as the gentlelady has seen, it is a very cumbersome, paperwork-intensive process to establish probable cause and to get a court-ordered warrant. In many cases, it took us 6 to 9 months to get these warrants. 
   Now, it has been a little streamlined since 9/11, but it is still a very, very cumbersome process. And again, the statute was never intended to apply to this type of situation. That is why we need to fix this now. 
   Again, the majority leader, Steny Hoyer, says there is no urgency. There is no urgency. Tell al Qaeda that. 
   Chairman Silvestre Reyes, things will be just fine. Tell al Qaeda that. They must be celebrating. When they look at what we are doing with this statute, they must be saying to themselves, How naive. We are playing right into their hands, and this needs to stop.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman for his comments. And reclaiming my time, there is an urgency here. We need to act in real time with real time intelligence. We can't afford to wait 6 to 9 months for a FISA Court to issue a warrant to a foreign terrorist overseas who has no constitutional protections. 
   Let's look at what the Director of National Intelligence said about this issue just recently since the expiration of the Protect America Act. He says, ``Our experience in the past few days since the expiration of the act demonstrates that these concerns are neither speculative nor theoretical. Allowing the act to expire without passing the bipartisan Senate bill has had real and negative consequences for our national security. Indeed, this has led directly to a degraded intelligence capability.'' 
   I don't know of any American who can read these words from our Director of National Intelligence, the man who heads up our intelligence communities, the man who served under both Democrats and Republican, and not have a chill run up your spine when you read this quote. The threat, the risk, the grave risk that the majority is putting this country in by allowing this act to expire. There is an urgency and we need to get it passed. 
   With that I am going to yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman for his comments. Reclaiming my time, the gentleman is absolutely correct. This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. The Senate passed it overwhelmingly in a bipartisan way. In fact, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, a Democrat, said this is the right way to go in terms of security of the Nation. 
   The gentlelady serves on the Intelligence Committee. We serve on the Homeland Security Committee, Mr. Dent and I. When you talk about the security of the Nation, you've got to leave your partisan politics and your special interests behind because protecting the American people deserves better than that. It doesn't deserve the partisan rhetoric. 
   Twenty-five attorneys general signed a letter, Democrat and Republican, please pass this act. So I do believe the time is now. 
   And the sad thing is, the most tragic thing is, we know good and well if this was brought to the floor today or tomorrow, that it would pass overwhelmingly. And yet the American people are denied that opportunity to vote on this bill, through their representatives, because special interests are holding this up.  
   Again, I point to the ACLU and the trial lawyers who want to take a shot at the companies, the private sector, who have carried out their patriotic duties, when the government asked them in a time of war to do their duty, to help the United States Government listen to terrorists overseas and somehow we should subject them to liability. I think that's crazy. If the government did something wrong then, of course, the government should be held accountable. 
   When companies are acting on behalf and certified on behalf of the Attorney General to do this, essentially a mandate to do it, they should not be held liable for those actions. So I think that is the real issue here, what's holding up this bill that would protect Americans. 
   I yield to the gentlelady from New Mexico.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlelady for her insight, and she's absolutely right that this terrorist surveillance program has protected Americans from the very scenario that you mentioned. 
   We all remember this day. It's etched in our memory forever. I will never forget this day, and every patriotic American will never forget what they did to us that day. But yet, every day this Act, since it has expired, with every day there's greater risk to this happening again. 
   There's a reason why this hasn't happened again. It's because we have been able to thwart and to stop plots against the United States to kill us. That's what this program does. That's what the Protect America Act did until the Democrats allowed it to expire almost 3 weeks ago. 
   Alluding back to Ramzi Yousef, very interestingly, and I know the FBI agents when they arrested him, when they busted down his door to talk about what the gentlelady talked about in terms of a sinister evilness about the terrorist, to get in the mind of the terrorist, what they found were about a dozen baby dolls, and those baby dolls were stuffed with chemical explosives. They were going to carry those on the airplanes and blow them up. 
   Now, chemical weapons we saw with the London arrest. They always go back to their old tricks. They attempted to sneak chemical explosives onto these airplanes. Fortunately, we had good intelligence. Without good intelligence, people die. Without good intelligence, we cannot fight this war on terror. Without good intelligence, we cannot protect the American people, and as we stated before, we put the war fighter at tremendous risk. 
   So, with that, I will yield again to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman, again, for his insight. 
   Because of the wall back then and because of the intelligence gap, people did die, 3,000 Americans. Haven't we learned our lesson? How many times do the terrorists have to hit us? We know before September 11 there were many attacks against American interests, whether it was Beirut, the Khobar Towers, the USS Cole, the 1993 World Trade Center, they went back to it again. When are we going to learn the lesson? 
   The 9/11 Commission came out with its recommendations, and yet I don't believe we're heeding the warnings from the 9/11 Commission today. When are we going to learn the lesson that we need the dots to connect them in the first place? 
   And I think it's worth repeating, for those who have just tuned in, again the FBI agent's frustration that Mr. Dent has referred to, and I can see this. Having worked with the FBI, I can see an agent who is pounding his head against the wall because some bureaucratic rule prevents him from coordinating with the intelligence side of the house and he can't get the intelligence he needs to protect Americans because the intelligence community knows that  two of these terrorists are in the United States but they can't tell the FBI about it. It is an absurd result, and he says, very, very frustrating, sending a letter to FBI headquarters, which could be a career-breaking act to do, very dangerous thing for an FBI agent to do, but he voices his frustration, saying someday someone will die. This is before 9/11. And law or not, the public will not understand why we were not more effective at throwing every resource we had at certain problems. They don't seem to understand the biggest threat to us now is Osama bin Laden. 
   That fell on deaf ears, and I'm afraid that this message is now falling on deaf ears again. It's certainly falling on deaf ears in this House when the majority fails and it's a dereliction of duty not to bring this bill that will protect American lives to the floor of this House.

   Because we had an intelligence gap, September 11 occurred. What we're trying to do is to stop that from ever happening again. Without that, we fail, and it's the best weapon we have, the first line of defense in the war on terror. And yet, for some reason, the majority in the Congress are being denied the right to vote on this and pass it and, in turn, denying the will of the American people, who we know support it. They want us to know what al Qaeda is saying overseas, and yet what we're doing is we're extending protection, giving the trial lawyers authority and extending constitutional protections to foreign terrorists.

We didn't heed the warning. We didn't listen to those alarms before they went off. 
   And then, of course, on September 11, the sleeping giant awoke, and we wanted to do everything we could possibly do to secure and protect this Nation.

   I would like to just add that, certainly during the Cold War at least, the principle of mutually shared destruction applied; we valued our lives and so did the Soviets. In this war against terrorism, in the day of suicide bombers, we can't say that. So real-time intelligence is absolutely critical to protecting the Nation. 
   I want to state again, from the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, he says, ``Expiration of this act will result in a degradation of critical tools necessary to carry out our national security mission. And without these authorities, there is significant doubt surrounding the future aspects of our operations.'' Again, that is a warning to the United States Congress that if you don't do your job, I can't do my job. Do your job.

   I would like to close with a quote. Why is this debate so important? I think it's important to understand the threat and to understand who the enemy really is. Who is the enemy? Let's get inside the mind of the enemy. And our enemy says, ``The confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know Socratic debates, Platonic ideals, nor Aristotle diplomacy. But it knows the dialogue of bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing and destruction, and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun. Islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and cooperative councils. They are established as they always have been, by pen and gun, by word and bullet, and by tongue and teeth.'' 
   The words I just read to you are the preface of the al Qaeda training manual. That is how it begins. That's in their words, not mine. That is the enemy. That is the threat. That is why it's so important we pass the Protect America Act on the House floor, and pass it now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I too am a member of the Homeland Security Committee. I was also a Federal prosecutor in the Public Integrity Section in Washington, and I also serve on the Ethics Committee. I would respectfully submit that we are not muddling up the process but rather trying to restore ethics and integrity to the process and to this institution. 
   In my view, this is Congress at its worst. Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have created a secret slush fund with billions in secret earmarks hidden from public scrutiny. This comes on the heels of many broken promises that we heard, promises such as from Speaker Pelosi: ``We will bring transparency and openness to the budget process and to the use of earmarks.'' 
   The majority leader, Steny Hoyer, said: ``We are going to adopt rules that make the system of legislation transparent so that we don't legislate in the dark of the night.'' 
   Yet that is exactly what is occurring in this body. CNN, not exactly a conservative think tank, actually said that the Democrats promised reform and it is not happening: ``The `anti-earmark reforms' are just for show. Mere window dressing.'' This process signals a retreat in the secret dealings and a guarantee of fiscal and ethical abuse. Earmarks should always be open to public vetting, full debate, and floor challenge, as we attempted to do in the last Congress. 
   Now, Mr. Obey and the Democrats are stuck between the pork and those campaign promises that they made. And so those promises are given away. The majority wants this Congress to operate behind closed doors in dark corridors where the precept of Justice Brandeis that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant'' is hardly known. The powerful impact of public debate and a free press are critical features of an American democracy and they are missing, Mr. Chairman. They are missing here today in this Congress. 
   Secrecy creates a breeding ground for corruption. Openness is an important part of ensuring that government officials are acting in the best interest of the public and that the citizens are not being manipulated by special interest groups. 
   Here we have one man, one man and an unelected staff, determining the power of the purse for the United States Congress, acting on behalf of 435 Members elected by the United States. Yet we have one man to make all the decisions about the spending for the United States Government. This is not, I submit, a democracy. This is a monarchy. 
   And to quote James Cooper: ``A monarchy is the most expensive of all forms of government, the regal state requiring a costly parade, and he who depends on his own power to rule must strengthen that power by bribing the active and enterprising whom he cannot intimidate. 
   ``A nation is truly corrupt, when, after having, by degrees lost its character and liberty, it slides from democracy into aristocracy for monarchy; this is the death of the political body ..... '' 
   Someone said: ``The best weapon of a dictatorship is secrecy, but the best weapon of democracy should be the weapon of openness.'' That is what we are trying to achieve here today. 
   I will close with a quote from Lord Byron, and I think he sums up this debate better than any quote I have heard when he said: ``The Cardinal is at his wit's end; it is true that he had not far to go.''

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill. I also rise as a former Federal prosecutor who prosecuted, under the Federal firearms statute, gun cases. 
   I want to commend Chairman Dingell, Congresswoman McCarthy, and the National Rifle Association for reaching what I consider to be a good result on a bill that, in my view, is necessary. 
   It has been illegal for various individuals to purchase firearms for many years, illegal aliens, mentally defective individuals, those using illegal drugs, and people convicted of crimes of domestic violence. But for too long, in my experience and many of my colleagues whom I worked with in the Justice Department, the system, the background check system was not accurate. The information was not fully put into the system. In my view, if we are going to have a background check system, we ought to do it right. So let's get the system right. 
   I think that is what this bill does. It gets the system right. It provides the Federal funding necessary to get the  system right. And at the same time, it protects law-abiding citizens, those who are law abiding who want to purchase firearms. It protects their second amendment rights, and it keeps guns out of the hands of the bad guys. 
   I prosecuted cases under the Exile Program, which was a program sponsored by the National Rifle Association, and what we found was that it was bad guys that possessed firearms that caused the crime in this country. And we found when we locked up the bad guys who possessed these firearms that the crime rate actually went down. 
   So with that, I, again, give my support to this bill.

   I bring to this debate a unique experience. I worked in the Justice Department under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act on FISA's national security wiretaps. This statute was never designed to prohibit us from capturing overseas intelligence from foreign targets. If Osama bin Laden is calling in to the United States, we, as Americans, have a right to know what he is saying. 
   This is, again, one of the most important debates, and the Senate passed yesterday a version of this which I urge the House to pass today, and also one that protects companies, patriotic companies, who help out the United States Government when the United States Government asks and gives the call to duty to help the United States in capturing this overseas intelligence. 
   The time to act is now, and extension in terms of intelligence is unacceptable. We cannot allow our intelligence to go dark in many parts of the world. We must pass the Senate version of the FISA bill.

   In my view our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are playing a dangerous political game, and the American people are the pawns in this game. I bring to the Congress a unique experience. I worked in the Justice Department under the FISA statute. I have worked on national security wiretaps, and I can tell you that the statute was never intended to cover foreign targets in a foreign country. And if Osama bin Laden is on the phone calling into the United States, I think the American people want us to pay attention to that and to listen to that conversation. 
   Intelligence, good intelligence has stopped every threat to this country since 9/11. Intelligence is the first line of defense in the war on terror. Without that, we cannot prevail in this war on terror, and we need to protect the American companies who we ask to protect the United States and the American people. 
   They stood up to the plate, and it is our time to stand up to the plate and now protect them. They were doing their patriotic duty in a time of war when America asked them. 
   If we do not protect them, then what company, American or otherwise, will dare help the United States of America in its greatest time of need, in a time of peril, in a time of war. 
   Yesterday, the Senate passed the FISA bill, which included this immunity and also protects Americans. I say we put that bill on the floor, let's pass that bill and let's make the Protect America Act permanent. Now is the time, not 21 days from now, not several months from now. For the American people, let's pass and protect the American people now.

   Madam Chair, the Department of Education has provided funding from within its special education national activities account aimed at children who are both deaf and blind, commonly referred to as ``deafblindness.'' This money trains teachers who have such children in their classes on how to educate and include them in daily classroom activities. This modest $12 million program has not received an increase in nearly two decades. 
   Today over 110,000 people rely on this important program. Expanding this program will allow us to identify more children in need and increase the number of on-site technical assistance personnel. 
   This amendment simply increases the Special Education National Activities Account to provide the DeafBlindness program with a modest but necessary increase.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I want to thank my colleague from Texas, Mr. Green, for introducing this bill. It has been a real honor to work with you on this bill. I am proud to be a lead sponsor and to have played a role in terms of whipping votes on my side of the aisle and getting this bill to the floor of the House where it stands today. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this important piece of legislation which honors a former President of the United States and his commitment to better educate the future generations of America. 
   Today, we will vote to name the Department of Education building in Washington, D.C., the Lyndon Baines Johnson Federal Building. And, by doing so, we honor a son of Texas who left a positive mark on me, my family, the State of Texas, and this country. 
   Born on August 27, 1908, in Stonewall, Texas, Lyndon Johnson's family knew that he was destined to do great things. The future President got his experience in Washington first as a secretary to Congressman Richard Kleburg. Shortly after that, Johnson met Claudia Alta Taylor, a woman the world has come to affectionately know as Lady Bird. 
   In 1937, after the death of Congressman James Buchanan, Lyndon Johnson entered a special election for the 10th Congressional District of Texas, a district which I am proud to represent today. Representative Johnson beat nine other candidates to win the seat, an experience that I can personally relate to. 
   In addition to his tour of duty during World War II, LBJ would spend the next 23 years in the Congress as both a Congressman and Senator. During his career in the Congress, Johnson would serve as Senate minority and Senate majority leader. As President Kennedy's Vice President, Johnson served as the chairman of NASA and the Presidential Space Committee. 
   Lyndon Johnson early on earned a reputation for getting things done for the betterment of our Nation, and he used that intensity to lead America to land a man on the moon and continue America's dominance in space.     
   But it was Lyndon Johnson's steady and calming leadership after the assassination of President Kennedy which helped to lead our Nation through one of its most turbulent and tragic hours. 
   Taking the experience he had gained from his younger days as a teacher, President Johnson focused on working with the Congress and passing several landmark education bills. These initiatives served as a foundation for a new standard of education in America. Among them were programs such as Head Start, the first Federal aid to public schools and the first Federal student loan programs. 
   President Johnson recorded in his memoirs, he said, ``I remember seeing in the folder of reading material I took to my bedroom one night, the account of a 62-year old man who learned how to write his name after years of making an X for his signature. He was so excited that he sat for a whole hour just writing his name over and over again.'' 
   Johnson said, ``Reading about this man whose life had been so enriched, I was almost as excited as the man himself.'' 
   Now, that sums up so much of the man President Johnson was. In his story, our striving for increased opportunity and education took shape and became real and valid. It is this love and dedication to education that makes this bill the ideal way, in my view, and my judgment, to honor President' Johnson's memory. 
   While President Johnson will always be remembered as a champion of the  Civil Rights Act, it was President Johnson's wish that the education papers from his Presidency be the first set of records to be made public because he believed, and I quote, in his words, ``You can't get your civil rights without your education.'' This is why, in my judgment, he will always be known as the first ``Education President.'' 
   One of the greatest honors I have had during my tenure in the Congress was the opportunity to sit down with Lady Bird Johnson, who I am proud to have as a friend and a constituent. I spoke with her about my intention to see this bill through the Congress and have the Department of Education named for her husband. And the excitement and the gratitude in her eyes that she responded with will be a memory that I will cherish for the rest of my life. 
   As the Representative of President Johnson's former congressional district, I have been inspired by his dedication to the American people. I specifically look back to his work in supporting the space program and education as I consider ways to further improve our great Nation. 
   So I urge my colleagues to honor this great Texan and to support the Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Act. 
   May God bless Lyndon Johnson, and may God bless our national treasure, Lady Bird, may God bless Texas, and may God bless the United States of America.

   This study will be able to quantify the important benefits green schools provide by way of economic savings, environmental impact, and the health and academic performance of students. The building industry represents the largest economic sector in the United States, and school construction is the largest component of that sector. If all new school construction and school renovations went green starting today, energy savings alone would total about $20 billion over the next 10 years. It costs less than $3 extra per square foot to build a green school, but the payback occurs within 1 year based upon energy savings alone. With childhood asthma becoming more widespread in recent decades, this research is timely and necessary. According to the CDC, childhood asthma accounts for about 14 million missed school days per year. 
   This amendment authorizes $1 million over 5 years to undertake this important area of research. It is endorsed by the U.S. Green Buildings Council, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Institute of Architects.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, nearly 4 weeks have passed since the Protect America Act expired, and for 4 weeks our intelligence community has gone dark around the world. For 4 weeks, we are missing critical intelligence from foreign terrorists to better protect this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a dereliction of duty. The most solemn obligation we have in the House is to protect the  American people; yet we have allowed this act to expire. A bipartisan bill has passed in the Senate; yet we in the House are denied democracy and the opportunity to have the people vote for this important legislation that will protect Americans. 
   I applied for FISA warrants in the Justice Department. This statute was never intended to apply to foreign terrorists in foreign countries. In fact, what we are doing is extending constitutional protections to foreign terrorists like Osama bin Laden. This turns the statute on its head; yet we have a majority leader who says there's no urgency. The chairman of Intelligence says we'll be just fine. It reminds me of an FBI agent who warned before 9/11, frustrated about the intelligence gap, ``Someday someone will die. The public will not understand why we were not more effective at throwing every resource we had at certain problems, especially since the biggest threat to us now is Osama bin Laden and he is getting the most protection.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   In response to the issues raised, the DNDO has reached an agreement in principle with State and local stakeholders, and it is about 95 percent there. I submit we cannot wait another year for the appropriations cycle to take place. 
   This amendment is important. It restores $40 million to the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. The lack of these funds threatens to delay the completion of the radiation portal monitor program and significantly impair the implementation of securing the cities initiative. Both of these initiatives aim to strengthen the Nation's defenses against a terror attack by a nuclear device or a radioactive ``dirty bomb.'' 
   There is no doubt that the risks are real. We know that nuclear terrorism is the number one threat facing our country and that the economic costs associated with a dirty bomb could reach about $1 trillion. We know that Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda terrorist network have been attempting to acquire a nuclear bomb. We also know that hundreds of tons of the necessary ingredients of nuclear weapons are dangerously insecure all over the world. There have been numerous documented cases of theft of weapons-grade nuclear material. 
   But nuclear terrorism is, in fact, preventable, and we should be spending Homeland Security dollars on preventing what could be a catastrophic attack against the United States. Twenty million dollars of the cuts to the DNDO comes out of the radiation portal monitor program. It would delay the completion of these until the year 2013. Acquisition of systems for five ports of entry, including the Port of Houston in my home State of Texas, would be delayed, and this means that more unscreened cargo would get into this country. 
   Such a delay is unacceptable. And the best deterrence against terrorism is to disrupt the ability of terrorists to do what they want to do, and that is to kill Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2638, as currently written, prohibits the use of funds for additional unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, until the Customs and Border Patrol informs the House and Senate Appropriations Committees that their use is cost-effective. I submit today that they are worth every penny. My amendment would strike that provision which would otherwise be protected by the rule. 
   These eyes of the sky bring exceptional operational capabilities to the table. They can stay airborne for 30 to 40 hours and can carry state-of-the-art technology through day and night cameras, radar tracking systems, and other surveillance tools. 
   UAVs working the borders have flown over 2,000 hours and aided in the arrests of nearly 3,900 illegal immigrants and the seizure of over 13,000 pounds of marijuana.  
   UAVs are not in sufficient quantities to provide economies of scale and, as such, will always be more expensive to operate than a pilot in a small aircraft. But, Mr. Chairman, cost is not the only consideration. 
   On March 20, 2007, a UAV detected and tracked six illegal aliens trying to cross the southern border. When border officials arrived on the scene, they seized 395 pounds of marijuana and arrested all six. Among the six was a fugitive wanted in Kings County, Washington, on charges of third-degree rape of a child. 
   We should be providing our border authorities with more technology and tools. We talked a lot about the fence but this is the technology piece. More technology and tools, not less. Had a UAV not detected the entry of those illegal immigrants, how many more children may have been victimized by sexual predators? 
   I think this is an important piece to our overall security of the border, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of my amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, section 531 prohibits the implementation of MAX-HR. MAX-HR is the human resources program that allows DHS wide latitude in personnel matters such as transferring workers to areas where they may be needed during a national emergency. Congress gave the Department this ability so that it could move quickly to protect the country from terrorist threats. 
   While some authority is currently under judicial review, the bill as currently written would enjoin the entire program until courts decide.     
   If this section were to pass as written, it would result in an action that is not consistent with the purposes of Homeland Security. 
   My amendment would strike section 531 of this bill and allow current regulations to continue until the courts make their final judgment.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I respect the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina, but I would say I believe it's important that we let the courts decide this matter. It's under judicial review, just a small part of the human resources program at the Department of Homeland Security. 
   I think it would be a tremendous mistake for us in the Congress, as a separate branch of government, to essentially enjoin, essentially enjoin the executive branch in the human resource program that has combined 22 agencies, developed the human resources program that has been efficient in many respects, only because the courts have enjoined a very small portion. Again, let's let the courts decide this issue, and let's let the rest of the program go forward. 
   I know that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like to move the Department into a more unionized system that is not merit based. My view is that that would cripple our ability to respond in emergency situations. That was the view of the Congress at the time that we developed the Department of Homeland Security, and that is the view of this Congressman at this time.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we all took an oath in this Chamber to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies, both foreign and domestic. That is what this debate here today is really all about. 
   By allowing the Protect America Act to expire, we are extending constitutional protections to foreign terrorists. This bill does nothing to fix that problem. 
   We need to pass this Senate bill that passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis. I worked in the Justice Department on FISA warrants. The statute was never designed to apply to foreign terrorists in a foreign country, as recently stated by admiral Bobby Inman, the principal author of the FISA statute. 
   I want to point out two articles that were in The New York Times today: ``Afghanistan: Taliban Destroy Cell Towers.'' ``Taliban Threatens Afghan Cellphone Companies.'' 
   This is what is happening. We need to protect America now by making the Protect America Act permanent. The Taliban in their own words, their own statements, says the surveillance program has ``caused heavy casualties to Taliban'' in great proportions. 
   It is time to pass the Protect America Act.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of an important amendment to H.R. 1427. As we all know, the underlying bill creates an Affordable Housing Fund. In addition, the bill provides for the establishment of an Affordable Housing Trust Fund, should Congress decide to create one in the future. All the moneys from the Affordable Housing Fund would then be transferred into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. 
   While I have serious concerns that a fund like this creates the opportunity for fraud, waste and abuse, and detracts from the bipartisan goal of GSE reform, I would like to commend the chairman of the Financial Services Committee for including in the bill a list of prohibited uses for the housing fund grants. These prohibitions include political activities, advocacy and lobbying. 
   I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle agree with me when I say that government grants should not be used to fund political activities of any sort. If they didn't, they would not have included it in this bill. 
   My amendment simply applies the exact same restrictions on any future trust fund. While an argument can be made against this amendment that the prohibitions are implied in the text of the bill, it is important in my view that when we are dealing with the taxpayers' dollars that we are as clear and explicit as possible. 
   I thank the chairman.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I'm always inspired by the fact that we begin our business here in the Congress with a prayer to God and a pledge to this great country. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a great man, a man of God, a man of faith, a man who has devoted his entire career, indeed his entire life, to the service of his fellow man. Pastor Wayne Graumann, who offered this morning's prayer for the House of Representatives, is revered, admired, and loved by all in his congregation and by all those whose life he has touched. He is the voice and the shepherd of Salem Lutheran Church in Tomball, Texas. 
   Born in Granite, Oklahoma, Pastor Graumann became a pastor after completing his education at Concordia Theological Seminary in Springfield, Illinois. He eventually accepted a calling from Salem Lutheran in Tomball, Texas, and has served and strengthened his flock there for the past three decades. 
   Pastor Graumann has been married to his wife, Kathy, for more than 36 years. They have been blessed with two children and two beautiful grandchildren. Pastor Graumann also spends countless hours working on world missions for the health and well-being of others, particularly in Honduras, Kenya, and Mexico.  
   Everyone who knows Pastor Graumann knows him as a true messenger of Christ. In his words and in his deeds and, above all, in his heart, his example is a beacon of light which draws us all closer to our Creator. His faith and devotion to the life of Christ is an inspiration to us all. 
   I'm reminded of the Gospel of Matthew when Jesus said, ``Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.'' 
   May the peace of Christ be with you and may He hold you in the palm of his hand.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple one. It would prohibit any funds appropriated in this bill from going to any projects named after a sitting Member of Congress. The amendment is based on my bill, H.R. 5771, which I introduced earlier this year, and has been cosponsored by 27 other Members. 
   One of the most egregious examples of pure vanity and arrogance that we see in Washington is the practice of naming projects after current Members of Congress, or, as I call them, monuments to me. 
   According to the latest polls, only 12 percent of the American public approves of the job we are doing in the Congress, and that sentiment is due, in no small measure, to the fact that the American public thinks that we care less about them than we do ourselves. That is really what is wrong with Washington today. 
   And a few examples I think illustrate this problem that we have with ethics today in the Congress. The Robert Byrd Center for Hospitality and Tourism, the Robert Byrd Lodge, office complex, the Ted Stevens International Airport, the Harkin Grants, the Harkin Wellness Grant Program, the Harkin Global Communication Center, the Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center, the John Dingell Drive, the Cynthia McKinney Parkway, the Jack Murtha Highway, the James Clyburn Golf Center, the James Clyburn Pedestrian Overpass, the James Clyburn Intermodal Transportation Center, and the Charlie Rangel Center For Public Service.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Madam Speaker, once again, the tax man cometh. Today, April 15, is a day American taxpayers scramble to comply with a tax code over 67,000 pages long. 
   In 2007, individual taxpayers spent over 3 billion hours complying with the Federal income tax laws. Individuals spent $26.5 billion for tax software, tax repairs, postage, and other costs related to filing their Federal income taxes. And corporations spend over $156 billion to comply with the Federal tax laws. 
   Americans may send $2.5 trillion to the IRS, but the costs to our economy is much greater. Despite this, the majority party is forcing a $654 billion tax increase on the American people, the largest tax increase in American history. It is time to scrap this oppressive tax code. It is time to take a look at the fair tax or the flat tax as viable alternatives to our overly burdensome tax code, and it's time to stop punishing taxpayers and pass fundamental tax reform.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Members who introduced the bill. I want to thank Chairman Langevin, who I have worked with very closely on this. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the passage of this resolution, which supports the goals and ideals of National Cyber Security Awareness Month. While I believe it is important to recognize the need for cybersecurity awareness, this is an issue that should not be limited to just one month. Cybersecurity should be on the minds of all of us throughout the entire year. 
   Computers and the Internet have become an integral part of American business, government and lifestyle. Over 200 million Americans use the Internet on a regular basis. Companies, both large and small, rely on the Internet to manage their business, expand their customer reach and enhance their connection with their supply chain. 
   Almost 90 percent of all youth use the Internet, and the vast majority of those use the Internet at school. It is important that these children are taught to use the Internet in a safe and secure manner. This will not only protect their own systems from attack, but will provide for their physical safety. 
   Cybersecurity is also a critical part of our Nation's overall homeland security. The systems that control and monitor our dams, power grids, oil and gas supplies, as well as our transportation systems and other critical manufacturing processes, are connected to the Internet. 
   Right now, a terrorist organization or a hostile nation-state could disrupt our critical infrastructure systems and do serious damage to our economy without even entering our country. Appropriate cybersecurity practices are essential to overall security. 
   The dangers associated with online behavior are becoming more and more common. These threats range from spam, viruses and identity theft to complex computer attacks created by organized crime, terrorist organizations and possibly nation-states designed to steal sensitive information through espionage. 
   Organizations, such as National Cyber Security Alliance, are making it their mission to increase awareness of cybersecurity and technologies to home users, students, teachers and small businesses. These organizations deserve to be recognized for their good work and be supported. 
   While there is much to do, cybersecurity awareness is growing. The Congress has a role to play in encouraging the use of proper cybersecurity practices and technologies throughout our country. National Cyber Security Awareness Month provides a solid platform from which to improve cybersecurity awareness in our country, and I am pleased that this Congress is supporting its ideals and its goals. We have much more work to do, but being aware of the need for cybersecurity is a necessary first step.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support this bill and thank Chairman Gordon and Ranking Member Hall, a fellow Texan, for their hard work and leadership on this issue. 
   I think we can all agree on the importance of ensuring America is competitive in science and engineering. As the National Academy of Sciences report ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' warned, this country is in danger of losing its leadership role in these fields. 
   Last year I sponsored the Research For Competitiveness Act to address this issue. Unfortunately, that legislation did not come to the floor of the House after being passed by the Science Committee. However, I am pleased in this Congress in a bipartisan fashion to note that H.R. 363 incorporates sections from last year's bill that establish early-career grants for young scientists and engineers. These grants will encourage scientists and engineers in the early stages of their academic careers to establish innovative lines of research. This approach continues the successful model of partnership between the Federal Government and America's universities. 
   As you know, many of the technologies we enjoy today, such as breakthroughs that enabled e-commerce to become a reality in the 1990s, are based on research initially conducted at universities like the University of Texas in my hometown of Austin. 
   When we fund programs such as these, we are investing in minds and helping create the next generation of America's high-tech workforce. Therefore, I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I rise in support of this amendment. I want to commend my colleague, Congressman Cuellar, for bringing this amendment to the floor, and I am honored to support it. He has a great deal of expertise in this area. We have traveled to the border towns together, both on the United States side and in Mexico, and I met with law enforcement on both sides of the aisle and with government officials and we served on the United States-Mexico Interparliamentary Group. He understands the importance of security at the border, and particularly in the post 9/11 world. 
   Currently, there is little Coast Guard presence on international waterways shared with Mexico. This amendment would require the United States Coast Guard to provide an analysis of their mission strength for the navigable portions of the Rio Grande River in Texas. The amendment also asks the U.S. Coast Guard to identify what resources would be needed to increase the Coast Guard's presence along the international boundary of the Rio Grande River. 
   One of the Coast Guard's most important functions is providing safety and security in international waters, and the safety of the international border is a national security concern as the level of violence in Mexico increases and continues to spill across our border. Contraband and undocumented people continue to pass and cross the  border into the United States, despite our best efforts. This amendment may also pave the way for future studies assessing the need for Coast Guard presence in other areas of the United States where waterways are shared on the border of Mexico and with Canada. 
   So having said that, I want to thank my colleague, Mr. Cuellar, for bringing this amendment, and I rise in support. 
   I yield to my colleague from Ohio.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, on which I am proud to serve, for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, but I also rise to express my disappointment. 
   Despite the importance of a bipartisan approach to homeland security and promises made to the contrary, the new majority has chosen to prevent even their own rank and file members from participating in the debate over this bill. This stands in stark contrast to how Republicans implemented 39 of the 41 9/11 Commission recommendations when we were in the majority. 
   This bill raises several concerns. It proposes to require the Department of Homeland Security to screen 100 percent of maritime cargo containers bound for the United States. And while well intentioned, this is not possible with current technology. Under the SAFE Port Act passed in the last Congress, we started a pilot project to determine the feasibility of such a program. We should continue and await the results of this study. 
   This new unfunded mandate would cost the government and the economy billions of dollars per year and bring commerce to a crashing halt. And even the Washington Post today called this a ``bad investment.'' H.R. 1 also gives foreign port terminal operators a role in the screening of cargo containers bound for U.S. seaports. 
   Most disturbing of all, H.R. 1 proposes to hand over control of the Proliferation Security Initiative, a system which works to protect Americans against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, to the United Nations. This is the same United Nations of which Syria and Iran are members. As a former counter terrorism official in the U.S. Department of Justice, I know first hand the threat of terrorism. It is very much alive and well. And while I am overall supportive of this bill and the 9/11 Commission recommendations, Congress can and should do better.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Committee has spoken and the result is positive. I appreciate the words of the Committee in the Statement of the managers accompanying the Omnibus Appropriations legislation specifically regarding the USAID and hunting conservation programs in Africa and around the world. 
   The initial problem that came to light earlier this year was language that denied USAID funding of recreational, sport and trophy hunting in its assistance programs in Africa. The language in the Statement of the Managers to accompany the Omnibus legislation offers out the opportunity for the USAID conservation projects to continue and states that they need to come before the Committee and explain these important conservation programs. I support this effort and commend the Committee on this language. 
   These USAID projects are very important tools in the effort to promote conservation. Tourist hunting in foreign lands has proven to be vital and critical to community-based natural resource management programs such as the CAMPFIRE Program in Zimbabwe and the LIFE Plus Project in Namibia. The CAMPFIRE and the LIFE Plus Projects in Africa are just two examples of working conservation programs that involve controlled, regulated sport and trophy hunting. These programs literally support the entire tribal system in many areas of Africa. Without them, literally millions of acres that are properly managed now would fall prey to poachers and the land would prove to have no economic value. Animals in this environment would be killed for food, over-  hunted and poached. None of us want that result. 
   These programs provide conservation and social benefits like growth, revenue, poverty reduction, improved livelihoods and empowerment--all of which alleviate human suffering. 
   The facts are in: in twenty-three African countries that allow licensed, regulated hunting, approximately 18,500 hunters generate over $200 million annually in remote rural areas. The USAID programs are extremely important to the survival of many species worldwide and I thank the Appropriations Committee for recognizing the flaw in the House Report language and speaking to it appropriately in the Statement of the Managers that accompanies the Omnibus legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlelady from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say first that I support a military strategy to deal with the drug cartels. Having come from Texas, having worked counterterrorism with the Justice Department at the Mexican border, I know firsthand what a direct threat to the security of this Nation these drug cartels present. They export drugs. They poison our children. They export human trafficking. They bring special interest aliens into this country, some of whom are not caught. And in the post-9/11 world, they present a threat that we can no longer ignore. And they must be dealt with. That is why I have been supportive of this initiative. 
   However, I believe that we need a strategy on this side of the border, as well. I believe we need a two-pronged approach, if you will, a comprehensive strategy that deals not only with the Mexican side but with the U.S. side. And for too long, our border sheriffs and our Border Patrol agents have been outmanned and outgunned. And if we are going to provide assistance to Mexico, it seems to me we ought to be providing assistance to our men and women on our side fighting this war every day. 
   I had a unique opportunity to meet with President Calderon. He told me that he is at war with the drug cartels. He is at war with these drug cartels. And we need to fight this war against the drug cartels.  
   And I believe the best way to do that is provide the military assistance, but also provide the resources necessary on this side of our border, which is why I offered an amendment at the foreign affairs markup of this bill to provide $1.4 billion, an equal amount, if you will, over 3 years for our Federal, State and local law enforcement, including the border sheriffs. And Chairman Berman was supportive of this amendment. The chairman sits on the Judiciary Committee. It was my sincere hope that this amendment would have been taken up by the Judiciary Committee when they marked up this bill, as well. 
   Unfortunately, that didn't happen. And the Judiciary Committee decided not to take up this bill. In addition, instead of having an open rule whereby it could offer this amendment on the floor, we have a closed rule, and this vote is now under suspension. I believe this is a missed opportunity. I believe it is a missed opportunity to have a really comprehensive bill that could have had strong bipartisan support, that had the approach and the strategy that I just outlined, a military strategy on the Mexican side of the border, and a beefed up law enforcement on this side of the border. That is how we are going to achieve true border security in this Nation. So I just wanted to present that objection. 
   It is my sincere hope we can fix this and add this amendment at some point in the process to give our law enforcement on this side of the border the tools that they need, also, to win this war against the drug cartels.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlewoman from New Mexico for your great leadership on this very important issue and for having this debate tonight. 
   I think we are denying democracy its voice by not allowing the Members who represent the American people the opportunity to vote on the Protect America Act and to make that act permanent. 
   As the gentlewoman mentioned, I do have experience in the Justice Department in this area. I applied for FISA warrants while I was there. This statute was never intended to apply to overseas intelligence. It was solely intended to apply to agents of a foreign power who were in the United States. 
   This is a very dangerous game, and it's probably the most important debate that I've seen since I have been elected to the Congress. By allowing the Protect America Act to expire, by walking away from this Chamber 10 days ago and doing nothing about that, we see what the consequences are. We have heard the letters from the Director of Intelligence, from the Attorney General, and the failure now to be able to capture critical intelligence overseas.     
   In fact, some estimates are as high as 66 percent. In other words, we are going dark now in parts of the world where we should be paying attention. This is a dangerous game of politics; in my view it is partisan politics at its worst. 
   We are literally putting Americans at risk. The most solemn obligation we have as Members of Congress is to protect the American people. And there is a reason why since September 11 we haven't seen a September 11. 
   Intelligence is the best weapon we have, as the gentlewoman has mentioned, in this war on terror. And the idea that somehow when American soldiers are kidnapped in Iraq overseas by al Qaeda and yet we are denied the opportunity to listen in because we have to get lawyered up, and we have to go through the FISA Court to get that emergency warrant, and in the meantime one soldier is killed and two we have not heard from since, really saddens my heart as an American. And I believe, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania said, we are derelict in our responsibilities. 
   I want to share with the gentlewoman an editorial, an op-ed that I wrote with Admiral Bobby Inman. Why is Admiral Inman important? He was the Director of National Intelligence, the Deputy Director of the CIA under both Democrat and Republican administrations. Admiral Inman was one of the principal authors of the FISA statute. And in this editorial he says, to apply FISA to monitoring foreign communications, a suspected terrorist operating overseas such as Osama bin Laden and other key al Qaeda leaders, turns the original intent of FISA on its head. Turns the original intent of FISA on its head. 
   That is what a few key leaders on the other side of the aisle have done. By not allowing us to vote, they know that it would pass. It passed overwhelmingly in the Senate in a bipartisan way. And he goes on to say, contrary to some of the rhetoric coming from the Democrats, it is the members of al Qaeda, not American citizens, who are the target of these intelligence-gathering activities. 
   I submit the question, don't you think that most Americans want us to be listening to what al Qaeda is saying overseas? Don't you think most Americans want to hear the conversations that we know they are having, because this is a long-term struggle, and we know that they are planning to attack us again? Don't the American people want us to be listening to that? And yet by failing to make this Protect America Act permanent, we are denying that opportunity. 
   If I can just by saying that if, God forbid, something happens between now and the time we can finally get this body together to pass this act, and American blood is spilled, that blood will be on the hands of all Members of Congress. We need to get this act passed.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Forty-five days ago, the Protect America Act expired. Forty-five days ago, we began to lose critical intelligence overseas that could help better protect this Nation. Forty-five days ago, al Qaeda began to have the upper hand in this war on terror. Forty-five days ago, we started to  go dark in parts of the world. Why? Because the Democratic leadership will not allow this body to vote to make the Protect America Act permanent, as the Senate did many months ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a dangerous and reckless partisan play with the safety of the American people. It endangers the American people, both here at home and the warfighter abroad. We took an oath of office when we were sworn in to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. These are the foreign enemies. We are talking about foreign terrorists in a foreign country communicating foreign communications. This has nothing to do with the United States citizens. And yet, what the Democrats are allowing is to extend constitutional protections to people like Osama bin Laden and Khalil Sheikh Mohammad, al Qaeda leaders who are communicating about how they can perpetrate an act of evil like on September 11th. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a reason why this has not occurred since 9/11. It is because we have had good intelligence. Good intelligence is the best weapon we have in this war on terror. Without good intelligence, we cannot protect this Nation. And this is what this debate is all about. We all remember where we were on this day. But many of us don't remember where we were when the London arrests were made to stop airplanes from being blown up over the United States. Many of us don't remember the countless acts of heroism our intelligence community has performed in protecting the American people from plots against the United States. 
   I, myself, when I worked at the Justice Department, worked on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrants. They had to do with agents of informed power in the United States. Through the use of good intelligence overseas, without having to go through the FISA Court, we were able to stop a terrorist plot to blow up 10 American cities on the 4th of July. The voice that was intercepted said, ``Roast the Americans on Independence Day.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is real. This is a real-life threat to the American people. You don't have to take my word for it. I want to read for you a letter that was sent to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Reyes, from the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence about the expiration of the Protect America Act. What he says, he says, ``Our experience since Congress allowed the Protect America Act to expire without passing a bipartisan Senate bill,'' the bipartisan bill that was passed overwhelmingly in the Senate, that Senator Rockefeller supported, he says, ``demonstrates why the Nation is now more vulnerable to a terrorist attack and other foreign threats.'' 
   He explained that both the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence say in this letter to Chairman Reyes that the expiration of the authorities in the Protect America Act would plunge, would plunge critical intelligence programs into a state of uncertainty, which could cause us to delay the gathering of, or simply miss critical foreign intelligence information, and then underlined and highlighted in this letter, they warn the chairman, the Democratic chairman of the Intelligence Committee, that is exactly what has happened since the Protect America Act expired 6 days ago without enactment of the bipartisan Senate bill. We have lost intelligence information this past week as a direct result of the uncertainty created by Congress's, by Congress's failure to act. 
   What is the response from the Democrat leadership here in the House in response to a letter that says that we have failed to act in the Congress, a dereliction of duty, in my view, by Members of the House. Steny Hoyer, the majority leader says, there really is no urgency. Let's all just calm down. Intelligence agencies have all the tools they need. Really? When the Director of National Intelligence says just the opposite. 
   Chairman Silvestre Reyes says, you know, things will be just fine. Things will be just fine. Tell the American people that if we get hit again. Tell the three American soldiers who were kidnapped by insurgents in Iraq, and because we had to get ``lawyered up'' and go through a court in the United States because the time expired, one of those soldiers was killed and two we have not heard from since. You tell the families that there is no urgency and that things will be just fine. 
   Winning this war on terror, as the 9/11 Commission said, has everything to do with connecting the dots. But if we are not allowed to collect the dots, there is no way we can connect the dots. That is what this debate is all about. It's about being able to capture overseas foreign intelligence by terrorists, by people who wish to do us harm, who every day are hoping that this will happen again. 
   With that, I would like to yield to the gentlelady from New Mexico, who has really led the fight in the House on this issue, Congresswoman Heather Wilson from New Mexico. I would also be interested in your account of when this intelligence gap, if you will, this terrorist loophole first came to your attention. 
   With that, I yield.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. If I can ask the gentlelady that serves on the Intelligence Committee, we are talking, are we not, about foreign communications by a foreign target in a foreign country, but just because of the new technology, that it may touch a wire in the United States, it requires us to get attorneys to go before the FISA court to get a warrant. Is that correct?

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlewoman. So the threat is not only to the safety of American lives, in my view it is a threat to democracy. If this bill was allowed to come to the floor, it would pass overwhelmingly, as it did in the Senate. 
   Briefly before I yield, the gentlewoman talked a lot about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. I practiced law under that. 
   Admiral Inman, who is a supporter of mine, a friend in Austin, Texas, was the Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the NSA. He was one of the principal authors of the FISA statute. When we talked about the application of this, having to apply the FISA overseas to foreign terrorists, that we are extending constitutional protections to terrorists in foreign countries, what he said, and he wrote an op-ed with me, he said, ``To apply FISA to monitoring foreign communications of suspected terrorists operating overseas, such as Osama bin Laden and other key al Qaeda leaders, turns the original intent of the FISA statute on its head. Contrary to some of the rhetoric coming from the Democrats, it is the members of al Qaeda, not American citizens, who are the target of these intelligence gathering activities.'' 
   As the gentlewoman mentioned, in my view the driving force behind this dereliction of duty, this stopping democracy, is driven by a narrow special interest, and that is the ACLU and the trial lawyers pushing their agenda in a dangerous way that will put the American people at grave risk. 
   With that, I would like to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Dent).

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I appreciate the gentleman's comments. Yet when it comes to national security, it should be bipartisan. We are Americans first, before we are Republican or Democrat, yet there is a special interest driving this agenda, as the gentleman mentioned. The trial lawyers have filed a lawsuit in San Francisco against the telecommunication companies, and I would like for the gentleman from Pennsylvania maybe to expand a little bit on that. 
   I think most Americans don't quite understand how trial lawyers could drive the agenda with the Democratic leadership such that they will be placing the American people at grave risk and jeopardizing the safety of Americans.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I think we should be thanking these companies for their patriotic service in a time of war, not slapping lawsuits on them or putting the trial lawyers' interests above the warnings of the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General. Not just the U.S. Attorney General, but 25 State Attorneys General have signed a letter calling upon this Congress to act and pass the Protect America Act and make it permanent. So I would put more stock in the top law enforcement leaders in 25 of our States and the U.S. Attorney General over the special interests.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlelady. And I couldn't agree more that real-time intelligence is the best weapon we have. We can get the intelligence; but if it is not in real-time, it endangers our ability to protect the American people, as the gentlelady pointed out with the three American soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division who, unfortunately, one now is no longer alive and two are missing. 
   But I think it is important to give this an historical context and maybe take you back to a gentleman named Ramsey Yusef who came into the United States in 1992. He was detained; but because there wasn't enough detention space at the time, they let him go. And, from there, he conspired with the first al Qaeda cell in New York to take down the Twin Towers. And the idea of the plot was that one tower would fall, toppling over the other, and bring down the symbol of the economic superpower. They got a Ryder van, they loaded it up with explosives, went into the underground parking garage, and blew it up. Fortunately, the Towers survived that day. Although several people were killed, they didn't achieve that goal. That day would come later. 
   Ramsey Yusef escaped afterwards, went to Islamabad where he was in Pakistan, the Philippines. Then he hooked up with his uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It is all in the family. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, we would find out, would be the mastermind of September 11th. When they talked about in the mid-1990s flying airplanes into buildings, wouldn't it have been good to have that real-time intelligence? They talked about that. They talked about how they could take down the United States of America. And when Ramsey Yusef was finally arrested, he was arrested in a hotel room in Islamabad, they found something very eery. And I have worked with the FBI agents who arrested him, and it always left a very chilling sort of view in my mind, and that was, they found about a dozen baby dolls and these baby dolls were stuffed with chemical explosives. Mr. Yusef gives you great insight into the mind of the terrorists: Simple, brilliant, but evil genius. The same evil geniuses that perpetrated 9/11. He was planning to take those baby dolls on airplanes and blow them up. Of course, with the London arrests, later we would find they were back to their same game of using chemical explosives to blow up airplanes. Fortunately, our intelligence stopped that plot against the United States. 
   But we all know what happened on September 11th. We also know there was a secret meeting that took place overseas, and that the CIA was possibly aware of two of these people entering our country. And at that time, the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing all the time because the criminal division couldn't talk to the foreign counterintelligence division in the FBI. And I will never forget a quote from an FBI agent, because his words prior to 9/11 about his frustration apply the situation that I find and I think we find ourselves here in the House. 
   He wrote to FBI Headquarters, which was a gutsy move for a line FBI agent, and he said, ``Someday, someone will die, and the public will not understand why we were not more effective at throwing every resource we had at certain problems, especially since the biggest threat to us now, Osama bin Laden, is getting the most protection.'' 
   We are not throwing every resource that we can now at this problem. We are turning a blind eye to this problem. And if American blood is spilled while our watch is down, while we have allowed this Act to expire, that blood will be on the heads of Members of Congress who did not allow this to go to the floor for a vote. And, yes, the foreign terrorists now are getting protection. They are getting constitutional protection that the FISA statute never intended for them to get in the first place. 
   With that, I would like to yield to the gentlelady from New Mexico who is on the Intelligence Committee, Ms. Heather Wilson.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentlelady for her eloquence on this issue. And I think it is worth repeating again that we are talking about foreign targets in foreign countries overseas. I think the American people want us to be listening to what al Qaeda has to say. In fact, I think they expect that, and I think they would be shocked if they learned that our capabilities were put in jeopardy because of partisan politics and special interests. It is irresponsible. And, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania has often said, it is a dereliction of our duties here in the House to protect and defend the American people from enemies overseas. 
   The gentlelady talked about the war with the Soviets. In some ways it was a more predictable enemy, and the concept of mutually assured destruction applied to the Soviets because they valued their own life. The concept of mutually assured destruction does not apply to the Islamic jihadists, because they won't think twice about blowing themselves up if it means they can take other lives, particularly American lives. They won't think twice about flying airplanes into buildings and killing almost 3,000 people, including themselves, because, in their extreme fanatical view, that means the rewards in heaven are greater. That is the mindset of the enemy that we are working with. 
   Satellite imagery was very important in the Cold War. But in this war, this war on terror, intelligence is the best weapon that we have. And if that is taken away from the intelligence community, as the Democratic leadership is trying to do, if they take that capability away, as they did when they allowed the Protect America Act to expire, they are tying the hands of our intelligence community to better protect the United States of America. And I believe that is treasonness. 
   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. The gentlelady is correct. The Constitution applies to persons in the United States. The Constitution doesn't apply to foreign terrorists in a foreign country. I think that is the central heart of this debate that we are having here tonight. 
   As the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out, Mr. Moussaoui retained information on his computer that could have helped prevent this from happening. He is a person in the United States; and as such, properly the FBI and the Department of Justice went through the FISA court. The initial FISA application was turned down by the Office of Intelligence Policy Review. We lost critical time in processing that application. My point being, the FISA court is very document intensive, cumbersome and time-consuming. 
   We should not apply FISA court standards to foreign terrorists in a foreign country when real-time intelligence can stop something like this from happening here in the United States. 
   You know, when the wall was in place, one intelligence community was aware of these two individuals in the U.S., yet the FBI was not made aware and they could not track them down. 
   The FISA Court of Review issued an opinion about the wall when it finally struck it down and said that effective counterintelligence, we have learned, requires the whole-hearted cooperation of all of government's personnel who can be brought to the task. A standard which punishes such cooperation could well be thought dangerous to national security. So a lack of coordination and cooperation is dangerous to national security. 
   And if we can't work with the private sector, and in fact we cannot obtain this intelligence without the private sector; and if we will subject them to liability and to lawsuits for doing their American patriotism, we indeed will lose the private sector as a partner.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. The gentlelady is correct. What is at grave risk is not only in the war on terror capturing intelligence overseas, but if the private sector would be subject to liability and lawsuits, and they say to the government, ``I am not going to cooperate with you anymore,'' they don't have to. Then we place at jeopardy domestic investigations that could include child predators, organized crime, and a whole myriad of criminal activity in the United States. So this is setting a very dangerous precedent.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. The grave risk is that they will not cooperate on any investigation, whether it be overseas or domestically, because there is no incentive for them to cooperate with the FBI here or with our intelligence community abroad if we are going to subject them to liability and to lawsuits. 
   If there is wrongdoing on the part of the government, that is one issue. But  when the telecommunication companies are told that they need to cooperate in the interest of the national security, I don't think we should be slapping them with a lawsuit, we should be thanking them for protecting this Nation. 
   I want to go back to the gentleman's comments about the 9/11 Commission. After this occurred, we all were scrambling to do everything within our power to prevent this from happening again. The President met with his advisors, and the 9/11 Commission met. And they made recommendations and they talked about connecting the dots. The problem is that we cannot connect the dots, and we are not putting this information together. 
   What is at risk here tonight, as every hour passes that the Protect America Act has expired, is we cannot collect the dots to connect them. 
   I would like to draw on a quote, a letter from Attorney General Muskasey and the Director of National Intelligence McConnell to Chairman Reyes. He says, ``Our experience in the past few days since the expiration of the act demonstrates that these concerns are neither speculative nor theoretical. Allowing the act to expire without passing the bipartisan Senate bill has had real and negative consequences for our national security. Indeed, this has led directly to a degraded intelligence capability.'' 
   I don't know about you, but when I read that language from the experts in the intelligence community and our top law enforcement officer, it sends a chill up my spine. We need to pass this bill, and we need to do it now.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the gentleman. 
   Before we passed the Protect America Act, the Director of National Intelligence came to us and he said, ``I'm losing two-thirds of the intelligence out there.'' Well, now with the expiration of the Protect America Act, we can only imagine going back to that scenario. We were going dark in parts of the world. We were losing critical foreign intelligence from our enemy to better protect this Nation from another terrorist attack. 
   And to put to you, I think, one of the best quotes I've read, it really puts you in the mindset of who is the enemy and what is the real threat to the United States, I'd like to leave you tonight with the following words. And this is in their words, not mine. 
   ``The confrontation that we are calling for with the apostate regimes does not know Socratic debates, Plutonic ideals, nor Aristotle's diplomacy. But it does know the dialogue of bullets, the ideals of assassination, bombing and destruction, and the diplomacy of the cannon and the machine gun. 
   The Islamic governments have never and will never be established through peaceful solutions and cooperate councils. They are established, as they always have been, through pen and gun, by word and bullet, and by tongue and teeth.'' 
   The words that I just read to you are the words found in the preface of the al Qaeda training manual. They are the words of the enemy. That is what the enemy is telling us. We need to win in this war on terror and stop this enemy and protect the United States from this ever happening on American soil again. It is time to pass a bipartisan Senate bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm proud today to cosponsor and to support this bill and extend my gratitude for the bipartisan cooperation that went into drafting this important legislation--Congressman Schiff, Chairman Thompson, Chairman Langevin. 
   The detonation of a nuclear device in an urban area of this country would be catastrophic to say the least. And with nuclear proliferation worldwide with such apparatuses as the A.Q. Kahn network reaching the Islamic jihad world, countries like Iran, North Korea, Venezuela, the threat of a nuclear explosion and the threat of nuclear devices coming into this country is very real. This bill will help prevent that. 
   Reducing the risk of nuclear or radiological terrorism requires a layered system of defenses that involves deterring, detecting, disrupting and recovering from terrorist attacks. 
   We've spent a great deal of time in this Congress discussing the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic and Nuclear Detection Office, or DNDO, to deploy radiation portal monitors at our Nation's ports of entry. These monitors, staffed by Customs and Border Protection officers, are the Nation's first line of defense against illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological material. 
   I'd like to take this opportunity to commend the DNDO on their achievements in this area. But even with the best possible detection systems, the possibility remains that terrorists could beat the system and sneak something past one of our detectors and through a non-official port of entry. That is why defense against terrorism, especially nuclear terrorism, requires a multi-layered approach. 
   This bill will improve a critical layer in our Nation's system defenses against the risk of nuclear and radiological terrorism by codifying the role of the National Technical Nuclear Forensic Center, which already exists within the DNDO. By enhancing our nuclear forensic capabilities, we will be able to more easily identify the source of nuclear materials. And while getting the whole picture also requires good intelligence and law-enforcement style investigations, a credible attribution program could even serve as a deterrent against nuclear terrorism. 
   A main concern I have had is the decreasing number of qualified people into the fields associated with nuclear forensics. In recent years, the number of young people entering scientific fields has declined. The nuclear fields, in particular, are suffering, especially in fields relevant to nuclear forensics, which may have no commercial counterpart. I'm pleased that this legislation includes language designed to strengthen the pipeline of talented new scientists into this important field, especially from minority-serving institutions, so as to take full advantage of all the talent present in our universities. 
   This bill instructs the Department to establish a National Nuclear Forensics Expertise Development Program which is devoted to developing and maintaining a vibrant and enduring pipeline of technical professionals. This program will grant scholarships and fellowships from the undergraduate through the postdoctorate level of study in nuclear and geochemical science specialties, directly relevant to technical nuclear forensic. 
   This legislation is the first step in the right direction of reinvigorating the work force in an area critical to continued defense against nuclear and radiological terrorism. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and its goals to improve the state of nuclear forensics in this country. 
   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

They want to acquire this capability, and we know that with the proliferation of this technology with nuclear capability, through the A.Q. Khan network to many other countries, we know that this threat is literally on the doorstep. I believe this bill will go a long ways to protecting Americans which, after all, is our first and foremost obligation as Members of Congress to protect the American people as the Constitution requires. 
   And that is why I'm so proud that this was presented in a bipartisan fashion. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an American issue. It is about protecting the lives of the American people. And I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first I rise in support of this bill, and I am pleased that our troops are being supported with the funding necessary. 
   But I also rise in my capacity as ranking member of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Homeland Security Committee to make an important observation about this supplemental appropriations bill. 
   The funding included in the prior supplemental that would have provided $800 million for advancing the national strategy for pandemic influenza are not in this supplemental. I'm perplexed as to how the strategic threat to this Nation of a pandemic influenza outbreak declined in the past 2 weeks. We all voted to include it then, and now it is gone. 
   I bring this up to remind all of us that emerging threats are best addressed with preparation before the outbreak. Once an outbreak occurs, it is too late. I cannot tell you the day or week when the pandemic influenza will occur, but all the experts agree that it will. Our only strategy, therefore, is to prepare now so we will be ready when it does happen. 
   We run catastrophic risks in delaying this pandemic influenza preparation, and I strongly encourage the House to include this funding in the next appropriations vehicle. The risks here are simply too great to postpone our preparations.

   Madam Speaker, our most solemn duty in the United States Congress is to protect the American people; and while this bill may be well intentioned, it fails to do that. In fact, just the opposite. It puts the American people in great danger. 
   Before running for Congress, I worked in the Justice Department. I worked on national security, wiretaps or FISAs. The intention of the FISA Act was never to apply to agents of a foreign power in a foreign country. It was to apply to agents of a foreign power in this country. This bill does just the opposite. It expands it to bar a collection of foreign intelligence on foreign targets in foreign countries. 
   FISA is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. I am concerned that if we cannot collect intelligence overseas that we cannot protect our war fighter in the battlefield. We put them in danger, and we put the citizens of this country in danger. 
   We all know that al Qaeda is looking at hitting us again. It may be very soon. And with the anniversary of 9/11 approaching, we must do everything we can to protect her.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to thank Chairman LANGEVIN and Ranking Member ROGERS for their leadership on this issue, and I am proud to have been a coauthor of this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 599, a bipartisan bill to help protect and encourage companies that develop antiterrorism technologies. This bill helps implement the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies, or SAFETY Act. The SAFETY Act was passed as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, and basically it encourages companies to develop antiterrorism technology by limiting their liability in the event of a terrorist attack. 
   As part of the oversight provided in the 109th Congress, the Homeland Security Committee determined that the SAFETY Act better protected the American people, and over 60 new technologies have been approved for coverage under the SAFETY Act in areas such as radiation detection, facility protection and passenger screening. 
   Unfortunately, in order to qualify for SAFETY Act protection, companies must go through a cumbersome application process rife with red tape. This bill cuts that red tape by requiring DHS to streamline their process and make it more effective. 
   In my district there are a number of companies developing antiterrorism technologies, including detection and identification systems. By limiting their potential legal liability, this bill will help them develop new technologies to address the real and constant threat of a terrorist attack. 
   This bill represents a commonsense, bipartisan approach, and I applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, an approach to streamline government and make it friendlier to the American people. By doing this, we will make it easier for government and the private sector to work together to make America safer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today not in opposition to  what this legislation stands for, but out of concern for what this legislation fails to include. 
   Numerous provisions that were part of the authorization bill which were approved unanimously and reported by the Committee on Homeland Security were removed from the legislation that is before us today. And these provisions were largely eliminated without any real policy justification for their removal. Never in the history of the Homeland Security Committee has such an action been done. 
   One of these provisions stripped from the authorization bill before us today was based on a piece of legislation I introduced which authorizes the National Bio and Agro Facility, or NBAF. The text of this legislation was unanimously approved at the Committee on Homeland Security authorization bill markup. 
   I am at a loss as to why my colleagues across the other side of the aisle unilaterally decided to eliminate the NBAF provision from this bill, especially when some of my Democratic colleagues on the committee, including Chairman Thompson, were original cosponsors of the NBAF legislation. 
   The need for the NBAF is clear and immediate. Its establishment is crucial to defending our Nation from agroterrorism and naturally occurring animal diseases. Currently, there's not one Biosafety Level 3 and BSL 4 livestock laboratory in the United States, and the NBAF provision would have authorized a facility to fill that gap. 
   DHS is conducting a site selection process right now. Eighteen sites have been looked at across the country, one close to my district at Texas A&M. They are investing significant resources in the competition. 
   I'd also like to note that some of the other sites being considered lie in or near districts represented by Democratic colleagues. 
   Congress has already provided $46 million for pre-construction NBAF activities, and yet, DHS currently does not have the legal authority it needs to even procure the land. 
   Because the enactment of this legislation is crucial to the establishment of the NBAF and to defending the Nation against the threats of agroterrorism, and because this legislation was eliminated from the authorization bill before us, I urge my colleagues to work to move forward in a bipartisan way to help secure our homeland and to pass H.R. 1717.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee for yielding me this time. 
   Here we are once again. I feel like we have done this before. Once again, I rise in opposition to the Democratic leadership's latest attempt to politicize the war, and I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote against defeat in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, the debate in this Chamber over the future of Iraq and the best course of action has been passionate and divisive, and each Member of this House has their own opinion. Yet the one thing we should be united on is our end goal and result. That should be the same: a democratic and stable Iraq. 
   The Democratic majority has chosen to use this month of July, as they have  attempted several times already this year, to hold a series of votes to withdrawal our troops and force a premature end to Iraq's pursuit of freedom and democracy. 
   We have to ask: What would happen if we withdrawal immediately? When we talk to the experts in the region, the leaders in these governments and key stakeholders in the region, they will tell you it will be a fireball in the Middle East. It will create a vacuum, a safe haven for al Qaeda. Iran will swoop in and take over. They, the key nations in the region, are quite frankly terrified of this action, and they tell us that privately. 
   I believe that we can cannot afford that course of action. The Democrats have chosen this course not because it is in the national interest of this country but rather because they believe it provides them with good talking points to use back home. I submit they are mistaken. 
   In my view, Americans are tired and frustrated with the partisan squabbling over the war which has done nothing to improve the situation in Iraq. Putting politics above our national interest while the men and women of our military are fighting overseas is simply unacceptable.     
   In a time of war, politics should end at the water's edge. 
   There is another way forward. I and others have introduced the Iraq Study Group recommendations Implementation Act of 2007. This legislation is bipartisan. It is a comprehensive set of recommendations, a plan of action to succeed in Iraq, a plan which matches our military might with political solutions, with economic solutions and with a diplomatic surge which can bring peace and stability to the troubled nation. This bill has gained strength by those who recognize that moving forward in a unified way still exists in the Congress. 
   The Iraq Study Group report offers a consensus policy that the vast majority of Americans support. The sponsors of the Democrat withdrawal bill that we are debating here today, however, have decided that even though the surge only came into effect 3 weeks ago, that it's already failed and we need to question it and throw it out. 
   They further decided that we should declare defeat immediately and not wait for General Petraeus to come to Congress and give us his firsthand report. This rush to judgment, this rush to action on their part makes it clear that they have not reached an informed decision but, rather, a political one. 
   Throughout the course of our American history, we've answered the call for freedom, and we, Mr. Speaker, I submit are at our greatest when we are united as a Nation; at our worst when we are divided. 
   We should unite behind the ideals which helped achieve victory against the threats to our very way of life, such as the victories against the Third Reich, such as the threats by the Soviet empire and the victory against the Soviet Union. 
   Today, the greatest threat is the threat of terrorism, and the conflict in Iraq poses one of the greatest challenges to the American experience. We must unite, or we will surely fail.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the chairman and ranking member for their bipartisan spirit on this bill. It was an honor and I was proud to be a conferee to this report. 
   This is not a perfect bill. We raised concerns at the conference regarding the 100 percent screening for cargo containers, and I don't believe that's a realistic assessment. However, there were enough exceptions to give the Secretary flexibility that I felt comfortable. 
   Also, the Visa Waiver Program which the terrorists have exploited. However, under this bill, those provisions will be strengthened. 
   But nearly 6 years after the attacks of September 11, I believe it is now time to implement the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, but I want to focus my remarks at this moment on a unique opportunity we had with this bill and with the conference to address a gaping loophole in our national security, and that is regarding the FISA statute and FISA reform bill. 
   When I worked in the Justice Department, I worked on national security wiretaps, or FISAs as they were referred to. I believe that intelligence is our first line of defense in this war on terror, and the 9/11 Commission recognized this when they said there were systematic problems with covering communications of potential terrorists. 
   Just recently, Director McConnell wrote a letter to Chairman Reyes of the Intelligence Committee, and I think it's important to know what he said. He said: ``Our Nation faces an intelligence `gap,' a situation in which  our intelligence community everyday is `missing a significant portion of what we should be getting' in order to protect the American people. 
   ``Under FISA today, `we are significantly burdened in capturing overseas communications of foreign terrorists planning to conduct attacks inside the United States.' '' 
   As the head of the Nation's intelligence community, he says that, ``I am obligated to provide warning of threats of terrorist activity and I have deep concern of the current threat situation.'' 
   Indeed, the National Intelligence Estimate, recently published, concluded that our Nation faces a determined al Qaeda. 
   ``If we are to stay a step ahead of the terrorists and protect the American people,'' he says, ``I firmly believe that we need to be able to use our capabilities to collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets overseas without the requirements imposed by an out-of-date FISA statute. 
   ``Simply put,'' he says, ``in a significant number of cases,'' this is the Director of National Intelligence, ``we are in the unfortunate position of having to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located overseas.'' 
   He says, ``It is essential that the administration and Congress work together and without delay to close the current intelligence gap by amending the FISA statute.'' 
   I will say that every day we waste by not amending the statute and closing this gaping loophole in our national intelligence law, every day we take a risk of another attack on the United States, and I call upon my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us to get this done before we go home for the August recess.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our troops and in support of victory in Iraq. 
   It is hard to ignore the inconvenient truth that this ill-timed measure will aid the terrorists and depress the morale of our soldiers who are fighting to defeat them. It also sends a wrong message to our troops at exactly the wrong time. They are carrying out their mission, as I speak, while we here in the Congress are condemning them. 
   It amazes me that at the same time General Petraeus was confirmed by the Senate, this resolution was introduced condemning his counterinsurgency plan for victory. 
   Never in our history has this country sent a war leader into battle, while condemning the very mission that he and the Armed Forces will be leading. 
   Make no mistake, this resolution is the first step towards cutting off funding for our troops. As a consultant to the Iraq Study Group, I supported the findings that failure is not an option, and that a troop surge is necessary for security and stability. I also supported the recommendation that a political and diplomatic surge is essential for peace. 
   The time for evaluating the success or failure of this endeavor will come soon enough, but now is not the time to be sending a message to friend and foe alike that we no longer believe in the mission. 
   But many in this country and many in this Chamber insist it is in America's interest to surrender and retreat from our obligation to help Iraq build a stable democracy. They say that, knowing full well the consequences of an early American withdrawal. 
   And what are those consequences? Chaos, instability in the region, and, in al Qaeda's own words, a threat that America has never seen before. 
   Recently, the ambassadors from Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia told me that ``if the U.S. fails here, it will be catastrophic. We are in this together. They will come after us and then they will come after you.'' And then they will come after you. 
   Recently, after meeting with them, I had to say to myself, how will history then judge us; that when we stood at the brink, we chose retreat over advancement, surrender over victory, and defeatism for our children and for future generations? 
   Let us remember the words of President Kennedy, when he said: ``Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and success of liberty.'' 
   Where is the party of President Kennedy today? This resolution sends a clear message across the Islamic jihad world that we will not bear any burden, that we will not oppose any foe, that we have lost our will, that they have won, and that they can come and they can get us. 
   I believe Abraham Lincoln summed it up best by saying that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. 
   As Members of Congress, the most sobering job that we have is to comfort the families left behind in a time of  great loss and a time of war. I have stood by, like many of my colleagues, to honor those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. We all stand here today indebted to those brave Americans and their families. 
   And because those heroes and those families cannot speak on the floor of the House, I would like to share some of their words here with you today. And these are the words of Janet Norwood, a constituent, a Gold Star Mother, whose son, Byron, was killed in Fallujah while serving in Iraq. And she said: In the past I have always had great hope for this country. But, for the first time, during the State of the Union address last month, I had real doubts. I had doubts about our winning this war on terrorism. She said, When President Bush used the word ``victory,'' only half of the room stood to applaud. My heart sank. It was obvious to me at that moment that party affiliation was more important to some than victory over evil and the sacrifice our son and other sons have made. 
   Well, to Janet and all the other Gold Star Mothers, I say, I couldn't agree more. And as Abraham Lincoln said, a house divided cannot stand.  
   September 11 changed our lives forever. But the war on terror started long before that. The year 1979 changed the world. When Iran took our embassy hostage, the seeds of Islamic jihad were spread all over the Middle East. 
   These seeds planted hatred and contempt for freedom in the souls of men like Osama bin Laden. In 1983, they murdered our marines in Beirut. In 1993, Ramzi Yousef and his al Qaeda associates bombed the World Trade Center. They were supposed to fall that day, but that day would come later. 
   They struck the Khobar Towers in 1996. They bombed our embassies in Africa. They defeated us in Somalia. And they deliberately attacked the USS Cole. 
   Each time we failed to respond. And then came September 11. It was as if the United States was a sleeping giant. And not until the bloodiest alarm of 9/11 did the giant finally awake. And America cannot afford to go back to sleep again. 
   ``It is hard to ignore the inconvenient truth that this ill-timed measure will aid the terrorists and depress the morale of our soldiers who are fighting to defeat them.'' It also sends the wrong message to our troops at the wrong time. They are carrying out their mission as I speak, while we here in Congress are condemning it. 
   The time for evaluating the success or failure of this endeavor will come soon enough, but now is not the time to be sending a message to friend and foe alike that we no longer believe in this mission. 
   It amazes me that just as General Petraeus was confirmed by the Senate, this resolution was introduced condemning his counter-insurgency plan for victory. 
   ``Never in our history has this country sent a war leader into battle while condemning the mission that he and the armed forces he will be leading have been asked to complete.'' 
   Make no mistake; this resolution is the first step towards cutting off funding for our troops. As a consultant to the Iraq Study Group, I supported the findings that a troop surge is necessary for security and stability. I also supported the recommendation that a political and diplomatic surge is essential for victory. 
   But many in this country, and many in this chamber, insist it is in America's interest to surrender and retreat from our obligation to help Iraq build a stable democracy. They say that, knowing full well the consequences of an early American withdrawal. 
   And what are those consequences-- 
   Chaos. Instability in the region. A threat that America has never seen before. A threat that we will not be able to blindly put our head in the sand and wish it to go away. 
   Al Qaeda has openly said that they consider Iraq the central front in the ``Third World War.'' Their goal is to create a Caliphate with Baghdad as its capital. Their plan is to then conquer the rest of the world and force all humanity to submit to Radical Islam. 
   The National Intelligence Estimate released last month stated, ``If Coalition forces were withdrawn rapidly...... this almost certainly would lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq.'' 
   Our allies agree. The Ambassadors from Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia recently told me, ``If the U.S. fails it will be catastrophic. We are in this together ..... they will come after us and then they will come after you.'' 
   How will history judge us then? That when we stood at the brink we chose retreat over advancement, surrender over victory, and defeatism for our children and for future generations. 
   Let us remember the words of President Kennedy when he said:  
   Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.''  
   Where is the party of President Kennedy today? This resolution sends a clear message across the Islamic Jihad world--that we will not bear any burden--that we will not oppose any foe--that we have lost our will--that they have won--that they can come and get us. 
   We are better than that. 
   We are Americans--the same Americans who defeated the most powerful country in the world at the time to win our independence. 
   We are the same Americans who defeated Fascists in Japan, Germany and Italy. 
   We are the same Americans who defeated the scourge of the Soviet Union, liberating millions more. 
   Now we face yet another challenge--defeating the jihadists and an ideology of hate. But our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say ``We will support the War on Terror, except where the terrorists have chosen to fight it.'' 
   Our previous struggles were not easy, they were hard and required great sacrifice. Yet all of these challenges were met, and victory was won, and the world is a better place because of it. This struggle is the same. If we give up now, we betray not just the Iraqi people, and not just our place in history, but those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. 
   I believe Abraham Lincoln summed it up best by saying:  
   . . . that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain . . .  
   As Members of Congress, the most sobering job we have is to comfort the families left behind in a time of great loss, in a time of war. I have stood by, like many of my colleagues, to honor those who have paid the ultimate price for freedom. We all stand here today indebted to those brave Americans and their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. McCAUL of Texas. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment offered by Mr. Wolf of Virginia to restore $158 million to this bill for democracy, governance, rule of law and human rights programs. In addition, it will fund nonproliferation and anti-terrorist programs. 
   Mr. Chairman, the debate in this Chamber over the future of Iraq and the best course of action has been passionate and divisive. Each Member of this Hou se has their own opinion, yet the one thing we should be united on is that our end goal should be the same, a secure and stable Iraq. 
   Unfortunately, this bill predetermines failure by cutting off all funds to important democracy-building programs in Iraq. The majority has chosen to use this bill, as they have attempted several times already this year, to force a premature end to Iraq's pursuit of freedom and democracy. This will only lead to chaos and instability in the region. 
   As a consultant to th e Iraq Study Group, along with Mr. Wolf of Virginia, we introduced a bipartisan bill, the Iraq Study Group Recommendations Implementation Act of 2007 which provides a comprehensive set of recommendations and a plan of action to succeed in Iraq. Included in these recommendations are suggestions for funding democracy, governance and rule of law, all the items that are funded by this amendment. 
   This bill has garnered 52 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, who have recognized the potential we have by implementing these recommendations together and moving forward as a united Congress. If we allow this bill to pass without the money for building an Iraq democracy, we condemn our mission to failure and declare that the sacrifices we made over the past several years were in vain. It will also squander any opportunity we have to give the Iraq Study Group recommendations a chance to succeed. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support the Wolf amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I thank the chairman. 
   I rise today to offer an amendment that will p artially restore the administration's funding request for the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account in the FY08 State Department and Foreign Operations appropriations bill. This amendment would add $30 million to the account, halfway between the committee funding level and the President's request. This is a bipartisan amendment. I would like to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Cuellar, for his support as an author and cosponsor. 
   Earlier this month I atten ded the U.S.-Mexico Interparliamentary Group in Austin, Texas, and for 3 days we talked about issues important to the United States and Mexico. The major topic discussed was the issue of increasing violence and lawlessness along the U.S.-Mexico border. The drug cartels have taken control over northern Mexico and law enforcement has become corrupt and ineffective. Since his inauguration earlier this year, President Calderon has begun a renewed effort to reestablish law enforcement's control over his country and their borders. However, the drug kingpins are ruthless in their efforts to retain control and the Mexican Government's law enforcement capabilities are sorely outdated. Just recently, the drug cartels brazenly ordered the assassination of a Mexican state legislator. 
   I would like to take a moment to commend Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf for including $27.5 million in the bill for this effort and for recognizing in the report language of the bill the need to address this problem w hich so devastatingly impacts our southern border, our national security and the citizens of this country. However, I believe that additional funding would go a long way to eradicating the drug cartels. 
   The offset in this amendment is a $30 million reduction in the contributions to the international organization's account. I believe it's a worthwhile transfer of funds that will benefit not only our border with Mexico but also our counterdrug efforts worldwide. One of the most important international pea cekeeping efforts today should be on the southern border against the violent criminal enterprise of the narcotraffickers. 
   The cartels control the corridor routes into this country, exporting drugs and human trafficking across our southern border. The intersection between these criminal enterprises and potential terrorists could be deadly. In the post-9/11 world, we can no longer continue to ignore this threat. 
   At a time when the newly elected Mexican Government has stepped forward and made a commitm ent to reform its law enforcement and combat the drug cartels, it is important that we provide as much funding and resources as possible to the International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement program. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. McCAUL of Texas. I will consider withdrawing the amendment. I would like to get a few assurances from the gentlelady, if I may, and that is that this funding would be directed primarily, would be targeted towards the problem at the U.S.-Mexico border with the drug cartels who have controlled these corridors that I mentioned. 
   If I could just add, my subcommittee on Homeland Security issued this report on the border last conference confirming the threat . This was given to President Calderon by Secretary Chertoff. 
   He understands this. I have met with the Mexican Congress. They understand it. Our State Department actually does understand this. While they may not ask overtly, they really could use these funds to confront this threat. 
   I would ask, in exchange for withdrawing, that we try to come as close as possible to the number I have requested and that that money be directed towards the threat that Mr. Cuellar and I see so often down in a bord er State.
