<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 800. 
   The secret ballot is absolutely critical to the integrity of the election process. Workers shouldn't be intimidated by corporate executives, labor bosses, or fellow workers. That is why nine out of ten Americans oppose stripping workers of their right to a private vote when determining whether or not to join a union. 
   Now, let us be honest about what this bill is really about. Union membership is down, Democratic influence is up, and the secret ballot is headed out. I have to admit that I find it very ironic that just months after our Nation went to the polls and voted in secret ballot elections putting our Democratic friends in control of the Congress, they are now in turn trying to strip that very same right away from workers across this country. 
   I believe that unions have done a lot of good for our society and have played an integral role in establishing and protecting the rights of workers. They have a very proud history and continue to provide competitive benefits, training programs, and workplace protections for millions of workers across the country. 
   However, this legislation does nothing to level the playing field for a worker trying to determine whether or not to be represented by a union. Rather, it undercuts the law that it was designed to protect workers' rights in and terminates a vital right afforded to our Nation's workforce. 
   The bottom line is that workers should want to join a union because of the benefits of that union, not because they are scared not to do so. I hope my colleagues will listen to the union workers for whom this legislation is purported to benefit. In 2004 Zogby International polled 70 union members regarding this very issue. Seventy-eight percent of these union workers said that Congress should keep the existing secret ballot election process in place and not replace it with another process. 
   I urge my colleagues to listen to the rank and file union workers and vote to protect the sanctity of the secret ballot. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 800.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 131, a resolution recognizing and honoring the lifetime contributions of Rafael Jos&#233; Diaz-Balart, on the dedication of the Rafael Diaz-Balart Hall at the Florida International University College of Law. 
   I would like to thank my friend Mr. Meek for introducing this important resolution. 
   The founding of the Florida International University College of Law did not become possible until 2000. The college of law received full accreditation from the American Bar Association in December 2006. 
   The law school is home to 382 law students and 25 faculty members. The Rafael Diaz-Balart Hall was designed by the renowned architect and dean of architecture at Yale University, Robert A.M. Stern. It incorporates two interior courtyards, an atrium, a reading room, an auditorium, a legal clinic, and two teaching courtrooms. In addition, the hall will have two additional rooms solely for expanding international and foreign law collections. 
   Of particular interest to the students and the school are volumes focusing on international organization and Caribbean and Latin American law.     
   Rafael Diaz-Balart, for whom the hall was named, was born in Cuba and earned a law degree from the University of Havana in 1919. He later served as a lawyer, a judge, president of the city council and was eventually elected mayor of the city of Banes and then was elected congressman. Diaz-Balart went into exile in 1959 and earned his second law degree from the University of Madrid in 1965. He died in Miami in  1985. Mr. Diaz-Balart is also the grandfather of two distinguished Members of Congress, Mario and Lincoln Diaz-Balart. 
   I congratulate the Florida International University College of Law on receiving its full American Bar Association accreditation and the inauguration of this beautiful new hall. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I would totally agree with my colleague, Mr. Meek, that the Diaz-Balart family has made America a much better place for all of our children to grow up. I have been very honored to serve with both Lincoln and Mario Diaz-Balart, and I know they both have a lot of pride in their grandfather. 
   I am very happy that Mr. Meek introduced this resolution honoring Rafael Diaz-Balart. Mr. Meek also obviously has a lot of pride in the bloodline he has with the famous Congresswoman Carrie Meek. I was reminded of her just this past weekend when I was down in Miami for the football game on Sunday and I parked on Carrie Meek Boulevard down there. 
   I explained to the parking lot attendant that I served with Carrie Meek and I am friends with her son, Kendrick Meek. He said, Yeah, man. That will be thirty bucks. It only gets you so far. But I have a lot of pride in knowing both of these families. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Florida's men's basketball team on their second consecutive NCAA, Division I championship. On April 2 of this year, they joined only six other teams in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships. My congratulations also go out to Coach Billy Donovan, who has done a fine job with these young men, not only leading them to back-to-back championships but also for preparing them for what lies ahead in life. 
   The University of Florida is a fine institution with many standout athletes. My home State of Florida and I are tremendously proud of their accomplishments on and off the field. The University of Florida is the only Division I college in history to win the national championship in basketball and football in the same calendar year. In fact, between the Gator championships in basketball and football, I don't think there will be an athlete on campus who has not met the President by the time they graduate. 
   Now, so many of these Gator basketball and football will be heading off to the NBA and NFL where they will have to struggle to make due on their multi-million dollar salaries. The good news for many of these other schools is that a lot of the starters will be moving on. The bad news, of course, is I am hearing they are having their best recruiting classes ever in both football and basketball. Ohio State was such a worthy opponent both in football and basketball and handled themselves with so much class, much praise is warranted to the Buckeye fans as well. Congratulations on a job well done.

   We need additional cops now more than ever. For example, in my hometown of Orlando, Florida, we experienced a 123 percent increase in the murder rate last year. Yesterday I received a letter from a 7-year-old boy in Orlando. He writes, ``My name is Santiago Valera. I am a 7-year-old boy. I live with my grandma. We live in Orlando, Florida. Every day bad people rob and kill good people. They even shot my Auntie Connie in her neck. I'm afraid to go outside and play. I don't want someone to kill my little brother or me or my grandma. Please help us.'' 
   To Santiago and all the other little boys and girls of central Florida, please know that we hear your concerns, and help is on the way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3927, a measure to extend programs under the Higher Education Act, which are set to expire at the end of this month, for an additional 6 months. This is a clean extension. This will simply change the date required to reauthorize this law from October 31, 2007, until April 30, 2008. I thank my committee colleagues, Chairman Miller, Chairman Hinojosa, and Ranking Member McKeon, for their work on this bill, as well as their consistent efforts on behalf of our Nation's college students and their families. 
   Mr. Speaker, while I support the extension of the Higher Education Act, I also believe that we need to get on with it at this point and reauthorize this important law. The last time this law was authorized was when President Bill Clinton was in office back in 1998, and it expired in 2004. 
   We need to work in a bipartisan way to finally reauthorize the Higher Education Act. Republicans on the House Education Committee recently took a positive step in this direction by introducing H.R. 3746, The College Access and Opportunity Act of 2007. This bill is an updated version of H.R. 609, the Higher Education reauthorization bill that passed the House last Congress but was not taken up by the Senate. H.R. 3746 would strengthen the Pell Grant program by providing for year-round Pell Grants, and it would address college affordability by providing transparency in college costs, among other things. 
   I hope that we will move forward with the Higher Education Act reauthorization in a bipartisan and thoughtful manner. I look forward to working with Ranking Member McKeon and Chairmen Miller and Hinojosa and all of my colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee in completing our work in the coming months. In the meantime, however, I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this extension. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the problem of skyrocketing gas prices. We must reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Our constituents deserve straight talk on this issue and here it is: The main component of the price of gasoline at the pump is crude oil. Crude oil is a commodity governed by the law of supply and demand. Therefore, we must reduce our demand and increase our supply. 
   We should reduce our demand by having tax incentives for hybrids, raising fuel efficiency standards, and investing in alternative renewable energy sources like wind, solar, biomass, and nuclear. We must also increase our domestic supply of oil. We can do that by drilling in Alaska, drilling in the gulf of Mexico, and building more refineries. 
   The straight talk is we need a comprehensive approach of more drilling and more conservation to achieve long-term energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 400, the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2007. If a contractor in Iraq decides to engage in the corrupt business practice of overbilling the U.S. military to maximize his profits, he will now face 20 years in a Federal prison cell and a fine of $1 million. 
   Those bad apples who defraud the American taxpayer must be held accountable, regardless of whether the sleazy, fraudulent practice occurred in the United States, Afghanistan, or Iraq. This is especially true when the  fraud relates to our military and reconstruction activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, because such schemes could directly harm our country's global war against terrorism. 
   Moreover, corruption by a handful of individuals who are ostensibly engaged in supporting our military and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan unfairly tarnishes the reputation of the many honorable military and civilian contractors, the overwhelming majority of whom risk their lives daily and professionally perform their duties. 
   Fortunately, according to the testimony of Stuart Bowen, Jr., the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, most contractors are good apples, and the incidence of corruption within the U.S. reconstruction program constitutes a small component of the overall American financial contribution to Iraq's reconstruction. 
   These cases often require extensive investigative resources and documentation. Having to gather such evidence in a dangerous setting like Iraq or Afghanistan makes it difficult to build a successful criminal case. 
   Nevertheless, the U.S. Government has brought many successful prosecutions, and it will likely bring more. For example, Philip Bloom was sentenced earlier this year to 46 months in prison as a result of his scheme to defraud the Coalition Provisional Authority by rigging contract bids in excess of $8.6 million. 
   In addition, Robert Stein, the former Coalition Provisional Authority comptroller and funding officer, was sentenced to 9 years in prison earlier this year. He was prosecuted and convicted of funneling numerous contracts to Bloom in exchange for kickbacks and bribes. Overall, the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction has opened over 300 criminal and civil investigations, leading to 10 arrests, five persons indicted, five convicted, and two imprisoned. The Inspector General continues to work on 79 live investigations, and these investigations may involve one or more targets. Twenty-eight of these investigations are currently being prosecuted by the Department of Justice, 23 of these are criminal cases, and five are civil. 
   In short, this legislation creates a new crime with a maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, which is double the existing crime of fraud against the government, and deservedly so. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 400. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume, and then I will turn and yield 30 seconds to Mr. Davis of Virginia. I will go ahead and respond as Mr. Davis is gathering his thoughts. 
   One of the concerns Mr. Davis raised was what if there was some inadvertent overpricing by a contractor based on a mistake and later went back and corrected it. My reading of the bill is that person wouldn't be prosecuted because there's a three-prong standard. First, you have to knowingly, materially overvalue goods or service with the intent to defraud. And the intent-to-defraud prong would not be met under the analogy or the example Mr. Davis gave because ``intent to defraud'' is a term of art which requires that the actor possesses the specific intent to cheat the government. And you would not have that element of the crime proven if you had inadvertent overpricing based on a mistake. 
   Now, it doesn't mean you may not have what he's concerned about, an overzealous prosecutor try to prosecute someone without having the prongs or the factual basis for it. We can ask the prosecutor from the Duke case what happens when you're overzealous in your prosecutions. But I believe under that particular example that person wouldn't be prosecuted. 
   However, before I yield to Mr. Davis, let me just say, he does have a great deal of experience dealing with Government reform issues as the ranking member and represents a lot of government employees. And so I certainly am empathetic to his concerns that perhaps his committee might have had some insight into this bill that was worth looking at. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis).

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume and am prepared to yield back as we have no further speakers. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill. We agree on a bipartisan basis that when a corrupt contractor overbills our U.S. military, it rips off the taxpayers, it hurts our national security, and it unfairly stains the reputation of the many honorable military and civilian contractors who risk their lives every day and do a professional and honest job.     
   This bill appropriately says that if you plan on overbilling or ripping off the U.S. military in terms of these contracts to do reconstruction work or military-related work in Iraq or Afghanistan, you are going to be sitting in a prison cell for 20 years and you are going to pay a fine of $1 million. We think that is an appropriate message to accept in light of this problem. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 400.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of S. 3035, a 1-month extension of the Higher Education Act. I would like to begin by extending my thoughts and prayers to Senator Kennedy and his family in this difficult time. We are all saddened to learn of the diagnosis of his malignant brain tumor and we are hoping and praying for a speedy and full recovery. 
   I was just with Senator Kennedy a few days ago in the Oval Office with President Bush, as the President signed into law the Ensuring Continuing Access to Student Loans Act on May 7. Senator Kennedy was in a jovial mood and was in good spirits. We look forward to seeing him in the same condition in the future. 
   Senator Kennedy obviously has played a very integral role in the development of this higher education legislation, and I want to recognize him for his passion for education and his longstanding efforts to ensure that all young people receive a quality education and have the opportunity to obtain a college degree. As we extend the Higher Education Act and allow additional time to negotiate the renewal of this landmark law, I think all of us know that this legislation will bear the indelible imprint of Senator Kennedy's hard work and commitment. 
   Just last month, we were on the floor passing what we thought and hoped would be the last extension of the Higher Education Act. Unfortunately, while we have made a tremendous amount of progress on the bill, the size of the bill and our concern about producing a thoughtful product prevented us from completing our work. 
   The Education and Labor Committee, I am happy to report, has worked in a bipartisan fashion to produce a bill that received strong bipartisan support here on the House floor. Chairman Miller and Ranking Member McKeon have been leading our efforts to negotiate a final compromise with the Senate colleagues. We have a handful of issues, however, that remain outstanding, and we believe that we will be able to reach resolution on these issues over the next few weeks. Of course, there may be some complications outside of our control, not the least of which is possibly Senator Kennedy's situation and recovery. 
   As we move toward finalizing this broad overhaul of Federal higher education programs, our top priority must remain college access and affordability. Bolstering our higher education and student aid programs has long been a priority of Congress. I know, for me personally, making college more affordable is a top priority. All children, rich or poor, should have the opportunity to get a first class college education. 
   This extension of the Higher Education Act is particularly important because it extends the significant and popular programs such as the Pell Grant program and Perkins student loan programs. This reauthorization is a long time coming. I am pleased to be here supporting what we hope and expect to be the final extension before this law is finally renewed. I urge my colleagues to also support this extension. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the lead Republican original cosponsor of this legislation which will reauthorize the COPS program and put 50,000 more cops on our streets. 
   The COPS program is responsible for putting nearly 120,000 cops on the streets nationwide, including 774 cops in central Florida. 
   Violent crime is on the rise, and we need this legislation now more than ever. For example, in my hometown of Orlando, Florida, the murder rate is up 122 percent. I recently met with all of central Florida's chiefs of police and sheriffs, and 100 percent of them support the COPS program. This legislation is also endorsed by the National Sheriffs Association and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. 
   Is the COPS program successful? Absolutely. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft described the COPS program as a ``miraculous sort of success.'' A 2005 GAO study concluded that the COPS program successfully played a role in the decline in violent crime in the 1990s. And more than 95 percent of law enforcement officers hired by a COPS grant are still on the street today. 
   Now, some might say that putting cops on the street is not a priority worth funding with Federal dollars. Well, I would rather put cops on the street than build bridges to nowhere or give subsidies to spinach growers. Let's be practical. There are children in Orlando, Florida, growing up in neighborhoods where 49 people were killed last year. Those kids want to be able to walk home from school safely and play in their neighborhoods without fear. These kids don't care if the cops' salary is paid for with purely local funds or a mixture of local and Federal funds. They just want to feel safe. 
   This legislation is a step in the right direction. I want to thank the cosponsor of this legislation, Congressman Anthony Weiner, for his leadership and strong support of the COPS program. He and I worked together earlier to get $70 million added in the supplemental. 
   Some have said that some Republicans are new to this. I can assure you that I've been an original cosponsor of this bill ever since I got here to Congress. If I can quote L.L. Cool Jay, the rapper: ``Don't call it a comeback; I've been here for years.'' 
   This COPS legislation was approved by the Judiciary Committee by a full voice vote and is worthy of our bipartisan support. I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1700.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise today as a proud supporter and cosponsor of H.R. 3232, the Travel Promotion Act. I would like to tell you why I support it, how it works and what the benefits are. 
   Why I support it, I represent the world's number one vacation destination, Orlando, Florida. We have 49 million tourists a year, mainly because my fine city is home to Disney World, Universal Studios, Sea World and many other exciting theme parks. 
   Forty-nine million tourists a year represents 46 million tourists domestically, but only 3 million internationally. You would think that Orlando and the other tourist destinations throughout the United States would be a good value now for European travelers, particularly with the weak American dollar. But we are not seeing that. In fact, our international tourism numbers are down to levels lower than they were before 9/11. Even though domestic travel is up 13 percent, international travel is down 6 percent. 
   Other countries spend millions of dollars to promote international tourism. We don't. Unfortunately, a lot of travelers in Europe and other continents mistakenly think that the process of entry and visas and security is a lot more complicated than it really is. 
   So, how would this legislation work? This legislation provides $200 million  to promote international tourism through marketing overseas and communicating U.S. security and entry policies. It spends this $200 million without one penny being charged to taxpayers. Half of the money comes from the private sector, the other half is paid for by foreign travelers. 
   Now, what is the benefit of this legislation? It will create thousands of jobs. One of my employers alone provides 60,000 jobs. One out of four people in my area is employed in the tourism industry. 
   Expert studies show that this legislation will generate up to $1 billion a year in an additional tax revenues. This is legislation that is key to stimulating the economy, at a time when we need the economy stimulated the most. 
   I want to close by pointing out the broad bipartisan support that this legislation has. We have 243 cosponsors. I want to especially congratulate the lead sponsors of this legislation, Mr. Delahunt of Massachusetts and the minority whip, Mr. Blunt of Missouri. They have worked on this legislation for many years and pushed very hard to finally get us a floor vote. I am proud to join them today as a cosponsor and proud of their hard work. 
   I want to urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes on H.R. 3232. Let's be in favor of the Travel Promotion Act, and let's create some jobs at a time when we need them the most.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, when a single mom in Orlando, Florida, is paying $80 to fill up her minivan, that's a crisis. It's a crisis that this Democratic energy bill does not address. 
   Now, why doesn't it address it? Democratic colleagues at the Sierra Club, the head of the Sierra Club said, ``We're better off without cheap gas.'' Well, let's look at the specifics. There is no ANWR in this bill whatsoever, even though it's the single largest untapped source of oil in the United States of America. 
   With 10.4 billion barrels of oil available, that's enough to provide all of Florida's energy needs for 29 years. It's enough to give us 1 million barrels of oil a day every single day for the next 30 years, but it's nowhere in the bill. 
   Why? Because we're better off without cheap gas, according to the Democrats and their colleagues. Well, we are not better off without cheap gas, we are better off without cheap political stunts, and that's what this Democratic energy bill is. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on it and give us an up-or-down vote on the American Energy Act.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of this legislation. I'm proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 980, the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2007. 
   Firefighters and police officers put their lives on the line to protect us, and they deserve the right to collectively bargain for safe working conditions and fair wages. 
   Recent events remind us of their heroism. It was a week ago today that a plane crashed into two homes in Sanford, Florida, just outside my hometown of Orlando, Florida. An off-duty firefighter named Ryan Cooper was nearby when he heard the plane roaring toward the houses. As the airplane smashed the two homes and exploded  them into flames, Ryan Cooper went into action. He rushed into the smoldering homes and brought out a 10-year year-old boy and his father. 
   Firefighter Ryan Cooper is a true hero. From his hospital bed, where he was being treated for smoke inhalation, Mr. Cooper humbly said that any firefighter would have done the same thing. 
   Sometimes firefighters pay the ultimate sacrifice. Just last month, nine firefighters in Charleston, South Carolina lost their lives fighting a blaze at a furniture store. These acts of heroism highlight the dangerous nature of public safety officers' jobs. 
   This legislation gets the ball in the strike zone. On the one hand, it allows firefighters and police officers to collectively bargain for better working conditions and fair wages. On the other hand, it expressly outlaws strikes, and it does not overturn State right-to-work laws. In short, this bill is fair and reasonable and deserves our bipartisan support. 
   Finally, let me address the main concern raised by some folks about this legislation. They say that this legislation would mandate compulsory unionism in right-to-work States. That simply isn't the case. Section 8, subsections 2 and 3, specifically state that this legislation would not preempt State right-to-work laws. In other words, this legislation allows States to enforce laws that prevent employers and unions from requiring union fees as a condition of employment. 
   Many people confuse collective bargaining with right to work. The two can coexist. For example, firefighters currently enjoy collective bargaining rights in my home State of Florida, yet Florida is a right-to-work State. 
   In closing, I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for all his hard work on this bill. Mr. Kildee has been a tireless advocate for this legislation. 
   I would also like to thank the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee, Mr. Miller, and the majority staff for working with the minority to make some changes and improvements in this bill, particularly those that address issues which were raised during consideration of this bill in committee. I would also like to thank the lead Republican cosponsor of this legislation, Mr. Jimmy Duncan from Tennessee, for his work. 
   I will be voting for H.R. 980 today, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I don't believe we have any other speakers. 
   Let me just begin by saying what this bill does not do to provide some reassurance to some of my Republican colleagues who may be concerned. 
   This bill expressly does not allow public safety officers to go on strike. This bill does not preempt State right-to-work laws. This bill does not require compulsory unionism. This bill does not require binding arbitration. 
   I think we all agree that firefighters and police officers risk their lives every single day and they are entitled to make fair wages and have working conditions that are as safe as possible. This legislation is fair and balanced, and that is why it has received such broad bipartisan support. 
   On the one hand it does allow firefighters and police officers to collectively bargain for better working conditions and fair wages. On the other hand, it expressly outlaws strikes and does not overturn State right-to-work laws. For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to do what I am about to do and vote ``yes'' on this important bipartisan legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today is tax day. Millions of Americans will write big fat checks to Uncle Sam. Who is paying the bill? The top 10 percent of households, families with incomes of $100,000 or more, pay 70 percent of all Federal income taxes. Coincidentally, 70 percent of all the new jobs in America are created by small businessmen. 
   The tax cuts of 2003 have created 7.8 million new jobs and have given us the lowest unemployment rate in four decades. Unfortunately, the Democrat budget proposal contemplates allowing these tax cuts to expire which will give Americans the largest tax increase in history. 
   Under the Democrat tax increase, small businesses will be hurt and 42 million families with children will see their tax bill go up by an average of $2,100. A married couple with two kids making $60,000 will see their taxes go up by 60 percent. 
   On tax day let's remember the hardworking families who are paying the bills to Uncle Sam and oppose all new taxes.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS AND PREVENTION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 330, recognizing April as National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. Every 2 1/2 minutes, a person is sexually assaulted in the United States. Sadly, one in six women have been victims of rape or attempted rape. Two-thirds of these assaults are committed by someone known to the victim, and yet only 40 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police. 
   Sexual Assault Awareness Month attempts to change these startling statistics by promoting educational programs, victim support services, advances in DNA and forensics technology, and aggressive prosecution and incarceration of sexual offenders. National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month helps to educate the public about sexual violence in our communities and the long-term effects on these victims. It also recognizes the selfless work of staff and volunteers at rape crisis centers and other community organizations across the United States that provide counseling and victim support services to sexual assault survivors. 
   This year, the featured event of Sexual Assault Awareness Month was ``Shop to End Sexual Violence.'' Businesses throughout America pledged to donate a percentage of their sales during April to increase awareness of sexual violence and promote community involvement in reducing these crimes. 
   With education and community support, it is my hope that more victims will pursue prosecution of their attackers by reporting these assaults. Once the victims take the first and critical steps, it is up to lawmakers and law enforcement to ensure these violent offenders are put away. 
   Earlier this month, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on H.R. 5057, to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Program. The Debbie Smith Program, originally authorized in 2000, awards grants to State and local governments to reduce the DNA backlog of samples collected from crime scenes and the backlog for entry into the national DNA database. Through these grants, State and local governments received funding to test approximately 104,000 DNA cases between 2004 and 2007. 
   These grants have also funded the collection of 2.5 million DNA samples from convicted offenders and arrestees for inclusion in the national DNA database. The Department of Justice estimates that over 5,000 ``hits'' or matches are the result of this DNA backlog reduction. This is a positive step forward, but we must continue our efforts to reduce the DNA backlog to provide justice for sexual assault victims and put their attackers behind bars for good. 
   I wish to thank my Judiciary colleague, Congresswoman TAMMY BALDWIN, for sponsoring this resolution, and also thank Congressman TED POE for taking the lead on our side of the aisle in moving forward this important resolution. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I want to begin by thanking the chairman and also the ranking member for their hard work on this bill. Chairman Miller has accommodated us when he can and opposed us when he must, and I know we have worked together as much as possible. 
   I think we owe the public an explanation, before we talk about our differences, of what we have in common. So let me begin with what both sides throughout this debate have in common, essentially three things. 
   First, we believe that all children, rich or poor, should have the opportunity to go to college. Second, we believe that there should be consequences and sunlight on those colleges who excessively increase tuition. And, third, we believe that Pell Grants are the passport out of poverty for so many worthy young children from low- and moderate-income families, and they deserve to be increased. 
   Now, there are four major differences in this bill, and these differences result in many of us Republicans not being able, regrettably, to vote for this bill. The first difference is on entitlements. How do you feel about new mandatory entitlements? The Democratic bill has nine new entitlement programs with mandatory spending. The Republican substitute has zero new entitlement programs. 
   How do you feel about Pell Grants, which is money we give to low- and moderate-income families to help their kids go to college? Today the Appropriations Committee is going to be increasing Pell Grants to $4,700. Under the Democrat bill, next year, they will have an additional $100, for a total of $4,800. Under the Republican substitute, students would have an additional $350 for a total of $5,050. So if you care about Pell Grants, you would do substantially better under the Republican bill if you were a student than you would under the Democrat bill. 
   How do you feel about paying down the deficit? The Democrats use only $1.5 billion to pay down the deficit. We more than triple that in the Republican bill. 
   How do you feel about private sector versus government-run programs? We have a basic, honest philosophical difference in this belief. Republicans believe that competition among the private sector is good for lower prices and lower taxes. Democrats believe, at least some do, that big government-run programs are better, and if that means eventually raising taxes, especially on the wealthy, then so be it. And we see that in the context of the student loan debate here. Republicans aren't afraid to take money out of the private student lenders. We did so as part of the Deficit Reduction Act. We took $16 billion away from their subsidies. But the Democrat bill, on top of the $16 billion, takes an additional $18.5 billion. It cuts the lender subsidies down to the bone to the point that the private student loan providers really won't be able to make a living if they are the small folks, and it will run many of them out of business. The big folks will stay in business. And that is okay to some on the other side. They prefer the direct student lending program. Under our system, 80 percent of the loans on the Federal level are provided with private sector money, called the FFEL program; 20 percent are the direct student loans. And this bill stacks it heavily in favor of the direct loan program. For example, if you are a low-income public sector employee, such as a police officer or social worker or a firefighter, and you have worked for at least 10 years, you get absolute forgiveness of your loan only in the direct program. They don't forgive it in the private FFEL program. They want to encourage people in the direct program. 
   If you are a parent and you want to take out a loan for your child to go to college, under the FFEL program, which is the private program, you have to pay 8.5 percent; under the direct lending program from the government, only 7.9 percent. Again, trying to encourage people to go with the big government program. And that was a drafting error that the Republican Congress made when we were passing the Deficit Reduction Act. And we tried to correct it in this bill. The Democrats knew about it, and they didn't let us correct it. And I suspect, and this is my feeling, it is because they expressly favor the direct loan program. 
   So we have a philosophical difference. I think the motives on both sides are pure. We have an honest difference of opinion with regard to entitlements, Pell grant funding, paying down the debt and private sector involvement. 
   And for these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I will urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of the McKeon substitute and ``no'' on the underlying bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Working Families Wage and Access to Health Care Act. This vital legislation will benefit employees by increasing the Federal minimum wage from $5.15 per hour to $7.25 per hour, while also helping employers provide affordable, quality health insurance through small business health plans. 
   During my 6 years serving the people of Central Florida, I have met with literally hundreds of small business owners. Their number one concern has consistently been the skyrocketing cost of health insurance. Of the 45 million Americans without health insurance, 60 percent are small business employees and their families. By allowing small businesses to join together and purchase health insurance through national associations at group rates, it will lower insurance premiums by up to 30 percent. 
   Small business health plans, or association health plans, as they are also known, are not a new idea. Since first being introduced in the 104th Congress, a variation of small business health plan legislation has passed the full House on six different occasions, including during the 109th Congress when 36 Democrats voted for it. 
   An increase to the minimum wage does not come without a cost, and that cost is going to be borne by our Nation's small businesses. Therefore, it makes perfect sense to me that Congress should offset the cost of the wage increase with a decrease in the cost of providing health insurance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote ``yes'' on increasing the minimum wage no matter what. But I am also going to vote ``yes'' to increase workers' job security by lowering the health insurance costs for small businesses through AHPs, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss student loan interest rates. As the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee, I believe in higher Pell Grants, lower student loan interest rates, and a leveling off of tuition. 
   If you ask a college student, would you rather have a 6.8 percent loan or a 3.4 percent loan, he will tell you 3.4 percent. If you ask him, would you rather have a 3.4 percent student loan that you have to pay back or a Pell Grant to help you go to college that you will never pay back, they will say Pell Grants. 
   The Democrats should have taken the $6 billion in spending and invested it in Pell Grants to help students on the front end instead of only helping those college graduates on the back end. 
   Education should not be a partisan issue; no one party has all the answers. Today, I will show a little good faith and vote for this bill. Tomorrow, I hope the Democrats show some good faith and listen to people like me when it comes to Pell Grants.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today to oppose this rule. It is, after all, a closed rule. There were no hearings, no committee work, no markups, no amendments allowed, no due process. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have 54 new Members of Congress. That is 12 percent of this body who haven't benefited from any of this legislative work or hearings. Now, I happen to be the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee. And before the last election, I was the chairman of this subcommittee. So, luckily, I happen to know these issues cold, and I can tell you there is a lot to know. 
   With regard to student loans, there are Perkins loans, Plus loans, Stafford loans, direct loans, private loans, subsidized loans, unsubsidized loans, and consolidated loans. With regard to Pell Grants, there are regular Pell Grants, academic and competitiveness grants, and there are SMART Grants. 
   The new Members would have benefited from some hearings and legislative work on this matter. But the other side said, well, these are smart people. Well, let us assume that every single freshman is a genius and they know these issues cold; and I am willing to make that assumption. I would have loved to have listened to their ideas in the hearings. I would have loved to have considered their suggestions. I would have loved to have accepted their positive amendments to make this bill better. But we were denied the whole process because of a closed rule. 
   I showed up to the Rules Committee, and I had two amendments that would make it better for kids to go to college. One dealt with the high cost of tuition that has gone up 35 percent in the last 5 years at public colleges. Another dealt with Pell Grants, to actually help people go to college. Before I even opened my mouth as the ranking member of Higher Education, the chairwoman on the Rules Committee said, there will be no amendments accepted whatsoever. This is a closed rule. 
   Now, the American public is pretty smart. They recall that Speaker Pelosi, sitting in your chair on January 4, said she is going to lead with partnership, not partisanship. Yet when you show up, if you have an amendment from the other side, it is not even considered, not even heard. The American people are smart, and they know actions speak louder than words. 
   I am told by the gentlewoman from California that 88 percent of the people support this bill and they do not need any more open process.     
   Well, if you ask someone would you rather have a 6.8 percent rate or a 3.4 percent rate, of course they are going to say 3.4. But if you ask them would you rather have a student loan at 3.4 percent or a Pell Grant that you never have to pay back, 100 percent would prefer the Pell Grant. We should have helped people with this $6 billion on the front end with increased Pell Grants to go to college rather than helping college graduates on the back end. 
   Mr. Speaker, by ignoring our suggestions to increase Pell Grants and address the skyrocketing costs of tuition, the Democrats have managed to hit a single for themselves, when they could have hit a home run for America's college students. 
   The American people want us to work together, and they realize that education is not a partisan issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today as the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee. I believe in higher Pell grants, lower interest rates, and a leveling off of college tuition. I come to this belief through my own life experiences. I grew up in relatively humble circumstances. My mom was a single parent who raised three kids on the modest salary of a secretary. If it wasn't for Pell grants and student loans, I wouldn't have been able to go to college and, ultimately, law school. I believe every child, rich or poor, deserves the chance to go to college. 
   Let us turn to student loans and how that impacts that. When I graduated from college in 1986, the student loan interest rate I had on my loans was 9.5 percent. In 2002, during my first term here in Congress, we decided to do something about that and we joined together, Republicans, Democrats, and student groups, and approved legislation in January of 2002 fixing the student loan interest rate at 6.8 percent. On January 24 of 2002, Chairman George Miller supported the 6.8 percent rate. He voted for the 6.8 percent rate, and he said on this floor that we should be commended for passing the 6.8 percent rate. 
   Last year, in March of 2006, when we were passing the higher education bill on the House floor, Chairman Miller said that he wanted to now cut the interest rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. It had a big price tag of $18 billion. He didn't offer any ways to pay for it. 
   Today, he comes before us with another proposal to cut the rate from 6.8 percent, down to 3.4 percent, phased in over a 5-year period, so you hit the 3.4 percent in the final year only. This price tag is smaller, at $6 billion. And to their credit, the Democrats have come forward with a way to pay for it, and that is mainly by taking money out of the student lenders' pockets. 
   The question before us is one of access. What is the best way to expand college access? Should we help college students on the front end afford to go to school by increasing their Pell grants, or do we help college graduates on the back end by phasing down their loan interest rates? 
   I think a better approach would have been to take some of this $6 billion in savings and invest it in the Pell grant program. This is a program we Republicans have been pretty serious about during my 6 years in Congress, and I would like to show you a chart reflecting that. 
   This is the 20-year history of the Pell grant program. As you can see, in yellow, this is the 10 years the Democrats were in control of Congress. The red represents when the Republicans took control of Congress. You see a steep increase. If they had adopted the proposal we set forth, these charts would be literally off the charts in terms of such a dramatic increase in Pell grants. 
   Now, someone said earlier, well, we haven't done enough to increase Pell grant funding during our time in the majority over the past 6 years. Let us take a look at that claim. Overall, Pell grant funding from 2000 to today has gone up 71 percent, from $7.6 billion to $13 billion a year. And we have increased by 36 percent the number of children eligible for Pell grants from 3.9 million to 5.3 million. We have a pretty good record on Pell grants, one to be proud of. 
   If they had taken the $6 billion and invested it in the Pell grant program, what a dramatic difference it would make when you consider the Pell grant program along with the Pell-eligible programs of competitiveness grants and SMART grants. 
   This is the difference: First-year students would get up to $5,300 a year; second-year students would get up to $5,850; third-year students would get $8,050; and fourth-year students, up to $8,050. We made this proposal, went before the Rules Committee, and it was a  closed rule. They didn't want to hear anything about it. 
   We also had some ideas about the skyrocketing cost of tuition. It has gone up 35 percent in the past 5 years at public colleges. We had some pretty good ideas to help, mainly Chairman MCKEON, now Ranking Member McKeon's, bill. He went before the Rules Committee. Closed rule. Didn't want to hear about it. 
   Now, what did Chairman MILLER and others say about this problem with not investing enough in Pell grants and the skyrocketing costs of tuition? We will come back to those issues. We will deal with that a later day. 
   Now, here is the problem. Whatever we do on a later day with Pell grants will be $6 billion less than it could have been because this $6 billion is gone. It is gone, based on this approach here. 
   In summary, by ignoring our ideas about increasing Pell grants and addressing the rising tuition costs, the Democrats have managed to hit a single for themselves when they could have hit a home run for America's college students. 
   Education should not be a partisan issue. No one party has all the answers. Today, I will show a little bit of good faith and vote ``yes'' on this bill. Tomorrow, I hope the Democrats will show a little bit of good faith by listening to what people like me have to say about Pell grants and the skyrocketing costs of tuition.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding to me. I am back. Like gum under a bus seat, you can't get rid of me here. Let me just address a couple of issues to clarify some things. 
   First, you keep hearing about a $12 billion raid on student aid. We didn't take a single penny away from a single student. Not one Pell Grant went down, not one student paid a higher interest rate on their student loans. What we did was take money away from lender subsidies. 
   Now, when we took $12 billion away from lender subsidies, it is called a raid on student aid. When the Democrats today took $6 billion away from lender subsidies, it is called the College Student Relief Act. 
   Now, they say, ``well, we poured that money back into helping students with lower interest rates, $6 billion of it.'' We poured $9 billion back into helping college students. $4.5 billion went to Pell-eligible students in something called Academic Competitiveness Grants and SMART Grants, giving high achieving Pell Grant students the opportunity to get an extra $4,050 their final 2 years. We also lowered the amount of origination fees students would pay for loans and increased their loan limits. 
   So we poured $9 billion back, 33 percent more than they did. So don't be fooled by the funny little names characterizing things, because it is not a lot of straight talk. 
   The second thing you hear is ``would have, could have, should have.'' They had been in power for 6 years. Why didn't they do more to increase Pell Grants? Pell Grants in 2000 were $7.6 billion. This past year, they were $13 billion. That is a 71 percent increase. We did increase it. In addition, we paid down the shortfall of $4.3 billion.     
   Second, if you look over here, in 2000, the maximum award was $3,300. In the final year, it was $4,050. This is an increase, not as much as many of us would like, but it is an increase. 
   Finally, the reason this $4,050 did not go up to $5,100, as President Bush and I and others had hoped, is because we had a dramatic increase in the amount of students who were eligible for Pell Grants from 3.9 million to 5.3 million. So the pie got a lot bigger, and rather than cut their grants, we still continued to fund them and had an extra 36 percent enrollment of people who got Pell Grants. 
   Now, what should we have done more? The Higher Education Act, we had language that I put in there that increased the Pell Grant authorization to $6,000. We made Pell Grants year round. I sent letters to the appropriators asking them to fund that  amount. We had the funding up 71 percent. We have SMART grants and academic competitive grants. What more could we have done? 
   At some point, we have to realize as the authorizing committee, we are kind of dependent on what appropriators are going to spend. We have a pretty good record on the Pell Grant issue, one we can be proud of. 
   To see it visually a little easier, you can see the yellow marks the 10 years when Democrats were last in control of Congress. The red is when the Republicans took over. You can see a dramatic spike in Pell Grants. And what is interesting, in the final 2 years when Democrats were in control, 1993 and 1994, they actually cut Pell Grants. 
   So we have got a good record to be proud of, and that is one of the reasons we wanted some of this money to go to Pell Grants today so it would help people to actually go to college rather than just helping people on the back end. 
   With that, I am not here to make fun of the proposal the Democrats have come forward with. I am going to vote for it. The thing I am most impressed with is, this time they have offered a way to pay for it. That is something they did not do last year. They should be commended in doing that. 
   I just hope that, moving forward, they will work together with us in a bipartisan manner to address this skyrocketing increase in tuition costs and to help increase Pell Grants so that every child in this country, rich or poor, will have the opportunity to go to college.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 39, recognizing the achievements of the University of Florida Gators. Last week, the University of Florida won the Division I-A college football national championship with a decisive 41-14 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes. 
   As a Floridian, I am very honored to be recognizing the Gators' accomplishments, and I would be remiss if I did not offer my condolences to our distinguished minority leader, Mr. Boehner, and to my former colleague on the Education Committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi). 
   The University of Florida's victory in the BCS championship game capped a remarkable 13-1 season and win of the Southeastern Conference Championship. This national championship is the Gators' second, with their first occurring a decade ago in 1996. The University of Florida also won the 2006 NCAA Division I men's college basketball national championship. Florida is the first university to hold both of these titles at the same time. 
   I hold up the cover of Sports Illustrated this week showing our MVP, Chris Leak, quarterback of the Florida Gators with the title ``Gator Raid.'' It points out that there was history in Gainesville with the first simultaneously men's basketball and football titles in 1 year. There is a lot of pride all of us have from the State of Florida, understandably. 
   In addition to these athletic achievements, the University of Florida is consistently recognized as one of the country's best public universities. I would like to extend recognition to Dr. Bernard Machen, president of the University of Florida; Mr. Jeremy Foley, the athletic director; head football coach Urban Meyer; and the many other members of the university community that contribute to the institution's academic and athletic excellence. 
   I also extend my congratulations to the University of Florida, in particular its football team, for this latest national championship, and also to the University of Florida fans worldwide who have supported the Gators, the good times and bad. 
   I thank my colleague from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for bringing this resolution forward. I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), who represents the University of Florida. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to join us in recognizing this achievement and supporting House Resolution 39.

However, at this late stage, interjecting more young American troops into the crossfire of an Iraqi civil war is simply not the right approach. We are not going to solve an Iraqi political problem with an American military solution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the war in Iraq. I oppose the surge. We don't need more American troops caught in the cross-hairs of a civil war. After nearly 4 years, it is high time for the Iraqis to send in their own troops to take out the Shia militias and the Sunni insurgents. 
   In short, the problem in Iraq is that we are losing nearly 100 American lives every month, and we are spending $2 billion a week. The solution is not to lose even more lives and to spend even more money. 
   I approach this subject with a great deal of humility, and it is not my intention to micro-manage this war. I am merely a Member of Congress and not a four-star general. But I have listened to what the most well-respected four-star generals in the United States have to say about this matter, and Generals Abizaid, Casey and Colin Powell have all said that sending another surge of troops into Iraq is not the answer. 
   I am terribly concerned about interjecting American troops into the middle of civil war violence. Who do they shoot at? The Sunni? The Shia? One thing we know is that 61 percent of Iraqis approve of violent attacks against our own U.S. troops. Does that sound like a grateful country to you? 
   Thanks to our brave American troops, Saddam Hussein and al-Zarqawi are dead, the Iraqi people have had three Democratic elections and three-fourths of the senior al Qaeda operatives have been killed or captured. And yet 61 percent of Iraqis want to kill American troops, and 79 percent of Iraqis have a mostly negative view of the United States. 
   The American people have paid the ultimate price for this war, and now is not the time to escalate the tragedy even further. The Iraq war has lasted longer than World War II. It has claimed more American lives than the attacks of 9/11, and it has cost more money than the Vietnam War. 
   The military action this Congress authorized in 2002 was for a far different purpose than the war we face today. I voted to authorize the use of force because I did not want Saddam Hussein to give weapons of mass destruction to al Qaeda. Now Saddam Hussein is dead, and there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
   Why did we stay in Iraq? Because we wanted the Iraqi people to have a unified and secure government so that Iraq would not become a haven for terrorists, like what happened to Afghanistan after Russia pulled out. 
   Unfortunately, the Iraqi government has provided neither unity nor security. After nearly 4 years, the Iraqis still have not achieved reconciliation, still have not decided how to share oil revenues and still have not dealt with the militias and the insurgents. 
   For example, 80 percent of the sectarian violence in Iraq is within a 30-mile radius of Baghdad, yet despite the fact that the Iraqi security forces outnumber the al-Sadr militia by a ratio of 5-1, that is 300,000 versus 60,000, the Maliki government has still not taken action to take out Moqtada al-Sadr and his militia. 
   In his speech, President Bush tells us that he emphasized the importance of benchmarks with Prime Minister Maliki. Unfortunately, the Iraqi government has a pattern of not fulfilling its promises with regard to benchmarks. 
   For example, when I was in Iraq in May of last year, the Iraqi government officials told me they would be able to provide security for themselves by December of 2006. Now they are saying they hope to have their own security in place by December of 2007. 
   Similarly, the U.S. surged the number of troops in Baghdad last summer from 7,500 to 15,000 to take out the insurgents. But the Iraqi government reneged on its promise to provide Iraqi troops, and, as a result, the insurgents came right back after we left. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the motives of President Bush and other prominent leaders, such as John McCain, who are pushing for more troops are pure and well meaning. I believe they sincerely think this is the best way forward. Three years ago, I would have agreed with them. However, at this late stage, interjecting more young American troops into the crossfire of an Iraqi civil war is simply not the right approach. We are not going to solve an Iraqi political problem with an American military solution. 
   In closing, regardless of how one feels about the war in Iraq or the proposed surge in troops, as long as our American troops are in harm's way, it is our duty and responsibility to support these troops 100 percent. 
   May God bless our troops and our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (SKYROCKETING GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the problem of skyrocketing gas prices. When a single mom in Orlando, Florida, is paying $80 to fill up her minivan, that's a crisis. The American people deserve some straight talk, and here it is: The main component of a price of gasoline at the pump is crude oil. Crude oil is a commodity governed by the law of supply and demand. Therefore, we must increase our supply and reduce our demand. To increase our supply, where is the single largest source of untapped crude oil in the United States? It's in Alaska in an area called ANWR, specifically in a section called 1002. 
   I recently went to Alaska and toured the entire northern slope, including the 1002 section of ANWR. I will tell you why I did. The critics of Alaska oil drilling say three things about ANWR: 
   They say, first, don't drill there because there's only a trivial amount of oil. Then they tell us that it would ruin the pristine wilderness. And, finally, they say don't do it because it will hurt the wildlife there, particularly the caribou and the polar bear. Let me address all three issues head-on as someone who has personally been there. 
   First, is there a trivial amount of oil there? There's 10.4 billion barrels of oil there, according to the United States Department of Interior. And 10.4 billion barrels of oil is enough to provide all of my home State of Florida's energy needs for 29 years; 10.4 billion barrels of oil is enough to pump 1 million barrels of oil a day every single day for the next 30 years. Does that sound like a trivial amount of oil to you? 
   The next thing we heard is that it's a pristine wilderness. You can't possibly drill there. Well, I went there. I went to the town of Kaktovik, the only village of ANWR, and I looked out and was a little surprised by what I saw, and I'll tell you what I saw. It was a flat, barren tundra. It looked like the surface of the moon, not some rain forest-style wilderness. There was not a tree within 100 miles. And as I stood there with the leader of Kaktovik, Mr. Felton Rexford, the leader of the local Eskimo tribe, I said, ``Where are all the trees? Where's the wilderness? 
   He said, ``Congressman, there is no wilderness here. There are no trees. The closest tree is over 100 miles away.'' 
   When you look at the size of ANWR, 19 million acres, the size of South Carolina, you have to realize that the drilling that we're proposing is in a limited 2,000-acre section of 1002. That means literally 99.99 percent of ANWR is off-limits and the tiny area that we would drill is a flat, frozen, barren tundra. To put that in perspective, it would be the size of a stamp on a football field. 
   The next issue: This would hurt the wildlife, particularly caribou and polar bear. Well, there are 800,000 caribou in Alaska, 5,000 polar bear. I saw them both on my trip. I can tell you the numbers for both are up over the last 30 years, each and every year, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. In fact, next door to ANWR is Prudhoe Bay, which is an existing oil field that's owned by the State, and we had caribou there in the mid 1970s to the tune of 3,000. They have increased since then tenfold up to 30,000. 
   So if those reasons aren't valid, what are the real reasons we are not drilling in ANWR? Well, here is a quote from the head of the Sierra Club, Mr. Carl Pope, and he says, ``We are better off without cheap gas.'' Better off without cheap gas. Tell the single mom paying $80 to fill up her minivan that she's better off without cheap gas. Tell the airline employees who all just lost their jobs that they're better off without cheap gas. Tell the small business employees who were just laid off that their families are better off without cheap gas. Tell the public school superintendent that had to switch to a 4-day week because he can't afford the money for the buses that our children are better off without cheap gas. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are hurting. We want you to put the ordinary Americans above the radical fringe environmental groups. We want you to give us an up-or-down vote on the American Energy Act. We want you to do it this September before taking another vacation and take care of business.

   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule because it is a closed rule that does not provide a fair and open amendment process. 
   On the positive side, the underlying continuing resolution increases funding for Pell Grants and COPS while not exceeding the spending caps set by the President's budget. As the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee, I am pleased that the Pell Grant maximum awards go up $260 from $4,050 to $4,310. 
   I also believe in putting more cops on the street through increased funding to the COPS Program, especially since my home town of Orlando saw its murder rate more than double in the past year. I sent a letter to the appropriators signed by Anthony Weiner and 101 Members calling for an increase in COPS funding. I am pleased that this bill increases COPS funding by $70 million, which is enough money to put 900 new cops on the street.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the Iraq war is the central issue of our time. We are spending $2 billion a week and we are losing 100 American lives a month. Under these conditions, I feel I owe my constituents my best judgment. 
   Interjecting more young American troops into the cross-hairs of an Iraqi civil war is simply not the right approach. If the President sends these troops anyway, I will support their funding 100 percent so they have the bullets and equipment they need to defend themselves. 
   I approach this decision with a great deal of angst and humility. I am not trying to micromanage this war. I am just a Member of Congress, not a four-star general. But I have listened to what our country's most well-respected four-star generals have to say about this matter, and Generals Abizaid, McCaffrey and Colin Powell have all said that sending more troops into Baghdad now is not the answer. 
   Some people will say, if you are not for surging more American troops into Baghdad now, what are you for? What is your plan? 
   I am for a different kind of surge. I am for a surge of Iraqi troops to take out al-Sadr and his militia, especially since the Iraqi security forces outnumber the Sadr militia by a ratio of 5 to 1. That is 325,000 versus 60,000. I am for a surge of political process by the Iraqi Government to finally reach a deal on sharing oil revenue. I am for a surge of action in implementing the Iraq Study Group recommendations, which were adopted in a bipartisan, unanimous fashion. I am for a surge of gratitude by the Iraqi people, 61 percent of whom think it is okay to kill American troops and 79 percent have a mostly negative view of the United States. 
   Some people argue that we should support President Bush's decision. I like and respect President Bush. I want him to be successful. Three years ago I could have voted for this surge. But the situation on the ground in Iraq today is very different than it was 3 years ago. 
   Three years ago, Iraq was not in a civil war. Now it is. Three years ago, Iraq did not have 325,000 of its own security forces to defend itself. Now it does. Three years ago, we didn't know whether surging more American troops into Baghdad would give us a long-lasting impact. Now we know the answer, because we tried the same thing last summer. The benefits were temporary. The body bags were permanent. 
   We are now told we should trust the Maliki government. I have been down that road before. I personally went to Baghdad and met with the Maliki government officials last summer. I was told by December of 2006 they would have enough security forces that they would need to defend themselves and we would then be in a position to start bringing our troops home. Now they say, give us another year. 
   We were told when America sent 15,000 of its own troops to surge in Baghdad last summer that the Iraqi troops would be right there beside them. Well, Iraqi troops didn't show up. The benefits of the surge were only temporary. 
   Mr. Speaker, I voted to authorize the use of force in 2002 because I did not want Saddam Hussein to give weapons of mass destruction to al Qaeda. Now Saddam is dead and there are no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
   We have remained in Iraq for 4 years because we want a unified and secure Iraq, so it doesn't become a haven for terrorists. Unfortunately, it seems the Americans want a unified and secure Iraq more than the Iraqis do.  
   Let me give you an analogy. Imagine your next-door neighbor refuses to mow his lawn and the weeds are all the way up to his waist. You decide you are going to mow his lawn for him every single week. The neighbor never says thank you, he hates you, and sometimes he takes out a gun and shoots at you. Under these circumstances, do you keep mowing his lawn forever? Do you send even more of your family members over to mow his lawn? Or do you say to that neighbor, you better step it up and mow your own lawn, or there are going to be serious consequences for you. 
   Mr. Speaker, sending more young American troops now into the middle of Iraqi civil war violence is not the answer. I will support the troops 100 percent. But we are not going to solve an Iraqi political problem with an American military solution. And that is my best judgment. 
   May God bless our troops, our President and our country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4154, a bill to increase the limit placed on the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Capital Financing Program. This worthy program provides Federal insurance for bonds issued to support capital financing projects at HBCUs. Generally, the funds are used for repair and renovation. 
   This program includes important safeguards to protect taxpayers while making funds available to HBCUs. Under current law, the total outstanding principal and interest payments on loans made under this program cannot exceed $375 million. During fiscal year 2006, the Department of Education made 24 loans from this program. Since the last Congress, at least four institutions have submitted applications to the Department of Education to obtain funds from this program. Another seven schools have expressed an interest in the program, according to the Department. Without expanding this cap, none of these schools would have access to these critical funds. 
   Historically black colleges and universities are integral to the fabric of our Nation's higher education system. HBCUs serve many low-income and first-generation college students that would not otherwise have the opportunity to attend college. Students attending these institutions should have access to safe, up-to-date facilities. 
   With so many institutions in need of assistance, this bill will increase the overall limit on this program from $375 million to $1.1 billion. With this new cap, the Department of Education will be able to make over $400 million in loans to deserving public and private institutions. Through the HBCU Capital Financing Program, we can help these institutions to help themselves. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4154. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as the former chairman of the Higher Education Subcommittee, and now the ranking member, I rise in support of H.R. 4153, a bill which provides for technical changes to the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007. 
   I was honored to be with President Bush on September 27, 2007, at the White House when he signed this important legislation into law. Joining me at that time was Chairman George Miller of the Education Committee, and the budget chairman, John Spratt. It was a special time to be there as the only Republican in Congress at that time seeing this historic legislation signed into law. It has been referred to by my colleagues as the most important piece of higher education legislation since the GI Bill in 1944. 
   That legislation dramatically increased Pell Grant funding and cut student loan interest rates in half. For example, Pell Grant funding went from $4,310 up to $5,400 over a period of years. And the student loan interest rate for undergraduates was cut from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent. 
   Well, what are we doing here today? As a follow-up to that important legislation, today we are making some necessary technical clarifications and corrections to ensure that the act is implemented just as Congress intended. For example, this piece of technical legislation will clarify that members of the Armed Forces reserves are eligible for student loan deferments when they return home after serving abroad. 
   This legislation will ensure that students whose loan applications were submitted prior to the law's effective date are not unnecessarily subjected to higher rates or deprived of important student loan benefits. 
   This package of technical corrections will improve our financial aid programs by clarifying the intent of the recently enacted College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us today in supporting this important measure and voting ``yes'' on H.R. 4153.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (DRILLING IN ANWR -- (House of Representatives - September 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about one of the central issues of our time, and that is whether or not we should drill for oil in Alaska in an area known as ANWR. 
   I have just returned from a 4-day trip to ANWR to do a fact-finding mission to see this area firsthand. Those in our country who are for drilling in the ANWR section of Alaska say that there's a large amount of oil there, that it can be drilled in an environmentally friendly manner, and that the Alaskan people want it. Those who are against drilling in ANWR say there's only a trivial amount of oil there, it will hurt the pristine wilderness, and it will hurt the wildlife in that area, particularly polar bears and caribou. 
   Well, to answer those questions for myself, I went there. I just want to walk through a couple of them. First, let's talk about the amount of oil in the ANWR area. Having been there and talked with the experts, I can tell you that there is 10.4 billion barrels of oil in ANWR, according to the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Interior. That 10.4 billion barrels of oil is enough oil to provide my home State of Florida with all of its petroleum needs for 29 years. It's enough to provide 1 million barrels of oil a day, every day, for the next 30 years. 
   The next issue comes up, Well, this will hurt the pristine wilderness area. Well, I traveled to ANWR, and you can see this map. This is the entire ANWR area. The only village in ANWR is called Kaktovik. I stood right there in the Arctic Ocean looking down at ANWR with the head elected leader, Mr. Fenton Rexford. As I looked out, all I saw was a flat, barren tundra. 
   I asked Mr. Rexford, Where are the trees? He said, there are no trees within 100 miles of this area that would be drilled. The area is not a pristine wilderness. It looks more like the moon than it does the rain forest. 
   The next issue becomes, Well, this will hurt wildlife. We hear from those who have concerns particularly about caribou and polar bears. I saw both on my trip in visiting various parts of Alaska. There are 5,000 polar bears approximately in Alaska, and 800,000 caribou. Caribou are by far the most numerous of the large mammals in Alaska. 
   Are we concerned about diminishing numbers? No. Both the numbers of polar bears and caribou have increased every year since the last three decades. In fact, we know that they can coexist because right next to ANWR is an area called Prudhoe Bay, the single largest oil field in the United States. 
   When oil started to be taken out of Prudhoe Bay in the mid seventies, there were 3,000 caribou in that area. Today, there are over 30,000 caribou. The numbers have increased tenfold. 
   So the bottom line from my fact-finding mission to Alaska is this. There is a significant amount of oil there. Over 10 billion barrels. The Alaskans do want it, over 70 percent Statewide, and 90 percent of those who live along the ANWR coastal plain. This can be done without harm to the wilderness. There's not a tree within 100 miles. And 99.9 percent of ANWR would be off-limits to the drilling. It can be done without harm to wildlife, either polar bears or caribou. And we can have it all. We can have responsible, environmentally friendly drilling that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I made a promise to the Eskimo tribal leaders when I was there in Kaktovik, a small town with 300 folks, that I would come back and tell their story as objectively as I could. They said so few Members of Congress have ever visited there and they would like to just get the truth out for both sides. I hope today, by laying out as best I can my factual findings, I have honored their request. I urge folks to look at this issue objectively, as I have, and try to reach a fair conclusion.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from a 4-day trip to Alaska. I went there on a fact-finding trip to learn more about what is becoming one of the central issues of our time, and that is, whether or not we should drill in the portion of Alaska known as ANWR, particularly the section called 10-02. 
   Before venturing off on this trip, I listened to folks on both sides. Those who were for the drilling said that there's a large amount of oil there, that exploration can take place in an environmentally friendly way, and that the Alaskan people themselves want it. 
   Those who were against drilling there said there's only a trivial amount of oil there, this will hurt the pristine wilderness, and it will endanger wildlife, particularly caribou and polar bears. 
   Well, after spending 4 days on a fact-finding mission, I'm prepared to relay to you what I saw in response to these three key issues. First, what is the amount of oil there? Second, will it hurt the pristine wilderness? And third, will it hurt the wildlife? 
   I can tell you from my trip to ANWR and the Northern Slope and talking with experts in and out of the government that there is approximately 10.4 billion barrels of oil in ANWR, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey. How much is 10.4 billion barrels of oil? It is enough oil to provide all of my home State of Florida's needs for 29 years. 10.4 billion barrels of oil is enough to provide 1 million barrels a day every day for the next 30 years. It is the single largest source of untapped oil of any location in the entire United States. 
   If I can show you a chart, Mr. Speaker, to give you an analogy of why we have some comfort that that's true, you see this is the State of Alaska, ANWR in the upper left. It's about the size of South Carolina, about 19 million acres. Drilling would be limited to a real tiny area up here--this is called the 10-02 ANWR coastal plain area--to a section of only 2,000 acres, just about the size of the red dot here. So literally 99.99 percent of ANWR would not have drilling, and I told you there's roughly 10.4 billion barrels in this 2,000-acre area. 
   Next door to it you will see a sign says Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. This is the single largest oil field in the United States. It has 15 billion barrels of oil. They have already extracted 12 billion, and there are 3 billion remaining. Now, when you go up there like I did and you compare the two areas, they look roughly the same. 
   Why is there drilling at Prudhoe Bay and not in ANWR? It's simple. This area is owned by the State of Alaska. They want the drilling and they allow it. This area is owned by the Federal Government. It has not yet been allowed. 
   What's significant also is you see a line here, it says TAPS. That's the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. What's so key about extracting this large quantity of oil is you have an 800-mile pipeline that takes the oil all the way down to the southern tip of Alaska to a city called Valdez. There it is picked up by tankers and taken to refineries in the lower 48 States and from the refineries turned into gasoline and shipped to your local retail gasoline dealer where you purchase the gasoline. 
   So we have a huge amount of oil. We have a pipeline infrastructure ready to move it. The only question is whether we will. 
   That brings us to the next issue. Will it hurt the wilderness? As I already said, 99.99 percent of the wilderness will be off limits, if you call it wilderness. 
   But I happened to go to all of these areas, but this little town right here, Kaktovik, is the only village in ANWR, and I stood there at the edge of Kaktovik looking through this 10-02 coastal plain area with the leader from that small Eskimo tribe, a man named Felton Rexford. 
   I looked out and I'll show you what I saw. I saw a flat, frozen, barren tundra. As the camera looks at that picture, folks may look at it and say, well, what am I looking at? I don't see any trees. I can't see any wilderness. That's exactly what I saw as I stood there, and I said to the elected leader from the Eskimo tribe: Where are the trees in the area that we're talking about drilling? And he said, Congressman, there's not a tree within 100 miles. Not a tree within 100 miles. 
   So much for the beautiful wilderness that we hear about in so many of the photos that are seen. I can tell you those photos aren't the area that we're talking about drilling. 
   Well, the next issue becomes: What about the wildlife? We don't want to hurt the caribou and the polar bears that live in Alaska. I saw both on my trip to Alaska. Alaska has 800,000 caribou, the most numerous large animals anywhere in Alaska, and 5,000 polar bears. I can tell you, in the last three decades, every single year the population of polar bears has increased. Every single year the population of caribou has increased. 
   In fact, I mentioned to you that the biggest oil field is called Prudhoe Bay next to the ANWR area, and I toured Prudhoe Bay. And as I toured there--here we are--I saw some caribou right there among the oil fields. And I talked to the wildlife experts who were with us. I said, Is that unusual? They said, Not at all. Back in the 1970s when oil was discovered here in Prudhoe Bay and they started drilling, there were 3,000 caribou in that area. Today, there are over 30,000. The caribou population has increased tenfold. 
   And so to wrap up, Mr. Speaker, what I learned in summary is that there is a significant amount of oil there, 10.4 billion barrels. I learned that the Alaskans want it: 70 percent of the Alaskans statewide, 90 percent of those who live in the ANWR area. I learned that we can do this without having any harm to the wilderness or to the wildlife and that we can have it all done with responsible, environmentally friendly drilling that reduces our dependence on foreign oil. 
   I have great respect for all four of the individuals running for President on the national tickets, Republicans and Democrats, but having been to Alaska and spent 4 days with the world leading experts on this issue, I can tell you that in my humble opinion Governor Sarah Palin knows more about this issue than all three men combined. I'm excited with the energy she brings to this debate and the knowledge she has about drilling because she knows these issues cold. And I hope in this Presidential election, whether you're a Republican or Democrat, listen to what this lady says because she's been saying what I learned over the past 4 days. There's very few of us that get to see it in person. 
   So, with that, let me thank the gentleman from Georgia so much for yielding his time to me.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank my friend for yielding. I would just take a couple minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, you may be surprised to learn, as I was when I went there, that there is not a tree within 100 miles of where we are drilling and that the animals peacefully co-exist and, in fact, have done well. You may wonder why am I hearing this for the first time? Let me explain something to you. 
   This is the only village in all of ANWR, called Kaktovik. And when I sat there with the leader of the village, Mr. Felton Rexford, who lived there his whole life, and I would say he's in his mid- to late 60s, he was so kind to me. And as I sit there in 30 degree weather in the hottest month, in the middle of August, he told me I was one of the few people that ever bothered to visit there, that they were surprised. Hardly anyone has ever been there. It's 30 degrees in the hottest month. It's 30 below in the winter. They just got running water there in the year 2000. Only 300 Eskimos live there. They have a doctor that visits their town one time a year. There are no roads in and out of the village. They have to travel by snowmobile, and they live off of whales. So when you hear about this being a pristine wilderness area that's going to hurt the wildlife, you're hearing it from people that have never been there and have a vested interest in telling you that because they are probably trying to raise money for some fringe group. 
   And I made a promise to Mr. Felton Rexford that when I would get back to Congress, I don't know if I would sway anybody but I would come to the floor of Congress and tell the truth. And the truth is these are the most environmentally conscious people in the country that I have ever met, and they think it can be done in an environmentally friendly way and they support it. And the area there looks like the surface of the moon and not a rainforest, and we can have it all. 
   So I wanted to honor that, Mr. Gingrey, and I appreciate your giving me the chance to speak tonight on this very key issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2831, LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and, Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this closed rule and the underlying legislation. 
   When the Democrats went through their 6 for '06 agenda and gave us closed rule after closed rule, they told us it would be temporary; we would then have a fair process to amend bills and clarify them. It hasn't happened. 
   Today is the 28th time the Democrats have given us a closed rule, literally twice as many as Republicans during the same time period. We had two amendments that we wanted to offer that would improve and clarify the bill. We had no chance to do so. 
   Next, let me talk about the substance of the bill. This legislation has the practical effect of doing away with statutes of limitations in employment cases. On May 29, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Ledbetter's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. This legislation attempts to specifically reverse that decision and, in fact, makes it retroactive to the day before the decision on May 28, 2007. 
   Make no mistake, there is a strong public policy reason for having a statute of limitations in the employment context. Witness memories fade, documents are lost and employees die. We want these disputes to be resolved when witness memories are fresh, documents are available and employees are alive. 
   The Ledbetter case is a perfect example. Ms. Ledbetter alleged sexual harassment misconduct by a single Goodyear supervisor. Yet she waited 19 years after the supervisor passed away from cancer to file suit. She said at the  hearing, ``I didn't say anything at first because I wanted to try to work it out and fit in without making waves.'' 
   Now, she seemed like a nice lady to me. I had the chance to meet her, but I wonder what her supervisor would have said had she brought this suit when it was fresh so we could hear both sides. 
   The Supreme Court wondered the same thing. The Supreme Court wrote in its Ledbetter opinion: ``The passage of time may seriously diminish the ability of the parties and the fact-finder to reconstruct what actually happened. This case illustrates the problems created by tardy lawsuits.'' 
   We hear about equal pay for equal work. We're all for that, Mr. Speaker. The fact is those folks haven't read this opinion because she had an Equal Pay Act that was thrown out on the merits.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the practical effect of this legislation is to do away with the statute of limitations in employment disputes. On May 29, 2007, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Ms. Ledbetter's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. 
   There is a strong public policy reason for having a statute of limitations in the employment context. Witness' memories fade, documents are lost, and employees die. We want these disputes to be resolved while witness' memories are fresh, documents are available, and the employees are alive. 
   The Ledbetter case is a perfect example. Ms. Ledbetter alleged sexual harassment misconduct by a single Goodyear supervisor, yet she waited 19 years after the former supervisor passed away from cancer to file a lawsuit. 
   On June 12, 2007, Ms. Ledbetter testified before our Education and Labor Committee. She stated, ``My story began in 1979 when Goodyear hired me to work as a supervisor in their tire production plant in Gadsden, Alabama. I worked there for 19 years. One of my supervisors asked me to go down to a local hotel with him and promised if I did, I would get good evaluations. He said if I didn't, I would get put at the bottom of the list. I didn't say anything at first because I wanted to try to work it out and fit in without making waves.'' 
   At our hearing, I spoke with Ms. Ledbetter at length. She seemed like a nice lady to me. The conversation she described about the motel made you angry about it and sympathetic to her. I wondered what that supervisor would have said 19 years ago. Would he admit it? Would he deny it but not be very credible? Or would he have said that it couldn't have happened because he was in Canada at the time and here is my proof of that? 
   Well, it turns out that the U.S. Supreme Court was thinking the same type of thoughts I was about this matter. Their opinion makes their concerns crystal clear. 
   On page 12 of its opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court wrote: ``The passage of time may seriously diminish the ability of the parties and the factfinder to reconstruct what actually happened. This case illustrates the problems created by tardy lawsuits. Ledbetter's claims of sex discrimination turned principally on the misconduct of a single Goodyear supervisor, who, Ledbetter testified, retaliated against her when she rejected his sexual advancements during the early 1980s. Yet, by the time of trial, this supervisor had died and therefore could not testify. A timely charge might have permitted his evidence to be weighed contemporaneously.'' 
   Supporters of the legislation say that the time period of 300 days in most jurisdictions, 180 days in some, is not enough because an employer might hide the fact that the female employee's salary was less than the amount paid to men for the same work. 
   There are two responses to that. First, the judicial doctrine of equitable tolling would be available to those type of plaintiffs. 
   Second, the plaintiffs could file a claim under the Equal Pay Act. This Federal law forbids paying women less than men for the same work. It has a longer statute of limitations and an easier burden of proof. Ms. Ledbetter filed a Equal Pay Act claim, but it was thrown out on the merits by the trial judge who found that Goodyear paid  Ledbetter less because of her performance, not sex. Significantly, Ledbetter abandoned this Equal Pay Act claim. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying, hard cases make bad law. That applies here. Do we throw out the statute of limitations in employment cases because a nice lady waited 19 years to file a lawsuit? Common sense tells you the answer is no. 
   The same public policy reasons for a statute of limitations are still there. We want witness' memories that are fresh, documents that are available and employees who are still alive to tell what actually happened. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise today in support of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. As the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee and founder and chairman of the Pell Grant Caucus, I am honored to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   How did we get here? The troubles that began in the subprime mortgage market have had a ripple effect on our economy, impacting all types of consumer credit. Unfortunately, that includes student loans. As a result of these disruptions in the financial markets, students and families all across the country are worrying about how they will pay for college this fall. Through no fault of their own, middle class families are worrying that their children may have a difficult time getting the financing they need for college. At least when it comes to Federal loans, there are steps we can take now to prevent that from happening. That is why I support this bill before us. 
   This bill will increase loan limits by $2,000 to undergraduate students, it will give students more flexibility in their loan payment options, and it includes provisions that will help generate more low-interest loans. Additionally, the savings achieved in this bill will provide more aid to full- and part-time eligible students through national SMART grants. 
   This is how SMART grants work. If you are eligible for a traditional Pell Grant and you major in math, science or foreign languages that are critical and you have a B average, you will be able to get an additional $4,000 above and beyond the maximum award of $4,800. This bill expands that to allow full- and part-time students to partake. That means we will be helping a total of approximately 100,000 students who are majoring in math and science and critical languages, and also helping ourselves, because we desperately need more math and science majors. 
   I have a chart here regarding our strong support for Pell grants on a bipartisan basis to put this bill in perspective. Since I came to Congress in 2000, I have noted that we have increased Pell Grant funding by 149 percent, from $7.6 billion to $18.9 billion.     
   We have increased the maximum award from $3,300 to $4,800, an increase of 45 percent. Now, with this new expanded legislation for more part-time students to get these SMART Grants, those particular students in math and science will get, as I said earlier, $8,800 in eligible grants. 
   And, finally, and particularly significantly, we have made it possible for an additional 1.9 million students to go to college, an increase of 49 percent from 3.9 million students getting Pell Grants in 2000 to 5.8 million today. 
   Making sure that college is affordable has been a bipartisan priority of this Congress. This bill will help ensure access to college for many worthy students and provide much needed stability to the student loan market at a time when it is most important to our college students. 
   I want to thank Chairman George Miller, Chairman Hinojosa, and Ranking Member McKeon for their speedy and bipartisan work on this bill. I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate for turning this legislation around so quickly and adding some key provisions dealing with the SMART Grants. I also want to thank the White House for indicating its strong support of this legislation and their willingness to sign it upon arrival. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 5715, and let's make college more affordable for all young people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise today in support of this veterans funding bill. This is a great victory for 400,000 central Florida veterans because it provides $220 million for a new VA hospital in Orlando. What does this mean for our central Florida vets? As a result of this hospital, our Orlando area vets will no longer have to travel 2 hours to Tampa. They will no longer be living in the largest metropolitan area in the United States without a VA hospital. Instead, they will have a brand new state-of-the-art 134-bed hospital and access to world class physicians and researchers working in partnership with the new UCF Medical School. Our vets deserve it. 
   We didn't get here by accident. The critical turning point began on September 10, 2003. That is when the VA CARES Commission held their hearing in central Florida to determine what cities if any in America would get a new VA hospital, since one hadn't been built in 30 years. I testified at that committee and pleaded that a new one be built in Orlando because of the large number of veterans we had and their lack of access to care. The VA CARES Commission agreed. This decision was ratified by the VA Secretary and then ratified by Congress. 
   Today, Congress takes the biggest step forward in funding this project. Although we have already provided $75 million toward this project, this new funding of $220 million is quite significant because it's $100 million more than the President asked for and is the largest single investment so far in this new project. 
   Where do we go from here? We ask our Senate colleagues to act, and we finish the job. We will work together on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats, to complete this worthwhile project. 
   I'd like to close just by saying that this has been very much a team effort. I would like to thank my Democratic and Republican colleagues on both sides of the aisle.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida, Mr. Diaz-Balart, for yielding time. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the ranking member on the House Higher Education Subcommittee, and a member of the conference committee, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan Higher Education Opportunity Act, which is the first reauthorization of the Higher Education Act in 10 years. 
   I also appreciate the regular order we have followed with respect to the rule on this bill. 
   I support this important legislation for three key reasons. First, it allows year-round Pell Grants for students who wish to complete their education more quickly. 
   Second, it reduces burdensome red tape on students and families by providing a much shorter, simpler application for Federal student financial aid. 
   And third, it includes my legislation to curb wasteful spending by closing a loophole that had allowed convicted child predators to receive Federal financial aid to take college courses. 
   I am going to limit my remarks this morning to the wasteful spending issue. It is a national embarrassment that we are wasting taxpayer dollars for child molesters and rapists to take college courses, while hardworking young people from lower and middle income families are flipping hamburgers to pay for college. 
   I have been working to close this loophole for years. And today, the most insane, wasteful spending program in America comes to an end. This legislation ensures that taxpayer money for Pell Grants will go to low and middle income students, not dangerous sexual predators. 
   Let me give you a real life example. James Sturtz is one of the most violent sexual predators in America, and he is currently locked up in a Wisconsin facility. He was convicted and sent to prison for raping a 4-year-old girl. After being released from prison, he raped a woman at knife-point, and was sent to prison a second time. After being released, he met a college student waiting for a bus, persuaded her to get in his car and then raped her at knife-point. He was then sent back to prison for a third time, and after his sentence ended in 2006, he was locked up in a civil confinement center to be held there indefinitely. 
   Sturtz and several other locked up sexual predators decided to exploit the civil confinement loophole and obtain thousands of dollars in Federal Pell Grants to take college courses, like algebra, through the mail. Then, Sturtz and two-thirds of the other inmates dropped their classes and used our taxpayer money to buy blue jeans, music CDs, movie DVDs, radios, television sets and DVD players. 
   Of course, even if they hadn't dropped their classes, there is zero evidence that violent sexual predators who take algebra and calculus classes have lower recidivism rates. 
   Well, how could this loophole happen in the first place? 
   Prison inmates have been ineligible for Pell Grants since 1994. In 20 States, including Florida and Wisconsin, they wisely hold the most violent repeated sexual predators indefinitely in civil confinement centers after they serve their regular prison sentence because they are likely to repeat their crimes if released back into society. 
   For example, in my home State of Florida, 54 violent sexual predators obtained over $200,000 in Pell Grants at taxpayer expense in 1 year alone. Similar expenditures in the other 20 States with civil confinement means millions of dollars being wasted, until now. 
   This was a team effort. I would like to especially thank ranking member Buck McKeon, Chairman George Miller, as well as the other members of the conference committee and our hardworking professional staff members for working in a bipartisan spirit to include this provision and so many other worthy provisions in this legislation. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and vote yes on H.R. 4137.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Free Flow of Information Act. 
   This media shield legislation is important because ``off the record'' confidential sources are needed to help journalists get to the truth, and I don't want reporters thrown in jail for doing their jobs. 
   Our history is full of examples of confidential sources exposing corruption, fraud, and misconduct. For example, the Watergate scandal was blown wide open by Deep Throat, a confidential source we now know to be Mark Felt, the number two person at the FBI. Confidential sources also exposed the cooked books at Enron and the unacceptable treatment of soldiers recovering at Walter Reed. 
   Whistleblowers, with inside knowledge of corruption, might be discouraged from talking to reporters if they fear their identities might be disclosed and their jobs placed at risk. That's why protecting the public's right to know is needed for a healthy democracy. That is also why a majority of the States already have media shield laws on the books and why we need this law on the Federal level. 
   The media shield privilege under this bill is not absolute. Exceptions are carved out where it is necessary to reveal a source in order to prevent imminent death or bodily harm, terrorist attacks, or other specific threats to national security. The bill also includes the language I drafted, which provides an exception for civil defamation claims. This language, found in section 2(C) of the bill, is modeled after language found in various State media shield laws such as those in Tennessee and Oklahoma dealing with this issue. 
   Finally, I want to thank my colleagues, especially Mr. Pence and Mr. Boucher, for their impressive bipartisan leadership and hard work on this important bill. It was my honor to work closely with them on the drafting of this legislation during the Judiciary Committee process. 
   Madam Speaker, the bottom line is that a free and independent press is critical to ensure government accountability. I urge my colleagues to protect the public's right to know and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2102.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (SECURING AIRCRAFT COCKPITS AGAINST LASERS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Aiming a laser beam into the cockpit of an airplane is a clear and present danger to the safety of all those on board the aircraft. 
   This legislation is simple and straightforward. It makes it illegal to knowingly aim a laser pointer at an aircraft. Those who intentionally engage in such misconduct shall be fined or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, in the discretion of the judge. 
   This legislation was unanimously approved by all Republicans and Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee in this Congress and in the last Congress. It was also approved by the full House by a voice vote, and the Senate also approved this legislation by unanimous consent after slightly amending the legislation to provide for limited exceptions for testing and training by the Department of Defense and FAA, as well as using the laser to send an emergency distress signal. This bill represents the negotiated compromise between the House and Senate on these limited exceptions. 
   The problems caused by laser beam pranksters are more widespread than one might think. According to the FAA and the Congressional Research Service, there have been over 500 incidents reported since 1990 where pilots have been disoriented or temporarily blinded by laser exposure. The problem is on the rise, and there were over 90 incidents in 2005 alone. 
   These easily available laser pin pointers, like the one I purchased here at the Staples Office Supply Store for $12, have enough power to cause vision problems in pilots from a distance of 2 miles. It is only a matter of time before one of these laser beam pranksters ends up killing over 200 people in a commercial airline crash. 
   Surprisingly, there is currently no Federal statute on the books making it illegal to shine a laser beam into an aircraft cockpit, unless one attempts to use the PATRIOT Act to claim that the action was a ``terrorist attack or other attack of violence against a mass transportation system.'' 
   So far none of the more than 500 incidents involving flight crew exposure to lasers have been linked to terrorism. Rather, it is often a case of pranksters making stupid choices to put pilots and their passengers at risk of dying. It is imperative that we send a message to the public that flight security is a serious issue. These acts of mischief will not be tolerated. 
   I wanted to learn what it was like to be in an aircraft cockpit hit by a laser beam; so I spoke with Lieutenant Barry Smith from my hometown of Orlando, Florida, who was actually in the cockpit of a helicopter that was hit by a laser beam. 
   Lieutenant Smith is with the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. He and his partner were in a police helicopter searching for burglary suspects at  night in a suburb of Orlando when a red laser beam hit the aircraft twice. Lieutenant Smith said the Plexiglas windshield of the helicopter spread out the light to the size of a basketball. It shocked them. They were flying near a large tower with a red light, and they mistakenly thought they may have flown too close to the tower. They were disoriented, and they immediately jerked the helicopter back. When they realized that they weren't near the tower after all, Lieutenant Smith began to worry that the light could have come from a laser sight on a rifle. He wondered if they were about to be shot out of the sky. He told me, ``It scared the heck out of us.'' 
   In reality, it was just a 31-year-old man with a small, pen-sized laser light, standing in his yard. 
   In conclusion, I authored this bipartisan legislation because it is needed to ensure the safety of pilots and passengers. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1615. 
   I want to especially thank Chairman Conyers and Chairman Scott for their bipartisanship in moving this bill forward after having hearings and markups.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, prior to 1986, the district court appointed interim U.S. attorneys to fill vacancies until a replacement could be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In 1986, the process was changed to authorize the Attorney General to appoint an interim U.S. attorney for 120  days. After 120 days, the district court would appoint an interim to serve until the Senate confirmed a permanent replacement. 
   Last year, Congress addressed concerns that allowing the judiciary to appoint the prosecutors before their court created a conflict of interest. The PATRIOT Act reauthorization eliminated the 120-day time limit for an executive-appointed interim to serve, and eliminated the authority for the district court to appoint an interim. S. 214 returns the authority of the judiciary to appoint interim U.S. attorneys if a permanent replacement is not confirmed within 120 days. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is fairly obvious that the motivation behind this legislation was the dismissal of several U.S. attorneys earlier this year. Congress has been investigating the circumstances surrounding those dismissals for several months now. Notwithstanding the heated political rhetoric from some of my colleagues, this investigation has turned up no evidence of criminal wrongdoing or obstruction of justice. 
   Let me just try to lay this issue out as fairly as I can. Some of my colleagues still have concerns about allowing a judge to appoint the prosecutors before their court because they feel that is a conflict of interest. On the other hand, some of my equally smart colleagues have suggested that we should return to the way interim U.S. attorneys were appointed for 20 years, from 1986 to 2006, before the recent PATRIOT Act changes, to ensure that the process is not used to circumvent the Senate confirmation process. 
   The House Judiciary Committee has held hearings on this matter. We held a markup on the companion legislation, H.R. 580. The Justice Department does not object to this legislation, and I will be supporting it myself personally. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is painfully obvious to the American people that the price of gasoline is going up. The nationwide average for regular, unleaded gas is at a record $3.20 a gallon, according to AAA, up almost 34 cents from a month ago, and the peak summer driving season hasn't even started yet. The American people are mad as heck, and they don't want to take it anymore. 
   To heck with OPEC. How about NOPEC? That's what this legislation is all about. 
   Last week, the Antitrust Task Force of the House Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, held a hearing on prices at the pump, market failure, and the oil industry. The experts at this hearing, including the Connecticut attorney general, Mr. Blumenthal, insisted we do something about the OPEC cartel. 
   The price of gasoline at the pump closely tracks the price of a barrel of oil on the world oil market. That is because the price of crude oil comprises 56 percent of the cost of a gallon of gasoline. American refineries, which import over 60 percent of their oil from foreign countries, compete for those oil resources with China and India. Demand for oil in those two countries has dramatically increased in recent years. As the demand has increased at home and abroad, supplies have not kept up and the price of oil has gone up. 
   Complicating this problem is the fact that we haven't built a refinery in this country in 30 years. And recent, unexpected refinery shutdowns have constricted supply. Of course, there are also anticompetitive forces in play that manipulate the law of supply and demand to their selfish benefit and our detriment. 
   For example, the world oil price is dictated mainly by the quantity of oil that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, is willing to supply. The 11 current OPEC members account for 40 percent of the world oil production and about two-thirds of the world's proven oil reserves. Most would argue that the presence of this cartel, controlled in large part by totalitarian or hostile regimes like Iran and Venezuela, is not helpful. 
   The question is: What can Congress do about it? NOPEC is one possible solution to this problem. Because of the ``act of state'' doctrine and the concept of sovereign immunity, Americans are precluded from suing the cartel that controls a good portion of the world's oil supply. This bill would change that. 
   Under this NOPEC legislation, the U.S. Attorney General would be allowed to bring an antitrust lawsuit against the oil cartel members for collusion, price fixing, and other anticompetitive activities designed to gouge American consumers. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Zoe Lofgren) for their leadership on this NOPEC legislation. 
   I would point out, in the interest of straight talk, that the White House this morning issued a statement saying that the President will veto the NOPEC legislation. I would point out that they misspelled the word ``President'' in this release; President is spelled P-R-E-S-E-N-T. Apparently, the White House cares even less about spell-check than they do about OPEC with regard to this matter. 
   I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do something about OPEC's price fixing misbehavior and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2264.  
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, spyware is a serious and growing problem. This software allows criminals to hack into a computer to alter the user's security setting, collect personal information to steal a user's identity or commit other crimes. 
   H.R. 1525, the Internet Spyware Prevention Act of 2007, is bipartisan legislation that imposes criminal penalties on computer hacking intrusions and the use of spyware. A maximum term of 5 years imprisonment can be imposed for a hacking violation in which an unauthorized user accesses a computer. 
   In addition, a maximum of 2 years imprisonment can be imposed for anyone who uses spyware to break into a computer and alter the security settings or obtain the user's personal information. 
   This bill also authorizes $10 million for fiscal years 2008 through 2011 for the Department of Justice to increase Federal prosecutions of these new offenses. 
   I congratulate Congresswoman Lofgren and Congressman Goodlatte for their leadership and dedication on this issue. I also thank Chairman Conyers and Crime Subcommittee Chairman Scott for their support of this legislation.

   Mr. Speaker, S. 1104 expands an existing program that provides 50 special immigrant visas per year to Iraqi and Afghani nationals who have served as translators for our Armed Forces. 
   Translators and interpreters would be eligible to petition if they are an Iraqi or an Afghani national, have served with our military for at least 12 months, and receive a favorable recommendation from the unit in which he or she served. Many of us have heard stories about Iraqis who have faithfully served alongside our troops bridging the language divide. They have been a valuable resource for the United States and its allies. 
   Yet many Iraqi and Afghani translators have faced intense persecution from their communities as a result of serving the U.S. military. It is because of this persecution that the translator visa program was first established. This program allows us to reward those who worked directly for the United States Government in supporting our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (ALIEN SMUGGLING AND TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss H.R. 2399, Alien Smuggling and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007. 
   Let me address a few basic issues about this legislation. First of all, what is alien smuggling? What is the existing law? What are the changes that we're proposing? And what, if any, are the problems that we need to fix with regard to this issue of alien smuggling? 
   Well, let's begin with what is alien smuggling. Alien smuggling is the process whereby people often known as ``coyotes'' take someone from a country like Mexico and sneak them in, often under the cover of darkness, into the United States for an average fee currently of approximately $1,500 per person. It requires specialized skills; and folks often feel that they can't come over, say, from Mexico to California and bypass all the border security agents without having a coyote or alien smuggler to help them. So they often have their family members pay the $1,500 fee. 
   I wanted to know more about this, so I personally went to the San Diego-Mexico border and spent a week traveling around at 2, 3 in the morning with Border Patrol agents as they arrested illegals and alien smugglers as they came across the border. And I learned from the Border Patrol agents that their biggest frustration is that they have arrested the same alien smugglers more than 20 times. In fact, the agents I met with were so demoralized they had what's called a wall of shame. 
   And it's hard to see from where you sit, Mr. Speaker, but this is a wall showing over 200 photographs of alien smugglers who they have repeatedly arrested, some of them more than 20 times, such as Antonio Amparo Lopez. And it is currently the law that if you smuggle someone into the United States for financial gain you will be sent to Federal prison for a minimum of 3 years. And yet, agent after agent told me they arrest the same people and they weren't prosecuted by the local San Diego prosecutor. 
   Well, the existing law, 3 years mandatory minimum if you smuggle someone into the United States. What does this bill do? It keeps the existing law at 3 years for smuggling someone in for financial gain, but adds some newer, stiffer penalties for certain people that you bring in. For example, if a smuggler brings someone in who is a known terrorist, then instead of being a mandatory 3 years in prison, you could be subjected to up to 30 years in prison. 
   And here is the challenge that I want to talk a little bit about this issue and why it's so important: When Attorney General Gonzales came before the Judiciary Committee on April 6, 2006, I relayed to him the story that I just relayed to you, Mr. Speaker, about the problems with these alien smugglers not being prosecuted. I happen to have a transcript, and I said on April 6 to the Attorney General, ``The pathetic  failure of your U.S. attorney in San Diego to prosecute alien smugglers who have been arrested 20 times is a demoralizing slap in the face to Border Patrol agents who risk their lives every day. It also undermines the credibility that you and President Bush have when you talk tough about enforcing laws. And it renders meaningless the laws this Congress passes to crack down on alien smugglers.'' 
   Then I asked him, ``What, if anything, will you do to see that the U.S. attorney in San Diego prosecutes these alien smugglers, at least those that have been repeatedly arrested by Border Patrol agents?'' 
   This is what the Attorney General said: ``I'm aware of what you're talking about with respect to the San Diego situation and we are looking into it. We're asking all U.S. attorneys, particularly those on the southern border to do more, quite frankly. We need to be doing more. 
   ``But the U.S. attorneys along the southern border tell me that the existing law regarding alien smugglers could be tighter. There is a discussion and debate now about what the language should be. No one wants to prosecute those who are engaged in Good Samaritan activities. We are looking into the situation in San Diego, and we are directing that our U.S. attorneys do more because you're right; if people are coming across the border repeatedly, particularly those who are coyotes and they're smugglers or they're criminals or felons, they ought to be prosecuted.'' 
   Now, I bring this up because there happen to be a few of us in Congress, and I happen to be one, who are pretty familiar with this issue of alien smuggling, familiar enough, having been there and talked with the Attorney General, talked with the Border Patrol agents. But we didn't have any input to this legislation. 
   I have the bill before us that we are debating. This is the last version, the one we're debating on. And the date on it is May 22, at 1:35 p.m. It is now 3:40 p.m. It's as thick as a small town phone book, and yet we've only had it for a couple of hours. There have been no hearings. No subcommittee markup. No full committee markup. 
   Now, I'm not someone who usually gets up and complains about process, but this is an example where someone like me and others of the committee could have been quite helpful if we had had hearings, could have had a markup. There are a couple of major flaws in this bill that I'll talk about. And I say this in good spirit. I'm going to actually vote for this bill because I think your intentions are correct. But let me just give you two examples. 
   First, if you help smuggle in a terrorist, you can go to jail for up to 30 years. Under the language of this bill, you have to show that the smuggler knew that the person was a terrorist and knew that he intended to engage in terrorist activities. 
   Now, you don't have to be Johnny Cochran to successfully defend a defendant in that particular case. The standard is just almost impossible for a prosecutor to prove. For example, let's say that you have Mohammad Atta on the stand, and he's just been detained by a Border Patrol agent and we want to apply this new provision. 
   If I was the defense attorney, my first question to the Border Patrol agent would be, Mr. Border Patrol Agent, you've arrested my client. You want to send him to prison for 30 years. Did Mr. Atta show you his al Qaeda ID card? No? Did Mr. Atta show you the picture that he has with Bin Laden and his family? No? Did he show you some videotape showing him on the monkey bars in the Afghanistan training camps? No? Well, if not, how do you know with mathematical certainty that this guy is a terrorist? 
   It's almost impossible to prove. 
   That's an example of something we could have fixed during the markup, saying, if you brought this person into the country for financial gain and he's a member of the terrorist watch list, we're going to give you an enhanced sentence up to 30 years. But we didn't have that chance because there was no markup. 
   Another thing that's flawed is, it doesn't fix the Good Samaritan exception. There's language in this bill that talks about Good Samaritans. Specifically, it says it is a defense, if you are arrested for a religious organization or one of its members to provide room, board, travel, medical assistance or other basic living expenses. That's the situation of a nun, for example, helping someone who's going to die out there in the 110-degree heat. We all believe that that should be provided. 
   But I read you the transcript of the Attorney General; he said, because this Good Samaritan exception needs to be tightened, and it does. For example, under this law, because you didn't talk with us about fixing it, if you are a member of the Red Cross or you're a member of the United Way, which is not religious affiliated, you could still be prosecuted. 
   Now, none of us wants that to happen. 
   My point is, as this bill moves forward, I'm willing to support it because I support the intent behind it. I support getting tough with alien smugglers. But the bottom line is, we need to fix this in conference. We need to work with Republicans and Democrats to include our input to make sure that at the end the day we have a much better bill that we can be proud of. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the ranking member on the Higher Education Committee and a strong supporter of the Pell Grant program to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Pell Grant Equity Act of 2007. 
   The rationale for this legislation is pretty simple: It is unfair that 100,000 college students are penalized for attending community colleges with low tuition rates. These students will now be able to use the additional $108 in Pell funding, on average, to pay for legitimate education expenses beyond tuition, such as books and mandatory lab fees in their science classes. 
   At a time when college tuition is skyrocketing across the Nation, we should praise and not punish those community colleges who are doing their part to keep tuition low and reward those students who are going to those colleges who otherwise wouldn't have a chance at the American Dream of a college education. 
   I want to praise Chairman Miller and Chairman Hinojosa as well as Ranking Member McKeon for their leadership and moving this legislation along. I think it is a great piece of bipartisan legislation that deserves all of our support, and I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``yes'' on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 916, offered by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski). This resolution increases the awareness of Catholic education while honoring the contributions of America's Catholic schools. 
   January 27 through February 2, 2008 has been designated Catholic Schools Week, an annual tradition in its 34th year and jointly sponsored by the National Catholic Education Association as well as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. With this resolution we recognize the vital role Catholic elementary and secondary schools play in providing an education with high standards of quality and excellence to the nearly 2.4 million students enrolled in Catholic schools across the country. 
   According to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic schools have a graduation rate of over 98 percent, and about 97 percent of Catholic high school graduates go on to post-secondary training at 4-year colleges, community colleges, or technical schools. This success can be attributed to the importance Catholic educators place on character and morals. By making the development of moral and social values an integral part of the curriculum, Catholic schools are ensuring that their students are not only good academicians but also good citizens. 
   The theme for Catholic Schools Week 2008 is ``Catholic Schools Light the Way.'' This theme highlights the mission of Catholic schools to provide a faith-based education that supports the whole child academically and spiritually and prepares students for future success. 
   Catholic schools demonstrated an enormous amount of character and compassion in their response to the devastating hurricanes that hit the gulf coast 3 years ago. In the wake of this national disaster, more than 300,000 students were displaced from their homes, schools, and communities. Catholic schools opened their doors and hearts and welcomed these students into their classrooms. They provided these children with the opportunity to continue their studies without stopping to consider the cost of that education. Instead, the Catholic schools knew their first priority was to educate these children. In addition, the Catholic schools in New Orleans have proved to be most resilient by becoming some of the first schools in the hurricane-damaged area to reopen their doors to students. 
   I appreciate the great work done by Catholic schools, their administrators and teachers, as well as the parents and volunteers. Catholic schools carry out their servant mission by building the academic achievement, character, and values of their students. 
   I again commend the gentleman from Illinois for introducing this resolution and urge my colleagues to support it.

   I yield back the balance of my time. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker. I too rise in support of H. Res. 916 to honor the contributions of Catholic schools throughout the country and to support the goals of Catholic Schools Week. I believe we should continue to support all schools that graduate our youth in high percentages and prepare them for a productive future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  
   Mr. Speaker, Catholic schools enrolled over two million of our Nation's children during the 2006-2007 school year. With minority enrollment at 25 percent and non-Catholic enrollment at 14 percent this past year, Catholic schools continue to teach students of all backgrounds. 
   The high-school graduation rate of Catholic schools is an impressive 99 percent, with 80 percent going on to a 4-year college and 17 percent going to a 2-year or technical college. These rates are extraordinary and are to be commended. 
   Next week, January 27th through February 2nd is designated as Catholic Schools Week by the National Catholic Educational Association and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. 
   The purpose of Catholic Schools Week is to show support for the Catholic schools, including St. Emydius in Lynwood and St. Helen's in South Gate, and to their students, parents, and teachers across the Nation for their ongoing contributions to education, and for the key role they play in promoting and ensuring a brighter, stronger future for this Nation. 
   I believe we should continue to support all schools that graduate our youth in high percentages and prepare them for a productive future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 916.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 932 offered by the Representative from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez). National School Counseling Week, which is celebrated annually the first full week of February, helps focus public attention on the unique contribution of professional school counselors. School counselors are employed in school districts and public and private schools of all levels across America to help students reach their full potential. They are actively committed to helping students explore their abilities, strengths, interests and talents as these traits relate to academic success and career awareness and development. School counselors serve as a vital resource for parents by helping them focus on ways to further the educational, personal and social growth of their children. They work with teachers and other educators to help students explore their potential and set realistic goals for themselves. They often seek to identify and utilize community resources that can enhance and complement comprehensive school counseling programs that help students become productive members of society.     
   These comprehensive developmental school counseling programs are considered an integral part of the educational process which enables all students to achieve. 
   National school counseling week highlights the tremendous impact that counselors have in helping students achieve academic success and plan for their career. This year's theme, ``School Counselors: Creating Pathways to Success,'' truly sums up the effort they put forth daily to ensure that no child is left behind. 
   I wish to express my sincere gratitude to all school counselors, not only from my home State of Florida but also all across this great Nation. I also wish to thank the Representative from California (Ms. Linda T. S&#225;nchez) and the Representative from Michigan (Mr. Ehlers) for bringing forth this resolution today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 908 which recognizes National Mentoring Month. National Mentoring Month celebrates mentors who are positively impacting the lives of young people and highlights the need for additional mentors to make themselves available to America's youth. I applaud Representative McCollum for sponsoring this resolution, and as a cosponsor I look forward to further bipartisan efforts to draw attention to support this very important issue. 
   Mentors give their time and energy to improve the lives of American young people who are increasingly spending less time with concerned adult role models. Young people with mentors are less likely to drop out of school, use illegal drugs, or engage in criminal behavior. The positive effects of mentoring include higher self-esteem, higher graduation rates, and higher academic achievement. I have personally seen the positive impacts of mentoring firsthand. As a young boy, I benefited from having a mentor from the Big Brother Big Sisters program. As I became an adult, I then became a mentor to two high school students at my alma mater, Boone High School, who were at risk of dropping out of high school, but fortunately stayed in school and graduated.     
   I then became chairman of the board of the COMPACT mentoring program, which is the largest mentoring program in central Florida and it is targeted at at-risk students in high schools and middle schools who possibly may drop out of school. I am pleased to report that we were able to recruit 700 new mentors and the COMPACT program has a 95 percent success rate of kids staying in school and going on to graduate. In fact, one of the mentors for the COMPACT program itself is none other than Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who has spent a great deal of time with the leaders of the COMPACT program and the children themselves every year. 
   When I was elected to Congress in 2000, one of the first things I did was join together with then-Congressman Tom Osborne, the famous coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers, to author the Mentoring for Success Act which Coach Osborne and I were able to successfully include in No Child Left Behind to provide substantial funding for mentoring programs. As we move forward with the No Child Left Behind reauthorization, we will work again to make sure that this language is included and stays in existing law. 
   One of the big benefits of a mentoring program is in the area of crime prevention. Roughly eight out of 10 inmates in Florida's jails and prisons are high school dropouts. We see mentoring programs like the COMPACT program in Orlando having a 95 percent success rate of keeping kids in school. That's making a difference in these children's lives and also helping us as taxpayers because we pay $20,000 a year for people in State prisons and $25,000 a year for folks in Federal prison. 
   President Bush himself has praised the importance of mentoring programs. On December 19, 2007, President Bush proclaimed January 2008 as National Mentoring Month, giving public recognition to mentors who serve as role models. Specifically the President stated, ``By sharing their knowledge and experiences, mentors serve as examples for young people and help teach them the skills they need to succeed in life.'' 
   By honoring mentors and mentoring programs, we recognize the importance of mentoring programs implemented in our local schools and communities. We also draw attention to the components of a quality program, including appropriate screening of potential mentors and careful matching of youth with adults who have a genuine interest in providing guidance and being exemplary role models. 
   Mentoring programs are varied and unique. They can be school-based or faith-based. They may be established through community organizations or corporate initiatives. I encourage people across the country to take time to discover what mentoring programs exist in their communities and see what they can do to help. Many volunteers are needed to meet the growing demand for mentors. 
   Again, I am pleased to cosponsor House Resolution 908, recognizing the important work of mentors and quality mentoring programs, and I urge Members to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield such time as she may consume to my distinguished colleague from California (Mrs. Davis).

   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Madam Speaker, I just want to mention in support of this bill that mentors are so important in helping today's children grow up to live productive and fulfilling lives. Unfortunately, there is still an acute need for more people to become involved in this rewarding venture and I hope that today's resolution convinces others to get involved as mentors. 
   Again, I want to express my support for the National Mentoring Month resolution and recognize all the hard work that mentors put in on a daily basis. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the designation of January 2008 as ``National Mentoring Month'' and to applaud the efforts of mentors who work tirelessly to support America's children. 
   I am pleased today to honor mentoring organizations across the country, including those who serve the young people of my own community, such as: Catholic Big Brothers/Big Sisters; The Watts-Willowbrook Boys and Girls Club; Girlfriends, Inc. of Long Beach; Helpline Youth Counseling, Inc.; and ELLAS, which stands for Embracing Latina Leadership Alliances. 
   Mentors serve as advocates for children. They make sure that children know that they matter. 
   Mentors actively support children's academic achievement, personal and social growth, and career development. 
   Helping students achieve academically is a critical part of a mentor's role. Through tutoring and encouragement, mentors can help mentees appreciate the importance of staying in school and working hard to achieve success. 
   Not only are young people who have been mentored less likely to fail in school and get in trouble for delinquency, they are also more likely to graduate and attend college. So mentoring doesn't just defend against unwanted outcomes, it promotes good ones. 
   Mentoring isn't just for one kind of kid. It can benefit boys and girls, urban and rural, white and Latino. If a young person is coping with a divorce, being pressured to join a gang, or has just moved to a new school, mentors can help. They can offer guidance while building self-esteem and a sense of purpose. 
   Mentoring isn't just for one kind of mentor, either. Mentors can come in all shapes and sizes. A mentor can be a lawyer, a mechanic, a religious leader, or an older brother. Anyone with a little extra time and a desire to help the next generation can become a mentor. 
   By exposing youth to positive life experiences, mentors help children develop new skills and interests and get used to interacting with adults. 
   By setting ambitious goals with their mentees, mentors can help today's children become the leaders of the future. Truly, a mentor can help a young person make her dreams a reality. Knowing all this, who wouldn't want to be a mentor? 
   I hope I have succeeded in encouraging my colleagues to become mentors or to help promote mentoring in their communities. Our children can't raise themselves. I salute those who have served as mentors, and those who will do so in the future. 
   Madam Speaker, once again I express my support for ``National Mentoring Month'' and recognize all the hard work mentors put in on a daily basis. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 908.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I'm going to limit my comments to the Pell Grant portion of this legislation. 
   I'm honored to serve as the ranking member on the Higher Education Subcommittee. I used to be the chairman of this committee before the change in Congress, but I still have the honor of serving as the chairman and founder of the Pell Grant Caucus. 
   Pell Grants are money we give to children from low- and moderate-income families to help them go to college. I, myself, would not have been able to go to college if it wasn't for Pell Grants. Pell Grants are truly the passport out of poverty for many worthy young people. 
   We believe, in a bipartisan manner, that all children, rich or poor, deserve the opportunity to go to college through Pell Grants. When this College Cost Reduction Act was initially presented in the House, I felt that it spent too much money on new entitlement programs and too little on Pell Grants. For example, it had an increase of $5.8 billion. I was honored to serve on the conference committee. I made those comments during our conference committee. And the conference committee decided to increase the Pell Grant funding from $5.8 billion to $11.4 billion, doubling what was in the original House bill. 
   What does that mean for young people going to college? That means the maximum award is now going to go from $4,310 to $5,400, phased in over time. 
   Whatever one may think of the rest of the provisions, pro or con, I have to tell you that is an outstanding provision in terms of a Pell Grant increase. 
   Now, some of my Republican colleagues may say that we're investing several billion dollars in Pell Grants and is that a wise use of money. I can tell you that these Pell Grant increases pay for themselves. The nonpartisan Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance said that by investing $13 billion in Pell Grants, it helps yield up to $85 billion in additional tax revenue. The reason is the average college graduate makes 75 percent more than the average high school graduate. So it's good for the treasury. It's good for our young people, and it's good for employment rates in this country. 
   I want to congratulate and thank Congressman Miller, Congressman Hinojosa and Congressman McKeon for all their work in substantially increasing Pell Grants. Those provisions make it much easier for young people to be able to go to college.

   I spent my time in August touring the northern slope of Alaska to learn more about the oil drilling situation as well as touring the Florida Solar Energy Center in Central Florida where they have the cutting-edge solar energy technology of tomorrow. 
   The straight talk is we need a comprehensive approach to address this energy crisis. We need more drilling here in America, in both Alaska and offshore. We need more renewable energy like wind and solar. We need more conservation like hybrids and higher fuel efficiency standards for our cars. We need all of the above. That is why I am proud to be the cosponsor of the American Energy Act. It's also why the American people deserve an up-or-down vote in this Congress on the American Energy Act. 
   Now, those who say ``no'' to drilling completely ignore the facts. The main component of a price of gasoline is crude oil. Crude oil is a commodity governed by the law of supply and demand. Therefore, we must increase our supply of crude oil and reduce our demand. Well, where is the largest untapped source of crude oil in America? It's in Alaska, in a place called ANWR. 
   The critics say three things: Don't let us drill in ANWR because it's only a trivial amount of oil. It will ruin the pristine wilderness, and it will hurt the wildlife in that area, particularly the caribou and the polar bears. I went there on a factfinding mission to find out the answers to those questions myself. Let's address each one. 
   Is it a trivial amount of oil? I learned from our independent experts and employees of the U.S. Department of the Interior that there are 10.4 billion barrels of crude oil under the lands in ANWR. 10.4 billion barrels of oil are enough to provide all of my home State of Florida with its energy needs for 29 years. 10.4 billion barrels of oil are enough to pump 1 million barrels of oil a day every single day for the next 30 years. Does that sound like a trivial amount of oil to you? 
   The next thing I heard is it will ruin the pristine wilderness area. Well, I stood right here in the only village in ANWR called Kaktovik, and I looked south from the Arctic Ocean, and I didn't see any trees. It's a flat, frozen, barren tundra. It's 30 degrees in the middle of August, and it's 30 below in the winter. I sat there with the head leader from the Eskimo tribe, Mr. Fenton Rexford, and I said, ``Where are the trees?'' He says, ``Well, Congressman, there's not a tree within 100 miles of where the drilling would take place.'' So much for the pristine wilderness we hear about. 
   The next thing we hear is that we'll hurt wildlife. I learned from our fish and wildlife experts that, in reality, there are over 5,000 polar bears in Alaska and 800,000 caribou, and their numbers have increased every year for the past 30 years. In fact, in the current largest oil field in America, Prudhoe Bay, they started drilling in the mid-1970s. At the time, there were 3,000 caribou there. Now caribou have increased tenfold in Prudhoe Bay, and there are  over 30,000 caribou there. I saw them peacefully coexisting. 
   So, when you take away their real arguments and you see it firsthand that you can drill for oil and that you can do it in an environmentally friendly manner, what is the bottom line for why some of these environmental extremists don't want us to drill? Well, we don't have to guess. This is what the president of the Sierra Club says. His name is Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club: ``We are better off without cheap gas.'' They don't want gas prices to go down. 
   Tell the single mom in Orlando who just paid 80 bucks to fill up her minivan that she is better off without cheap gas. Tell the thousands of airline employees who just lost their jobs because of skyrocketing fuel that they're better off without cheap gas. Tell the people in Orlando, Florida who are losing their jobs in the tourism industry because tourism is down that they're better off without cheap gas. Tell the small businessman who has just had to lay off his employees because he can't make the payroll anymore because of gasoline prices that he's better off without cheap gas. Tell the school districts that are having to go to 4-day-a-week school because they can't afford the gas for their buses that they're better off without cheap gas. 
   Let's bring some sanity back into this program. Let's have a vote, up or down, on the American Energy Act. Let's have it right now, this month, before we adjourn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in support of the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act. As the ranking member of the Higher Education Subcommittee, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. I want to especially thank Chairman Miller, Chairman Hinojosa and Ranking Member McKeon for their hard work in the drafting of this legislation on a bipartisan basis. 
   The troubles that began in the subprime mortgage market have had a ripple effect on our economy, including all types of consumer credit. Unfortunately, that also includes student loans. As a result of these disruptions in the financial markets, students and families all across America are worrying about how they will pay for college this fall. Through no fault of their own, students may have a more difficult time getting the financing they need for college. 
   Well, at least when it comes to Federal loans, there are things we can do now to prevent that from happening. Today we are taking positive steps to make sure that students have access to low-interest student loans, despite the recent turmoil in the financial markets. This bill was developed on a bipartisan basis to take preliminary action to shore up the Federal Family Education Loan Program and to offer new flexibility and protections to students and their families. 
   There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the troubles facing our student loan program. I appreciate the fact that the Financial Services Committee is also looking at these issues and that we may be exploring additional action in the future that more directly addresses issues of liquidity. 
   At this time, however, this is a good bill that will have a positive impact, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and support its passage.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1288, a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Campus Safety Month. 
   I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Sestak, for introducing this important resolution, recognizing the importance of safety on college campuses, and the efforts of outside organizations to dedicate September to promoting greater awareness of campus safety issues. 
   Over the past few years, we have seen how important it is to pay attention to our students' safety on campus. It is unfortunate that sometimes it takes tragic events like those occurring at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois for us to remember that crimes take place on college campuses all over the country. It is important that Congress continue to encourage institutions to update their campus security plans and ensure that they have plans in place to deal with all types of emergencies. 
   I'm pleased to support this resolution, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today as a proud Floridian in support of House Resolution 901, congratulating Tim Tebow for winning the 2007 Heisman Memorial Trophy Award. 
   Something miraculous happened when he got this award. He was the first sophomore in NCAA history to win the Heisman Trophy, and he joins a very elite group of three people from the University of Florida, all quarterbacks, to win the Heisman Trophy: Tim Tebow, Danny Wuerffel, and Steve Spurrier from my hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee. 
   We are so proud of all that Mr. Tebow has accomplished, a class person as well as an athlete, and he had a lot of help from his Gator football team, which also won the National Championship in 2006 against Ohio State, as well as a great head coach, Urban Meyer; and a supportive university president, Dr. Bernie Machen. 
   So we are very honored to be able to have this resolution before us today. I am happy to see my good friend and colleague Representative Crenshaw honoring this exceptional player and all his accomplishments. And we wish him continued success. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to this rule and this bill. Mr. Speaker, I believe that SCHIP should ensure that poor kids are covered first before providing massive tax increases and coverage for adults and illegal immigrants. 
   The Democrats' SCHIP bill before us today has a 5,900 percent tax increase. It provides coverage to 500,000 adults. And it costs Federal taxpayers $3.7 billion because of illegal immigration. 
   Let me be specific. With respect to the 5,900 percent tax increase, it takes the tax on cigars from a nickel to $3. With respect to the adults, 500,000 adults whose children are in SCHIP will still be covered.     
   With respect to illegal immigration, $3.7 billion was provided by CBO. 
   Since I'm against that, let me tell you what I'm for. I'm for H.R. 3888, which provides the coverage to kids first without having tax increases or coverage for adults and illegal immigrants. That's what we need. I urge my colleagues to support that legislation, and not the bill before us today.

<DOCNO>Mr. KELLER of Florida. (STUDENT LOAN SUNSHINE ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And I appreciate the Freudian slip by Congressman Chairman Miller. I still am Republican. I am reminded every day when my parking space is now out in Maryland that I'm a Member of the minority party here. 
   I rise today in support of the Student Loan Sunshine Act, H.R. 890, for three specific reasons. 
   First, this legislation fully includes legislation that I authored called the One-Stop Financial Aid Information Act, H.R. 1522, which creates an easy-to-use one-stop Web site for students and their families about financial aid information for college, including information about Pell Grants, student loans and scholarships offered by various Federal agencies. Far too many young people give up on their chance to go to college because they lack information about the various grants and scholarships available to them. Now they will have all this information right there at their fingertips as a result of an easy-to-access link right there on the home page of ed.gov. 
   I want to especially thank Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas. It was Congressman Cuellar who actually conceived of this idea and shared it with me on a codel that he and I had to Iraq based on his positive experience with a similar Web site in Texas, and he is a coauthor of this provision. 
   The second reason I support this legislation is because it specifically includes a financial aid code of conduct that must be adopted by colleges; and that language is taken out of the bill authored by Congressman Buck McKeon called the Financial Aid Accountability and Transparency Act, H.R. 1994. In a nutshell, it provides that there shall be no conflicts of interests, gifts or revenue sharing between lenders and colleges or their employees. 
   The third reason I support this legislation is because it does not ban preferred lender lists under the market-based FFEL program. Now after the recent student loan scandal, some of which was highlighted by Attorney General Andrew Cuomo of New York, there was a temptation on a handful of people's part to overreact. Some wanted to abolish or place a moratorium on preferred lender lists. Some even suggested that we switch from the market-based FFEL program to direct lending. This appropriate legislation doesn't contain that overreaction, and I'm proud that it doesn't, and the reason is preferred lender lists play a very positive role when done right. 
   There are literally over a thousand student lenders. Some of those lenders have lower interest rates, low origination fees, more flexible terms for deferring repayments and better customer service. On the other hand, there are lenders that have higher rates and fees, bad customer service and can be characterized as fly-by-night operations. It's pretty hard to tell if you're an 18-year-old kid which lender is which, but if you're a financial aid administrator who has been in the business for two or three decades, you can give some guidance into that issue. 
   This bill specifically allows these preferred lenders to still have a preferred lender list, provided that each college gives a choice of at least three lenders, the college disclose why they were selected as a lender, and the college disclose what terms they remain a lender. That is a pretty fair and appropriate response to the scandals that we have had and a pretty good contrast to what we have with the Federal direct lending program where a college says you only have one lender, it's the Federal Government, and there is no competition for lower fees or rates. 
   In closing, Mr. Speaker, this legislation helps to rein in some of the bad apples in the student loan industry, while preserving the healthy and appropriate competition between the direct lending and FFEL program. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As a congressman from Florida, the State with the largest percentage of seniors, I very much want low cost for prescription drugs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says this proposal will not lower prescription drug costs at all. Seniors are already getting volume discounts through pharmacy benefit managers and private sector competition. 
   Now the Democrats say: It works at the VA, it will work here. So I looked into that. I happen to take Lipitor for lower cholesterol. It is the number one selling drug in the world. Even Lipitor is not available on the VA formulary. That is because the VA only have a limited number of drugs, and that is why it is cheaper there. It is also why more than 1 million veterans are already getting their drug coverage through Medicare part D. 
   Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of the seniors in this country are happy with their drug plans under Medicare part D, and 75 percent of the seniors in central Florida have signed up for it and like it. If it ain't broke, why are we fixing it? 
   Let us give seniors both choices and low prices. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 4.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Let me just compare where we are today in Pell Grants versus where we were in 2000 when I was elected to show you why I have so much optimism about the good things being done in this bill and others. 
   In 2000, there were 3.9 million students getting Pell Grants. This year, 5 1/2 million students are getting Pell Grants. In 2000, the maximum award was $3,300 per student. This year, it is about 4,800 per student, and based on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act that President Bush signed into law in September, it is going to go up to $5,400 in the next couple years. In 2000, our overall Pell Grant funding was $7.6 billion. Now it is double that amount. 
   We have made a substantial investment in the lives of these young people to make sure that every single child in America, rich or poor, has the opportunity to get a college education. We have reason for optimism. We are working together in a bipartisan manner on these higher education issues, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Madam Chairman, I know what Mr. Davis is trying to do here, and I'm sympathetic. He realizes, like we all do, that people are hurting and they're paying higher costs for mortgages and health insurance and gas prices and college tuition. And so for those folks who can't make their student loan payments, let's give them some relief in bankruptcy court. The challenge is, this is going to help a small number of people, but hurt a larger number of people. 
   If you allow this to go forward, then what you have is a much higher risk loan that will result in the lenders having no choice but to charge higher interest rates for new students getting loans, higher origination fees. They will require a higher credit score. Now, since most 18-year-old kids don't have good credit scores, you would have to look to their parents as cosigners. What does that mean? The kids from wealthy families, whose mom and dad have a high credit score and have lots of assets to back up as collateral, nice home, Mercedes, are going to get student loans. The poor kids in the future who you're trying to help whose parents don't have a high credit score are going to have to pay a lot higher interest rate for loans and origination fees. And their mom and dad may not have the collateral to get them a loan if that's required in these private loans. 
   So it's going to have the unintended consequences of restricting credit in the future. It's also very unfair to lenders who made loans 10 years ago to have this applied retroactively. 
   Now, what is a better way? The better way is the current system. You get out of school, you've got 10 years to make your payment, and if you can't make it, you work with the lenders for more flexible options, let you pay over 25 years. The Bankruptcy Code already provides a provision for undue hardship for those people who truly need it. 
   Let's go with the better approach. And that's why it would have been better to have the Judiciary Committee have jurisdiction over this issue, because we could have flushed it out. That was skipped in this process. And while the intentions are good, the consequences are bad. And I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on Mr. Davis' amendment.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not personally opposed to this amendment. 
   I just want to briefly address the subject matter of articulations and the free flow of credit. And while that's important, many people listening to us, our colleagues, may not be familiar with the term ``articulation agreements'' if they do not serve on the Education Committee, for example. Let me give them an idea of what that is. 
   If you go to a community college in my district, let's say one called Valencia Community College, and you get your associate's degree, there is an articulation agreement that exists with the local 4-year university that's called the University of Central Florida. That agreement says if you graduate from Valencia Community College, we guarantee you admission and acceptance into our 4-year university. That is a wonderful thing for low-income kids who want to get a 4-year education, because it only costs 2 grand a year to go to this community college, and you know that based on this articulation agreement and the transfer of credits you will then go to a prestigious 4-year school for an additional 2 years and be guaranteed admission. It's really the only silver bullet I see out there right now at a time when we see the public 4-year universities increasing their tuition by 31 percent over the past 5 years. The one bright spot that exists is so many partnerships that exist between community colleges and 4-year schools in the forms of articulation agreements. 
   Whatever we can do in Congress to make it easier to have more of these articulation agreements and a freer  flow of transfer of credit can only help those children from low- and moderate-income families achieve their dream of a college education. That's why I am going to support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it as well. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I am not opposed to this amendment. 
   Let me just clarify for our colleagues what this amendment is about, at least from my perspective. 
   If you are a high school special education teacher, you are probably familiar with autism and dyslexia, and by virtue of your training and daily experience, you know how to relate to the children with these special needs pretty well. But what if you are a 10th grade history teacher trained in, obviously, teaching history? It may be a little more challenging for you to teach children who have autism or dyslexia unless you have some special training to help you teach them history. So what this amendment does is to provide funding for these general education teachers to partner up with their 4-year universities to get some extra training in teaching children with special needs. 
   That seems like a commonsense approach to us. So I will be voting for this amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Thank you, Madam Chairman. 
   I claim the time in opposition although I am not opposed to this amendment. We have seen a skyrocketing problem, at least in my home State of Florida, with the rise in violent juvenile crime. In my area, central Florida, we have seen juvenile robberies over the past 2 years of kids of 15 and under increase by 311 percent. 
   When I talk with the experts about this problem, I am told that we do need a holistic approach, as my colleague, Congressman Hastings, says; and that for the worst of the worst offenders, the repeat violent offenders, people who slit other kids' throats, you have got to lock them away. But on the front end when you can still have hope to catch some of these kids and turn them around, we have to make every effort to do it. 
   The reason I say that is because when we look at the statistics in Florida we find that 80 percent of the inmates in our jails and prisons are high school dropouts. If we deal with them holistically, we say, hey, if you're going to stay in school, we will give you a Pell grant to pay for a college education so you can have a nice car and a home. If you are willing to stay in school but you can't read, we will get you a reading coach to help you read, even if you are in high school. We are going to get you a mentor to get you through it. 
   We have to give these young people hope in educational and job opportunities and approach it holistically. Yes, that means prevention, but you also need tough enforcement. I think this amendment recognizes you need all of it. And so we are pleased to support this amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, one of the most frustrating things that Members of Congress have had to deal with over the past 5 years on a bipartisan basis is the skyrocketing cost of tuition. Over the past 5 years, tuition at public 4-year universities has gone up 31 percent. And we are frustrated because you want to rein in the tuition costs, but at the same time you are hesitant to implement any sort of cost control or micromanaging of these universities. 
   What this amendment says essentially is that we are going to ask the college to tell us what your endowment is and how much of it you spent on helping kids with their aid to go to your college. Sometimes that will mean that gives us an opportunity to really thank these colleges for doing a great job. For example, Harvard University has a $34 billion endowment. They recently received nationwide publicity, well deserved, for using that endowment to say, if you are accepted to Harvard and you are from a low-income family, we are going to use our endowment to pay for you to come here. If you are from a middle income family, we are going to pay for you to come here. If you are from an upper-middle-income family, all the way up to  $180,000, we are still going to help you with tuition. I think that is wonderful. And you have seen other schools, Yale and others, follow suit. 
   We would like to see exactly what schools across America are doing on the positive front to use their endowment to help low- and moderate-income kids go to college, and on the flip side what schools with substantial endowments are not making any efforts to help these low- and moderate-income kids get a college education. 
   So for these reasons, I will be voting for this amendment, and I will urge my colleagues to also vote for the amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

This will mean that the 2,100 children of parents who died in Iraq or Afghanistan will be able to get the full Pell Grant, which is about $4,800 this year and will be upped to $5,400 by 2012. It is certainly the least we can do. 
   There are many more things we want to do beyond this to help these children whose parents paid the ultimate sacrifice. But I think it is wonderful that these two Congressmen have come forward with this very commonsense and important amendment.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, we want the best and the brightest to go into the inner city, low-income areas to give these young people as much hope and opportunity as we can. Right now, we already provide student loan relief for math and science teachers who are willing to go  into these low income areas to help turn around a school. 
   When I look at Mr. Stupak's amendment, it reminds me of the movie ``Lean on Me,'' where it has a principal who goes into a low-income area and, against all odds, completely turns around the school. 
   We want the best and the brightest of our assistant principals, principals, and school superintendents to go into these areas and say, Hey, look at all these young people who are taking AP calculus and AP English, and we are excited, and we turned things around. 
   The more we can do to get the best and the brightest into these inner city areas, then the better these young people's lives will be. So I am happy for those reasons to support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same.

   In a nutshell, this amendment will greatly simplify the financial aid process and help to eliminate erroneous payments under the Pell Grant program. By taking these commonsense steps, it is estimated that the Federal Government would save billions of dollars over the next 5 years, which could go toward providing additional Pell Grant aid to our most disadvantaged students. 
   For all of these reasons, I urge its adoption and yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Chairman, this is a very creative outside-the-box way to provide an incentive to recruit mentors for at-risk kids, and I commend the author of this amendment, Congressman Crowley, for coming up with this idea; and I will be voting for it.  
   I had a mentor myself when I was a young child in Big Brothers Big Sisters program. When I got a little older and became an adult, I became a mentor to high school students through the largest mentoring program in Orlando, Florida, called Compact, which provides mentors to children who are at risk of dropping out of school. 
   I then became chairman of the board of that organization; chairman of the Mentoring Caucus, once I got to Congress; and a coauthor of the Mentoring for Success Act with Congressman Tom Osborne, which is now part of No Child Left Behind.     
   I tell you this by way of background, because I know that the hardest thing in mentoring organizations is recruiting mentors. I gave in 1 year 50 speeches to Rotary clubs and Kiwanis clubs to recruit 700 mentors, and it was very difficult because sometimes you only get folks to mentor for 1 year. But I saw that once you invested the time towards recruitment, it made a difference. That program, Compact, has a 95 percent success rate in keeping kids in school. As Congressman Crowley alluded to, that helps all of us in terms of lower incarceration rates. Right now, 75 percent of the inmates in our jails and prisons nationwide are high school dropouts. State prisons cost taxpayers $20,000 a year; Federal prisons, $25,000 a year. 
   If we can say to community college students, Hey, we want you to do the right thing by providing an hour a week as a mentor, or more, and by the way, if you do, we will help you financially for $10 an hour for every hour you mentor for a year, that creates a pretty good pool of folks that we can look to to do the right thing and have a financial incentive. 
   I congratulate you for this innovative approach. I never thought of it, but am impressed with it, and will be voting for it. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for it as well. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I also will be supporting the Ryan-Altmire amendment. I am not so far removed from college and law school that I don't remember the days when you would go to buy your textbook at the bookstore. Often you'd be required to buy a particular textbook written by that professor and get sticker shock that this particular book is $120. 
   When you talk to the publisher, sometimes they say, well, it's not our fault. We sold it to the bookstore at 60 bucks and they marked it up to 120 bucks. And when you talk to the bookstore people they said, no, it's their fault because they told us an abnormally low suggested retail price and made us look bad. 
   I don't know whose fault it is. All I know is we've got to get some relief to these college and law school and graduate students who are forced to buy particular books. This seems to at least try, and whatever we can do to try to help these kids who are spending $900 to $2,000 a year we owe it to them to do. So I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of our time.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4137, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act, which reauthorizes the Higher Education Act.  
   I support this legislation because it will expand college access for millions of worthy students primarily by strengthening and reauthorizing the Pell Grant program and Perkins student loan program. 
   I know that these programs work well because I wouldn't have been able to go to college if it wasn't for Pell Grants and student loans. Also, as the chairman of the Higher Education Subcommittee, and now its ranking member, I know that over 5.5 million students get Pell Grants each year, and over 500,000 of these students also get Perkins student loans, which, together, are the passport out of poverty for so many of these young people. 
   I'm going to limit my remarks today to the Pell Grant and Perkins loan sections of the bill since they are, in my view, the heart of this legislation. 
   First, with respect to Pell Grants, Pell Grants are money we give to children from low- and moderate-income families to pay for their college tuition, books, and fees that they never have to repay. This bill strengthens the Pell Grant program by providing year-round Pell Grants to help college students get through college quicker and by increasing the authorization levels. 
   This legislation also, at my request, has included language which eliminates a wasteful spending loophole that had allowed convicted pedophiles and rapists to get Pell Grants even though Congress passed a law in 1994 making it illegal for prisoners to get Pell Grants. In my home State of Florida, for example, this loophole was exploited by 54 sexual predators who were able to get over $200,000 in Pell Grants. 
   By passing this legislation, we will take money out of the hands of convicted predators and put it back into the hands of needy, law-abiding college students where it belongs. 
   With respect to the Perkins loan program, these are very attractive, low, fixed rate at 5 percent student loans for children of low- and moderate-income families. This legislation will strengthen the Perkins loan program by increasing the loan limits for undergraduate and graduate students and expanding loan forgiveness to now allow firefighters to have their Perkins loan forgiven, as well as nurses, teachers, and police officers. 
   In closing, I want to thank Chairman Miller for his hard work, Ranking Member McKeon and Chairman Hinojosa for working together in a bipartisan spirit. This legislation is good for students; it's also good for our Treasury. The expert studies show that by investing $16 billion in Pell Grants, it can help yield up to $85 billion in additional tax revenue because the average college graduate makes 75 percent more than the average high school graduate. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4137. Let us work together in a bipartisan manner to make sure that all children, rich or poor, have the opportunity to get their dream of a college education.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I note that Mr. Emanuel's extension was shorter than even his form that he's seeking here, but we're in broad bipartisan support of that simplified process. It was a wonderful idea, and I'm glad we could work with him. 
   At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nebraska.

   Mr. KELLER of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the serious problem of childhood obesity. Two out of three adults in the United States are overweight. One out of three children are overweight. Childhood obesity rates have tripled since 1980. We're now seeing children diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and depression. 
   I approach this subject with a great deal of optimism and hope as someone who has lost 100 pounds over the past year. I have seen firsthand the power of healthy habits. As parents, experts tell us that there are three healthy habits our children should follow every day. First, never skip breakfast; second, play outside 1 hour a day; third, eat five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. 
   The good news is that no matter what has happened in the past, all of our kids can enjoy healthy and happy lives in the future.
