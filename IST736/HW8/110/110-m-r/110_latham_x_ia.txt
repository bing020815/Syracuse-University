<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (TOM LANTOS AND HENRY J. HYDE UNITED STATES GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AGAINST HIV/AIDS, TUBERCULOSIS, AND MALARIA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is very important. Helping people in need overseas has always been a national priority, and I stand in favor of H.R. 5501. However, I must say that helping American taxpayers hurt by natural disasters should be our highest priority. This Congress is letting them down. 
   According to the House and Senate leadership, there simply isn't enough time for Congress to pass emergency aid to help Midwestern States affected by the devastating floods last month. 
   Not enough time? 
   When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf on Monday, August 29, 2005, Congress began working. On Friday of that same week, the House and Senate introduced, passed, and had a supplemental appropriation bill signed into law that same day. Five days later another supplemental bill was introduced and was signed into law the very next day. And in 2004 after Hurricanes Charlie and Frances landed, the Congress passed a supplemental appropriations bill and had it signed into law in 1 week. 
   Yet here I stand almost 2 months after the most damaging natural disaster in Iowa's history began and the Democrat leadership in the House and the Senate are telling the people up and down the Mississippi River that  they can wait until there is frost on the beans until we decide on additional aid. 
   Earlier this week the Governor of Iowa told the leadership of this House that Iowa alone needs an additional $1.2 billion more than FEMA can provide. Iowa has suffered a loss of $10 billion. Now we are told we will be waiting until September for a bill. 
   Where's the outrage? Well, I will tell you. It's in Iowa. It's with the 25,000 homeless Iowans. It's with the small business owners, the employers, the people who sacrificed their homes to help their neighbors. 
   This House has had time since the first waters started flowing through Midwestern homes to vote on numerous bills under the suspension calendar. We have had time to designate the ``National Day of the Cowboy'' and the ``National Carriage Driving Month.'' And 348 Members of Congress walked over here to vote to honor the life of a musician who had a number one hit entitled ``What's the Use of Getting Sober, When You're Gonna Get Drunk Again?'' 
   Well, it appears that Congress needs to sober up and help the people of the Midwest. The House should not leave for the August recess until we finish our work and help the victims of the Midwest.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of Congressman Braley's amendment and to express my deepest sympathies to all my fellow Iowans affected by the tornados that recently tore through Iowa. It is my hope the intense grief felt by those suffering from the sudden loss of a loved one will be lifted, even for a moment, by the prayers of hope from strangers. 
   For those of us who have the privilege of living in America's heartland, severe weather is nothing new. Tornados are a seasonal reality we all live with. But, when disaster strikes and takes the lives of our friends and neighbors--we are never prepared to witness the power of Mother Nature and the tragedies she can leave in her wake. 
   Through the tears and sense of disbelief, Iowans again have pulled together to help friends, family and strangers in need. Over the years, I have had the misfortune of viewing many communities damaged by storms. Earlier this week I toured the flood ravaged parts of my district. The scenes painted by wind and water are heartbreaking, but it never ceases to amaze me how quickly Iowans show their true mettle by bringing hope and strength to their towns. 
   I know for many Members of Congress, tornados rarely, if ever, affect your communities. When you see the astonishing videos of storms and the aftermath, I ask that you take a moment and think about our first responders and the people who find themselves in need. We must take every step possible to prevent and prepare for disasters like the State of Iowa has experienced in recent weeks. This amendment will go a long way towards that important goal. 
   Our thoughts and prayers are with Iowa and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express shock in the way this spending bill has been written and dumped into our laps, sight unseen, except by a few members of the Democratic Leadership. 
   This supplemental bill has been crafted without the input of rank and file members, completely circumventing the committee process. 
   There have been no hearings, no debates, no amendments allowed and about 18 hours to review this enormous bill.  
   We now have a few members of the house, substituting their judgement on serious wartime funding issues, for the other 430 Members of both parties. 
   Think about that for a minute. You and your colleagues have had no say in this bill--none. Again, members will have had 18 hours to review this 250 billion dollar spending bill. 
   This is very troublesome to me as a member of the people's house and I know, for a fact, that it's troublesome to members from both sides of the aisle. Today, the 3 million citizens of my State of Iowa, and millions of other Americans--which, by the way, include soldiers serving overseas and their families waiting for their safe return--will have no say in how their tax dollars are being spent for our military. 
   Whatever your position is on the war, or any Federal spending in this bill, the Speaker has set a terrible precedent for this institution. To the extent that we value precedent around here, this is not the type of bad precedent we should be allowing. 
   Both democrats and republicans deserve better, and we deserve a voice. 
   The way this process has been handled also taints the legislative success of good bills based on good ideas. The case in point is the inclusion of legislation I fully support and of which I am an original co-sponsor--the post 9/11 Veterans' Educational Assistance Act. This bi-partisan bill overhauls the G.I. bill education benefits and increases the benefits available to veterans. 
   This is a good bill dropped into an emergency spending bill that the Democrats know will not become law. The majority is using the G.I. bill for their political play book of attacks against Republicans in the upcoming elections--pure and simple. 
   This provision, as a standalone bill, has wide support from veterans groups and Republicans and Democrats in both the House and the Senate. But the American people have the right to have their Members of Congress debate and amend the bill. 
   I want to read a quote that is relevant to this sad situation. it comes from the Democrats' ``New Direction for America'' agenda--``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   Evidently, the Democrat leadership has abandoned that position, and rewritten the agenda to read: ``Spending bills should be written by the leadership, in secret, and sent to the floor of the House under a closed rule, safe from the rules of regular order, traditional debate or any risk of being amended by duly-elected members of the House--from either party.'' 
   The citizens of this country deserve better, and the members of this body, on both sides, deserve better. This type of practice has no place in this house.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (REMEMBERING CONGRESSMAN WILEY MAYNE -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much Congressman King for the time. 
   It is very difficult for me to talk about someone that I admired so much as Wiley Mayne, the idea of him having passed this earth. Wiley was born back in 1917. He passed away on May 27 of this year. He was born in a little town of Sanborn up in O'Brien County, and what a great area up there, a lot of the good Dutch men, and grew up, went to school there. 
   And you think about someone coming from Sanborn, Iowa, then going off to Harvard to college, and he got his bachelor of science degree, continued studying law at Harvard, came back to Iowa and finished his law degree at the Iowa Law School. 
   In 1941, he joined the FBI and had his career there. And then, during the Second World War, from 1941 to 1943, he served in the United States Navy and escorted destroyers through the Mediterranean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific and served his Nation extraordinarily well at that time. 
   He came back to Sioux City, practiced law for a couple decades, then became the president of the Iowa Bar Association and obviously was so admired and respected by his peers to have an honor bestowed on him like that. 
   Like the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) said, Congressman Mayne was elected to this Congress in 1966 in the 90th Congress, served in that Congress and the three following Congresses and served his people extraordinarily well. He was someone who was dedicated to his constituents, someone that cared all the time about his constituents. 
   And you talk to people who were around him at that time, and that's the thing that you will hear over and over, was his concern, his great job of representing his constituents. In my mind, in this job, that is our highest calling is to try and represent to the best of our abilities the people that we are honored to serve in this great body.  
   Like Congressman King said, Congressman Mayne had the committee assignments, both Judiciary and obviously with the Watergate investigation and his service on that panel, then also served on the Ag Committee, very, very important to the Iowa interests, and served extremely well. 
   The thing I will always remember about Wiley, though, is his deep love and devotion to his wife, Betty. And they were a couple. You'd have the pleasure of meeting up with them at a lot of Republican events and around, but they rarely missed anything, were always so much part of the community. 
   And Wiley served on the Sioux City Orchestra Board for years and years, I think was president for 20 years, but so involved in the community. 
   But his love for Betty, who he unfortunately lost back in 2001, was devastating to Wiley, and was such a model of a couple who cared for each other, cared for their community, and certainly, most importantly to them were their children. 
   Martha Smith, who is their oldest daughter, lives in Colorado now. Wiley, Jr., also I believe lives in Colorado, and their youngest, John, who's a very good, personal friend of mine, who has been such a great help to me personally and to so many people throughout the Sioux City area, but their love for their family, for their grandchildren, for their community was something that was an example for everyone to see and their dedication to their grandchildren especially. 
   It is very, very difficult to think about Wiley not being around. I think back when I first ran for Congress back in 1994, and to go over to Sioux City, where I wasn't really familiar with all that many people at that time, but I had the real pleasure and honor to get acquainted with Wiley and John and Betty at that time and to seek their support and which they gave me. And I would not be successful here today if it were not for the advice, counsel and support that they gave me. Wiley was just a wonderful, wonderful person. 
   When you think about people who always are thinking beyond themselves, who act on behalf of other people, who are truly concerned about what this country stands for, what their community is about, how they can better the world that they live in for their children and for their grandchildren, Wiley Mayne was one of those people, and he will be dearly missed by so many people throughout Siouxland for so long. 
   And certainly, I want to extend my personal condolences to the entire Mayne family, all the children, the grandchildren, all the friends that mourn his loss, as certainly I do, and I know Congressman King does, also. 
   But he was an example to me. I went through the predicament, the situation with the impeachment process for President Clinton, and the first person that I called for counsel was Wiley Mayne because he had been through it. And I think people misrepresented what his real position was because he was betrayed by President Nixon, but to get his counsel, to get his insight, to get his thoughts, someone who was so smart and so normal, who could talk in real terms, who could relay not only the facts but the emotions, the feeling, the real sentiment about what this was all about and the long-term, historical part of what was happening. 
   I just want to tell Congressman King, I appreciate the chance to visit a little bit about Wiley, but I'm going to miss him personally. And again, I just extend my most sincere condolences to his entire family. 
   And the best thing we can do for Wiley is to celebrate him, celebrate his life, celebrate the positive things that he did and celebrate the legacy that he has left for the folks in Sioux City, for Siouxland and the State of Iowa and for this entire country. 
   And I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (JOSHUA OMVIG VETERANS SUICIDE PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. I first want to thank my friend and colleague Leonard Boswell for his service to our Nation, and his efforts to bring this legislation forward on behalf of Iowa veterans. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation when it was introduced. 
   The bill contains many important provisions to ensure that the VA health system is better equipped to identify soldiers at risk for suicide and respond with appropriate counseling and care. The bill also mobilizes federal government agencies to pool their expertise on this issue in order to identify the best strategies for suicide prevention. 
   The bill is named in honor of SPC Joshua Omvig, who served his country as part of the Army Reserve 339th Military Police Company from Davenport, IA. A little over a year after his return from a tour in Iraq, Joshua Omvig took his own life on December 22, 2005. While his death was tragic, we are grateful for his service to our Nation. 
   Our soldiers encounter enormous stress and mental health challenges in the course of their duties. We have a crucial obligation to do all we can to ensure that our veterans are given proper care and to prevent such tragedies from occurring. 
   No one has done more to secure our Nation's freedom than our veterans and military personnel. Their sacrifice and service must be matched with greater commitment to them on our part. With that, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 327.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, we have all heard from thousands of our constituents on this measure over the past two weeks. I spoke to one constituent of mine from Iowa yesterday who contacts me regularly to express her opinions and ideas. When discussing her opposition to this bill she summed up the frustrations of Iowans and the overwhelming majority of people across this country. She said ``the people out here in the heartland see this bill and bailout as a result of Washington talking to Washington--and not talking and listening to the real people beyond the beltway.'' 
   She hit the nail on the head. This measure today is a true result of Washington talking to Washington, of Congressional partisanship blinding the legislative process and blocking the chance for real common sense comprehensive solutions, and members of an administration that are quicker to respond to the needs and pain of Wall Street than the needs and reality on Main Street. 
   The measure we voted on Monday was based almost exactly on the original plan of one man--that of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. This plan was sold to us with no guarantee of success--even from its author. This plan was created and based on a randomly selected price tag of $700 billion to the American taxpayers. When asked about why that number was chosen, a spokesperson for the Treasury Department responded in a news article last week that they came up with it because they wanted ``a really large number.'' 
   Additionally, the question has to be asked of this plan--is it morally right to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to reward and benefit those on Wall Street who were knowingly involved in risky and, sometimes, exotic financial investments that were hidden from the eyes of Federal regulators? 
   Why is Washington so quick to focus on the needs of Wall Street at the cost of those responsible Iowans who have sacrificed, saved, and spent within their means? 
   No wonder real America has lost faith in Washington. 
   I voted against almost this same measure on Monday afternoon. It was a tough vote but it was the right vote. I took that vote so we could sit down as Americans who are truly interested in the well-being of all people in this Nation to find a more acceptable path--a well thought out common-sense path. After all, we do agree that something must be done to try and save this Nation and her people for what would be a devastating period of economic disaster. 
   My hopes, and the hopes of the majority in this country, were dashed after the U.S. Senate not only embraced the plan we voted down earlier in the House, but added an even larger price tag on American taxpayers. And, the Senate--as only could be done in Washington--added hundreds of millions of dollars in pork to the bill to fund children's wooden arrows, race tracks and Puerto Rican and Virgin Islands rum. The Senate turned a deaf ear to the cries of the American people who are opposed to this measure and decided to add even more unwanted items to their tab. 
   In the interest of full disclosure the Senate did add items that I fully support. Important provisions that could help Iowa's renewables industry--in wind, solar and biofuels--that could help Iowans who are struggling to rebuild after the devastating floods of this summer, and other common sense measures that include increasing FDIC insurance limits. 
   But the foundation of the Senate bill that we are considering today remains the same--the randomly selected $700 billion plan that was the creation of one man, that empowers that one man to spend the money as he sees fit--yet has no guarantees for success or even realistic protection provisions that will close the taxpayer's check book if the plan is not working. I could never trust anyone person with complete discretion of $700 billion of taxpayer's money--no strings attached. 
   As the members of this body know, I joined with a group of my colleagues yesterday to work to provide Washington with one last option other than the plan of based on a randomly selected number. 
   We drafted an amendment that would give Secretary Paulson $250 billion to use as proposed in his original plan. Even he has said that he could only spend at the most $50 billion a month. This gives him at least five months to see if his plan is working, and if it is proving to have success for all of America's economy, then he can return to Congress to request the remaining funds. While I know even $250 billion is unacceptable to many fiscal conservatives, the plan gave the American people some level of control over their tax dollars to know that a plan based on a randomly selected number would have to show success and benefits to main street before it was permitted to move forward beyond that additional smaller price tag. 
   Our amendment also gave us time--time to come back here and discuss alternatives for the good of the nation as a whole. 
   I believe that this amendment would have received overwhelming bi-partisan support from the rank-and-file members whose voices were shut out of this process. 
   Unfortunately, what has become standard operating procedure for a broken Congress, in a broken Washington, the members of this body--representing the hundreds of millions of people in real America--were not even allowed the opportunity to vote on an alternate  plan. Instead we are forced to consider--up or down, no committee hearings, no committee votes--this plan based on a randomly selected number. 
   This week I have spoken with and listened to the reality of the economic landscape from small business employers throughout Iowa. I have heard from farmers, from colleges, from community governments, realtors, car dealerships, utility companies, and hometown bankers--employers of hundreds of thousands of Iowans. They all have told me of the reality of their experiences with credit markets, the reality of economic turbulence, and the real fears that if nothing is done soon that Iowa is facing economic disaster like most of us have not seen in our lifetime. These are real people from real town America, who are doing the right things, providing good jobs for good people, who are leaders in their community and staples of the local economies who are suffering and face economic disaster not because of decisions they have made, but because of the decisions made on Wall Street and in Washington. 
   It is clear to all of us that action is needed to protect our economy. But is this plan really the right action we should take? After all, supporting this bill just for the sake that we agree that action is needed does not guarantee that we are moving in the right direction. And, for those who are suffering in real America, actions we take now that are not fully debated and discussed could end up causing more economic harm over the long term. 
   The events of the past two weeks--and the resulting proposal that we are forced to consider today--make it painfully clear to me, and millions of Americans, that Washington is unwilling, or incapable, of listening to anyone but Washington. 
   That is why I must stand on principle once again today and vote against this measure with the hope that Washington will wake up and--immediately following this vote--begin the responsible process of working together, working with the American people to find a solution that is well considered based on fundamental economic principles that addresses the real needs of real America--real main street. These are the principles on which our Nation was founded and these are the principles that we have the duty as Americans to stand up and protect.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. I thank the ranking member, my good friend from California. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, last night Mr. LaTourette and myself went to the Rules Committee to ask that an amendment be made in order which would reduce the size of this bailout bill from $700 billion down to $250 billion, and then we would have the opportunity to come back to see if this thing is actually working and have a vote to actually affirm and spend more money if, in fact, this was working and this plan was right. 
   Now the Rules Committee denied that. And I think it's very unfortunate that the will of the House is not being heard today. We do not have the chance to vote on an amendment which I believe would pass overwhelmingly in this House of Representatives, because it will bring some accountability to the administration. It won't just write the check to the Secretary of the Treasury. And we can finally solve this problem and still have the accountability that people are looking for in Congress.     
   I would just encourage everyone to vote down this rule so that we can have a fair chance at an amendment that makes real sense to everyone.

   I miss Jim Leach around here because of his great sense of humor, his insight, his thoughtfulness, someone who was a strong Iowa Hawkeye supporter, having the Hawks in his district, and I, myself, representing Iowa State, so we used to go back and forth an awful lot. 
   Jim Leach will be remembered here in this body for his 30 years of service, his great thoughtfulness, his intellect, someone who, whether it be in financial services, and the Financial Services Modernization Act bears his name, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill; whether it be trying to stop gambling predators over the Internet; someone who knew and understood international policy, foreign affairs like no one else; someone who had such a broad breadth of knowledge, who could bring that forth and convey it to other folks in a very kind and thoughtful way. 
   He does represent the very best of what's in this Congress, and that is a spirit of bipartisanship, of thought over politics, of actions rather than posturing; someone who I have the greatest personal respect for. And I'm so pleased that Mr. Loebsack has  brought this resolution to the floor of the House, and I would urge everyone to support this resolution in honor of James Leach. And I want to commend him, also his wife, Deva, and the family; just wonderful people, and an honor like this could not go to a nicer person or a more deserving individual.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Chairman, I rise to commend the Agriculture Sub-committee Chairwoman, Ms. DeLauro, and the ranking Republican, Mr. Kingston. They have done a commendable job in putting this measure together in this first year in their respective positions. 
   All along the way, Ms. DeLauro reached across the aisle to sound out the concern of the members on this side of the aisle--and the work product shows her bi-partisan efforts. 
   While I do not agree with everything in the bill, I think it is a good product, all things considered. I especially want to thank the Chairwoman for her efforts to increase funding in the bill for the cooperative State research, education and extension service. The CSREES funding level was below the level where it should have been coming out of the subcommittee. 
   After hearing the concerns of many members, Ms. DeLauro and Mr. Kingston closed ranks and fixed the problem. That funding gap was a particular issue to many members, especially those from rural, farming areas. 
   I am pleased to note that the bill contains much in the way of agriculture research funding in a number of areas. This is important to many areas, particularly renewable fuels and food production science, to name two areas. The more we can make substantive progress in both of these areas, the better for the consumer and the farm community. 
   I do want to point out a couple of areas where I think we can and should improve on the bill. First, there is a provision, section 746, which currently reads, ``no funds in this act may be used to authorize qualified health claims for conventional foods''. 
   I understand that there will be an amendment later on that stipulates no funds for FDA will be used for this purpose. However, this amendment does not address the problem. 
   If this provision, or a similar one, is intended to help FDA avoid wasted time and resources on frivolous petitions, it misses the mark. Nothing in the language removes FDA's responsibility to review these petitions, as required by law. The provision only denies final approval, or ``authorization'' of the use of valid claims. 
   This is bad health policy, and it is bad fiscal policy, and I urge the chairwoman to relook at the provision in conference, lest its impact come back to haunt us. 
   On another issue, the horse slaughter language, the provision, as written, is opposed by animal experts across the country--real experts, including veterinarians and others. The way the language is written, it precludes health inspections and certifications for the legal transport of horses, for example. 
   Finally, I think, like some others on both sides of the aisle, that we have short-changed some necessary program areas, on occasion, in the past. 
   But I also think that, as with some other bills, we are going a little far in adding extra spending. Too much spending can do as much damage as too little spending. 
   It is important to remember that when we give agencies too much money, they spend more than they need to spend simply to hold their annual baseline intact. this is not a heal thy way to manage the Nation's resources. 
   We have some discretion here, and we should use that discretion since, apparently, we have turned a blind eye to the serious and growing problem of out-of-control entitlements. 
   In summary, let me, again, commend the gentlewoman from Connecticut. I think you have done a fine job, and I look forward to continuing to work with you to improve this bill as we go forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the University of Iowa Men's Wrestling Program on winning the 2008 NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship. 
   Dating back to the early 1900's my home State of Iowa has lead the way in shaping what competitive collegiate wrestling has become today. In fact, the first ever NCAA Division I National Wrestling Championship Tournament took place in Ames, Iowa. Anyone who follows the sport will tell you that you can always count on a team from the State of Iowa finishing among the top of almost every tournament. 
   At all levels, the State of Iowa has a long storied and honored wrestling tradition and it is the preferred sport of many Iowa households. It has been a hallmark of Iowa athletics for decades and its competition remains prominent in the majority of middle schools, high schools, state colleges and universities throughout the state today. There is a tremendous amount of hard-work, discipline and dedication required to succeed in wrestling, common characteristics of all Iowans which may explain why we have been so successful in the sport for so long. 
   The University of Iowa's wrestling program has significantly contributed to this success and tradition. It has historically been, and remains, considered among the nation's elite programs. In 2008 the University of Iowa won its 21st national title, its first since 2000, and crowned two individual champions--senior Mark Perry and sophomore Brent Metcalf. And, Coach Tom Brands was selected as 2008 Coach of the Year. 
   Again, I wish to congratulate the Iowa wrestling program on a job well done as they celebrate their 2008 national championship and I encourage my colleagues to do so as well by adopting this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Indiana for recognition and for the kind words. I appreciate that very much. The gentlewoman from Texas, thank you for your support. And I want to thank Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith for working together to bring this very important resolution to the floor quickly after it was introduced. 
   I also want to thank Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton and Ranking Member Hunter for their valuable input on this resolution and important work on this issue. 
   Many servicemembers who are single parents rely upon grandparents or other caretakers to care for their children while they are deployed. If the servicemember is tragically killed in action, these caretakers are left without access to the death gratuity payment to help raise the servicemember's children. 
   I am grateful that the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have addressed this issue, including in the 2008 defense authorization bill provisions allowing servicemembers to begin designating caretakers as recipients of all or part of the death gratuity as we go forward. However, it is important that we also consider those families that have already been affected by the situation, which is the purpose of this resolution today. 
   There have been as many as 143 recent cases where minor children were the recipients of the death gratuity which they cannot access until reaching the age of 18. In some of these cases, such as the one involving the Jaenke family from Iowa Falls, Iowa, in my district, the fallen servicemember left specific written instructions that part of the death gratuity be used to care for her daughter. Naval Petty Officer 2nd Class Jamie Jaenke, who was tragically killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq last summer, was survived by her 9-year-old daughter Kayla, who is being cared for by her grandparents. Kayla's family has experienced countless financial hardships as a result of not having access to the death benefits for the purposes that Jamie intended. 
   While the situation may not affect a large number of families, the bottom line is I believe the wishes of our servicemembers with respect to their death benefits should be honored. 
   Our Nation will be forever grateful for Jamie's dedication and service and the sacrifice she has made for our Nation. It is a fundamental duty of Congress to ensure that the children of fallen servicemembers, like Kayla, are cared for. We owe this to our servicemembers who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I urge the Senate to act in a  quick manner to resolve this unfortunate situation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (COLLEGE STUDENT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in tepid support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act. As a result of this measure, approximately 55,000 subsidized Stafford loan borrowers in Iowa, many of whom attend Iowa State University and other colleges in my district, will have their interest rates reduced upon entering repayment after graduation. 
   The savings college graduates will realize through this interest rate cut, approximately $2,300 for students starting school this upcoming academic year, is commendable and deserves our support. 
   However, any statements implying that this measure makes college more affordable or more accessible, those statements are simply incorrect. Several Members have made such statements and the official Website of the Democrat Caucus also claims the bill ``makes college more accessible and affordable.'' The fact is this legislation does neither. 
   How can a reduction in student loan interest rates make education more accessible when students do not feel the effect of the rate cuts while they attend school? Only after the students are through school and enter repayment will they be able to take advantage of the provisions of this bill. So H.R. 5 does not expand college access for a single Iowa student in any way. 
   Further, any claim that this measure makes college more affordable is pure conjecture. Institutions of higher education have been increasing tuition at an alarming rate, 35 percent in the past 5 years. According to the Department of Education, financial barriers will prevent 4.4 million students from attending a 4-year public college and prevent another 2 million from attending any college at all over the next decade. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrat majority did not make any amendments that might actually make college education more affordable, including Ranking Member McKeon's College Affordability and Transparency Act, which would hold schools accountable for the huge cost hikes that they implement year after year, in order under the rule. 
   If recent pricing trends continue, any savings college graduates might enjoy from interest rate cuts will be negated within 3 years before the 3.4 percent interest rate takes effect. 
   Madam Speaker, I am proud that the Republican-led Congress tripled student aid over the last 10 years, and I fully support measures that make college education more accessible and  more affordable for America's working families. But this legislation falls woefully short of those important goals and is nothing but a cheap, or I should say a very expensive PR measure that allows Congress to get into the business of setting student loan interest rates based on campaign promises, not on sound fiscal or education policy. 
   I had hoped that the Democrat majority would actually fulfill the promise to make college education more accessible and affordable. I guess I hoped for too much.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (PROVIDING FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3161, AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. I thank the gentleman from California in recognizing the huge town of 160 people of Alexander, Iowa. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule because it does cut off and stifle debate on an appropriations bill. This really violates the open rule tradition on appropriation bill debate in the House and runs counter to the way we ought to be deciding to spend the taxpayers' resources. 
   Having said that, I want to commend the gentlelady from Connecticut for her great work, and the ranking member from Georgia really did an outstanding job. 
   There is one particular component of the new rule I would like to make a comment on. The reported bill contains a provision, section 746, stating that ``no funds in this act may be used to authorize qualified health claims for conventional foods.'' 
   This provision means that none of the funds in the bill can be used to give permission to display important health information, irrespective of whether or not the information is scientifically valid. 
   The provision, as reported, would clearly stifle the FDA's ability to put forth information on health benefits in foods. 
   This new rule self-executes a provision which narrows a reported version of section 746 to stipulate that the funding prohibition applies only to the FDA. The problem is that the change doesn't really address the problem. 
   If this provision is intended to help FDA avoid wasted time and resources on frivolous petitions, it misses the mark. Nothing in this revised language removes or alters FDA's responsibility to review these petitions as required by law. The provision only denies final approval or authorization of the use of valid claims as to the risks and benefits of foods sold in the U.S. 
   This means that FDA still must carry out its mission of reviewing petitions on claims, but just cannot issue approvals, even if they are warranted. The problem is that if FDA does not do it, nobody will.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3 because revising the current Federal policy on stem cell research is completely unnecessary. Sadly, the ethical debate over human embryonic stem cell research has completely overshadowed the fact that the Federal Government is devoting $600 million each year for all types of stem cell research. The current policy does not ban stem cell research in the United States, nor does it ban Federal funding for embryonic-type stem cell research. It only limits federally funded embryonic stem cell research to stem cell lines existing before August 9, 2001. The National Institutes of Health, through its peer-review selection process, currently directs only about $39 million of the total to human embryonic stem cell research. While some conclude that the stem cell lines approved under the administration's policy are not adequate, 85 percent of all the published research on embryonic stem cells, whether U.S. or foreign, was conducted using these stem cell lines. The fact is, despite these investments, embryonic stem cell research has yielded few and modest results in animals, and no clinical treatments in humans. 
   In stark contrast, non-embryonic stem cells are showing far more potential to develop treatments. Just this week, it was reported around the country that researchers from Wake Forest University found that stem cells extracted from amniotic fluid have the same growth and differentiation capabilities as embryonic stem cells. These cells are shed by the developing fetus and are easily obtained during prenatal testing without destroying human embryos. Other research using stem cells from non-embryonic sources, such as existing adult cells, umbilical chord blood and human placentas, has resulted in 72 experimental treatments for a number of diseases. 
   According to a study by the RAND corporation, there are approximately 400,000 frozen embryos at fertility clinics in the U.S., most of which have been set aside for future use. Only approximately 11,000 have been donated for research so far. If there is a breakthrough that provides a treatment using embryonic stem cells, the fact is that fertility clinics could never provide the number of stem cells needed for treatment: 50 to 100 eggs are needed to produce just one petri dish of cells. Donors would have to be solicited, which would put women all over the world at risk for coercion as well as the health complications associated with egg donation. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that the United States is not alone in the world in addressing this issue; Italy, Austria, Ireland, Norway, and Poland have an outright prohibition on human embryo research. In other countries, such as France and Germany, human embryonic stem cell research is only permitted for stem cell lines created before a certain date, which is similar to the current U.S. policy. Federal resources should continue to be directed toward the most promising medical research. I urge my colleagues to uphold the current policy on stem cell research and vote ``no'' on H.R. 3.

   I want to congratulate my good friend, former colleague from Iowa, Jim Nussle, on the unveiling of his portrait today and I would encourage all of his former colleagues to attend that ceremony at 4 o'clock this afternoon in 210 in the Cannon House Office Building. 
   Jim Nussle was a tireless advocate for the future of this country, and through the Budget Committee that he chaired for 6 years, did an outstanding job of fighting for the next generation to understand that the entitlement programs that are going to really cause devastation in our budgets in the future should be addressed, and fought tirelessly for the next generation. 
   As we all know, Jim Nussle has been nominated to be the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. There is no one better qualified than Jim Nussle, that has the skill to do this job, that has the budget knowledge. Jim Nussle is the most knowledgeable person we could possibly have in that position. He'll be a tireless advocate for a balanced budget, someone that can work across the aisle, as he did on the Budget Committee. And the comments from the ranking member last year really indicate how well Jim Nussle will work for our country and to lead our Nation and to manage this enormous government that we have. 
   So let's commend Jim Nussle, show up for the unveiling and really be advocates for him to continue his service for the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. ``Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to R.R. 3162. First, I fully support reauthorizing the SCHIP program and preserving this important program intended to provide health insurance to low-income children. 
   Having said that, I cannot support a bill that robs America's seniors of their Medicare benefits in order to give taxpayer-financed health care to illegal immigrants. The bill before us eliminates requirements that applicants show proof of citizenship, potentially allowing millions of illegal immigrants access to Medicaid and SCHIP. 
   Furthermore, there is no requirement to ensure that eligible children from low-income families are enrolled before expanding coverage to children from middle-class or wealthier families. No limits on income eligibility are included, allowing a virtually open-ended expansion of the program to children that already have private health insurance. Meanwhile, 70 percent of uninsured children are already eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP and most of these are in the low-income category. The original intent of SCHIP was to cover low-income children, and we need to give these kids priority. 
   To pay for the expansion of SCHIP, Democrats are cutting over $157 billion from Medicare Advantage, which provides enhanced benefits like prescription drug, vision and dental coverage, as well as lower out-of-pocket costs, for almost 51,000 Iowa seniors. This will result in a reduction of benefits for seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage, and an increase in their costs. These drastic cuts will even force 3 million current beneficiaries out of the program. 
   Pitting grandparents against their grandchildren is simply wrong. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. Let's go back to the drawing board to produce a more responsible bill focused on providing health insurance to children from low-income families.''

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. I thank the gentleman from New York for allowing me this time. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to share everyone's frustration with the mistakes that have been made in Iraq, and the fact that progress has not been made as fast as we would all have liked. I would say, though, before you cast your vote on this resolution, I think it is only fair to remind Members of this Chamber that the main thrust of this resolution focuses only on one of at least 10 of the recommendations the administration is carrying out based upon the work of the Iraq Study Group. Others include shifting our primary mission to training and equipping Iraqi security units and embedding more U.S. soldiers in the Iraqi military. 
   The administration has also pledged to hold the Iraqi Government accountable to its commitments to take primary responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November, establishing a fair constitutional amendment process, reforming de-Baathification laws, creating a fair oil revenue sharing arrangement and holding local elections. 
   Let me also remind the Democratic majority that when the Iraq Study Group announced its recommendations, the Democratic leaders publicly stated they hoped the President would embrace the report. But when the administration proposed carrying out policy recommendations by the study group, which included a surge in troops, the Democrats backed away and took the cynical approach, oppose and criticize, rather than to offer to work for real solutions. 
   Some Members of this body will use this week's nonbinding resolution to run away from the vote that they cast in 2003. I will suggest to you that history will judge this Congress in a manner many of you have not considered. In my judgment, every Member who votes in favor of this resolution is endorsing the Democratic Party's decision to manage the war from Capitol Hill. 
   After all, as the debate on this resolution got under way this week, the Democrat leadership in this House made it perfectly clear that the resolution is just the first effort by the majority to begin a Democratic-led legislative micromanagement of this war. 
   It is said that Colin Powell advised the President on Iraq, if you break it, you own it. So I want to tell the Democratic majority that with this resolution, your plan to micromanage this war through your legislative initiatives, you are taking possession of this war. 
   With this resolution, you are taking over the day-to-day management of this conflict, and at the same time taking the onus off of the President. Let me say that again. You are now responsible for the outcome of this war. 
   The Democratic majority has determined that solutions to our most complicated conflicts can be solved through nonbinding resolutions, and I predict forcing the President's hand by cutting off the funding for our men and women in uniform, just like they did in Vietnam. Our soldiers fought gallantly in Vietnam as they do today in Iraq, but the legislative micromanagement by the U.S. Congress during the Vietnam era, and in decisions to cut funding for our military mission in Southeast Asia, only tied the hands of our warriors, but it not only tied the hands of our warriors, it demoralized our men and women in uniform for decades. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, the new majority has not learned from the mistakes of the past, but has arrogantly concluded that House Democrats can take command and control of our strategy and our troops in Iraq from the floor of this Chamber. Keep in mind, now that the Democratic leadership has assumed the role of Commanders in Chief, the consequences of failures are now also theirs. Just as the North Vietnamese changed their strategy and were emboldened by the misguided actions of the Congress, so too will the enemies of freedom in Iraq be emboldened by this and subsequent resolutions by this Congress. 
   Furthermore, if the majority party's political rhetoric corresponds with their legislative agenda on Iraq, you can rest assured that the humanitarian disaster will be yours. The jihadist victory will be yours. The rogue state coalition of Iran and Syria will be yours.     
   A genocidal Sunni-Shiite-Arab civil war will be yours. You will have handed al Qaeda victory and empowered its homicidal leaders. Again with this resolution, the Democratic majority has seized control of this conflict. And again, remember what Colin Powell said: If you break it you own it. 
   History will not focus on your voting for the resolution authorizing the force, but they will long remember you unleashing the hell that is going to come in Iraq by voting for this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution honoring the 1st Battalion, 133rd Infantry of the Iowa National Guard. This unit returned last week from a deployment lasting nearly 23 consecutive months in Iraq, which is the longest continuous deployment of any Army National Guard Unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom. This distinction carries on the 1st Battalion's proud historical legacy: Since the Second World War the unit served more consecutive days in the European theatre than any other unit. 
   In Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 1st Battalion carried out a critical mission in one of the most dangerous areas of Iraq. The unit drove over 4 million miles providing security for convoys supplying thousands of U.S. troops. I want to commend the soldiers of the 1st Battalion for their successful completion of over 500 missions. 
   These soldiers and their families have made tremendous sacrifices to further the U.S. mission in Iraq and for that we owe them a debt of gratitude. Tragically, this sacrifice included more than 25 wounded and the deaths of two members of the unit who made the ultimate sacrifice. SGT 1st Class Scott Nisely and SGT Kampha Sourivong were killed in combat operations on September 30, 2006. Our Nation will forever be grateful to these heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedoms. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important recognition of one of our Nation's finest National Guard Units.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. I thank Mr. Wamp for the time. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my support for this important measure, and I want to commend Chairman Edwards and Ranking Member Wamp for their good work on this most important bill. I urge the Members to support the bill. It is so important to all of our veterans of this country. 
   I only talk about this to express real frustration that I have. I want to note that in my hand I have an amendment which I had hoped to offer today, but  because of the nature of the rule, I can't. And I wanted to offer this amendment in the interest of people from Iowa and throughout the Midwest who are struggling to put their lives together in the wake of the 500-year Midwest floods. 
   This amendment would have provided emergency money for economic development assistance for restoration of infrastructure, Army Corps of Engineers money to repair levies, SBA disaster loan assistance, Community Planning and Development funds for infrastructure, and additional FEMA disaster relief moneys. Unfortunately, we can't, and I don't want to delay this process. But this bill should be passed before we leave for break. 
   Mr. Chairman, last week I wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House and asked that we finally address, after 7 weeks, the flood disaster throughout the Midwest. I have not heard a response; so obviously we're being ignored. 
   I asked some folks at home to tell me some of their stories, and they have e-mailed me and sent me their messages, and I would like to read a couple of those. 
   The first one actually is a copy I received of an e-mail to Speaker Pelosi, and it reads: 
   ``I cannot believe that you will not bring flood relief legislation to a vote. Now you are going on vacation. Twenty-five thousand homes were lost in the June floods in Iowa alone, and Congress votes to recognize the National Day of the Cowboy instead of passing legislation to help Iowans. 
   ``After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Congress passed emergency supplemental bills nearly immediately, and here we are 7 weeks after the Iowa floods and no additional help! It is no wonder Congress's approval rating is at an all-time low. 
   ``While you're on vacation, please remember the thousands of Iowans who have no homes.'' 
   An e-mail received from a resident of Cedar Rapids. She said: 
   ``My husband volunteers on the weekends and 1 day a week (bless his employer for letting him work 4 10-hour days so he can do flood relief) as a flood site coordinator, which means he moves around from team to team and are sent by our church to help the residents `muck' out their basements, and tear out the walls, insulation, trim, carpet, and get rid of the furnaces and water heaters (and, unfortunately, throw out their life with every personal item that goes on the curbs) ..... 
   ``What are the elected officials in Washington going to do to help? I must be the most naive U.S. citizen who can hardly believe that it takes an act of Congress to have a National Cowboy Day but can go on a recess with clear consciences before coming up with some plan of action for this area and the people ..... 
   ``The Red Cross has moved on and the Salvation Army has come off the streets. FEMA sent trailers, people settled into them, and then they were displaced again when mold was found in the trailers ..... 
   ``These people are not asking for more than what they had, just help putting their lives, families, and homes back together. They need help and support from those they have put their trust in.'' 
   And another e-mail from a lady in Mason City. It says: 
   ``Please continue your fight to have Congress address the disaster needs of the Midwest! The rest of the world seems to have forgotten about our disaster. However, for those of us still fighting it, it's as painful today as it was the day our houses were filled with water. 
   ``My family is just one of many here in Mason City who are homeless ..... 
   ``Our house is significantly damaged; so we can't move back into it. We thought we could, and then 2 weeks ago we discovered the amount of damage was too much.     
   ``We have to elevate it, move it, or destroy it. Our house is a trilevel house where the floors are not on top of each other. The cost of elevating or moving would be more than the value of our home. The only option is to destroy it. 
   ``The house we are currently renting is a house for sale. On any given day, we are 30 to 45 days away from being homeless again. The house has been shown to prospective buyers at least six times since the flood. We are trying to find a house we can rent for a year. It's almost impossible to find something we can afford that's in a safe area and somewhat decent.'' 
   I would hope that the House tomorrow, since we are going to be in session, will finally pass disaster relief for people who are really hurting.

   Mr. LATHAM. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. 
   I rise today in strong opposition to this rule, and there is one very good reason. Partisanship has reached an unconscionable level in this House. 
   Just for the simple fact that I am in the minority party, the Rules Committee did not allow an amendment which would have given a 9-year-old child from my district access to the death gratuity that her mother wanted her to have when she was killed in Iraq, just for partisan reasons. 
   Susan Jaenke, the mother of Jaimie Jaenke, who was killed in Iraq, along with her granddaughter, Kayla, came to Washington at great expense and trouble and testified before the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee. There was broad bipartisan support for an amendment that would simply allow access to the death gratuity of Jaimie Jaenke by her daughter. 
   This is outrageous, the fact that you would deny a 9-year-old child access. Her grandparents don't have the money to raise this child. She has no spouse. It would not cost a dime. It is the right thing to do. In the committee, on a bipartisan basis, people said they would do anything possible to help in this situation. I brought this before the Rules  Committee and explained what is going on, how this child is denied access to funding so that she can have a decent life; and it was denied simply for partisan reasons. I would think you would be ashamed. 
   And this is not just a single case. There are at least 143 cases exactly like this. And to deny a child access to this benefit is simply outrageous. 
   Vote against this outrageous rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for the time, and I rise today in strong support of both the rule and the bill itself, this emergency supplemental. 
   I want to take this time to speak briefly about the devastating flood situation in our Midwestern States, and particularly in my home State of Iowa.  I also want to thank Chairman Obey very much and Mr. Lewis from California for their efforts in producing the $2.65 billion of disaster relief in this package that is part of the supplemental agreement. I think the six funding components of the package will be of significant help to the residents of Iowa and other Midwestern States as they continue to cope with this disaster. I hope that we can continue to work together through the process to provide this needed assistance. 
   This past Monday, after several days of touring affected areas in and near my district in Iowa, I talked with the committee about the devastation in Iowa and what I thought we would need initially to help us get through this. 
   It is difficult to fully grasp the magnitude of the devastation and loss unless you see it firsthand. City blocks, town squares, neighborhoods, businesses and homes are underwater. The damage and the extent of the flooding will exceed that of 1993. Illustrating the magnitude of these floods is the fact that Iowa Governor Chet Culver has issued an emergency proclamation for 83 of Iowa's 99 counties, all of which have experienced significant damage. Forty-two of the 83 designated counties have thus far been declared presidential disaster areas, and the flooding has not yet stopped. 
   This great flood of 2008 has displaced nearly 40,000 Iowans from their homes, and countless others have been displaced from hospitals and nursing homes. The damage in Iowa and to her people is staggering and will not be fully known for some time yet. In the agricultural sector, there are projections of losses in the range of $2 billion to $2.7 billion by themselves. When combined with the damage and losses of homes, businesses, hospitals, community facilities, roads, bridges and levees, the impact obviously will be staggering. Every sector of Iowa's economy has been touched, and the range of damage is endless. 
   I look forward to continuing to work with the members of the Appropriations Committee and others in the House in a bipartisan effort. We must pledge to continue to produce needed resources in a timely manner to help facilitate a quick recovery for Iowa and other Midwestern States. 
   I thank the committee and its leadership again, Chairman Obey and Ranking Member Lewis, for their help.

   Mr. LATHAM. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my sympathy to the families who lost their boys in the tornado in Little Sioux, Iowa, earlier this month. 
   As a parent, I know that no words uttered on this floor will ease the pain of losing a child. I only hope today's statements will serve as a timeless reminder that America's heart broke upon the news of this tragic loss. As a Nation, we are all so very sorry for your loss. 
   I'd like to take a moment to talk about Aaron Eilerts of Eagle Grove, Iowa. Aaron was 14 years old. He was the only son of Bob and Carol Eilerts. He was a dedicated member of Boy Scout Troop 108. 
   Although I didn't have the honor of knowing Aaron, many people in the town of Eagle Grove were touched deeply by this outstanding young man. After reading the many tributes to Aaron Eilerts, I was struck by what a special person he was. 
   Aaron had taken it upon himself to make pillowcases for children who were sick and confined in hospitals. He made dozens of colorful pillowcases, including one for his cousin who was recovering from losing his leg serving our country in Iraq. 
   Aaron will be remembered for his generosity and his big heart. He enjoyed making people happy and had a special gift for making folks smile. 
   It should be noted that Aaron was a distinguished member of Scouting's National Honor Society, The Order of the Arrow. Aaron was elected to the Order by his peers because he best exemplified the Scout Oath and Law in his daily life. 
   I will recite the Scout Oath and Law in Aaron's memory, and I hope it will give people a sense of what kind of a person he was and what we should all aspire to be. 
   The Scout Oath reads: ``On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country and to obey the Scout Law; to help other people at all times; to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'' 
   The Scout Law requires each Boy Scout to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. 
   We should all follow Aaron Eilerts' example. He lived a good life, doing good things for people in need.

We have been told by the House and Senate leadership that there simply isn't enough time to get the job done before we leave. I say, Why not? The history of this House is replete with time after time--in hours--passing bills to help for national disasters. 
   Instead, today, we're going to do 38 bills on the floor of the House, things like naming a post office in New York; things like supporting the goals and ideals of National Apple Month and the Apple Crunch; congratulating University of Florida quarterback Tim Tebow for winning the Heisman Trophy; congratulating the University of Tennessee for winning the national championship. 
   Isn't it ironic that the Democrat leadership less than 2 weeks ago found time for a 4-day tour of the gulf to pat themselves on the back on disaster aid and don't have time for the Midwest? 
   We should not leave here without passing disaster aid for the Midwest, and anyone who votes for adjournment should be held accountable.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (MAJOR SCOTT NISELY POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. 
   First of all, I would like to thank the committee and the gentleman from Illinois, Chairman Davis, for moving this piece of legislation as quickly as they have through the committee and for the opportunity to bring this I think most appropriate legislation to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support legislation that I introduced to honor Major Scott E. Nisely of Marshalltown, Iowa, one of America's heroes who was killed in combat on September 30, 2006, while serving our country in Iraq. 
   Scott Nisely served 22 years in the Marines as an officer on active duty and as a Reservist, retiring with the rank of major. During his time in the Marines, he served as an infantry company commander in Operation Desert Storm. And following his active duty, Scott worked 12 years for the U.S. Postal Service in Marshalltown, Iowa. 
   Due to Scott's strong desire to serve his country, he accepted an enlisted rank in order to fill a vacancy in the Iowa Army National Guard in 2002. 
   According to letters I have received from soldiers in Scott's unit, he did not broadcast the fact that he was a former Marine major, but humbly served his fellow soldiers. One officer also said he was a ``natural born leader of soldiers.'' 
   Scott served with the Iowa National Guard on the Multinational Forces Observer mission in the Sinai, and finally in Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
   Scott's friends, family, coworkers, fellow soldiers and marines attest to the positive and lasting impact he had on their lives. Numerous letters from these individuals were sent to me, and I include them for the Record. 
   Scott's life was a shining example of dedication to service, a strong commitment certainly to his family, his faith, and his country. This legislation will name the post office located at 309 East Linn Street in Marshalltown, Iowa, the Major Scott Nisely Post Office. 
   I want to thank Scott's co-workers at the Marshalltown post office who initiated this proposal, and I am proud to help them make this timely and appropriate honor a reality. I also want to thank my colleagues from Iowa, Leonard Boswell, Steve King, Bruce Braley and Dave Loebsack for their support in moving this legislation forward. I strongly urge all Members to pass H.R. 2563.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (SBA ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me time, and I congratulate the committee and the chairman for bringing this piece of legislation forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2359, the Small Business Administration Entrepreneurial Development Programs Act. 
   I am especially pleased that the Small Business Committee included legislation that I introduced earlier this Congress, H.R. 731, the National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act, into this broad legislative package. This National Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act utilizes one of SBA's most effective programs, the Small Business Development Center program. Generally the SBDCs support small businesses with financial, management, and marketing activities. My legislation, included in section 207 of H.R. 2359, creates a pilot program through the SBDCs that will provide free confidential counseling on regulatory compliance and help small businesses gain access to regulatory information and resources. 
   The research done by the Small Business Administration demonstrates that small businesses with less than 20 employees pay more than $7,600 per employee to comply with Federal regulations each year, while large firms pay 45 percent less per employee. Adjusted for inflation, the annual cost of Federal regulations faced by America's small businesses in 2004 was over $875 billion. 
   The fact of the matter is many small business owners have neither the time nor the expertise to sort through hundreds of pages of regulations in the Federal Register. Small business owners often learn of their failure to comply with Federal regulations or even that new Federal regulations have been imposed only after a penalty has been assessed. The current system denies small businesses access to regulatory compliance assistance and further weakens the opportunity for America's small businesses to compete with larger firms both domestically and internationally. 
   The Small Business Regulatory Assistance Act represents a win-win for America's small businesses. Not only will the SBDCs help small business owners understand what they must do to comply with Federal regulations but also how they may do so in a most cost-effective manner. 
   Again, I would like to thank the committee for including this legislation in the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the overall bill. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Today's entrepreneurs are facing countless challenges. SBA's entrepreneurial development programs must be modernized to provide small businesses with the ability to deal with the economic conditions of today. 
   Mr. Sestak's legislation, the SBA Entreprenurial Development Programs Act of 2007, makes much-needed updates to the agency's programs so that they are better able to assist entrepreneurs and enable small firms to remain a driving force in our economy. 
   H.R. 2359 has the support of the NFIB, who, in addition to supporting it, has made it one of their key votes for the 110th Congress. 
   Again I want to thank Mr. Sestak and also Mr. Chabot, the ranking minority member, for working in a bipartisan manner to move this legislation and other bills that will be moved today. I want to thank the staff that worked on this bill. From the majority staff, Michael Day, Adam Minehardt, Nicole Witenstein; from Representative Sestak's staff, Clarence Tong; and from the minority staff, Barry Pineles. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 2359.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4, a misguided policy that threatens to destroy the positive benefits provided to seniors through Medicare Part D. Arguments in support of this bill completely ignore the fact that under Medicare Part D, drug plans currently negotiate with drug companies to offer lower prices and better benefits for seniors. Due to strong competition among drug plans, the average Part D premium is now 42 percent less than originally projected. CMS actuaries recently announced that in 2008, Part D will cost taxpayers 10 percent less than it did this year. That will be 30 percent less than originally anticipated. In addition, most beneficiaries are satisfied with Part D. National surveys place beneficiary satisfaction at approximately 80 percent or higher. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, there are no projected cost savings associated with H.R. 4. This is because the only way to squeeze any more savings out of the current system is to limit formularies and steer patients to certain preferred drugs on a nationwide basis, as the VA does. With H.R. 4 in place, this would be a fairly easy step to take in the future. However, the VA model is not one we should follow. While 38 percent of the drugs approved by the FDA during the 1990s are on the VA formulary, it includes only 19 percent of drugs approved since 2000. One million of the 3.8 million Medicare age veterans in the VA health system have signed up for the Medicare Part D benefit because VA coverage is not adequate. 
   In the U.S., 43 million Medicare recipients account for 40 percent of all drug spending. With this kind of market share, Federal Government ``negotiation'' is in reality price setting. In the past, Democrats as well as Republicans have rejected federal price setting for Medicare drugs. 
   Noninterference clauses were included in past Democrat sponsored drug benefit legislation, including President Clinton's 1999 Medicare reform proposal, and two prescription drug bills offered by House Democrats in 2000. 
   It is important to point out the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, routinely cited as a model for its quality and efficiency, relies on private health plans to negotiate drug prices on behalf of federal employees and Members of Congress. If federal price setting is not good for us, then it is not good for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line here is that having competing drug plans negotiate drug prices--rather than the federal bureaucracy--is the best way to administer the Medicare drug benefit. The current system has been extremely successful in keeping costs low. Diverse formularies and cost sharing arrangements allow seniors to choose the plan that meets their needs at the lowest possible cost. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the ill-advised and misguided policy proposed by House Democrats and vote ``no'' on H.R. 4.

<DOCNO>Mr. LATHAM. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LATHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this funding package, and to tell my colleagues that there is much in this measure that should be supported. I also want to say that we should not be put in the position of scrambling to complete a continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down. This is no way to run a railroad. 
   Nevertheless, I want to say that I am pleased that we finally have a disaster funding title. My constituents will be appreciative. While this disaster money is a few months late, the citizens of Iowa will be pleased to know that funding assistance will finally get to them--hopefully, by mid-October--about 4 or 5 months after the floods came. 
   I do want to say that I am pleased that we have included in this disaster portion of the package, over $100 million in FEMA Community Development Loans. These funds are very much needed by FEMA as they have said in the past so I was pleased that they were included as I had asked. These are monies that  can go to local governments to help offset losses in local utilities, for example. 
   I have heard some complaints about the dispersal rates for funding assistance from our earlier disaster measure. In some instances, those complaints are justified but we all know bureaucracies are slow. However, one of the reasons that some of the funding did not go forth is that there was no money to send. 
   As most of you know, I and my colleagues on both sides pushed for a disaster relief measure to be completed before we left for the August recess because I knew that the first relief title passed on the Iraq Supplemental this summer would not go very far. I also knew that if we did not pass another flood disaster measure before we left, it would be four or five months before my fellow Iowans and others in the Midwest would see any significant relief assistance. 
   Unfortunately, the majority leadership refused to address the needs of Iowa and other Midwestern flood states before the recess. In turn, that meant that no funds would be forthcoming until fall. That was the reason I pushed so hard to get a supplemental before the August recess. 
   Had we passed that supplemental disaster measure before August, and it would have been easy to do, funds would have already been put to use by now, and the recovery efforts would now be further along. 
   All of that being said, we do need to pass this package today because we have put ourselves in the position where we have squandered our time. I urge members to vote for the measure.
