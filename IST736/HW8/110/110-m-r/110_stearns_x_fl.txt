<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (HEALTH CARE TAX DEDUCTION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, last night while attending our President's final State of the Union, I was encouraged to hear him say: Ending the bias in the Tax Code against those who do not get their health insurance through their employer is one reform that would put private coverage within reach for millions, and I call on the Congress to pass this piece of legislation this year. 
   My colleagues, I'd like to draw your attention to the Health Care Tax Deduction Act of 2007, a bill which I have offered, and one that accomplishes this goal of insuring every American man, woman and child. This bill will allow individuals a tax deduction from gross income for health insurance premiums and unreimbursed prescription drug expenses for themselves and their family. 
   I urge you to cosponsor this bill and attack this problem with meaningful and responsible legislation. With this legislation, we can end the debate over inefficient government-run health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 4040, CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I address my colleague, Mr. Rush, and say to him I am impressed with the courage and energy that you come down here, and we want to thank you today for taking that extra time. All of us obviously wish you well, and hope and pray and provide great love and friendship that the healing powers of the Lord Almighty will bring great restorative powers on you and you will be successful. We are inspired by you being here today. Obviously it has been fun working with you on this bill and others as the ranking member when you became chairman. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation, and obviously I urge its immediate passage. As former chairman and ranking member of the Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I have been involved in these issues for many, many years. When I was chairman, we held numerous hearings and markups on a variety of issues, not just on toy safety and lead standards but also the Consumer Product Safety Commission itself. In addition, we held consumer protection hearings on privacy, on the Ford-Firestone tire safety, and consumer protection on the Internet, including spyware, data security, and ID theft. We compiled a long record on this subcommittee. 
   This bill is a culmination of many years of hard work and oversight. However, like many bills, this bill, H.R. 4040, is not entirely perfect, not all of it is exactly what we may have wanted, but it does go a long way to protect our children against harmful products. And that is the most important issue. 
   Over the last 2 years, my colleagues, we have seen numerous children's product and toy recalls rise dramatically. Many of these recalls were because of excessive amounts of lead in toys being imported from China. As if parents didn't have enough to worry about, they are now faced with another dilemma: Are the toys that they are buying their children safe today? That is a question they are asking. Today, with passage of this conference report, we will make sure that children are kept safe from hazardous products. 
   While many Members on both sides have focused mainly on the growing compliance shortfalls with toys that are manufactured outside the United States today, particularly in China, toys have not been the only problem over the past several years. As imports of every type of product have risen over the years, so have the number of problems that have been associated with these particular products. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission has done a fairly good job of meeting this daunting challenge. 
   As you can imagine, there are 15,000 different kinds of products. They have issued more recalls over the last 2 years than any other time in our history. I commend them for their diligent work in protecting the American people and their children. Despite this good work, we recognize the need to provide the Commission with additional resources, which we are doing today. We authorize significant increases in their budget so that the Commission can fulfill their mission to keep defective products that can cause injury, or worse, out of the stream of commerce today. 
   This bill is good public policy that not only provides the Commission with new resources but also provides for new standards regarding lead paint and implements the most stringent standard ever for lead content in children's products. This bill requires testing and certification of children's products before they are ever shipped to store shelves, and provides increased penalties for companies that violate the law.  
   New labeling requirements will help facilitate effective recalls, and the bill provides greater authority for the Commission to recall harmful products and notify the public of these dangers. 
   It is very important that they have this additional recall authority that is in this bill.

   Mr. STEARNS. My colleagues, all of us on this conference committee and in the subcommittee have worked with the consumer groups, industry leaders, and the Commission itself to make this a bipartisan, sound bill that works effectively. I would like to commend the hard work of Chairman Rush, Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Ranking Member Ed Whitfield, the Senate conferees, and all the committee staff that worked so tirelessly on this important legislation. It is a fact we have a bipartisan bill. It was bipartisan out of the subcommittee and the full Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
   There are things you can complain about Congress, but today you can commend Congress for working in such a bipartisan fashion to get a very important bill after these many, many years. It is a commendation both to Mr. Dingell and Mr. Barton. Through their differences and through the different members on the Senate conferees, they were able to work patiently, consistently, and persevere until we have this final product today. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan legislation, and I look forward to its implementation soon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, efforts by Americans and our allies in Iraq have greatly weakened al Qaeda. If we withdraw our troops from Iraq before their mission is complete, we would forfeit all the progress we have made so far. 
   Since the surge began last year, we have made remarkable progress, both on the military front and on the political front. While we all agree that more needs to be done politically, there is no questioning the tremendous efforts our military have done to bring stability to areas once controlled by radical extremists. 
   There should be absolutely no question of whether we provide them the funding they need to do the job we've asked them to do. House Republicans stand united with our troops and our veterans who have fought bravely on the front lines. The least we can do is front the resources necessary for them to complete the task we sent our military to do. 
   We cannot delay, and we should provide this supplemental funding without extra new spending and extra new programs before we leave for Memorial Day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Chairman, today we vote on a bill that quite frankly hurts American workers. The derisively named ``Employee Free Choice Act'' removes employees' choice in choosing to organize by having them reveal their vote on an authorization card, under the watching eyes of union officials; not on a secret ballot. 
   This is wrong, not only in the workplace, but in any scenario where peer pressure can exert itself. In government elections, secret ballots are the foundation of democracy worldwide. We send election observers to developing nations to see that, among other elements, their ballots are cast in private. 
   The Fraternal Order of Police labor union wrote to our Speaker on Tuesday against this bill, saying: ``This ill-named legislation attacks the very meaning of free choice. Without federally supervised private ballot elections, our democratic process would be extremely susceptible to corruption, and the very foundation of our Republic could be undermined. This bill would do the same thing to our Nation's workers by robbing them of their privacy, power and voice in deciding who should represent and defend their rights as employees.'' 
   Employees who just want to go about their business and peacefully do their jobs without fear of reprisal from either their employers or union bosses deserve the same secret ballot with which all of us were elected.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (GLOBAL ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, the United States is the world's largest energy consumer and one of its leading producers. However, many Americans remain in the dark about the global nature of the energy crisis we have today. 
   As a result of the integrated nature of the world oil market, it is unlikely that any one nation acting on its own can implement policies that isolate its market from the broader price behavior. 
   As new major oil importers, notably China and potentially India, expand their demand, the oil market likely will have to expand production capacity, too. This promises to increase the world's dependence on the Persian Gulf members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially Saudi Arabia, and to maintain upward pressure on price. 
   International markets set the price of oil and energy as a whole. There is nothing we can do about that. However, we can increase our own energy reserves and can lessen the effects of the global energy market, but we must keep the proper perspective about our energy supplies. 
   Now, so-called alternative fuels, including wind, solar, fuel cells, ethanol, and biodiesel, indeed, hold great promise for the future, but right now, they are expensive and are currently useful only in small-scale applications. I hope this will change. Wind and solar power, for example, are intermittent and are unpredictable. Because electricity cannot be stored on a large scale, wind and solar are unsuitable as 24-hour-a-day sources of energy. 
   Even though government forecasts show more than a 50 percent increase in renewable energy used by 2030, the renewable share of the total energy pie will rise from only 6 to 7 percent during that period. At this stage, it would be more accurate to call these ``supplemental'' rather than ``alternative'' energy sources. They are simply not ready to replace the fossil fuels that currently account for about 80 percent of the world's energy supply. 
   We need an effective national policy that supersedes the existing patchwork of different State laws and regulations, one that allows us to tap all of our energy supply options, to promote greater reliance on conservation and efficiency and to foster a business environment conducive to market competition and timely investment in new energy infrastructure. 
   Current projections indicate that, shortly after 2040, the United States will exceed 400 million people and that the world will exceed 9 billion people. This steady climb has major implications for the U.S. energy industry. Each new person will put additional demands on the system, requiring more electricity and natural gas to run their homes and businesses and gasoline or other liquid fuels to transport them.  
   Although its forecasts do not quite go that far, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, electricity over the next 25 years is expected to jump by 50 percent. Now, similarly, domestic oil consumption is expected to grow about 1 percent a year with U.S. oil consumption climbing by one-third, from 21 million barrels a day to 28 million barrels a day. The U.S. addiction to oil is strong and growing. 
   We are not alone in our thirst for oil. Global demand for oil is also forecasted to increase by nearly 50 percent by the year 2030. The emergence of China and of India as economic powers is a leading cause of that growth. Their mushrooming demand for oil and for other forms of energy is reshaping global markets and is creating new geopolitical alliances and security concerns along the way. 
   These are significant increases, and we must plan now to meet this future energy demand or run the risk of undercutting the economic engine that drives the world's economy. 
   Because of the global nature of the energy crisis, there are no quick fixes or silver bullets to remedy this problem. However, this Congress must not sit idly by and watch the price of energy bankrupt American families. We must make finding a meaningful multilateral approach to our energy problem this year Congress' top priority. We need to do it now.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the War in Iraq has been difficult for all Americans. I understand and share the American people's frustration at how the war has been conducted. No one wants to bring our troops home more than I do, but conditions on the ground should dictate when our troops should leave, not domestic politics. 
   Regardless of if you voted for the war or against it or support immediate withdrawal or not, there is one issue we can all agree. Our brave men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve our respect and admiration. The best way to honor them is to provide them with all the necessary equipment to be safe and successful as quickly as possible. One thing our troops do not deserve is to be used as a political bargaining chip for additional billions in unrelated and unnecessary spending. 
    Unfortunately, that is what the Democrat leadership has done with the bill before us today. By playing politics, Democrats are ensuring that the troops will not get their funding prior to Memorial Day. Our troops do not deserve this kind of treatment. This is an insult to our men and women who put their lives on the line to protect our freedom. 
   This is most unfortunate because the first amendment, which I urge all my colleagues to support, contains funding for some very vital programs. For example, it includes $75 million in FY 2008 and $300 million in FY 2009 for traumatic brain injury care and research. In addition, the measure provides $95 million to address gaps identified by the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. The funding is designed to improve case management, data sharing, and the disability evaluation system. These, among others, are very critical to our troops and their families. They deserved to be enacted, not held up for petty political reasons. 
   Certainly mistakes have been made in Iraq and a change of strategy was long overdue. Now that the surge has been fully implemented and been given time to work, there is no doubt that the security environment in Iraq continues to improve. General Petraeus has said that security progress is still fragile and reversible. Much work still needs to be done, but progress on the ground is undeniable. 
   The question we must continually ask ourselves is what is the cost of withdrawing our troops? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leave the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk? Withdrawal needs to be based on events not politics. It is important to stress that an open-ended American military commitment is both unwise and dangerous. Progress in Iraq must be measurable, enforced and based on more than just military progress. 
   Accordingly, Col. Christopher Hughes, who commanded the 2d Battalion of the 327th Inf. Regiment, 101st Airborne in Iraq, has identified a set of strategic benchmarks deigned to measure progress in Iraq. Col. Hughes has developed an event-driven sequence that leads to a legitimate withdrawal. His plan includes six phases and a number of different benchmarks that need to be met. I have attached this plan and make it part of my speech. 
   It's important to highlight that events, not an arbitrary timeline, needs to guide our strategy. Col. Hughes' milestones for an event-driven withdrawal are strategic, operational and tactical. Such benchmarks include, holding insurgent violence less than or equal to one attack on Coalition and Iraqi forces per month, having 76 operational oil refineries and producing 4.5 million barrels of oil per day. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Congressional Record Col. Hughes' full strategy for leaving Iraq. 
   The amendment we have before us today does not take an event-driven approach, but sets an arbitrary deadline based on politics not the situation on the ground. I urge my colleagues to vote against the second amendment today. 
   In addition, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to talk about a provision in the third amendment pertaining to the Montgomery GI Bill. As a veteran and a senior member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I understand the hardship and sacrifice of military service. I, along with many of my colleagues, have supported legislation to update and expand the GI Bill, and I am cosponsoring H.R. 5740, the legislation that this provision is based on. However, the House leadership decided to combine the updated GI Bill with a huge tax increase on many small businesses. 
   The Democrat tax increase would put a surcharge on the gross income for individuals earning more than $500,000 and couples with over $1 million. However, of taxpayers with $1 million or more in income, nearly 83% report that some or all of that is income from a small business. This is a massive tax increase on the gross income of small businessmen and women who operate as self-employed individuals. They are the primary source of new jobs in our nation. Instead of raising taxes, Congress could fund the new GI Bill by reducing federal spending by a mere 0.1 percent over 10 years. I am certain that we can find one-tenth of one percent of wasteful federal spending and apply that to meeting the needs of our 21st century veterans. 
   In addition, the third amendment includes $5.8 billion in FY 2009 funds for levee rebuilding in Louisiana. This is in addition to the $7.1 billion the federal government has already provided to repair and enhance levees. Furthermore, $9.9 billion for foreign aid is included, which represents $500 million more than requested. These may very well be worthwhile programs but do they belong in an emergency, off budget spending package? 
   Lastly, I want to point out that the process of how this bill came to the floor today is not in keeping with the spirit and traditions of the House. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated in her 2006 document, A New Direction for America, ``bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups, with appropriate referrals to other committees.'' The Speaker went on to state that, ``bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the Minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
    Furthermore, according to The Politico newspaper, ``There have been about three dozen emergency spending bills in the past 20 years, and a handful have passed without input from the Appropriations Committee, including billions in Hurricane Katrina aid and post-Sept. 11 funds. But none of the Iraq war funding bills have bypassed the Appropriations panel.'' 
   Unfortunately, this supplemental bypassed the entire Appropriations Committee process altogether, and through the use of parliamentary gimmicks, avoids the input of both Democrat and Republican members who have real expertise in the subject areas involved, effectively shutting out the views of millions of these members' constituents. 
   To have the Democrat leadership cut off the people's right to be heard by such crass parliamentary maneuvers results hi great harm to the appropriations process and seriously undermines the credibility of the House of Representatives. 
   Our brave troops and millions of veterans deserve better. They do not deserve to be treated as political tools. We pass a clean supplemental, devoid of any unrelated, and unnecessary spending, that gets necessary equipment to our troops on the battlefield immediately . We should also pass a GI Bill that doe not unfairly tax small businesses. Unfortunately, the Democrat leadership decided to play politics, while our troops and veterans have to pay the price.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill.  
   Mr. Speaker, proponents of embryonic stem cells state the greatest advantage is the ``pluripotency'' of these cells, cells with the amazing ability to grow into any type of cell in the human body. It is this unique adaptability that they claim makes embryonic stem cells more promising than adult stem cells for treatment of human diseases. The truth however, is that embryonic stem cells have not produced a single viable human treatment for any disease; whereas, adult stem cells have produced numerous therapies that have been successfully administered. 
   Adult stem cells have provided human treatments, have a lower rate of immune rejection in patients, and show less likelihood of tumor formation. We should aggressively pursue this avenue of research. In seeking new treatments for the ills of humanity, let us also strive to protect the future of humanity. We too must uphold the first tenet of the Hippocratic oath--``First do no harm.'' 
   Proponents also claim that the U.S. is lagging behind the rest of the world in embryonic stem cell research and that increased Federal funding would close the gap. The fact is the United States leads the world in embryonic stem cell research. A recent Nature Journal publication states that U.S. scientists contributed 46 percent of all stem cell publications since 1998. Germany comes far second, representing 10 percent of studies, and the remaining 44 percent derive from between 16 other countries. 
   I want to remind my colleagues that the current ban on embryonic research does not prevent private funding for embryonic stem cell research. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Newport Beach bond trader Bill Gross are among several private donors who have provided millions of dollars toward embryonic stem cell research. In fact the Federal Government has spent over $161 million on existing stem cell lines where the embryo had already been destroyed. The bill before us today advocates the further destruction of new life to expand human embryonic stem cell research. I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation and do no harm.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased again, I have been here a number of times, to consider H.R. 964, the SPY Act, a bill which is important to fight Internet privacy. In the past and as we speak on the floor today, this has bipartisan support with bipartisan leadership. It has been offered by my colleague from California, MARY BONO, and my colleague from New York, ED TOWNS. Both of them have worked dutifully to try to pass this bill. And, unfortunately, the last time we passed it overwhelmingly in the House, it did not get through the Senate; so we are back at it again. 
   I also want to thank the new chairman of the committee that I chaired last year, Mr. Rush, for his commitment to maintaining a bipartisan process in this, and that is why we are here on the floor today. If it hadn't been for the leadership of these individuals combined with what I think is a Federal Trade Commission commitment and the stakeholders in the community in this process, we would not have had a workable legislative solution. 
   So I think today that we have to realize that even at the last 11th hour we might have some people who don't totally agree, but I think the bill is a strong bill. It takes a firm and, I think, a fair on balance approach in balancing the need to address bad actors and the need to protect the functions of legitimate business tools. 
   Both at the committee level and on the floor, we have voted on this spyware before, as I mentioned, three times. Three times we have gone through the process of holding hearings, receiving testimony from many witnesses, listening to the horrors of spyware and how it can be a tool of identity thieves, and we know how identity theft is prevalent today, conducting negotiations, and we have asked for ways to improve the bill. So we have seen support across the board in industry for this bill. We asked what is the best way to improve this bill. So I think we have worked hard on this legislation. 
   And, my colleagues, I think it is time we move this to the Senate, and if there are any further problems with this bill, we certainly can handle these problems in the conference between the House and the Senate. 
   Now, you should realize that there are some in the business community who have raised a 11th hour concern about a specific provision that was added at the full committee markup. Not in our subcommittee, Mr. Speaker, but in our full committee. I have been through seven hearings on the question of privacy on the question of opt in and opt out. I am well aware of the feelings of Members dealing with opt in and opt out, depending upon how you view this process. So I share some of the concerns of the business community in their 11th hour attempt to bring this to our attention. But the responsibility of continuing to move this process forward, I think, is important. That is why I have decided to vote ``yes'' today to support this bill. And, hopefully, when the Senate has it, they can make the changes. If not, we can do it in conference. But to take a bill that has been in this long process and has had so many hearings for so many years and decide that it should not go forward is not the right process.     
   And we all in Congress here know that sometimes the enemy of the good is the perfect. 
   So we can solve this issue, I think, to satisfy all interested parties. It is a strong piece of legislation; and I cannot think of a reason why our Senate colleagues should not act on it, also. 
   So, in closing, the SPY Act is a solid consumer protection bill that returns control of personal computers and private information to where it belongs, and that is to the consumer. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 964. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I rise today in support of H.R. 1594, a bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Hermitage, Pennsylvania, as the Michael A. Marzano Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic. 
   I appreciate the efforts of my colleague Phil English, and obviously Congressman JASON ALTMIRE who just recently spoke, and their efforts to push this legislation. Obviously this is a very important symbolic piece of legislation, and I think it reminds us of what occurred. I will defer to Congressman English for further comments on this legislation in a few moments. 
   As pointed out, Marine Sergeant Michael Marzano, a servicemember from Mercer County, Pennsylvania, was killed in action on May 7, 2005, while deployed in service to his Nation in Iraq. Reports from the field indicate his bravery and leadership while protecting a hospital, and many lives were saved due to his sacrifice. Sergeant Marzano was the first marine from Mercer County to give his life for freedom in Iraq. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislation has strong bipartisan support and also support from the local and State veterans communities, as well as support from the entire Pennsylvania delegation. 
   As pointed out, I thank Chairman Filner and also Ranking Member Buyer for foregoing the existing criteria to move this legislation expeditiously forward. It is right that we honor the memory and service of a warrior such as Michael Marzano by naming the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in his honor. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support the bill, which is H.R. 1594.

I will shortly, as has been pointed out by the chairman, recognize the bill's primary sponsor, Mr. ROBERT ADERHOLT of Alabama, for him to more fully discuss Col. Mize's contributions to our Nation. They are indeed very impressive. 
   While serving as a master sergeant during the Korean War, his company was defending an outpost when the enemy launched a heavy attack. Sergeant Mize rescued a wounded comrade at a listening post and returned to the main position where he established a defensive position and in turn inflicted many, many enemy casualties. 
   Taking the offensive, Sergeant Mize held off the enemy attacks. He organized an effective counterattack and directed artillery fire. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his valorous conduct and unflinching courage, upholding the most noble traditions of our military service. Mr. Mize's military career did not end just in Korea. In the early 1960s, Mr. Mize joined the Army Special Forces, better known as the Green Berets. He spent another 20 years in the Green Berets, including time spent commanding the Special Forces School at Fort Bragg. And he served nearly 4 years of duty in Vietnam where he was shot three times. 
   Col. Mize retired from the military after Vietnam, having been awarded a number of decorations in addition to the Medal of Honor. 
   So it's altogether right that we honor one of our Nation's heroes by naming this facility in Gadsden, Alabama after him. 
   At this point I yield as much time as he may consume to the author of the bill, Mr. Aderholt of Alabama.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I'm also pleased to be here in support of this bill, H. Res. 1335, a resolution celebrating a 120-year partnership between the Federal Government and the State veterans homes. 
   My colleagues, following the Civil War, a number of States independently established State veterans homes in order to meet the large needs of the veterans that were indigent, a lot of them were disabled. They returned from the war, but they were unable to establish a livelihood for themselves, earn enough money. They needed care. And these were veterans who sacrificed their lives in support of their country and were severely disabled and in need of help. 
   While the Federal Government operated national homes for disabled Union soldiers, the total number of veterans needing care was simply overwhelmingly. So in August, 1888, Federal sharing was formally authorized to help alleviate the burden that was placed upon the States. In 1952, the National Association of State Veterans Homes was established to help move this along. Their primary mission is to ensure that each and every eligible United States veteran receives the benefits, services, long-term health care and respect which they have earned in their service to their country and their sacrifice for our country. 
   Working through a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the organization also ensures that no veteran is in need or distress, and that the level of care and service provided by State veterans homes meet or exceed the highest standards we have in our health care system today. 
   Today, State veterans homes are one of the largest long-term providers in this country. In the State of Florida, for example, we currently have six State veterans nursing homes. We expect another one to open in St. Augustine in 2009. This is important because Florida is a State with ever-increasing veterans coming in, and we need to provide for them. 
   There are currently 135 State veterans homes throughout the United States with more than 30,000 total beds. The service these organizations provide to our Nation's veterans is obviously invaluable. And I commend the State veterans homes on their 120-year partnership with the government to provide care to our veterans community with a very high standard. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this wonderful bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA GATORS FOR THEIR HISTORIC WIN IN THE 2007 NCAA MEN'S BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT -- (House of Representatives - May 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Let me thank, first of all, my colleagues, for bringing this resolution to the floor. I certainly appreciate the gentlelady from New York, I believe, Long Island, for her gracious comments, to know that Billy Donovan also resided in her district. I think that is something that many of us did not know. 
   Madam Speaker, I do have a little feeling of modesty here and graciousness coming here again to the floor. It's almost like a great case of d&#233;ja 2vu again, because it seems like only a few months ago that I came to the floor to honor the University of Florida, which I represent, for winning the national football title. 
   Yet here I am again, feeling a great deal of humbleeness, coming to the House floor to honor the Gators men's basketball team, as pointed out, for becoming the first team since 1991-1992 to win back-to-back national titles. Of course, I am honored to represent the University of Florida, because it's in my congressional district. As we say in Gainesville, ``Go Gators.'' We do indeed hope for another championship. 
   With their win over the Ohio State Buckeyes on April 2, as mentioned, they became only the seventh school ever to repeat championships. In addition, Florida remains the only school in NCAA history to hold both the men's basketball and football championship titles in the same year, which is an arduous feat, to say the least. This is quite an accomplishment, and one the entire university community should take a great deal of pride in, which they do. 
   Many of the so-called experts said that the Gators would not be able to repeat as champions. However, all throughout the season, Coach Billy Donovan kept his team focused and on track and eventually proved the pundits wrong. The Gators were chasing history, so to speak, and they would not be denied.     
   The Gators finished their season with an impressive 35-5, winning the final 10 games of the season. Furthermore, my colleagues, they have an 18-game winning streak in the post-season, including sweeps at the Southeastern Conference tournament the last 2 years and a 12-0 in the NCAA tournament. 
   By winning the championship, Coach Donovan became the 12th coach to win multiple men's basketball championship and one of four active coaches to win multiple titles. He also became the third youngest coach to win more than one NCAA title. 
   Now, Florida's overall athletic program has proven to be one of the best in the Nation, now having won 21 national championships in all sports combined. Ten Gator athletic teams turned in top 10 finishes in 2005-2006. Florida is one of two schools to appear in the top 10 in each of the last 23 national all-sports ranking. 
   I appreciate your indulgence here as I brag a little bit more. Gator athletes excel in the classroom as well. UF boasts a 91 percent graduation rate among its athletes, making it only one of four programs in the national all-sports top 10 to achieve a graduation success rate above 90 percent. Furthermore, in the 2002-2003 season, UF placed a record of 193 student athletes on the SEC academic honor role, making six consecutive years UF placed 100 or more student athletes on the SEC honor role. 
   The University of Florida is more than just athletics. It ranks fifth among Kiplinger's top 10 colleges and is among the Nation's most academically diverse public universities. It is home to 16 colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. And during the 2005-2006 school year, they awarded a little over $500 million in sponsored research to do such things as to find diverse research in health care, citrus production including the world's largest citrus research center. 
   In addition, my colleagues, more than 300,000 Gator alumni are located throughout the world. Famous alumni include two current NASA astronauts, actress Faye Dunaway, and home improvement expert Bob Vila. Just a little bragging there. 
   UF's faculty are among the best and most decorated in the world, winning  awards such as the Fields medal, two Pulitzer Prizes, NASA's top award for research, and the Smithsonian Institution's Conservation award. Along with the faculty, the Gator students are among the brightest. UF admitted about 1,049 international baccalaureate students for the 2004-2005 academic year, more than any other university in the world. 
   So the Florida men's basketball team are excellent representatives of both the university and the great State of Florida in their focus, their persistence, and unassailable desire to succeed. I take great pride, my colleagues, in representing the University of Florida in Congress and congratulate Coach Billy Donovan and the entire university on this great accomplishment and hope for the best for next year. Go Gators.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the Senate gave overwhelming unanimous consent for General Petraeus to implement his strategy in Iraq. We all agree, on both sides of the aisle, he is the best we have. In fact, he has written a manual dealing with terrorists. 
   So why do the Democrats want to withdraw funds to support him starting the first of July? Even as we speak, the troops have to reallocate funds and prioritize their missions, because they don't have the full funding. In fact, they will run out of money shortly. So why do the Democrats not allow General Petraeus to do his job? General Petraeus intends to report back in September with a complete report on how we are doing. That is a very short amount of time, in fact, 5 months away. 
   He deserves a chance, and he deserves full funding for this Congress through the fiscal year 2007. So I urge Congress, after the President vetoes this bill, to come back and give a clean bill so that the President can get full funding for our troops, at least through fiscal year 2007.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, last Tuesday, Secretary Jim Nicholson resigned from his position at the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
   As a highly decorated combat veteran, his experience in the Army for over 22 years gave him insight into the needs of veterans. He has implemented many reforms since assuming the leadership of the VA in February 2005. He established electronic medical records for the nearly 8 million people in the VA health care program. This enabled the successful transition of veterans from hospitals damaged by Hurricane Katrina and Rita. 
   In addition, Mr. Nicholson improved care for veterans with brain injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder, mandating screening of all returning veterans for signs of PTSD, and adding mental health services at more than 100 medical centers. 
   Secretary Nicholson also hired suicide prevention counselors at each of the VA's 153 facilities and established a 24-hour national suicide prevention hotline. 
   I want to thank Secretary Nicholson for his commitment and leadership, and wish him well in his future endeavors. God bless him.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the Democrats' so-called emergency supplemental. This cynical bill uses our troops as a political bargaining chip for additional billions in unrelated, pork barrel spending, which has nothing to do with winning the global war on terrorism. This bill has become a Christmas tree of pork. 
   I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, what does $25 million for spinach growers, $74 million for peanut storage, and $50 for the Capitol Power Plant have to do with winning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
   Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the list of unrelated spending goes on longer than I have time. 
   Spinach producers and peanut farmers may very well need and deserve the money. And I am sure the Capitol Power Plant needs improvements, but why in this bill? Why is this money not being considered through regular order or subjected to normal budgetary rules, like PAYGO? And most importantly, why at the expense of our troops? 
   This important spending bill is being used as a vehicle to micromanage the war and score political points. Our troops deserve better. We need to focus on getting the equipment to our troops on the front lines and get away from political posturing. 
   However, this bill is not about the troops. It is about politics. It is about tying the hands of the commander-in-chief because some in this body do not agree with his policies. 
   People on both sides of the aisle can certainly agree that mistakes have been made in Iraq and a change of strategy is long overdue. However, what should this change of strategy be? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leave the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk? Or do we need a new strategy to win the war and finish the job? 
   While no proposal guarantees success, a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. support would guarantee failure. The stakes are too high to fail in Iraq. It remains in America's strategic interests to ensure regional stability in the Middle East and to deny terrorists a safe haven in Iraq. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. Furthermore, I hope that the House leadership will bring up a clean bill that focuses solely on supporting our troops and not one filled up with pork and unrelated spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CHARLIE NORWOOD DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 1808, to name the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia after my good friend and colleague, Charlie Norwood. I served with Representative Norwood for 12 years here in Congress, and was honored to work alongside him. This principled man did not hesitate to stand up for his conservative principles, even if it meant criticizing his party. 
   Charlie was an intelligent and respected man, both in this House and in his hometown that he ably served. He was an amiable man full of a love for life and with a wisdom that he had earned through experience. I was never surprised when in Committee he would comment on an issue with particular insight and concern for the complexities involved. 
   It is fitting that a VA Medical Center be named after this courageous man, especially since he himself had served our country with  distinction in the Armed Forces. Representative Norwood served as a Captain in the United States Army from 1967 to 1969, beginning with an assignment to the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1968, he was transferred to the Medical Battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam, and served a combat tour at Quin Yon, An Khe, and LZ English at Bon Son. During his tour, he participated in experimental military dental practices that are now standard procedure for the armed forces. Charlie Norwood was one of the first participants in the Army's outreach program that delivered dentists to forward firebases, instead of the previous practice of transferring patients to rear treatment areas. Interestingly, he also provided some of the first field-based dental treatment of military guard dogs, and assisted in non-dental trauma care in Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals. 
   In recognition of his service under combat conditions, Representative Norwood was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. After Vietnam, Charlie was assigned to the Dental Corps at Fort Gordon, Georgia, where he served until his discharge in 1969. He remained a member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the WorId Wars until his recent tragic death. 
   I was honored to serve with this effective Representative from the 10th district of Georgia, was strengthened to draw from this intelligent individual's wealth of knowledge and insight, and have been blessed to know this vibrant and caring man, Charlie Norwood, as a friend. I support honoring his memory by this designation, and urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, recently the Speaker has indicated that she intends to appoint a special task force, a select committee, to investigate global warming. The committee I serve on, Energy and Commerce, has jurisdiction on this matter and, in fact, we have had a hearing on this subject on July 27, 2006 in our oversight subcommittee. We investigated the so-called hockey stick effect. The hearing showed that there is a lot of information on global warming and that this is a very serious issue. But I question the need for another committee when the Energy and Commerce has full legislative power to continue to investigate and legislate. The committee the Speaker has designated will duplicate what is already in place with the longstanding expertise on the Energy and Commerce. In fact, as the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee recently said, ``We are just empowering a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs to go around and make speeches and make commitments that will be very difficult to honor.''

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, affordable and reliable energy is an important component of continued economic growth. It heats and cools our homes, facilitates the means of production, and fuels our transportation system. However, politics, not sound energy policy is driving the legislation before us today. 
   The tax provisions targeted for repeal in H.R. 6 are designed to encourage new capital investment in U.S. energy projects, and they are fulfilling this goal. Their repeal will discourage new domestic oil and gas production and refinery capacity, threaten American jobs, and make it less economic to produce domestic energy resources--thereby increasing our dependence on imported crude oil and refined fuel products. A recent economic analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers confirms: 
   ``Higher taxes on the U.S. activities of the oil and natural gas industry, as would result under H.R. 6, would be expected to reduce U.S. exploration, production, and refining activities and increase U.S. dependence on foreign oil. This outcome is in sharp contrast to long-term energy goals for a Nation less reliant on imported energy sources.'' 
   These results run directly counter to sound energy policy goals and, by diminishing energy supplies, would strike a blow to U.S. energy consumers. 
   Provisions in the bill affecting the deep water royalty relief program will set back the significant gains in oil and gas production that are attributable to the program and discourage new domestic production. This program has been one of the most successful policy stimulants for U.S. oil and natural gas exploration and production. It has contributed to a nearly 400 percent increase in natural gas production and more than 100 new discoveries. 
   The real impact of actions taken in this bill will be felt by our Nation's manufacturers and every day consumers of energy. The higher energy taxes will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher gasoline and home energy prices. Similarly, heavy users of oil and natural gas, such as manufacturers and their customers, will feel the pinch of these higher prices and the effects of higher gas prices will ripple throughout the economy. 
   This legislation would give an unfair competitive advantage to foreign energy firms by placing tax increases squarely on the shoulders of domestic energy producers. This will encourage domestic energy companies, which employ 1.8 million Americans to move those jobs overseas. 
   America's energy future is too important to risk a rush to judgment, and H.R. 6 represents a significant step backward for our Nation's energy security. Imposing new costs, whether in the form of taxes or fees is contrary to the goal of providing stable and affordable energy supplies for American consumers.  
   America's energy consumers deserve a sound energy policy that will not hit them with unnecessarily increased energy costs. This legislation is a poor substitute for a real energy policy. I urge my colleagues to reject this punitive energy legislation and to decrease our dependence on foreign oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (DO-NOT-CALL IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 3541, the Do-Not-Call Improvement Act, and I thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania and Mississippi for their initiative here of making a good bill even better. This legislation simply removes the requirement from the Federal Trade Commission to automatically remove consumers' phone numbers from the registry. 
   My colleagues, the original act would have required consumers to re-register their phone number every 5 years and was intended, in part, to keep the list accurate and up to date. This will result in tens of millions of Americans being dropped off the list each year contrary to their intention. Millions of Americans would have to re-up, so to speak, to stay on the list. Most of them, in their day-to-day life, would be unaware that their number is about to expire. 
   So, this bill does a great service. This bill corrects this and would make numbers on the registry permanent, but at the same time require the Federal Trade Commission to keep the list accurate by simply removing invalid and disconnected phone numbers. As further assurance of this, the Federal Trade Commission must study and report to Congress on the accuracy of these numbers. I think that's important. And we mentioned that earlier in the bill, that we're going to have the Federal Trade Commission come back with a report to us. And this is a good area for the Federal Trade Commission to come back and talk about the accuracy of these millions and millions of numbers. So, I applaud my two colleagues for doing that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his support on this important bill. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 2601, the Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007. As the sponsor of the legislation and as ranking member on the committee with jurisdiction over the Federal Trade Commission and over consumer protection, I can assure the Members of the body that this is a necessary piece of legislation. It will have an immediate and meaningful impact on our constituents. I can remember when we marked this up when I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection and we started this whole process rolling. 
   The national do-not-call registry was enacted by Congress to provide citizens the ability to place their home phone numbers on a list that prohibits unsolicited phone solicitations. My colleagues, unfortunately, the authority of the Federal Trade Commission to collect fees to maintain the registry has expired. This legislation simply restores the commission's authority to collect the necessary fees to maintain and update the registry and provides businesses with certainty on the fees that they pay to access the registry. 
   The bill also includes input from both the Federal Trade Commission and industry. We asked for their support. Substantively, the amended legislation provides permanency for the program through a consistent fee structure. This will help both business with predictability of fees and help the Federal Trade Commission excel by providing certainty of funding for this popular program, and this obviously makes budgeting far easier from year to year. 
   The legislation also provides for certain biannual reports by the Federal Trade Commission on the effectiveness of this registry that will provide Congress with the necessary information to provide adequate oversight, and that's important too, Mr. Speaker. 
   As the gentleman from North Carolina has mentioned, the popularity of this program has been very high and success of the do-not-call registry was confirmed by almost every member of our committee and their district. Many of our constituents still express their gratitude for enacting a simple law like this, the original law in providing a means to stop unwanted commercial solicitation over their home phone. 
   For those who avail themselves of this option, and remember now, if people out there want to use it, they have to call the toll-free number to get it, but the people who avail themselves of this have expressed satisfaction. They have experienced a noticeable decrease in phone calls interrupting their dinner and their family life. 
   So I am proud to be a sponsor of the reauthorization legislation. It's important that the act and the list continue in effect. This is one example where our actions received near unanimous bipartisan support here in Congress. Here we are with the omnibus budget bill and all the controversy, but here is a good example of bipartisan support. It brings in both the public, industry, and the Federal Trade Commission. So I am confident that the reauthorization of the Do-not-call Act is supported by millions of Americans who have placed their number on the list. So I urge all Members to support and vote for this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (IRAN'S MANIPULATION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Members of the House, Senate and the media should obviously be aware that Iran, a neighbor that shares decades of vibrant history with Iraq, is heavily involved in shaping the future of Iraq through illegal activities. 
   The president of the Strategic Policy Consulting company here in Washington, DC; Mr. Jafarrzadeh, recently stated, ``Al-Quds Force of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards is stepping up terrorism and encouraging sectarian violence in Iraq.'' Now this is a man to listen to when it comes to Iran. He is the Iranian dissident who first revealed the existence of the clandestine nuclear sites in Iran in August 2002. He says that Iran's goal is to create insecurity to compel coalition forces to leave in order to establish an Islamic theocracy in Iraq. 
   Iranian forces have been heavily involved in sending arms, ammunition, IED materials, training militia and sending its own intelligence agents into Iraq since 2003. My colleagues, it is a sad twist of irony; Al-Quds now coordinates insurgent attacks on our forces in Iraq from the national headquarters in Iran out of the old U.S. Embassy building, the same building where American diplomats were held for those horrific 444 days that began in the year 1979. 
   One of five Iranians arrested by U.S. forces in a raid on Iran's consulate in a city in northern Iraq on January 11 was an envoy of the former Iranian President. The man, Mr. Sharoudi, is wanted in Austria on charges that he took part in the assassination of an Iranian Kurdish leader and his aids in Vienna in 1989. This historic leader of Iranian Kurds was killed in an apartment in the outskirts of Vienna when he was scheduled to meet a delegation from Iran. According to the Austrian police, the killer escaped arrest by hiding in Iran's embassy in Vienna. Austrian sources claim that the Iranian president, Ahmadinejad, was the logistics head of the commando groups responsible for the Kurdish leader's death, and Sharoudi was one of the killers. It is curious, then, that this same man was recently found operating with four other Iranians in northern Iraq. 
   There is also an Al-Quds force in Iraq under the command of Mehdi Mohandes. According to a recent Washington Times article, it was Mohandes who was responsible for the attacks on the U.S. and the U.K. embassies in Kuwait in the eighties. Interpol placed Mohandes on a wanted list in 1984, and since then Mohandes has remained inside Iran's borders--until now. The new terror network which he commands in Iraq is curiously named Hezbollah, a deliberate linkage to Lebanon's own terror movement with which Mohandes has connections. The Iraqi network operates in Basra and Baghdad. Members are trained in military and terror tactics in Basra, and they receive armed shipments there that were smuggled across the border from Iran. 
   To maintain this network, obviously it is expensive, has a huge cost. According to the Washington Times article again, Brigadier General Abtahi of the Iranian Revolutionary Forces in southern Iran send millions and millions of dollars from a small border town in Iran into Iraq every month. My colleagues, we have little hope of success in Iraq if we neglect to address this growing interference by Iran. 
   In related news, the Iraqi President has changed his stance and has publically pledged to fight terror and insurgent groups within Iraq, whether they are Sunni or whether they are Shi'a, which includes the Sadr militia. In turn, this has motivated Sadr forces to end the boycott from the Iraqi government, a move towards greater participation in the political process there. My colleagues, it is a hopeful sign that perhaps with greater political participation, the popular support of the terrorists in the Shia community will decline. 
   We must maintain this diplomatic and military pressure against these terrorist groups and on the Iraqi government to fight them. There is no hope of success in Iraq as long as Iran is allowed free reign to interfere and despoil the Iraqi government's efforts. 
   I support the President's acknowledgement of this growing threat and urge him and my colleagues in Congress to work together to provide the  material support to our service men and women on the ground they need to combat it.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (MEDICARE PART D--WASHINGTON POST'S TAKE -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, two weeks ago the House passed a bill to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate with drug companies on the prices of pharmaceuticals for the part D drug program, H.R. 4 was the bill. 
   In my district, I have heard overwhelmingly good news about the existing part D program. For a striking example, there was a letter to the editor from one of my constituents on September 21, 2006 in the Gainesville Sun. Mrs. Vernell James wrote this letter. She and her husband, both in their seventies, married for 58 years, wrote, quote, ``Medicare part D has been a great experience for our family. Health insurance is important because it helps us stay well and live a quality life. My husband is on three different medications, so good health insurance is something we need. 
   ``The Medicare Web site made it simple enough to choose a plan and sign up. Now that the November 15th deadline is approaching, seniors need to be thinking about which plan is best for them. We save nearly $250 a month because of Medicare part D on our medications, and we are looking forward to continuing savings next year.'' 
   I have met this lady, and she impressed upon me how this benefit has given them healthy coverage, and more importantly, peace of mind. But don't take my word for it or the word of this lady; I found no more convincing arguments than what was recently in the two editorials in the Washington Post. One appeared November 2, 2006, and one the day after the bill, H.R. 4, passed, January 13, 2007. 
   Because of the prominence of this newspaper to policymakers around this town, I would like to share these editorials with my colleagues. 
   On what grounds does the Post disagree with the Democrat bill, H.R. 4, which involves price fixing? First, the same point that many of us may have heard on the House floor during the debate, but unfortunately not in committee because the bill failed to go through regular Democratic order. On comparing Medicare to VA, Veterans Affairs, the VA ``can do this because it is free to deny coverage for drugs whose makers refuse to provide discounts. Fully 3,000 of the 4,300 medicines covered by Medicare are unavailable under the veterans' program. Restricting the list of coverage drugs saves money, but it also reduces the quality of the benefit; 1.5 million veterans are sufficiently unhappy with the result that they opt to buy the more inclusive Medicare coverage.'' 
   Well, they are not the same creatures at all, these two programs. I have the background to know, I have been a member of the Veterans Committee for 15 years; I served on the Health Subcommittee on this Veterans Committee. In fact, I chaired the VA Health Subcommittee in the past. 
   Next: Why do this at all when the private insurance market is keeping premiums costs low for beneficiaries? As the Post went on to write, quote, ``the Congressional Budget Office estimated this week that savings from direct negotiations would be negligible, the average monthly premium has fallen since the program began a year ago. Private insurers can do this precisely because they are free to establish formularies, but market discipline ensures that these lists are not unappealing narrow. The insurers need to keep customers.'' Emphasis added. 
   Further, the Post wrote, quote, ``The Democrats' stance is troubling because it suggests an excessively government-led view of health care reform. The better approach is to let each insurer offer its own version of the right balance to see whether it attracts customers, and then adapt flexibly.'' 
   I have been extolling the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program as a model for over a decade. FEHBP works well precisely because the Office of Personnel Management administering it does not micromanage the program, does not set prices. It simply sets the terms of allowable plans, and then offers Federal and Legislative branch employees, including Members of Congress and the Executive Branch, the cafeteria of options, and they go forth and they choose what is best for them.  
   On November 2, the Post echoed this endorsement of consumer freedom writing, ``Retirees have a choice of insurance plans with widely varying costs, and some are faced with decisions on how much to spend out of pocket. If they choose to pay top dollar for branded medicines, the incentive to invent new medicines will rise. If they prefer to save money, incentives for innovation will decline a bit. Either way, a balance will be struck that reflects broad social preferences.'' 
   My colleagues, the Democrat bill, H.R. 4, that was passed, not through the democratic process here in Congress, but put on the floor without amendments, will not help the part D Medicare prescription drug program, it will hurt it. If you don't believe it, read these editorials of the Washington Post.

   I come to the House floor as a result of a town meeting I had in my congressional district in which I heard from the Harvest Christian Church. It goes to the point that the United States and India, as all of us know, are the world's two largest democracies. However, although the Indian National Government guarantees religious freedom, in many of the provinces, oppression and persecution still exist. I want to bring that to my colleagues' attention this morning. Harvest Christian Church in my home district has worked closely with many church groups in India. And, as I mentioned, during my last town meeting, Pastor Crowe shared with me some of the disturbing things that are happening there. 
   On April 1, during Palm Sunday celebrations in Jabalpur, in the middle of their worship service, about 30 people from a Hindu extremist group--whose name literally means ``religious army''--came with sticks and started beating everybody, including the evangelist and the men and women and children who were in the congregation that day. The pastor was badly beaten and suffers severe head injury. These people were admitted in the hospital where people from that group went and threatened them. They decided to leave the hospital and are currently staying at undisclosed locations. The attackers remain unpunished for these crimes. In fact, that day no one from the government condemned the attack or sympathized with the victims or the terrorized Christian community, not to speak of offering any relief to the family that were affected by this terrorist group. The police authorities, though reluctant to name the forces behind the attack, announced finally the arrest of five persons. All were from a radical Hindu background and lived in the slums the pastor used to visit regularly. Persecution such as this is not uncommon in India, and these sorts of attacks are not isolated incidents. 
   My colleagues, in another example, a mob of around 50 Hindu extremists surrounded a house church the night of April 22 and began shouting derogatory statements at all the worshipers in the church. Terrified believers in the church shut the doors, phoned the local police and asked for help. Two policemen arrived and took two pastors to the police station. En route, a few activists began beating and insulting the pastors and four other believers who had accompanied them, as the police officers simply looked on. ``At the station, the police shouted at the pastors, and the extremists who were present made accusations that the pastors were forcibly converting people and inciting the people to stop doing Hindu rituals and to remove pictures of Hindu deities from their houses,'' George said. The tirade continued until 3 a.m., when the pastors were jailed, not being released on bail until April 25. The police inspector stated the pastors were charged with ``promoting enmity'' between different groups on grounds of religion and ``deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.'' 
   While there is ongoing violence against Christians in India, the good news is that it is endemic and the number of incidents are not increasing. The BJP is a Hindu political party, which was in national power until 2004 when the secular constitution party then came to power. However, they still retain positions of power in some states, and it is there where the majority of attacks against Christians occur. 
   According to the State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2006, ``The constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the government generally respects this right in practice. However, the government sometimes did not act swiftly enough to counter effectively societal attacks against religious minorities and attempts by some leaders of state and local governments to limit religious freedom. Despite government efforts to foster communal harmony, some extremists continued to view ineffective investigation and prosecution of attacks on religious minorities, particularly at the state and local level, as a signal that they could commit such violence with impunity.''  
   My colleagues, this is a situation that must not be tolerated. The frequency of these attacks and the lack of prosecution of extremists who perpetrate these crimes are in direct opposition to the most basic tenets of our democracy and surely the democracy in India. I urge the Indian Government to protect religious minorities and to take strong steps to enforce their constitutional laws regarding religious freedom in these oppressive provinces.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, when you look at this bill, the question you should ask: Has this been tried before and has it been successful? 
   Corn ethanol is not an efficient fuel, as mentioned by the previous speaker. Even if the Nation's entire corn crop was used for ethanol, it would replace only 12 percent of current gasoline use. Worse, taxpayers will pay twice for ethanol: at the pump; but, more importantly, billions of dollars for these dollars through subsidies. 
   When you go into the European Union, you ask, How is it working over there? Well, there is a report. October 2007 Report ``Leaping Before They Looked. Lessons From Europe's Experience With the 2003 Biofuel Directive,'' by the Clean Air Task Force states that a 2003 European Union mandate to increase and promote the use of biofuel has exacerbated some of the very problems it was designed to solve, driving up food prices.     
   So my colleagues, this makes the problem worse, driving up food prices, leading to increased deforestation in tropical countries, worsening global warming and increasing imports of bio-oils. 
   So this is a report from the European Union which is trying to do the same thing you are trying to suggest in this bill. It did not work there and probably won't work here in the bill. 
   Lastly, I would conclude that the cellulosic biofuel credits is really based on something that is totally not science driven. 
   So I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (DTV TRANSITION ASSISTANCE ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   My colleagues, I rise in support of the DTV Transition Assistance Act, the Senate bill, S. 2607, and urge its immediate passage. 
   By setting February 17, 2009 as the date for full-power broadcasters to transmit exclusively in digital format, the DTV legislation gave industry the needed incentives to prepare for this transition. 
   The result, 91 percent of broadcasters are transmitting in digital; 68 percent are already on their post-transition channel and 68 percent are already broadcasting at full strength.     
   As of April 30, 2008, 78 percent of households had all their televisions prepared for the transition, and 91 percent of households had one or more televisions that were prepared for this transition. This means that with more than 9 months still to go, about 10 percent of households were relying exclusively on analog over-the-air broadcasts and needed to take action to receive programming after the transition. 
   Because low-power translator stations are not required to transition to digital television, our original DTV legislation created a $10 million grant program at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, to help translators convert digital broadcast signals back to analog. 
   As it turns out, not many requests for money from the conversion fund have really been made. Moreover, even if every translator participated in the program, it looks like we will still have money left over. Therefore, this bill allows some of the $10 million to be used for DTV consumer education, but only if the NTIA determines that not all the money will be needed for the converter box program. 
   The original DTV legislation also created a second grant program making $65 million available to help low-power stations voluntarily upgrade to digital broadcasting. At the time, it was believed that low-power stations would not upgrade until after full-power stations transitioned in 2009. Consequently, money from the $65 million upgrade fund was not to become available until 2010. It now appears low-power stations intend to upgrade sooner, so this bill makes the upgrade funds available in 2009 instead of 2010. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill that will give the NTIA additional flexibility to help ensure that the DTV transition goes as smoothly as possible. I strongly support this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to also support it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise also in strong support of H. Res. 1260, supporting the goals and ideals of National Internet Safety Month. This legislation is very important, and of course, it's quite timely. I urge my colleagues obviously to support it. 
   The Internet, as we all know, has revolutionized communications, business, and entertainment. Much of its success is due to the largely unregulated status that we have given it. Industry has done a tremendous job of deploying it, including to children, who increasingly rely on it to learn and to create things. 
   In the United States, more than 35 million children in kindergarten through grade 12 have Internet access, and 93 percent of children between 12 and 17 years old use the Internet. But just like any other technology, it is sometimes used by bad people to do bad things. 
   Recent studies show that sexual predators, cyber bullies, cyber stalkers, and identity thieves represent very real online dangers for children of all ages. According to the Crimes Against Children Research Center, 22 percent of people targeted by online predators were children with ages between 10 and 13. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reports 25 percent of children say they've received unwanted sexual material while simply surfing the Internet. The Identity Theft Resource Center reports that children are the newest target for identity theft, since they can be easily persuaded to divulge personal information, and the crime is unlikely to be discovered until the victim is much older. As these numbers demonstrate, Internet safety should be of paramount concern to all of us. 
   Furthermore, these statistics highlight why online safety education is so very important. By arming parents and children with the information, we can go a long way to avoiding some of the pitfalls out there on the Internet and obviously maximize its benefits. 
   That's why I support National Internet Safety Month and this resolution, and I urge its support. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CHILDREN'S GASOLINE BURN PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, it's a great opportunity to see you in the Speaker's chair today. 
   I would like to commend, obviously, Congressman Moore for his dedication and his determination to move H.R. 814, the Gasoline Burn Prevention Act. He has been, Madam Speaker, and as my colleague knows, the chairman of the committee has been tireless in his efforts to ensure portable gasoline containers are fitted with child-resistant caps, and that is simply what this legislation does. This bill mandates that all portable gas cans sold in this country be equipped with child-resistant caps. 
   I'd like to note, however, that mandating the standard is not a substitute for preventing access to gasoline. In fact, all prepackaged gas containers are required to be sold with child-resistant caps. And empty gas containers, which this legislation addresses, are now sold with such caps as a matter of compliance with a voluntary industry standard. Let me repeat. The industry has complied with this on a volunteer basis. The very standard that this bill adopts, industry has voluntarily complied with and set up themselves or in compliance with State environmental laws requiring child-resistant and spill-resistant caps. 
   As a consequence, I'm just a bit concerned about this legislation. Not, obviously, because of its substance, but simply because of the precedents that we have here, Congress, how we will treat industry who voluntarily step out, set their standards, comply with it and do it themselves. So when the industry is in compliance and did so voluntarily, why does the United States Federal Government need to get involved? Requirements of the Consumer Product Safety Act establish the CPSC should only promulgate a standard when no industry or other standard exists, or when an existing standard is inadequate or is not being complied with at large. But, again, industry in compliance; did so voluntarily. So why does the United States Government have to step in? 
   I'm concerned that we'll send a message to industry that even when you do things correctly, you adopt the standards voluntarily, and you comply with them, Congress will not hesitate to intercede, turning an industry standard into a commission rule while bypassing the requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act. 
   Now, think about that. They adopt the standards, they comply with it, they do it themselves; Congress still intervenes and adopts what the industry put as a standard as part of a bill here. If turning industry standards into agency rules becomes regular practice around here, it could severely diminish the willingness of industry to develop standards on their own because, be careful what you ask for. The industry will say to themselves, lo and behold, we work hard, we developed this voluntarily, this standard, bingo. They come back and they might take the standard, and not only take the standard, but the standard plus one, plus two, plus three. 
   So I worry that these additional layers of regulation liability, and of course there's liability when the Federal Government steps in, on the manufacturing industry, particularly when the industry complies, simply complies with the industry standards, are unnecessary in many cases, and often contribute to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs because of the concern about liability. 
   Now, having said all that, Madam Speaker, expressing my concerns of the unintended precedent, I obviously support this bill because the bill, in effect, is a reasonable effort that may, perhaps will, reduce danger to children. And so for that, Madam Speaker, I commend Congressman Moore. I just think it establishes a precedent that we, on this committee, Commerce, Consumer Protection and Trade, have to be careful about. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (VIRGINIA GRAEME BAKER POOL AND SPA SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, this bill, the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, as the chairman mentioned, simply aims to prevent tragic drowning and entrapment accidents that of course are entirely preventable with the addition of some simple equipment at a modest cost, I think we all agree. What we have here I believe is significantly different and significantly improved over what was initially referred to our committee. So, again, in a bipartisan fashion, I think we've improved the bill. So I commend the chairman for including some of the modifications that we suggested and some of the modifications that came from his staff. 
   My colleagues, this legislation has two distinct components: one, it adopts an industry standard on drain covers; and two, it establishes a grant program administered by the Commission designed to provide incentives to States to change their State laws regarding pool safety demands. These incentives, through these grants, the States will change their laws. 
   I fully support the intent of this measure, and I will, therefore, support the drain cover standard. I would like to reiterate the concern I expressed during consideration of the bill earlier, that of turning voluntary industry standards into commission rules. Without repeating what I said earlier on one of the previous bills, I again simply caution my colleagues about the unintended precedents our actions today may put in place. 
   Further, I would like to express my reservation about the pool safety grant program and its effect on a States' rights to regulate property and safety within its own borders. This piece of Federal legislation mandates that States adopt specific safety standards and no other. Mr. Speaker, there are 38 States with pool safety laws on the books today. None of these States, my colleagues, including my home State of Florida and the State of California, probably the two States with the most swimming pools and the most stringent pool safety laws, will be eligible for the $25 million in grant funds unless they change their existing laws, making this essentially a 12-State grant program. 
   The laws mandated by this legislation are overly prescriptive and may even weaken the safety laws of some States. Some of us may disagree on this, but that's what we could possibly consider. Holding Federal tax dollars over the heads of State lawmakers to urge them to change in their States their laws to a proscribed standard may not have any effect. We hope it does. If a State opts to change its laws, a change will unfortunately and indiscriminately raise the cost of compliance for all pool owners, regardless of whether they have children or not. 
   I note that the Commission itself expressed concern about the grant program. The CPSC does not have experience in ministering any grant program, and Mr. Speaker, it's not staffed to do so. 
   Now, notwithstanding those concerns that I have just expressed, I voice my support for this bill today and for its author, DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ, who did a very strong, persevering job on this. It came through committee when I was chairman and we tried to make changes. I appreciate her patience, and I look forward to supporting her, and I commend her for her perseverance. 
   We are going to support the bill because it will undoubtedly improve swimming pool safety by requiring that all drain covers sold in the United States be made in accordance with standards to prevent entrapment. This is very good. These horrific entrapment accidents are entirely preventable. It is my hope that this legislation will result in such prevention and avoidance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (PRODUCT SAFETY CIVIL PENALTIES IMPROVEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. This is a straightforward bill, and we support it on this side. Of the four consumer product safety bills that we have on the floor, we feel this is the one that is the most straightforward and, obviously, we support and we speak in favor of it. 
   My colleagues, go back to 1972. The House passed the Consumer Product Safety Act. At that time the penalty was simply $500,000. Now let's leap ahead. Adjusted for inflation, what is that equivalent in today's dollars? About $2.5 million. However, the original penalty maximum in the CPSA was not indexed to inflation; so $500,000 as years went by up to 1990 was a pretty paltry amount over this period of time. And then in 1990 it was indexed to inflation so that the current civil penalty maximum is $1.825 million. 
   The chairman would indicate that is a small incentive for companies out there. I submit that the penalty is not the big product for companies. It's bad PR. If you are a Wal-Mart and you have a product that is defective or you are a toy manufacturer, the penalty is going to be a deterrent, but the big deterrent is you won't be able to sell that product if those products have to be recalled and everybody knows that your  company has manufactured a defective product. 
   I support the ability of the Consumer Product Safety Commission to penalize those who willfully, willfully violate the act. At the same time, we are not sure whether the effect of an increase in potential penalties to as much as $10 million will have the desired effect. 
   I can support this measure, however, because there are three key factors when you look at this bill. First, the increase in the penalty maximum will be phased in, thanks to the chairman and his staff and our staff working together. Two, this measure amends the CPSA to include specific penalty assessment factors. And, three, the measure directs the CPSC to promulgate rules interpreting these factors and delineates how the commission will assess the fines. 
   My colleagues, this last factor in particular is important to our business community. Interpretive rules are necessary to provide guidance, clarity, and some predictability to regulate industries. Additionally, interpretive guidelines will provide a constant framework within which the CPSC may act. $10 million is too great an amount to not act responsibly, I agree with the chairman. That is a deterrent, and consistently imposing such fines is important.     
   But again, I point out that the larger deterrent for corporations is the fact that the publicity will be damaging to their sale of future products. 
   So, I would commend the chairman for his leadership in updating the CPSC on this matter, again, for his staff working with us to create, I think, a bipartisan work product that all of us, both Democrats and Republican, can support. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (DANNY KEYSAR CHILD PRODUCT SAFETY NOTIFICATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, this bill aims to improve  the recall process of children's products such as toys and furniture by requiring the inclusion of a product safety registration card with each product at the point of sale. The program is modeled on the car seat registration program mandated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, better known as NHTSA. 
   Now, my colleagues, this legislation creates a new mechanism for keeping consumers informed of child product recalls. To the extent we can improve the recall process, we should, and we think it's a good idea. Parents should know as soon as possible, if they own a product that's dangerous to their child's safety. 
   Children have been injured by the continued use of a recalled product simply because the parents were simply unaware of the product's dangerous nature. Our hope is that this registration program will render these type of accidents preventable. 
   Now, my colleagues, of course children's products are often passed along to other friends or family members once their child is grown, outgrows its use. We all know that. We put it up in the attic, then we hear a friend at church says they have a new child and we bring down this particular product. So many products are donated to charity outlets for resale, or sold at secondhand stores, online or at yard sales. No registration program will reach these parents in the event of a recall. They'll have to depend upon media. 
   This legislation will attempt to reach these legacy owners by permanently marking each product with the manufacturer's name, model number and other information used in consumer product recalls. A parent can simply research the item on the Internet or call the manufacturer to verify a product's safety if he or she gets this product either in a yard sale or it's given to them by a friend. This is good. 
   To the extent this measure improves notification to parents of potentially dangerous products, all of us should support this bill. At the same time, we all know that nothing is more important to a child's safety than vigilant parental supervision. I hope the good intentions of this legislation proves effective for both the consumers who purchase the products and the companies who will have to maintain these databases. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, past experiences in the United States and Europe clearly shows that amnesty legislation only encourages further illegal immigration. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 required a criminal background check, payment of application fees, acquisition of English-language skills, and a civics requirement. Now, despite all those measures, the law failed to curb the influx of illegal immigration. 
   The Senate's immigration reform legislation embodies the same flawed strategy as the 1986 law. Any measures to enhance border security or to improve immigration services would be overwhelmed by a continued flow of both illegal border crossing and individuals who entered legally, but remain in this country past the period authorized by their visa. 
   To stop further illegal immigration, Congress should not grant these illegal immigrants in the United States any form of legal status that does not require them to leave the United States voluntarily and undergo adequate criminal national security and health checks before seeking to return.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, this is a very simple amendment and perhaps the majority might want to just accept it, so let me just explain.  
   The generation IV nuclear energy systems program is the next far, far generation program. We have been waiting and working for the generation III program. This is about the generation IV after that, which is 2030. There is a lot of money in this that is going to be used to develop energy far into the future, and yet we have in the present nuclear power program of 2010, we have need for this money here and today. 
   I point this out to my colleagues, particularly on that side of the aisle, that if we don't get enough money to the nuclear power 2010 program, power plants across this country will be forced to build gas and coal-burning power plants to meet the ever-growing energy demands of this Nation. 
   So if you really want to reduce greenhouse gases, I think you should support my amendment because you are basically taking this money, $20 million, from the generation IV nuclear systems energy account which has been funded at almost $80 million above the President's budget request, and you are simply transferring it to the nuclear power 2010 account which is funded almost $34 million below the President's budget request. 
   If the other side is willing to accept my amendment, I am willing to stop talking and we can proceed. If you are concerned about global warming and coal- and gas-burning, this will help our Nation move forward by helping the nuclear power plants in the near, near future instead of the far, far future. 
   Let me talk about the nuclear power 2010 program. It is intended simply to encourage near-term orders for advanced versions of existing commercial nuclear plants. Frankly, it is an integral part of the goal of constructing new plants in the next decade. 
   Approximately two-thirds of the new reactors use a reactor technology that depends on nuclear power 2010. Nuclear power plants generate electricity without producing or emitting any greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide. Nuclear power plants generate 73 percent of all carbon-free electricity in America and are an essential mitigation tool for reducing greenhouse gases. 
   If we are serious about addressing the issue of global climate change, then nuclear power must be a critical component of any future energy and environmental strategy we have in this country. 
   With the additional funds in this amendment, the program for 2010, we could focus more on reducing the technical, regulatory and institutional barriers to the deployment of new nuclear power plants in the near term while still allowing a generous increase in funds for the generation IV program. So the money is already there for generation IV. So I am just asking a very modicum amount, taking from the generation IV and moving it to the near term, so that we can build these nuclear power plants. 
   I conclude by saying failure to meet the goals of the nuclear 2010 program could result in delays 1 year, 2 years, possibly 3 years, and create the possibility of an indefinite delay as companies attempt to meet the demand with other types of generation, including coal and natural gases. 
   I conclude and thank my colleagues for listening, but I think when you realize it is not very complicated, we are just taking $20 million from a generation IV nuclear research program that we have no results from and don't know anything about and moving them to a current program in 2010 and saying let's let the nuclear industry have this special advantage so we can combat global warming and we can make sure that we move forward with nuclear power generation in this country as soon as possible.

   Mr. STEARNS. Then the other question is, in Generation IV, the nuclear energy system by which you increased it $80 million, it seems to me, and you might want to answer this question, here you have a program that is a fourth generation of nuclear research. We don't even have the results from the second and third generation nuclear research, yet you're increasing a huge amount of money for something well into the future when you have a system, the 2010 energy system, which could use this money today and would go towards improving global warming and put less demand on all these nuclear energy companies because they certainly can't meet the demand in the next 2 years without burning coal and gas. 
   So I ask the gentleman, why would he want to increase something that's a fourth generation when the second and third generation have not even been successful in providing anything for us?

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my reluctant and continuing opposition to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, H.R. 1424--a bill that was hastily crafted, inadequately vetted, and has now been made worse by an infusion of tax extenders and narrowly targeted earmarks, costing taxpayers $812 billion as reported by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   This new bill is still flawed because its basic premise is that taxpayers have to take over these toxic loans from ailing institutions, and Secretary Paulson is still granted the unprecedented authority to purchase almost any troubled asset or financial instrument he deems necessary, effectively allowing him to become a financial dictator. Tax expert Ryan Ellis has rightly stated that with this bill, ``Congress is giving a member of the executive branch virtually unlimited power for the entire economy.'' 
   The bill today is very similar to the legislation that was voted down only a few days ago, but this time it contains frivolous add-ons. With the exception of the necessary increase of the FDIC insurance limit to $250,000, which I am happy to see included, this bill leaves little to be desired for American taxpayers. 
   To be specific, the Senate version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that we are voting on today contains both energy and non-energy related tax extender language, targeted earmarks, and mental health parity legislation--provisions which have no business being placed into a bill which is meant to rescue our economy from a financial meltdown. 
   The mental health parity bill that has been thrown into the 440-page Economic Stabilization Act federally imposes more financial responsibility on employers who are already struggling to pay for their employees' health insurance, and will come at an additional cost of $3.8 billion dollars. Further, the bill we are voting on today contains narrowly targeted earmarks which are being described as ``tax relief provisions.'' Buried within this 440-page bill is a temporary increase in the amount of rum excise tax revenue paid to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands; a 7-year recovery period for motorsports racetrack property; an economic development credit for American Samoa; tax benefits for fishermen and those who suffered from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill; and even an exemption for certain wooden arrows used by children. These provisions cost millions of dollars and are not paid for under this bill. Also included are nearly $42 billion in tax increases over ten years on oil and gas production, unemployment insurance, and investment income. 
   Madam Speaker, a bailout is still a bailout no matter which way you try to paint it. The American people understand full well that these targeted tax relief provisions were added for the sole purpose of winning votes, and today we are not voting on a clean bill. 
   I firmly believe there are viable, alternative ways to solve our deep-rooted financial problems without having to utilize a taxpayer-funded bailout strategy. Under this bill we have no way of determining how the Treasury Secretary will choose to price the toxic assets he will buy, and pricing them too low or too high will have serious repercussions. Some of our Nation's top economists along with my own colleagues have proposed far better solutions that would protect taxpayers and shore up our markets without rewarding Wall Street's bad behavior and putting us on a precarious path toward Socialism. I have personally proposed providing low-interest loans to these struggling financial institutions combined with giving taxpayers warrants so that they too can gain from any potential upside in our markets. I also support expanding the FDIC to cover all transaction accounts and put in place an oversight board that is separate from the Congress and the administration. 
   The issue of a lack of adequate oversight to protect taxpayers is truly worrisome. Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, points out that a plan which relies on the sole authority of the former chairman of a major investment bank to distribute billons of taxpayer dollars to struggling private sector companies will inevitably lead to corruption and crony capitalism. Further, Harvard political history professor Julian Zelizer has said of Paulson's unprecedented new powers: ``It ranks with the top list of delegations of power, especially since there's some flexibility for Treasury in deciding what to do with all of this money. 
   You don't like to give power over finance and taxes to people who are not democratically accountable like Congress is.'' 
   In a matter of 1 week we have gone from a 2 1/2 -page bill, to a 109-page bill, and now to a 440-page bill, but no matter the increase and attempt at improvement, the bill is still inherently flawed. I think it is unfortunate that we haven't taken the necessary time to more carefully consider our options and to re-evaluate some of the more troubling financial trends that have directly contributed to this historic crisis For example, I question why Congress hasn't addressed the issue of Credit-Default Swaps, CDS--a $62 trillion, unregulated market that threatens to be our next financial crisis. Warren Buffett describes these insurance-like contracts that promise to cover losses on securities in the event of a default as ``financial weapons of mass destruction.'' The CDS market is spiraling out of control as we speak, and the Chairman of the SEC has started to ask Congress for the immediate authority to begin regulating Credit-Default Swaps which are intrinsically linked to subprime loans and exotic securities, but Congress has not acted. 
   Certainly, the challenges that lie ahead of us are numerous and great. We are in the middle of a financial crisis of epic proportions, and I do hope the bill we are voting on today helps to shore up our markets and provide stability, but reluctantly I must oppose it. This legislation has been forced upon us by Secretary Paulson, and I question his ability to objectively implement the Treasury plan given his close ties to major investment banks and Wall Street. Surely Paulson's 25 years spent at Goldman Sachs and eventually becoming its chairman represents an overt conflict of interest. 
   Given the fact that taxpayers are getting toxic goods and there is no real reform of the Community Investment Act which has forced banks to make loans to people who have questionable credit and cannot afford to pay their mortgage back, I am voting against this bill, and I pray and hope the future will afford us a chance to craft a better bill on behalf of the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it is obviously with great sadness that we all honor the service of our colleague and friend, PAUL GILLMOR. 
   Paul and I came to Congress the same year. We were in the 101st Congress and we were both veterans of the United States Air Force. He obviously expressed a great love for this Nation, for this institution, and I believe sincerely he brought credit upon all of us. 
   This dedication was matched by his love for his family, his wife, Karen, his two daughters, Linda and Julie, and his three sons, Paul Michael, Connor and Adam. I express my deepest condolences to the family. 
   I had the opportunity when I first met PAUL to talk informally with him about his background. He said he was a leader of the senate. Coming from the private sector and not understanding the full significance of what that meant, I became acutely aware of what it meant when I heard him in informal sessions or in meetings where he had a presence about him, an aplomb, and also a sincerity, in which he would express his ideas in a way that would get to the meat of the issue and cut to the chase. And I realized during this, he could do it tactfully. He was not a partisan individual. He was bipartisan, in fact. I can't recollect on the floor him having a really partisan speech because I think it goes to when he was a leader of the senate, he understood to get things done, he had to develop consensus. So when he went to a meeting, he listened more than he talked and he also stepped forward with the idea of what we should do in a very nice way such that most people would say, Wow, at the end of the meeting, PAUL GILLMOR made the most sense. 
   Another vignette is when he was in the Speaker's chair. I watched when there would be a huge din on the floor, and somehow his voice rose to such a crescendo and also a pitch that he could pierce this noise and bring order and stability to the House here. I used to watch him also with great admiration on how he did this. It was a tribute to his leadership and also his background as leader of the senate. 
   So I come to the House floor to say his dedication and expertise will be greatly missed. He has had 40 years of public service. He established a long record of working for average Americans. God bless the Gillmor family, and God bless PAUL GILLMOR.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, an analysis of the accomplishments under Democrat control here in Congress for the 110th Congress has shown that not much has been accomplished. Let's take a look at it. There have been a thousand votes taken this year. When you look at those thousand votes, only 106 bills have been signed by the President. What are those bills? Well, 46 were naming of post offices, public buildings and bridges. Not much accomplishment there. And 44 bills were noncontroversial. Some were actually Republican bills. They had strong bipartisan support. 
   Fourteen of these bills were reauthorization of existing law that the Republicans developed and were just continuing. And two substantial, serious bills that passed this House, the FISA bill and the Iraq supplemental, passed without one member of the Democrat leadership supporting it. 
   That is all that has been accomplished, and I think the American people need to know. Lastly, not one appropriation bill has been sent to the President and the fiscal year is already over.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTERS -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I come to the floor to commend my colleagues' attention to a resolution that I recently introduced honoring the work of pregnancy resource centers. 
   According to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute, about half of American women will face an unplanned pregnancy, and at current rates more than one-third will have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old. Of the women who have had abortions, 90 percent indicate they would have preferred other options had they simply known about them. 
   The tragedy and irony in many situations is that most women are flooded with a pro-abortion message, but are rarely offered any other message of choice. Rather, unknowing clients are led to believe that abortion is the only solution to their problem. 
   Through costly advertising, young women go into abortion clinics and they are assured that help is only a few hundred dollars away. Harmful consequences of abortion are minimized or simply ignored. Alternatives, like parenting or adoption, are not encouraged; in fact, they are very rarely mentioned. Sadly, my colleagues, it is only later that they learn there are indeed alternatives. 
   Desperately trying to spread this message to young women are the 2,500 pregnancy resource centers across the United States. Through education and support, pregnancy resource centers meet women's emotional and physical needs. They provide one-on-one counseling regarding the facts about adoption, abortion and parenting so that the client may make a wise and informed decision about her pregnancy. Centers are dedicated to helping each woman resolve her situation in a way that equips her with better life skills for her future. Practical help, like parenting classes, support groups, education and job skill classes are offered through many pregnancy resource centers as well. Maternity clothes, baby needs and even temporary housing is also offered. Some pregnancy resource  centers have full medical services on their premises, and unlike abortion clinics, these centers offer support for women suffering from post-abortion syndrome. 
   For those women who have undergone an abortion, the devastation can be real and ongoing if she does not receive help. Most centers are committed to the healing, body and soul, of women who have suffered from an abortion. They offer medical and counseling services and stand alongside these women in the healing process. 
   Life-affirming pregnancy centers provide an example of love and compassion to women and their unborn babies. These centers have been upholding the values of all human life, born and unborn, for several decades. Women are increasingly turning to these centers for physical, psychological, emotional and of course spiritual help. They are always treated with the utmost dignity and respect and provided with accurate, up-to-date information in order to make informed decisions about their pregnancy, sexual health and relationships. Because everyone should have access to this information, all services are free of charge. 
   I am honored to represent one such center in my hometown of Ocala, Florida. The Women's Pregnancy Center has been serving the people faithfullly in Marion County for 22 years. This center serves nearly 1,500 women a year of all ages and backgrounds. They serve these women and men faithfully and discreetly. 
   My colleagues, in today's culture abortion is too often the first thought for women facing unplanned pregnancy, but there are alternatives, and pregnancy resource centers can provide them. These centers are not only the most strategic and effective, but often the most needed of the forces engaged in the defense of the unborn. It is fitting that we recognize these courageous and struggling agencies that seek to bring purpose to the surprises of life. Never are these needs greatest than in the smallest of family, a mother and her growing baby. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me in providing support for the more than 2,500 crisis pregnancy centers around the United States of America. The good work of these centers merits our recognition, and their compassionate staff deserve our admiration and praise. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this resolution and demonstrate their support for pregnancy resource centers and their tens of thousands of volunteer staff who are encouraging the protection and value of all human life in America.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the historic vote we are holding on the largest government bailout in our Nation's history. 
   I do want to applaud the legislation we have on the floor, because it is much improved from the 2 1/2 -page document put forth by Secretary Paulson. However, while I commend my colleagues on their bipartisan efforts to improve the bill and insure better protections for American taxpayers, I still have strong reservations. 
   Our Nation faces a growing financial crisis that deserves strong Federal intervention, and I had hoped to support a proposal to shore up our Nation's financial markets while protecting taxpayers. However, I believe this legislation takes the wrong course in supporting troubled financial institutions while simultaneously exposing taxpayers to excessive risk. 
   To begin, this bill comes with a $700 billion price tag which will be paid for by the American people. Billions of taxpayer dollars are going to benefit an indiscriminate number of private financial institutions that utilized reckless investment strategies. 
   Even more troubling than the cost of this bailout is a provision that allows foreign banks to participate in the Treasury's purchase plan. Under this bill, a foreign bank, such as the Bank of China, could sell a portfolio of toxic assets to a U.S.-headquartered investment bank and then that bank could sell those same assets to the Treasury Department. 
   Unfortunately, this bill deals exclusively with the asset side of these troubled institutions and does not address the key issue of liability. Furthermore, it is very possible that we will still face the risk of a run on our banks. 
   Having gone through the Savings and Loan crisis as a freshman Member of Congress in the 1980s, I can better understand ways we can address this financial crisis. In putting forward $700 billion in public funds, I would like to see Congress pursue a more deliberative process in identifying the ills affecting our financial markets. We need to hold hearings and call in the best financial and economic experts in the Nation and take a careful look at our alternatives. One plan I recommended was providing low-interest loans to these institutions combined with giving warrants to taxpayers so that they too can gain from any future upside. Furthermore, we should expand the FDIC to cover all transaction accounts and put in place an oversight board that is separate from the Congress and the administration. 
   It is troubling that under this bill the Treasury will be ceded vast powers. Secretary Paulson and successors will decide how $700 billion in taxpayer dollars will be spent, and may buy not only mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, but also any other financial instrument he deems necessary. 
   And while the bill does set up an oversight board, Mr. Paulson would be one of the five members of the Board monitoring his own actions. Thus, if Mr. Paulson wishes to use his authority to buy financial assets not linked to mortgages, he can do so after consulting with the Fed Chairman, but he does not need his approval or the approval of the Oversight Board. Granting a single person this much power over our financial future is not acceptable in a democracy. 
   The bill also gives the SEC Chairman the ability to suspend the accounting rules that require banks to report on the market value of their assets if he believes it is in the best interest of the public. The bill also allows the Government to purchase troubled assets from pension plans and local governments and small banks that serve low and middle-income families. This expands the intended scope of the bill to allow the government to buy the toxic debt of States, cities and municipalities in places like Detroit and Chicago. This begs the question--who is going to make the basic decision on what cities, States and municipalities are going to be rescued? 
   However, the heart of the problem of the bill we are considering today is that the Government should not be deciding the winners and the losers. The investors who made mistakes should be held responsible, and those who navigated the Federal distorted market should be rewarded for their wisdom and prudence. 
   If we, as Americans, believe in the viability of the free market system, we should allow it to work by not perpetuating a continuing bailout strategy that places immense risk on the shoulders of American taxpayers.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (TRUTH IN CALLER ID ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I request such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 251, the Truth in Caller ID Act of 2007. I thank my good friend, Mr. Engel of New York, for his work here; also the ranking member, JOE BARTON of Texas, for his leadership on this very important piece of legislation. 
   My colleagues, millions of Americans use caller ID in order to secure greater privacy for their families. Yet, as new technologies continue to be developed, caller ID spoofing, as brought out by the gentleman from Massachusetts, has become a problem for both consumers and businesses. 
   This bill protects consumers by prohibiting the deceptive manipulation of caller identification information, a practice which has been defined and is clearly delineated as ``spoofing,'' ``caller ID spoofing.'' 
   Now, this occurs when a caller masquerades as someone else by falsifying a number that appears on the recipient's caller ID display. The most important point about this discussion is that caller ID spoofing can make a call appear to come from any phone number the caller wishes. The increasing use of VOIP, which is voice over Internet protocol, that we see in America and other Internet telephone services, has made it much easier for people to make any number appear on a caller ID system. 
   In addition, several Web sites have sprung up to provide caller ID spoofing services, eliminating the need for any special hardware to replicate this. Although these caller ID spoofing services promote themselves for use in prank calls or for simple entertainment purposes, and that's what they propose only, they say, such services can be easily accessed and used by criminals.     
   So Caller ID spoofing has emerged as a useful tool for identity thieves and other scam artists. In addition, my colleagues, many business functions, from credit card verification to automatic call routing, depend on caller ID for security purposes, which spoofing can render useless. 
   So this bill, H.R. 251, prohibits sending misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud or cause harm. The Energy and Commerce Committee drafted the language in this bill so carefully that it will go after the bad actors but, at the same time, preserve the ability to manipulate the caller ID information for legitimate purposes, such as the protection for victims of domestic violence. 
   A woman is calling, let's say, from a shelter and she wants to protect her ID, or she doesn't want to disclose, get the phone number disclosed where she is. 
   A single mother at home, she should have the opportunity to block her phone number so people can't recognize that number and call her, harass her or even use it in a way to bring harm to her. 
   So my colleagues, this is an important piece of bipartisan consumer protection legislation. I urge all of you to support H.R. 251, the Truth in Caller ID Act. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The gentleman from New York mentioned about the harbinger of things to come, and I think that's what we are all worried about, so I think this is a great first step forward. 
   Just recently, my subcommittee, the Commerce Consumer Protection and Trade, which Mr. Rush chairs and I'm ranking member of, we did a do-not-call reauthorization, which is H.R. 2601. We dropped that bill last week. We urge the conference committee to mark that up and get that forward. It's part of the process here to protect consumers. 
   In fact, in the committee that I serve, we've done a lot of Internet consumer protection, so I'm very wholeheartedly in support of this, and I encourage some other bills. In fact, the gentleman from Massachusetts' Social Security bill, H.R. 948, is an excellent bill; as well as the Data Security bill, H.R. 958. So I think these are the types of bills we need to protect consumers, and I very wholeheartedly support them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the Iraqi National Assembly plans to take its regularly scheduled 2-month summer recess starting in July. Taking such an extended break demonstrates a lack of urgency on their part and political will on the part of the Iraqi parliament. 
   Defense Secretary Gates told a Senate hearing last month, ``I'll be blunt: I told some of the Iraqis with whom I met that we are buying them time for political reconciliation, and that every day we buy it with American blood. For this group to go out for 2 months, it would, in my opinion, be unacceptable.'' 
   Accordingly, I have introduced H.

I urge my colleagues to join with me in sending a message to the Iraqi parliament that they must work to fulfill their obligations.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from North Carolina and his comments and obviously thank our colleague from Illinois (Ms. Bean) for bringing this very important resolution to the House floor. I'm happy to rise in support of this resolution and emphasize, I believe, its important goals for my colleagues today. 
   As all of us know, the Internet is a wonderful tool for business, obviously for education, and for recreation. However, we have also learned the Internet can be a wonderful tool for not-so-wonderful different people. There are the general mischief makers, hackers seeking a cheap thrill, personal identity thieves that we know about and, most repugnant, stalkers and child predators. 
   But despite the plethora of information out there, many people are still unaware of the significant dangers the Internet poses to our children. Children themselves are often unaware of the danger, but are of a--well, you know, it won't happen to me--type of thinking. 
   That mindset can lead to trouble, and we've seen that in the NBC program, ``To Catch a Predator,'' in which  we've seen the insidious operations in which these child predators come in looking for the child, the teenager, and they're caught right on camera. So that camera has illustrated the problems that we have with the Internet and the dangers. 
   Not coincidentally, June is also the month many of our children leave school for 3 months of vacation and recreation. So we need to raise awareness of the danger to our children, to our parents, and that's why June is an appropriate time for National Internet Safety Month. 
   With less time in the classroom, these children spend more time obviously on computers. Parents are the first and most effective defense protecting our Nation's children. Most of us here in Congress are working parents. Our children are back in the district. We know we cannot look over them all the time, and perhaps the spouse is working also. So while we can't look over our children's shoulder every hour of the day, we certainly should put in place the software and the protection in our computer, as well as awareness of the child, of the insidious nature of the Internet and the evil people that are out there that are stalking our children. 
   So this resolution is meant to bring attention to the Internet dangers of cyberstalking, cyberbullying and cyberchild predators. In conjunction with our efforts, a number of organizations, both private and government, have launched public awareness campaigns with information related to National Internet Safety Month. I applaud the efforts of the multiple online safety organizations, industry-wide, and the Department of Justice's National Criminal Justice Reference Service for their efforts, and I think the American public should be aware that the National Criminal Justice Reference Service is available through the Department of Justice, and you can go online to the Department of Justice to find out more about this service. 
   The dangers of the Internet exist year-round and require vigilance in our defense year-round. At the same time, it is important for us to send a strong reminder to parents and children of the very threats of the Internet as our children begin their summer vacations and have more free, often unsupervised, time to explore cyberspace. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time,

The statistics bring home to all of us, particularly people that have seen our children grow up and use the Internet. 
   I would also suggest that she make available to all Members a copy of that bookmark. I think that bookmark is a terrific idea, and I think a lot of Members who have young children certainly could use that bookmark back in their district. Again, I think what she is doing is very important. 
   In the committee that I am ranking member of, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection, we have passed out of the subcommittee, the full committee, and in the House recently, the spyware bill, H.R. 964. This bill obviously is about spyware that's used to penetrate your computer and to find out different pieces of information about what you are doing that can be used for cyberstalking. 
   I want to applaud the House for voting overwhelmingly. I think it was over 360 Members voted for spyware. I urge the Senate to pass the spyware bill and bring it to conference, so that we can get it to the President's desk. 
   This would go also towards preventing the cyberstalking, some of the things we see here, and which we are seeking with Internet Safety Month. 
   Again, I thank the gentlelady for her efforts here.

   Mr. STEARNS. Good morning, Mr. Speaker. 
   My colleagues, the House passed the largest increase in veterans funding in the 77-year history of the Veterans Affairs Department. The bill provides more than $37 billion for veterans programs. This is a $4.4 billion increase over last year. As pointed out earlier, it has been over 130 days since the House passed the VA/Military Construction funding. Yet they have refused to appoint conferees like the Senate, their counterparts, have already done. So at this point the bill can't move forward and be signed by the President. 
   By the Democrats' failure to move forward on this bill, veterans are losing out on $600 million for posttraumatic stress disorder care, traumatic brain injury research and care; $4.1 billion to improve VA facilities, hospitals and clinics; and, lastly, $480 million for prosthetic research to help our wounded veterans retain a positive quality of life. 
   Mr. Speaker, we urge our Democrat colleagues to move forward on this bill and have it to the President so he can sign it on Veterans Day.

   I rise also in strong support for H.R. 4169, which would authorize the placement in Arlington National Cemetery of an American Braille tactile flag honoring blind members of the Armed Forces, veterans and other Americans. 
   My colleagues, our Nation's veterans have fought for our freedom, many at the expense of their health and well-being. Some of our veterans have not just lost use of an arm or a leg as a consequence of service, but now live in darkness from the loss of their sight. 
   In order to serve the needs of blind Americans, the Kansas Braille Transcription Institute created and designed a tactile American flag in Braille which would enable these blind veterans and other blind Americans the simple ability to see through the use of their hands the beauty of our American flag. 
   The flag has been specifically designed in a way that informs the blind of the full color of the American flag, 13 stripes and 50 stars on the blue field. Additionally, the tactile flag bears the Pledge of Allegiance in both raised print and grade one Braille. It is a plaque. It is not a traditional flag. 
   Mr. Speaker, I offer my full support of this great bill, the American Braille Flag Memorial Act. By placing the Braille American flag at Arlington National Cemetery, we do indeed bring honor to our Nation's blind veterans community and allow our blind veterans to see the American flag.

   I also rise today in support of H. Res. 963, supporting the goals and ideals of National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week, and for other purposes. I would like to thank my colleagues Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Miller of Florida for sponsoring this timely piece of legislation. 
   The President has designated this week, February 11 through 15, as National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Week. This week provides the American people the opportunity to thank a special group of men and women, the more than 98,000 veterans of the United States Armed Forces, who are cared for every day by the Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, outpatient clinics, domicilaries, and nursing homes across this Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution specifically shows the support of the United States House of Representatives for the National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans Program and its efforts to pay tribute to and express appreciation for these hospitalized veterans. The resolution also seeks to increase community awareness of the role of VA medical centers, and to encourage citizens to visit hospitalized veterans and become involved as volunteers. The resolution also encourages citizens who live near a VA hospital or clinic to just take time to visit and thank our veterans personally. 
   During my visits with veterans at the Gainesville, Florida VA Medical Center and my trip this past year to Ramstein to visit the troops at the hospital, I have also been inspired by the courage and honor that is displayed by these heroes. You will walk away feeling a whole lot better than when you came in, because you're so proud of what they've done. 
   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this resolution assures our Nation's veterans that we in Congress will continue to work with veterans service organizations to support our veterans with words, actions, and financial assistance. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 963. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 790, a bill commemorating the people of the State of Washington for showing their support for the needs of the State of Washington's veterans and encouraging residents of other States to pursue creative ways to show their own support for veterans. This resolution was introduced by my distinguished colleague from Washington (Mr. Baird). 
   It was particularly inspired by the Veterans Family Fund Certificate of Deposit, an insured account created through the grassroots efforts of citizens in Washington State to benefit military veterans and their families. The Veterans Family Fund Certificate of Deposit was officially launched on November 8, 2007. 
   When an individual purchases a Veterans Family Fund Certificate of Deposit from a participating financial institution, half of the interest is automatically donated to the State of Washington's Veterans Innovation Program. The Veterans Innovation Program was created to provide emergency assistance to help current or former Washington National Guard or Reserve servicemembers simply cope with financial hardships, unemployment, educational needs, and many other basic family necessities. 
   The initiative of the citizens of the State of Washington in creating this program is to be commended. Throughout the years, young men and women across this great Nation have answered the call to duty and taken up arms in defense of our freedom and that of others in this world. We should recognize the service of these veterans and encourage others to honor them by simply passing this bill today. 
   I would like to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for bringing this resolution so quickly to the floor for consideration today. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday tens of thousands of protesters protested on the National Mall the war on Iraq, and in particular, the 21,500 troop surge. These Americans exercised their first amendment right, and indeed, I am grateful to live in a Nation where we can protest government policies. However, my colleagues, I read in The Hill newspaper one troubling incident that arose. It says, 300 self-described anarchists spray-painted symbols and slogans on the west front steps of the United States Capitol building. 
   More puzzling, the article says that helpless Capitol Police officers watched, reporting that they were ordered to avoid confronting the group. It seems U.S. Capitol Police Chief Phillip Morse defends that the graffiti was ``easily removed'' and, most significantly, the building was secure from the artists' entry. 
   I am not sure I agree with such dismissiveness. Protected free speech does not include vandalism. I ask the Speaker to investigate. Peacefully assembling to protest is permissible, defacing public property is unacceptable and it should not happen again.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force. 
   America can rightly claim to be the greatest military power. This status is due in no small part to our overwhelming supremacy in air and space. Air Force men and women have produced an unsurpassed record of achievement. Never before has our ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities. 
   As an Air Force veteran and cochairman of the House Air Force Caucus, I know firsthand how the Air Force provides our Nation a unique military advantage. However, what is most impressive is the dedication of the men and women of the United States Air Force who work hard every day to ensure air supremacy. 
   Let me leave you with the words of one of the Air Force founders, General Hap Arnold: ``Air power will always be the business of every American citizen.''

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. And as a former Air Force officer and veteran and one of the co-founders of the House of Representatives Air Force Caucus, I know firsthand how the Air Force provides our Nation a unique military advantage, obviously, indispensable in war and peace, to know what is happening around the globe, to lend a hand with humanitarian assistance, to deter nations that would use aggression to bully their neighbors, and to defend our Nation when we are attacked and dealt a decisive blow to our foes. 
   But I bring to your attention, my colleagues, something that perhaps would not be talked about, that this supremacy could be threatened. And so I wish to, in this short amount of time talk about, although the Air Force has an overwhelming advantage right now, we are now at a point where a lot of the equipment is growing old. 
   Our Air Force flies the oldest aircraft that we have ever had to support, and they will be getting older and more costly to maintain if nothing is done to reverse this trend. 
   Both our B-52s, our KC-135s average 46 years old today. In 2030 they'll be 68 years old. Our A-10s average 26 years old today. In 2030 they'll be almost 50 years old. Though the Air Force is the youngest service, it has the most to lose in the fight against complacency. 
   Our Air Force is constantly in demand by combat commanders around the globe, but the size of our Air Force is the smallest it's ever been in decades. The Air Force had approximately 4,400 fighters in 1985. Today we have 2,500.     
   In 2030 it will have fewer than 1,400. Despite technological improvements, the Air Force cannot fulfill its global missions without sufficient force structure. Aircraft simply cannot be in two places at once, whether in Korea or Afghanistan or above New York City. 
   So for all of its immense accomplishments, the Air Force still faces formidable challenges as it enters the seventh year of the global war on terrorism. Losing our airpower edge is not a responsible option. We must ensure this does not happen. 
   In closing, let me leave you with the words of one of the Air Force founders, Five-Star General Hap Arnold. His words still ring true today and are especially poignant as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force: 
   ``Our Air Force belongs to those who come from ranks of labor, management, the farms, the stores, the professions, and colleges and legislative halls ..... Air power will always be the business of every American citizen.''  
   I rise today to honor and celebrate the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force. The Air Force is the world's dominant source of air and space power. America can rightly claim to be the greatest military power--a power that affords us prosperity and security. This status is due in no small part to our overwhelming supremacy in air and space. However, what is most impressive is the integrity and dedication of the men and women of the Air Force who work hard everyday to ensure air supremacy. 
   The Air Force is the youngest of our Nation's military branches. It is able to adapt in time and space by changing position. The effects the Air Force can achieve through perspective, range and endurance are those no other military instrument can execute. Our Nation's ability to gain an advantage over our enemies by exploiting air and space is unsurpassed. 
   The overwhelming advantages afforded to our Nation by the Air Force can be lost through inattention to modernization or by under-funding force structure. We are now at a point, after 17 years of continuous combat--from Desert Storm, Bosnia and Kosovo to Iraq and Afghanistan today--where our Nation's continued superiority in air and space is at risk. 
   Our Air Force flies the oldest aircraft that we have ever had to support--and they will be getting older and more costly to maintain if nothing is done to reverse the trend. Both our B-52s and KC-135s average 46 years old today; in 2030, they will average 68 years old. Our A-10s average 26 years old today; in 2030, they will average 49 years old. Though the Air Force is the youngest service, it has the most to lose in the fight against complacency. 
   Our Air Force is constantly in demand by combatant commanders around the globe but the size of our Air Force is the smallest it has been in decades. The Air Force had approximately 4,400 fighters in 1985, today we have around 2,500, and in 2030 it will have fewer than 1,400. Despite technological improvements, the Air Force cannot fulfill its global missions without sufficient force structure--aircraft simply cannot be in two places at once, whether in Korea and Afghanistan or above New York City. 
   Never before has the Nation's ability to project military power depended so heavily on air and space capabilities. Whether it is the principal actor or a supporting force, the Air Force brings to the fight unsurpassed air, space, and cyberspace capabilities--adding strength, flexibility, and resilience to the joint force. In many cases, other U.S. military branches would not be able to carry out their missions without the Air Force. 
   Much has changed over the years. The Air Force is flying unmanned aircraft over Iraq and Afghanistan controlled by airmen from bases in the United States and other remote locations around the world. Moreover, investments in air and space technologies have produced precision that would have been unimaginable even 15 years ago. Accuracy of weapons is now measured in mere feet from the target.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, as the body here begins the debate on the SCHIP reauthorization plan, separate from Medicaid, I would encourage my colleagues not to lose sight of the purpose of this program, which is insuring underprivileged children. 
   When we created this program in 1997, it was intended to provide health insurance for children at or around 200 percent of the poverty line. Today in States like Minnesota, almost 40,000 people are enrolled in SCHIP; 34,000 of them are adults. 
   The Democrats want to expand this program up to 400 percent of the Federal poverty line. This type of expansion would allow a family of four with an income level of more than $80,000 to be eligible for the SCHIP program in some parts of this country. 
   Let's get our priorities straight. We want to provide insurance for underprivileged children, not adults who can afford to pay for it themselves.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (Announcement by the Chairman -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Chairman, my amendment is very simple. My amendment transfers 10 percent or $25.5 million from AmeriCorp to the TRIO educational programs and the geriatric program. I have one of these programs in my congressional district, and I have a large university, two community colleges, so I thought it would be appropriate considering lots of time we talk about the loan process for the students, and particularly for low income, first generation college students, I thought it might be appropriate to take a very small portion of AmeriCorp and give it to these two programs. 
   I think we all know that AmeriCorp has done some good work. When we talk about volunteerism, we talk about people who go out and help people after natural disasters. We have a lot of that in Florida. We recently had a tornado in Lake County. A lot of the people in the district donated blood. They helped mentor schoolchildren. We teach English to new Americans, we teach illiterate adults how to read. We also have volunteers who go in and clean up rivers and forests. 
   AmeriCorp is a little bit different. It does have volunteers, but these volunteers, obviously, are paid. Remuneration in exchange for choosing to contribute one's time, energy and/or money clearly undermines the word ``volunteer.'' This is a different type of volunteerism. We have had a discussion whether it is necessary to pay volunteers. Paying people to volunteer sort of almost contradicts the spirit of the word, but we have sort of accepted that and the program has continued to flourish. 
   There has been some question that Members on both sides have sought to legislate whether AmeriCorp members could spend time with political activities, campaigns, faith-based initiatives or unions. That got us into some controversy and some rhetoric. If the Federal Government were not involved in what should be a personal preference in the first place, we wouldn't have to have these conversations discussing whether we should allow these AmeriCorp members be involved with political activities, campaigns, faith-based initiatives, or unions. 
   So I think when you look at the overall spectrum, I think the modest amount I am taking from AmeriCorp and putting into these two programs, I hope Members agree with me, it is worthwhile. 
   Take a little money, give to TRIO programs. They are aimed, as I mentioned, at low-income, first generation college students. Currently there are 2,700 TRIO programs serving nearly 900,000 low-income students across the United States. TRIO is critical to our Nation's commitment to advance educational opportunities at our colleges and universities and, as a result, obviously our Nation's economic future. 
   I have had the privilege of visiting several TRIO programs at schools in my district and had the privilege of hearing some of the wonderful success stories from these students. For that reason, I would like to give them a little more money. 
   Also across many districts like mine there are geriatric programs. So I am taking part of this money from AmeriCorp and putting it into geriatric programs, roughly $12 million. These programs are currently funded at the same level as the previous fiscal year. Included in these programs are educational centers which provide crucial physician, dental and mental health training programs for the care of our seniors. Current Federal funding will continue the support of about 50 geriatric education centers and the training of over 50,000 health care providers. This funding should be increased to provide more education and training for more health care professionals so we can meet our aging population's future health care demands. This is particularly true in Florida. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider putting part of the money from AmeriCorp into the geriatric educational centers. They have done a great job. 
   In my district we have three of these geriatric centers. At the University of Florida, where one center is located, it was established in 1987 to provide educational services for faculty and practitioners in the State of Florida. Their goal is to provide better care for older Americans. 
   I close, Madam Chairman, and urge support for my amendment so we can create better educational opportunities for underprivileged youth through the TRIO programs, and better ensure adequate and quality care for our seniors. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia. 
   Madam Chairman, I am just going to briefly respond to my two distinguished Peace Corps representatives. I know both of them have had ample experience understanding what the Peace Corps is all about. 
   When they came to Congress, we didn't have the AmeriCorps. In fact, the AmeriCorps is only a recent program here in Congress, and it's been funded continually every year. 
   I think this is a question not of the Peace Corps merits, but this is a question of priorities. And I think both of them would realize that the TRIO, which helps low-income students in college, is probably just as deserving, as well as geriatric education programs that are part of the amendment here which would get more funding. So it's only in terms of priority, and I think when you look at the two programs, I think they trump the AmeriCorps. 
   I just would conclude by giving you an example, perhaps highlight two outstanding participants in the TRIO programs that are from my congressional district. 
   A sophomore at Loften High School in Gainesville, Florida, Juliun Kinsey was one of only 30 students nationwide selected as a Young Entrepreneur of 2007 by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship for his unique and high-quality business plan. As a result, he received an all-expense paid trip to an awards banquet in New York City and a cash award. 
   Another example is Brooke Bostic, a TRIO program participant and a sophomore at Buchholz High School, which is also in Gainesville. He was one of only six students from Florida whose paper on global issues was selected for entry in the United Nations Association Student Paper Competition in New York City this spring. 
   So both these students benefited from the TRIO program. I think it has ample accommodation for us to say it has a higher priority when we take just a small portion from the AmeriCorps to use for this TRIO program. 
   So with that, Madam Chairman, I yield back to my distinguished colleague and thank him for the opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (EFFECTIVE JOB TRAINING FOR OUR RETURNING WARRIORS -- (House of Representatives - October 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, when our soldiers come home from combat, they often face an uphill battle. For many servicemembers, the transition from active duty to veteran status and returning to a full, meaningful civilian life is daunting, fraught with many challenging obstacles and bureaucratic barriers. Many times, these brave service men and women require job training but for entirely new careers. 
   Although statistics show that eventually veterans in general enjoy a favorable rate in the Nation's job market, many veterans obviously find it difficult to compete successfully in the labor market. That is why for over a decade the Federal Government has provided job training benefits to veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor. The mission statement for the Department of Labor Veterans' Employment and Training Service, VETS program, is to ``provide veterans and transitioning servicemembers with the resources and services to succeed in the 21st century workplace by maximizing their employment opportunities, protecting their employment rights, and meeting labor market demands with qualified veterans today.'' 
   Additionally, the Department of Labor offers servicemembers leaving the military with a service-connected disability the Disability Transition Assistance Program, DTAP. DTAP includes a 3-day workshop plus additional hours of individual instruction to help determine job readiness and address the special needs of disabled veterans. However, this is the identical DTAP program offered to all transitioning disabled veterans across this country. This 3-day program is valuable support, but it only provides general employment information and at no time addresses the specific needs of the community in which the veteran lives. Unfortunately, this means that frequently there is a void of information on local labor market conditions that result in veterans using their benefits to train for jobs that do not exist in their community. 
   Mr. Jeffrey Askew is director of the Marion County Veterans' Service Center in my hometown of Ocala, Florida. He said many veterans have used their Federal job training benefit for information technology (IT) career training. However, Ocala has little demand for IT professionals, and veterans are often advised to move to Orlando where there are many more opportunities for them. Upon finally getting settled back into civilian life, it is frustrating and unfortunate to say the least to be forced to uproot one more time and move your family to an unknown city. 
   I am concerned about this problem, but I think and I believe that there is an easy solution. That is why I introduced legislation to provide better information to veterans on their local job market needs. 
   H.R. 3646, the Veterans Effective Training Job Opportunities and Benefits Act of 2007, or VET JOBS Act of 2007, directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Labor to conduct a joint study on the greatest employment needs in various job markets around the country and post these results on the VA Web site. These results would then be updated annually to reflect the current and possibly changing needs in the local job market. With this tool, a veteran could plug in his or her zip code and see a list of the occupations that are most in demand, and subsequently use their Federal job training most effectively. 
   The Department of Labor already has the infrastructure in place for this kind of research, so this is a practical, low-cost solution. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has unofficially scored this proposal as having insignificant costs, insignificant costs for immeasurable benefits to our veterans. 
   I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort. Help our veterans today. Help them with their quality employment. Help them to find out where the jobs that they wish to be trained for are located, and support the VET JOBS Act that I ask for all of my colleagues to cosponsor.

The cost of Iraqi oil has skyrocketed in recent years up 250 percent since 2003. With these soaring oil revenues, the time is now for the Iraqi government to take greater responsibility for the security and reconstruction of their country and begin the process of weaning themselves off the largesse of the United States of America. 
   Recently, Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, announced that he was cutting $171 million in Pentagon funding for a police station construction in Iraq. This is a good first step towards ensuring that the Iraqi government understands that they need to show a real and sustained commitment to taking control of their country's destiny. By spending some of their record oil revenues, the Iraqis can send a definitive statement that they are serious about investing in their own future.

Chinese-made products have accounted for 60 percent of recalls this year, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. 
   China's small-scale food producers have been accused of unsanitary production, conditions, using tainted or substandard ingredients, and failing to register with the authorities. About 350,000, or 78 percent, of China's food processing operations employ 10 people or less. 
   Americans are rightly concerned when they learn many of the products imported from China pose a threat to their health. American consumers have grown to expect that the products they buy at their local markets are safe for their entire family. That is why it is vitally important for Congress to hold hearings on these issues to better examine how we can protect our constituents from substandard Chinese products.

   With their 41-14 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, as mentioned earlier, the Gators became the first Division I school to hold a national championship in men's basketball and football at the same time. 
   Coming into this game, many of the experts did not give the Gators any chance of defeating the previously undefeated Buckeyes. However, once they took the field, the Gators were not intimidated. In fact, the Gators held their own and held Ohio State to only 82 yards of total offense, the fewest number of yards in BCS history. 
   Notwithstanding this event, as my colleague on the other side mentioned, Ohio State had a very great season; and I congratulate and commend this wonderful football team and its coach  and all its players for a very successful season. 
   My colleagues, the Florida Gators are excellent representatives of both the university and I believe the great State of Florida in their tenacity, spirit, and their willingness to try to succeed. I take great pride in representing the University of Florida and congratulate Coach Urban Meyer and the entire university on this great accomplishment. 
   The university's accomplishments extend beyond the field or on the courts in the sports arena. UF boasts a 91 percent graduation rate among its athletes, including all of its sports, making it only one of four programs in the National All-Sports Top 10 to achieve a graduation success rates that is above 90 percent. Furthermore, in 2002-2003, UF placed a record 193 student athletes on the SEC academic honor roll, marking six consecutive years UF placed 100 or more UF student athletes on the SEC Honor Roll. 
   The University of Florida's accomplishments go well beyond athletics. It is ranked fifth among Kiplinger's Top 10 Public Colleges. UF's faculty are among the best and most decorated in the world, winning awards such as the Fields Medal, two Pulitzer Prizes, NASA's top award for research, and the Smithsonian Institution's conservation award. 
   University of Florida is also the first university in the world to be designated a Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary for its agriculture faculty's commitment to environmental and wildlife management. 
   Enrolling almost 50,000 students annually, UF is home to 16 colleges and more than 150 research centers and institutes. During the 2005-2006 school year, UF was awarded $519 million in sponsored research. This research includes diverse areas such as health care and citrus production, including the world's largest citrus research center. 
   My colleagues, one example of this innovative research is veterinarian Julie Levy, who is one of the worldwide leaders of research into a revolutionary, humane drug option for spraying and neutering cats and dogs. As it is now, the only way to permanently sterilized these animals is surgically. What if this process were as simple as a vaccine? Dr. Levy, at the University of Florida, is working on this research project today. 
   On both the field and in the classroom, the students, faculty, and administration of the University of Florida are champions. I am honored that this world-class university is in my congressional district and I look forward to many great things in the future. 
   As they say at the university, Go Gators!

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (FIRST COOLING, NOW WARMING -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   My colleagues, here is a quote from a Newsweek article: ``There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically, and that these changes may portend a drastic decline in food production, with  serious political implications for about every nation on Earth. The drop in food output could begin quite soon, perhaps only 10 years from now.'' 
   My colleagues, Newsweek published this dire warning in its April 28, 1975 issue, years before global warming began getting the headlines it does today. 
   Did Newsweek accurately forecast the coming of global warming more than 30 years ago? No. The article entitled ``The Cooling World'' warned that the Earth's climate seemed to be cooling to the point that populations around the world are in imminent danger because of the coming ice age. 
   Newsweek was not the only publication to warn about the supposed threat of global cooling during the 1970s. In an article entitled ``Another Ice Age?'' the June 24, 1974 issue of Time reported: ``When meteorologists take an average temperature around the globe, they find that the atmosphere has been growing gradually cooler for the past three decades.'' And Time's article did not predict a break in this decade-long cooling trend. 
   The article continued to warn that ``telltale signs were everywhere, from the unexpected persistence and thickness of packed ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward migration of warm-loving creatures like the armadillo from the Midwest.'' 
   Fortune magazine also gave warning. A February 1974 article entitled ``Ominous Changes in the World's Weather'' claimed that ``there is a fair agreement among researchers that the earth is now heading very slowly into another major ice age, such as the one that brought the glaciers deep into North America before it retreated some 10,000 years ago.'' 
   This article also pointed to the supposedly unusual weather patterns of the day as indication of much worse weather to come: ``Climatologists now blame those recurring droughts and floods on a global cooling trend. It could bring massive tragedies for mankind.'' 
   These days, of course, we no longer hear much, if anything, about the possibility of runaway global cooling triggering another ice age. Instead, we hear a lot about the threat of catastrophic global warming. Now, what happened? Well, the temperature trend changed. After dropping for about 35 years, the temperature started to rise in the mid seventies, although the global temperature now is only slightly higher than it was in the 1940s when the cooling trend began. 
   Over the centuries and millennia, the weather has changed, at times radically. During the 10th century, the Vikings established prosperous colonies in Greenland, having named the island for its lush pastures. By the early 15th century, however, these were wiped out by cold and hunger, and now four-fifths of Greenland lies buried under hundreds of feet of ice cap. No one blamed human activity for this climate shift or the ice age. 
   But in the seventies, some experts argued that human impact on the environment had grown to the point where their atmospheric pollutants were contributing significantly to global cooling, just as some experts argue that CO  
   2 and other greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming today. 
   Climatologists suggested that dust and other particles released into the atmosphere as a result of farming and the burning of fossil fuels were blocking more and more sunlight from reaching and heating the surface of the Earth. They projected that man's potential to pollute would increase six- to eightfold over the next 50 years. And as Reid Bryson stated in Fortune in February 1974, ``It is something that, if it continues, will affect the whole human occupation of the Earth, like a billion people starving.'' 
   Another of the concerned scientists was Dr. Stephen Schneider, the co-author of the Science report, who in the seventies was worried about the threat of global cooling. Now at Stanford University, Dr. Schneider not only sees things differently but is considered one of the leading experts now sounding the alarm about global warming. In a recent MSNBC report, Dr. Schneider argued that today's warming trend ``has been induced by humans using the atmosphere as a free place to dump our tailpipe waste.'' However, not everyone sounded the alarm about global cooling in the seventies, just like not everyone is sounding the alarm about global warming today. 
   Madam Speaker, the fact that so many experts were wrong about global cooling in the seventies does not necessarily mean that they are wrong about global warming today, but it does at least show that experts are sometimes incredibly, incredibly wrong.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan Protect America Act, a critical anti-terrorist law that closes loopholes in our intelligence laws and protects civil liberties is, once again, about to expire. The House must act today on this critical piece of legislation, which passed the Senate by 68-29. If this Senate bill is not passed in time, our intelligence agencies will be blinded to our enemies' plans and required to consult a lawyer before eavesdropping on foreign terrorists. 
   Democrats have had more than 6 months to make the Protect America  Act permanent and provide immunity to telecommunications firms that assisted our government and performed their patriotic duty after 9/11. The time for indecision and second-guessing is over. The time to get this important legislation passed into law is today. 
   House Democrats should pass the Senate bill and get it to the President, again, today.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, let me first of all agree with the Democrat from Oklahoma. He said this is a bad bill for the State of Oklahoma. This is also a bad bill for the State of Florida. Why is this bad? First of all, it is a giant tax increase. 
   Now, Mr. Udall has indicated that part of the reason this bill should be passed is because it stimulates the economy. I suggest when you stimulate the economy with an increase in taxes, you are not going to get the stimulation that you expect. 
   The Udall amendments proposes, as was mentioned, a one size that fits all States. Let each State work this out themselves. 
   Mr. Chairman, do all the Members realize that the Renewable Portfolio Standard does not include municipal solid waste? That does not qualify as renewable under the RPS proposal. In fact, a lot of the States that you represent use municipal solid waste. That is not even going to be part of this portfolio stand?. 
   This one size fits all is not going to work and does not take into account the nuances and the specific energy and economic needs of individual States. They are working on this themselves. We do not need this bill. Vote against the Udall amendment.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico. I appreciate his effort to support renewable energy and ensure clean, renewable sources of energy but this amendment is not the way to go about it. The Udall amendment proposes a one size fits all renewable portfolio standard RPS that would drastically increase electricity costs for Floridians and the entire Southeast without promoting investment in renewable energy generation. 
   Because of its design, the proposed Federal RPS imposes an unequal burden on States. Utilities located in areas of the country with poor renewable resources, like Florida, will be required to purchase credits from utilities located in areas with strong renewable resources potential, leading to significant wealth transfers out of Southeastern States. 
   This one-size-fits-all Federal mandate does not take into account the specific energy and economic needs of individual States by requiring that 15 percent of retail electricity sales be generated from specific renewable resources which are not prevalent in the Southeast. Because Florida and the Southeast lack sufficient quantities of such resources, utilities in our region would be forced to pay harsh penalties for noncompliance. 
   According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable resources currently account for only 3 percent of Florida's total electric generation. More than one-third of this power is generated from municipal solid waste, but municipal solid waste does not fully qualify as renewable under this RPS proposal. In fact, the majority of renewables currently used in Florida do not qualify under this proposal. Even if all existing renewable resources were included in the RPS, Florida would still have difficulty meeting the requirements given our limited availability of solar, landfill gas and virtually no wind power in the State. 
   And because Florida lacks the renewable resources as defined in this RPS proposal, this mandate would force electric utility companies to purchase renewable energy credits to meet the federal requirements. Since most of these credits would be purchased from the government and would not be based on actual renewable generation, it would essentially amount to an energy tax on all Floridians and anyone who lives in the Southeast. If Congress enacts a 15 percent RPS, this tax would cost Florida ratepayers billions of dollars and greatly increase the average annual energy cost to residential customers. In a report released by the Department of Energy in June 2007, the proposed RPS would cause residential customers to spend $7.2 billion more for electrtity. 
   Every single State public service commission in the Southeast, including the Florida PSC, recognizes this amendment will significantly raise electric bills for the ratepayers they represent. The Southern Legislative Conference, representing the legislatures of Southeastern states, has also recognized how unfair the Federal RPS is and has recommended that States be allowed to write their own standard. 
   In fact, 23 States already have an RPS tailored to fit their own available resources and energy needs and many more States are presently in the process of creating an RPS. Florida is one of those States. Governor Crist recently announced a 20 percent renewables program by 2020. However, he remains strongly opposed to a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate. It is Florida's position that individual States can best determine what is attainable in their State and should be allowed to set standards tailored to their specific capabilities and needs. I believe that renewable energy programs should be based on customer demand, regional differences, and appropriate incentives, not on unrealistic Federal mandates that selectively penalize electricity consumers in certain regions of the country. Regrettably, a Federal RPS mandate would impose significant additional costs to Floridians and the entire Southeast without providing any new investment in renewable generation within their State. 
   The Udall amendment will impose a giant new tax, while doing little to promote renewable energy, and absolutely nothing to lesion our dependence on foreign oil. I encourage my colleagues to oppose this one-size-fits-all RPS and vote against this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (DO-NOT-CALL REGISTRY FEE EXTENSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me thank, first of all, the discerning, clairvoyant, highly observant and eloquent statements from the gentleman from North Carolina for his kindness in recognizing that it is, indeed, my bill. I appreciate his very eloquent statement. 
   Mr. Whitfield was supposed to be here, but, of course, with the tornadoes, he cannot be here. He flew back to Kentucky to take care of his constituents, so he is to be commended for that. 
   But I rise today also in support of this bill, which is my bill which came through my subcommittee, the Do-Not-Call Registry Fee Extension Act of 2007. The Senate bill is 781. 
   As pointed out, this bill is identical to H.R. 2601 which I introduced and which passed this Chamber by voice vote under suspension of the rules on December 11, last year. As the sponsor of the companion legislation to the Senate bill and as the former ranking member of the committee with jurisdiction over consumer protection, I assured all my colleagues that this legislation is necessary and, of course, very timely. The gentleman from North Carolina mentioned that it is one of the most popular bills we have passed in Congress, and indeed it is. 
   I can also assure each of you that it will have an immediate and meaningful impact on our constituents, much more so than many of the bills that we've passed this year. 
   The Congress originally passed the Do-Not-Call Act in 2003 in response to the growing concern about the persistent invasion of unsolicited telemarketing calls to consumers' homes. Now, at that point I was chairman of the Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, and I took great pride that our committee came together with JAN SCHAKOWSKY, who was the ranking member, to put together the do-not-call registry. She is to be commended today, too, for her support and her enabling of this legislation. 
   The idea was very simple: Consumers could place their home phone numbers on a list, and telemarketers would then be prohibited from making unsolicited phone solicitation. In order to avail themselves of the tranquility afforded then by the registry, consumers simply call a toll-free number from the telephone line they wish to register, or they could add their number via the Internet. Telemarketers then access the registry at the Federal Trade Commission to obtain a list of registered numbers over the Internet and then remove their numbers from their call list. Pretty simple. These telemarketers then pay a simple fee for such access. It is those fees that fund the registry, including the maintenance and, ultimately, the enforcement of the violators of this legislation.     
   The program has been a huge success, as the gentleman from North Carolina has pointed out, with one recent polling finding there is over 150 million active telephone numbers on the registry. My colleagues, that's roughly 70 percent of Americans who avail themselves of the registry benefit. That poll also found over 90 percent of those registered with the do-not-call list do indeed receive fewer unsolicited telemarketing calls. 
   The Federal Trade Commission must also be commended for its part in making the registry a success. Without vigorous enforcement, a prohibition would be meaningless. Consumers who receive unwanted telemarketing calls log complaints via either a toll-free telephone number or the Internet. As a result, the commission has pursued 35 cases for violations of this do-not-call provision in the bill and has collected $25 million combined in civil penalties and equitable relief. 
   Unfortunately, the commission's authority to collect the fees necessary to maintain the registry expired last September. This legislation restores the commission's authority to collect the necessary fees to maintain and simply update the registry in a timely manner. Further, this act provides businesses with certainty into the future regarding the fees they pay to access the registry. 
   So, my colleagues, while this bill sets specific access fees, it also ensures Congress will receive the information necessary to assess in the future whether those fees are simply sufficient and appropriate. The Senate bill requires the Federal Trade Commission and the SEC to submit two reports to Congress biennially. One report shall include information regarding basic registry statistics such as the number of consumers registered, number of persons paying for access, and the impact of new telecommunications technology on the registry. The second report addresses consumer reports of abuse of registry exceptions, including the recent reports of ``lead generators,'' unsolicited mailers, and we've all gotten those unsolicited mailers through the mail, used to establish a business relationship. Then once that business relationship is established, they can come back and call you or otherwise they trick you into answering these little lead generators. And most frequently the people who do answer them are seniors, who are very conscientious, and then that, in fact, involves waiving their do-not-call protections. As time passes and people think of new ways to circumvent these protections, we will want to ensure we have the necessary information to keep pace with these folks that are trying to trick our constituents, thereby protecting their original intent of the do-not-call registry. 
   In conclusion, Madam Speaker, many of our constituents still express their gratitude for enacting the original Do-Not-Call Act, simply enabling them to make their home hours more peaceful without irritating telemarketing interruptions, especially around suppertime. The popularity and success of the do-not-call registry is without question. It is successful and it is one area in which this Congress has acted in a bipartisan fashion, almost unanimously on the House floor with approval. So I urge all my colleagues' support. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. faces a critical need to encourage domestic petroleum production. It seems as if the United States has unilaterally disarmed itself in the competition for energy supplies by imposing a host of unnecessary restrictions on domestic oil and energy production. Indeed, in the past three decades, we've thwarted construction of refineries and nuclear power plants that could have helped to ease the competition for energy supply and that could have secured greater energy independence for all of us. 
   Further, taxes on the major domestic oil producers lower incentives for new investments, and they add more costs to finished products at the pump. Furthermore, there is growing doubt that the recent rush to develop corn-based ethanol and other alternative and renewable energy sources will bring genuine relief or true energy security. By creating a bonanza for corn growers and agribusiness giants, we have succeeded in driving up food prices both in the United States and abroad. 
   American families deserve better from the Democrat-controlled Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it is never, never, justifiable to deliberately end the life, especially when there are alternative sources of stem cells that do no harm. 
   Proponents of embryonic stem cells state the greatest advantage is the pluripotency of these cells, cells with the amazing ability to grow into any type of cell in the human body. It is this unique adaptability that they claim makes embryonic stem cells more promising, more promising, than adult stem cell treatment of human diseases. 
   But my colleagues, the truth, however, is that embryonic stem cells have not, have not, produced a single viable human treatment for any disease, whereas adult stem cells have produced numerous therapies that have been successfully administered. Treatments derived from adult stem cells have been successfully treating patients for years, with measurable improvement in their conditions, and that is the real story.  
   Mr. Speaker, whether you believe that life begins at conception or not, the mere potential for human life needs to be protected--not destroyed. It is never justifiable to deliberately end a life especially when there are alternative sources of stem cells that do no harm. 
   Proponents of embryonic stem cells state the greatest advantage is the ``pluripotency'' of these cells, cells with the amazing ability to grow into any type of cell in the human body. It is this unique adaptability that they claim makes embryonic stem cells more promising than adult stem cells for treatment of human diseases. The truth however, is that embryonic stem cells have not produced a single viable human treatment for any disease--whereas adult stem cells have produced numerous therapies that have been successfully administered. 
   Treatments derived from adult stem cells have been successfully treating patients for years with measurable improvement in their conditions. Over 600 Americans were treated last year with umbilical cord blood transplants. After transplant these cord blood cells move deeply into the patients' bones and produce new blood and immune cells for the remainder of their lives. These cord cells literally give patients a new lease on life. 
   For example, researchers at the Burnham Institute and the Rebecca and John Moores Cancer Centers in San Diego found that pancreatic cells could be altered into insulin producing stem cells, foreshadowing a possible cure for both type 1 and 2 diabetes. 
   Recently, researchers at Wake Forest University and Harvard University reported that stem cells drawn from amniotic fluid donated by pregnant women hold the same promise as embryonic stem cells without causing harm to the mother or the fetus. 
   These stem cells are able to differentiate into fully grown cells representing the three major kinds of tissue found in the human body. Researchers also discovered that amniotic stem cells do not form tumors, a problem that commonly plagues embryonic stem cells. 
   The findings contained in this study point to a promising avenue of research that sidesteps the hurdles facing embryonic stem cell research. Moral objections to the destruction of embryos occurring when cells are harvested are avoided because no embryos are destroyed. 
   The Washington Post recently stated, ``The new cells are adding credence to an emerging consensus among experts that the popular distinction between embryonic and adult stem cells is artificial.'' 
   With more than 4 million U.S. births a year, it would not take long to collect the estimated 100,000 amniotic donations necessary to provide enough cells of sufficient genetic diversity to provide compatible tissue for virtually everyone in the United States. 
   I also want to remind my colleagues that the current ban on embryonic research does not prevent private funding for embryonic stem cell research. Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Newport Beach bond trader Bill Gross are among several private donors who have provided millions of dollars toward embryonic stem cell research.  
   In fact the Federal Government has spent over $161 million dollars on existing stem cell lines where the embryo had already been destroyed. The bill before us today advocates the further destruction of new life to expand human embryonic stem cell research. This research on NIH-approved embryonic stem cell lines accounts for 85 percent of all embryonic stem cell publications published. 
   Adult stem cells have provided human treatments, have a lower rate of immune rejection in patients, and show less likelihood of tumor formation. We should aggressively pursue this avenue of research. In seeking new treatments for the ills of humanity, let us also strive to protect the future of humanity, We too must uphold the first tenet of the Hippocratic oath--``First do no harm.'' 
   It is unnecesary and morally offensive to force all taxpayers to pay to expand embryonic stem cell research. I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (STEROIDS IN SPORTS -- (House of Representatives - February 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I'm a big sports fan. I have had the opportunity to play sports in high school and in an industrial league. I played it in the Boys Club back in 90-pound football. And I think, like most of us, we understand that the vast majority of stars today were a testament to true hard work. They were determined to succeed and often times under difficult situations. Their performances, victories, records and careers seemed to capture the straightforwardness of honesty, hard work and integrity that is based upon the heart of sports today, at least in the past, the ideal that sports a llow success based upon merit, whether it be on the court, the field or the track. 
   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, the scourge of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs is not simply a footnote in the history of sports in America. Steroid use goes much deeper, to the basic integrity of sports and all of athletics. At the most fundamental level, steroid use is just plain cheating. And furthermore, it is illegal. 
   Steroids are classified as a Schedule III controlled substance under the Controlled Subst ance Act. Those caught in illegal possession of steroids without a  prescription face arrest and prosecution. Dealers face a Federal felony charge and up to 5 years in prison. 
   Furthermore, steroid use involves significant health risks for all athletes who use them. Studies suggest that use of steroids can lead to stunted growth in adolescents, increased risk of heart and liver disease, as well as cancer and hormonal problems for both men and women. And that is why these and other factors demand th at our elite athletic organizations, both professional and amateur, establish uniform, world-class drug testing standards that are consistent and robust, just as our criminal laws are today. 
   However, the most worrisome development is that steroids are not only infiltrating their professional and elite amateur leagues, they are finding their way into middle schools and high school sports programs. In fact, according to the most recent Monitoring for the Future survey, funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 3 1/2 percent of high school seniors have used steroids with similar percentages for grades 8-10. 
   These are alarming numbers that represent just a part of the susceptible youth population that is out there. These estimates suggest that the high school steroid problem is just as great, if not greater, than it is in the professional leagues. 
   As any parent knows, high school is a trying time for many kids, let alone student athletes. These exceptional kids now face yet another hazard all the way to adulthood, that is trying to claim the safe haven of sports as its next growth market. 
   We must take an aggressive stand against this plague before these pressures lead young student athletes to use steroids, its destructive effects on honesty and fair play and ultimately, their very health and well-being. 
   And here and before the Commerce Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee last year, which I chaired in the last Congress, we heard testimony from a parent of a young man who tragical ly took his own life when that pressure to succeed, coupled with steroids, became too much. Unfortunately, these tragic stories are all too common. 
   Richard Pound, the founder and chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency says, ``Do we want our children to be forced to become drug addicts in order to be successful in sports? Like it or not, sports stars are heroes and idols to our kids. Our kids copy their heroes' behavior. That's why we have to encourage the stars to be good role models both on and off the field.'' Congress must continue to look into the use of illegal steroid and performance enhancing drug use. 
   Professional leagues have an obligation to be the gold standard with regard to education, detection and sanctions for the illicit use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. The recent scandals in baseball, the Olympics, professional wrestling and in other professional amateur sports have served to highlight the significance of the steroids problem. 
   Now, sometimes I'm asked back in the district why I care about drugs in sports. Shouldn't the athletes perhaps do whatever they want? They are only hurting themselves, is the reply. The use of steroids and performance-enhancing drugs by athletes today goes beyond just the integrity of the sport. By using illegal drugs, athletes are, in effect, telling our children that the only way to be successful and compete at the highest level is to cheat. That is not the message I want our children to hear.

With the Gators' 84-75 victory over the Ohio State Buckeyes, Florida remains the only school in the NCAA history to hold both the men's basketball and football championship titles in the same year.

   Madam Speaker, House Resolution 1287 would provide commendation to the Honor Flight Network, its volunteers and donors for enabling World War II veterans to travel to our Nation's Capital to see the World War II Memorial created in their honor. 
   Honor Flight Network was initially conceived in 2004 by Earl Morse, a physician's assistant and retired Air Force captain, to simply honor veterans he has taken care of for the past 27 years. Its sole purpose was to fly veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit the memorials dedicated to honor their sacrifice. 
   Today, Honor Flight Network has flown more than 800 World War II veterans to the memorial. It is a grassroots, nonprofit organization, and currently operates successfully in 30 States. My office has been involved in setting up three of these special honor flights for World War II veterans, and in June of 2007 I had the pleasure of partaking in one of these events myself. 
   The Honor Flight Network relies on support from volunteers and the funding from donors. These individuals help us to honor our veterans in return for all they have sacrificed to make this a better world. 
   Without the support of our volunteers, we would not be able to provide our heroes with the opportunity to fly to Washington, DC to see the memorial created in their honor. In reviewing the current legislative priorities for the Honor Flight Network, it is evident that their efforts have continued to supply support and recognition to World War II veterans through democracy.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (BAILING OUT WALL STREET -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it is also with great concern that I come before my colleagues to address a financial crisis of epic proportions. 
   Our Federal Government has taken drastic measures mainly in the form of a taxpayer-funded bailout in an attempt to put a stop to the complete deterioration of our financial system. 
   Just this weekend, the administration composed a comprehensive bailout to relieve private sector financial institutions and banks of their toxic mortgage assets to the tune of 700 billion taxpayer-backed dollars. 
   This plan increases our excessively high national debt to $11.3 trillion while also allowing foreign banks, which hold U.S. mortgage debt, to benefit from the billions provided by this bailout. 
   This plan constitutes the largest government bailout in history, yet it does nothing to protect the taxpayers. The Secretary of Treasury will have unlimited authority to purchase the most toxic of assets from any number of solvent, private sector financial institutions. 
   Furthermore, this plan comes in the wake of last week's $85 billion bailout of major insurance company American International Group and the Treasury's $200 billion bailout of out-of-control GSES Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
   Mr. Speaker, these bailouts come at a great price and expose American taxpayers to vast financial risk. Through these bailouts, our Federal Government is effectively risking hard-earned taxpayers' dollars to protect private sector companies that utilized reckless investment strategies with little regard to the consequences. Clearly, our financial and regulatory structures have failed us, and now the looming question on everybody's mind is, who is next? 
   Mr. Speaker, bailout after bailout is not a strategy, and it is certainly not a sustainable cure to our financial ills. These bailouts are an assault on American capitalism and have introduced a large degree of financial hazard into our economic system. 
   As an elected official, I am worried about this weekend's comprehensive bailout plan that gives the Secretary of Treasury unprecedented authority and virtually no oversight, aside from having to submit semiannual reports to Congress. This is unacceptable, and we must do something to protect taxpayers before adjourning this Congress. 
   Several years ago I became concerned with the financial picture of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, when as a member of the oversight subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I participated in the Enron hearings, and learned of the fraud and abuses perpetrated through accounting procedures. Moreover, I heard how Freddie Mac had also misapplied the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (FASB) standards for derivatives and hedging in its financial statement. 
   In 2003, as Chairman of the Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I held hearings on FASB accounting standards, including a hearing on Freddie Mac's fraudulent accounting practices. I planned on holding additional hearings on Freddie Mac's restatement, and developing legislation on accounting standards when jurisdiction over FASB was suddenly stripped away from my subcommittee and transferred to the Financial Services committee--seemingly the result of intensive lobbying efforts on Freddie's part. 
   I firmly believe, my colleagues, we need to establish congressional oversight of the Treasury, perhaps in the form of a commission that can monitor the transfer of this money, so that we may have better accountability and transparency as the government proceeds in bailing out company after company. 
   Additionally, we need better regulatory structures, and we should institute immediate controls to prevent massive short-selling of stocks which only further corrodes the market. And, further, we must ensure that the CEOs of these solvent, private companies do not walk away with millions of dollars in severance packages at the expense of taxpayers. Why not give taxpayers warrants for the upside in these companies that are being bailed out by taxpayers so that they benefit from this sacrifice? Unfortunately, this plan would put taxpayers at a risk for losses that belong to those companies that recklessly sought profits--profits for the stockholders and executives through dividends, salaries, bonuses and presumed stock appreciation. 
   I stress to my colleagues today, this is not a case of partisan politics. Our constituents' 401(k)s are at risk. The nationalization of private assets is inherently un-American. As free enterprising Americans, we need to let our markets determine the winners and the losers, not the United States Treasury. 
   Economists say we are in the midst of the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s, and yet the Democratic leadership intends on ending this 110th Congress on Friday. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have more work to do. We should not adjourn this Congress until we have a set of real solutions to work with, and these solutions should not involve risking any additional taxpayer dollars. I firmly believe that our Congress has a bigger role to play in ensuring that bailout and bankruptcy are not words the American people get used to hearing. We owe at least that much to the people who put us here.  
   The plan developed this weekend puts taxpayer dollars at risk with little or no benefit to those who pay the taxes, and I stand here today to firmly oppose it. 
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is a likely candidate to seek a taxpayer-funded ``loan'' or bailout from the government. This is particularly worrisome, given the fact that the FDIC exists for the sole purpose of insuring the deposits in our Nation's banks. If the FDIC's insurance fund continues to slip as bank failures persist, we may be facing another Treasury rescue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I request such time as I may consume. 
   Let me start out in this discussion of this bill, H.R. 6897, that Mr. Filner from San Diego has done a very exceptional job in his assiduous efforts to pass this bill. I admire him for his efforts. 
   I don't all together agree with him, and I will point to that in my speech, but this in no way implies that his efforts aren't appreciated for the Filipinos who fought for us in World War II and for those Filipinos who receive money who are not U.S. citizens because of this bill. 
   I would have to point out that he has said there are no benefits provided for the Filipino veterans. I have here an Overview of Filipino Veterans' Benefits, a report that indicates that, in fact, in 1946, $200 million was authorized to give them benefits. So his statement is not entirely accurate. 
   We do have a report of Congress that shows money was authorized, $200 million in 1946 was worth a lot of money. I think we should put that in perspective before we start discussing this further. 
   As pointed out, it is a lump sum payment to Filipino veterans of World War II subject to appropriations. Now, think about that for a second. There is no money in here authorized for this. This is subject to appropriation. They have to find the money. We don't know where this money, roughly $200 million, is going to come from. 
   I don't agree with the notion frequently put forth that there was a breach of promise put forth to the Filipino veterans by the United States Government, and that we must make some sort of belated payments to them for their service during World War II. The Congressional Research Service, as I pointed out, has provided an excellent objective and nonpartisan report on the Filipino veterans benefits from World War II. 
   It does not, as I pointed out, support the breach of promise theory that we often hear from my distinguished chairman and also, from a lot of Filipino veterans groups. Both the United States and the Philippine Governments are already providing benefits to many Filipino World War II veterans, so they are already getting benefits. 
   This bill is significantly different from the legislation that was previously marked up last July, H.R. 760, the Filipino Veterans Equity Act of 2007, and it also differs from the original language of the Senate-passed version of S. 1315. Both bills utilize funding from overturning the court decision in Hartness v. Nicholson to, among other things, pay pension benefits to Filipino veterans of World War II. 
   At least in that case they did attempt to find some money. So they had a legitimate way to get money to pay for this. That is not true in this bill today. It has taken out discretionary spending left to the appropriators, and the appropriators don't know where they are going to get the money either. 
   It's apparent from the legislation before us that my distinguished chairman took pause before moving forward. He listened, and this is a credit to him, he listened to the veterans service organizations who opposed the bill, his original bill. He listened to his colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and then he carefully drafted the bill that we have before us today. 
   It does not take money away from any other veterans group to pay for these funds, and it makes the payment of the lump sum subject to appropriation. This bill would authorize a payment of $15,000 for World War II Filipino veterans who are United States citizens and $9,000 for those who are not citizens of the United States and live in the Philippines. 
   I appreciate the committee accepting our ranking member, Mr. Buyer's amendment to the bill, which provides that payment of the lump-sum benefit would be final and constitute a complete release of any claim against the United States by those recipients that are covered under this legislation. However, World War II Filipino veterans would continue to receive benefits already awarded. 
   During discussions of the previously mentioned Filipino veterans equity bills, which utilized offsets from overturning the Hartness decision, Ranking Member Buyer had staff contact the various veterans organizations regarding the use of these funds. The American Legion, AMVETS, and NAUS, strongly opposed using the Hartness funds to provide for the Filipino veterans. That was then, that was back then. 
   While their positions vary regarding overturning the Hartness decision, there are other organizations such as the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Military Officers Association of America and the Gold Star Wives of America, believe that there are many higher priorities than additional benefits for Filipino veterans of World War II. 
   Why don't we talk about some of those higher priorities, because this is what the veterans service organizations feel strongly about. If you are going to give this money to the Filipinos, what about the higher priorities of these other people? How about improvements to the Specially Adaptive Housing Grant, the PVA; improvement to the Specially Adaptive Automobile Grant, PVA, increases to the mileage reimbursement rate, PVA and MOAA; increases in supplemental insurance coverage for disabled veterans, MOAA; increases to the DIC rate for American surviving spouses, GSW; increases to the maximum death benefit pension for the surviving widow of a veteran not entitled to a VA compensation, GSW. 
   Why, I would think, would we give $200 million for Filipino veterans who are not even U.S. citizens while not providing a priority for these? Obviously, there are many, many higher priorities that we as a Nation at war should be meeting. We should be devoting our available resources to meeting the needs of our veterans and the returning warriors that are coming back from Afghanistan and from Iraq. 
   Now, during last Wednesday's markup session, Mr. Buyer, the ranking Republican member of the full committee offered, and then he had to withdraw, a second amendment to this bill, which would have authorized $198 million to fund the VA veterans small business loan program that was terminated in 1986. Think of that, we could have, instead of this bill, we could have had the VA veterans small business loan program reenacted for all these veterans coming back from Afghanistan and from Iraq. Surely they could use this to help create jobs and start their own companies and provide for jobs for more Americans. 
   The program authorized VA to either guarantee a loan made by a vendor or make a loan up to $200,000 for a veteran-owned small business. Sounds like a good idea to me. The original program gave preference to disabled veterans, and Mr. Buyer added a preference for members of the National Guard and Reserves, who have been ordered to active duty in support of the global war on terror. 
   Each of us on this committee has veteran constituents who are also  small business owners, and many of these veterans are members of the Guard or Reserves. Unfortunately, one of the prices many of these dedicated citizen soldiers have paid is being forced to close their small businesses, or at least seeing their small businesses decline significantly while they are serving on active duty. 
   Obviously this program for small business loans that was terminated in 1986 was good and could have been done at a higher priority than the bill we have this afternoon. So, simply said, by authorizing a loan program for veteran-owned small businesses, we would have been responding to that unintended consequence of their willingness to serve their Nation. 
   While the amendment was withdrawn due to procedural issues, it received such strong interest among the committee members that Mr. Buyer plans to introduce the amendment as a bill, just simply, later this week. We will all have a chance to vote on it, and I encourage any interested Member to contact either the VA Committee, Republican staff, or to cosponsor Mr. Buyer's bill. We should be looking for ways to better assist our Nation's veterans, obviously, and I know you and everybody in this chamber agrees with that, to help returning warriors, instead of settling these questionable claims. 
   I urge my colleagues, when they consider to vote for this bill, to consider the priorities of all the veterans. I, for one, in good conscience, have trouble supporting the passage of this bill, particularly in light of what we are seeing here this week, with the Treasury asking to raise the debt ceiling, asking for $700 billion for Wall Street. 
   There are so many higher priorities for our Nation's veterans and for this bill. As I pointed out, we don't know where the funding for this bill is going to come from. With a price tag of almost 200 million, it's all subject to appropriations. 
   I conclude by saying while Filipinos of U.S. citizenship living in the United States will receive $15,000, we are giving $9,000 to Filipino veterans who are not citizens of the United States. If you take $9,000 based upon the cost of living in the Philippines versus what it is here in the United States, the Filipino veterans at $9,000 are getting a huge sum of money. 
   I can't, in good conscience say that this bill has a high priority than the ones we are talking about, and so I urge my colleague carefully look at this and to take into account the Overview of the Filipino Veterans Benefits report that shows they were authorized money of $200 million in 1946. Indeed, I think if you look at the priorities, you will see there are other priorities we should consider first. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STEARNS. This is sort of a compliment in a way. H.R. 760, which you offered, was for roughly $1.4 billion, as I recollect, give or take. This bill is for $198 million. So you are to be commended in your perseverance for trying to pass the bill, you have reduced the amount from $1.4 billion to $198 million. But I would say to you in all respect, is this the timing that you want in the middle of a possible financial meltdown in America?

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I request as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of this bill, S. 1315, as amended, the Veterans Benefit Enhancement Act of 2008. It's a modest bill. But it would enhance veterans insurance and housing benefits and improve benefits and services for transitioning for servicemembers. 
   The manager's amendment to this bill would remove the language in the original Senate-passed bill that would have overturned a decision made by the United States Court of Appeals for veterans claims in the case of Hartness v. Nicholson, that held VA must pay a special monthly pension benefit to severely disabled, elderly, homebound and poor wartime veterans pursuant to a law enacted in 2001. I'm pleased that this detrimental provision that would have impacted our most vulnerable veterans, has simply been removed from this bill. That's good. 
   The manager's amendment also removes all mandatory spending provisions in the Senate-passed bill that would have utilized the funding that would have been available if the disabled veterans no longer were to receive their special monthly pensions. 
   Now, what remains is a bill that is a compilation of numerous veteran benefit provisions. Among these, I'd like to highlight just a few that will benefit our servicemembers and our veterans. 
   This bill would ensure that severely disabled servicemembers can receive structural alterations to their homes prior to discharge from active duty. Right now, even if they know they are going to be discharged, they must wait until discharge to receive this very necessary housing benefit. 
   This bill would expand SGLI to include certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve for the first  time. It would allow the termination or suspension of cellular telephone contracts upon the request of servicemembers undergoing deployment outside the United States. That is good. 
   And finally, Madam Speaker, the legislation would improve the administration of veterans' education and employment programs and of the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. 
   Madam Speaker, passage of this manager's amendment will provide improved benefits to our Nation's veterans. These heroes have sacrificed so much for our Nation's, freedom and we must ensure that their needs are met. 
   So I urge my colleagues to support the bill as amended. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, the title of my 1-minute is called ``Taxpayers Sacrifice All and Receive Nothing.'' 
   The plan that developed this weekend for a comprehensive bailout of private sector financial institutions put taxpayers at risk with little or no benefit to those who pay the taxes. 
   This plan will put taxpayers at a risk for losses that belong to those companies that recklessly sought profits, profits for the stockholders and executives through dividends, salaries, bonuses and presumed stock appreciation. Instead, taxpayers who assume this risk should also enjoy an equity premium that goes beyond the return of their funds with interest for this bailout. 
   The taxpayers, after being awarded interest from their funds, as if they had invested in bonds, should have warrants as an equity kicker to sweeten their deal, giving them premium for their risk. Any institutional lender would demand as much and more. In this way, the taxpayers could share in the upside success of the companies that they rescue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a simple amendment that none of the funds made available in this act may be used by the Internal Revenue Service to implement a Spanish language version of the Where's my Refund? service. 
   Mr. Chairman, the English language has been one of the strongest, most durable ties that unites us all as Americans. Yet today our unity in the English language is undermined by policies that require government agencies to communicate in an increasing number of foreign languages. It is not just one, two, or three. In some of the cases, it is five, and six languages. 
   So I rise today to offer an amendment to strike language in the underlying bill that would mandate even more government multilingualism. My amendment would prohibit the IRS from developing a Spanish language version of the agency's Where's my Refund? Web site, which is currently only offered in English. 
   So think about that. As it turns out now, if you want to get a refund, you go to the IRS Web site, and sure enough, you can find out how to do it. English is right there. You go through the procedure and understand it. But now in the bill, they want to put it into Spanish. So I am just saying let's continue with the status quo and keep it in English. 
   Taxpayers should not be required to pay the cost of translating information so that people can demand a tax refund in another language. This is our country and we want to promote English, and I am sure most people that want to get a refund, of all things, would like to learn English so they can get their refund. Generations of immigrants have made great sacrifices to learn English and assimilate into this great American ``melting pot.'' This is what has allowed us to become the most successful multiracial and multiethnic Nation in the world. 
   Making exceptions now for another language I don't think is the right thing to do. It just assumes they are incapable of learning English like the previous generations. And many, many immigrants that came here learned English, and for all these years they have been able to determine what their refund was by going forward. So I think it is not a good idea to change this tradition. I realize that there are lots of people who don't agree with me, but I think we should have a vote on this to understand it and have the will of the House. 
   Now, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger knows something about the importance of learning English. He emigrated to the United States from Austria knowing very little English. He has said he immersed himself in American culture and made an effort to only speak English once he came to the United States. So he is a good example. 
   We should be encouraging immigrants to learn English, not enabling them by providing more and more government services in various foreign languages. It could be one language here, another language here, and pretty soon taxpayers are forced to deal with many, many languages just to get their refund. 
   Additionally, what makes Spanish speakers in this country more deserving than perhaps people from South Korea or people from Japan or people from China? I mean, is there one particular reason we are singling out this one language? If it is true we need to have this and I don't think we do, then I certainly think we should solve the problem of looking at all the languages. 
   The policy of our government should be to conduct official business in English and uphold the longstanding credo of ``E Pluribus Unum'': out of many, one. My amendment, I believe, simply would further this goal, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help preserve our national linguistic unity and strengthen our democracy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

We have lots of fun together. And I remember when he made those three pointers in the congressional basketball team how surprised, and pleasantly surprised, I was that he made them. So I'm respectful of that. 
   But I ask him, shouldn't government treat everybody equally? I mean, here you're talking about setting aside a special program, Where is My Refund program, under the IRS for the Spanish language. But I call the gentleman's attention to New York City. There are Chinese, almost 400,000 Chinese; 300,000 Italians; there are almost 250,000 Russians, there's 152,000 Frenchmen, Polish is a language there. The French Creole is about 100,000. Korean is about 86,000, German is about 86,000. In fact, the total number of people speaking foreign languages in his area, New York City, other than Spanish is 1.7 million people. So why shouldn't the government treat everybody equal is the question for you? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Ohio for his kindness. 
   We can wrap up this debate and I will just try to answer the gentleman from Massachusetts and the gentleman from New York here. 
   What can be more of an incentive to learn English? But the IRS program Where is My Refund? You would think if you are getting money back from the government, isn't that enough of an incentive to learn English? Maybe we should not have Spanish on the IRS Web site so we can get people to learn English. I mean, I would think giving them money back would be a great incentive. I would think you would be for this amendment because people who have to speak Spanish would have an incentive to learn English. That's my first point. 
   Second of all, the gentleman from Massachusetts says it's a minor cost. We don't know if this is a minor cost. But as we take his argument a little further, he says that I have no right to say there's another 1.7 million people in New York who speak other languages, and because the perfect is the enemy of good, we've got to give it to all these people, which is an argument that makes it confusing to people and say well, you have to vote against Stearn's amendment because we're not doing it for all these people. There certainly would be a cost if we went ahead and did if for 1.7 million various languages in Italian, Russian, French, Polish, French Creole, Korean and German. 
   And I ask the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano), why is one language selected to do this at the expense of another 1.7 million? Which goes to my point. We shouldn't do it for only one, we need not do it for any of them. 
   And so there is no reason to do the other languages here. They're getting money back. It would be very expensive if we did if for all the languages. And the cost here, we don't know what it's going to be. So I think the country is better off if we treat everybody equally. 
   The question you mention, Mr. Serrano, about CNN and other news organizations, these are private companies, they are not taxpayers funded. This is taxpayers funded. And I would think if a person is speaking French Creole in New York, he would like to have it in his language for the tax refund program, also. 
   So, I mean, you really make a difficult argument if you're saying it's just for people who are Spanish and you're not recognizing all of them, which goes to the heart of my argument, which is, basically the United States Government should treat everybody equal. The language should be the English language, and particularly when you're talking about the Where is My Refund program with the IRS. Vote for the Stearns amendment. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time I have left of my own and how much time I left of Mr. Regula? If that's possible to do that.

   So with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence.

Fanatic relatives of Shaymaa el-Sayed, 26 years old, attacked her in Alexandria, beating her, attempting to shove her into a car and vowing to kill her for her ``apostasy.'' 
   Police intervened. They arrested the victim herself. When they found her Christian identity papers, local police transferred her to a state security investigation office where the officials forcibly disrobed and photographed her naked in front of all the policemen at the station. 
   She was repeatedly subjected to interrogation and severe torture, including electrocution. She was released by the Egyptian police into the custody of her family despite their threats to kill her. ``This is not legal treatment, but it is happening all the time,'' said Rasha Noor, an Egyptian human rights activist. ``The Christians from Muslim backgrounds can't change their identities, so they are forced by the authorities to return back to Islam, or else.''

The Democrats are saying this is a great day, what a great day, when the Republicans started the SCHIP program. 
   Now, this bill, you have heard it all before. Obviously, it creates a new entitlement, crowds out private insurance with government coverage, offers perverse incentives to States; and, my friends, it contains a huge tax increase, with more on the way. Lastly, it punishes Medicare beneficiaries. This is very troubling, particularly in Florida. We have so many seniors that actually use Medicare Advantage. 
   The fact that they are going to eliminate this program to pay for this is really outrageous. It will disproportionately harm racial minorities and rural senior citizens by taking funds away from Medicare Advantage, a successful, lower-cost option for health care for seniors and use it to enroll and federally insure adult men and women who have the ability to work and receive health care from their employers in the open market.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, this omnibus appropriations bill we consider on the floor today is not a typical Continuing Resolution, but changes funding levels and re-prioritizes projects from prior years. This CR is the longest in recent history. Most of them are 1-2 pages. This is 137 pages. Some of these changes are controversial as well as complicated, and I feel that the whole House would have benefited from a thorough appraisal of these proposals, a vigorous committee process, so that all Members would have been fully apprised of the nuances and we could pass a wellthought out, carefully crafted omnibus spending bill. However, I was pleased that the crafters of this bill saw fit to include funding levels for Veterans' Affairs that come close to what the House Republicans passed in the last Congress, and funding levels close to the Administration's request. However, they should be higher. I do lament that the priorities of the current leadership to continue funding ineffective and wasteful programs have limited the amount of available funds that could improve the quality of life for our brave veterans even more. 
   For example, this bill does not eliminate 28 earmarks totaling $70 million, including the famed $50 million Rainforest in Iowa project. That $50 million could instead have been allocated to improving adaptive housing for disabled veterans. This bill also funds assistance to Independent States of the former Soviet Union at a level that is $11 million above the Administration's request. Had this bill been considered in Committees, we may have been able to determine that this $11 million excess may be better spent on rehabilitation programs for blind veterans. Finally, instead of allocating $316 million for ``Corporation for National and Community Service, Domestic Volunteer Service Programs,'' which includes funds to pay people to volunteer in the Americorps program. We could have used some of that money to increase the medical care for spinal cord injured veterans, or increasing benefits for survivors of service members who have sacrificed and given their lives in this Global War on Terror, defending the safety and freedom enjoyed by all of us back here in the States. This CR also breaks the Nation's obligation to provide soldiers and families adequate quality of life--affects the all volunteer force and unravels the Army's synchronized stationing and BRAC plan.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. What this debate is really all about is whether you wish to make a statement in support of our new strategy in Iraq or whether you oppose this new plan. 
   By simply supporting this resolution, you are saying you want to leave Iraq as soon as possible. I am not willing to do this. I am willing to support the administration and to give our military and our troops the benefit of the doubt, and I will vote against this resolution because I want to give this new strategy a chance, a simple chance to succeed. 
   My colleagues, let me repeat. If you vote for this resolution, then you are saying you do not wish to give the military and General Petraeus a chance to succeed. In fact, this resolution declares the new strategy in Iraq is a failure before it has even had a chance to be implemented. 
   This is inconsistent with the unanimous vote the Senate gave to the man selected to carry out this strategy, General Petraeus. Everyone agrees he is the best man. This resolution is undercutting the general and our troops at the very time they need our support. 
   Now, many will argue that there has been ample opportunity to succeed and that we have failed at this point. Certainly mistakes have been made and a change of strategy is long overdue. However, what should this strategy be? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leaving the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk? 
   The advocates for this resolution have no answer. In fact, they beg the very question, What happens when we leave? What happens in Iraq if we leave precipitously? And what do we do if it turns into a Middle East conflagration? 
   If Shiite Iran succeeds in exerting its influence through Shiite Iraq, it will threaten to spill over the sectarian violence across the Middle East and elsewhere. Now here is how the head of the Arab League views this potential conflict. This is what he said. ``If this happens we will enter hell itself.'' 
   The supporters of the resolution keep talking about the past, but they do not talk about the future and how we are going to solve this problem without creating a more serious problem. 
   Edmund Burke, the great conservative leader from Britain, this is how he put it: It is not a question of how we got into this situation, but how do we get out. They have no answers, and by not answering this latter question they are begging the question. 
   Now, this is circular reasoning. It is one in which a premise presupposes the conclusion in some way. In a course of logic, this is called the core relative. So this resolution is faulty reasoning.     
   Any professor of logic would simply recognize the false choice. We need this new strategy that General Petraeus is implementing so that we can hand over this country to the constitutionally elected government. My colleagues, this can be done and will be done soon one way or the other.  
   Any new strategy must be accompanied by a set of strategic benchmarks designed to measure progress in Iraq and to hold the administration and the Iraqi Government accountable for their role in achieving this success. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to include in the Record a list of these benchmarks that I recommend be part of this new strategy to allow our troops to come home. 
   Why not consider a resolution that incorporates these benchmarks? 
   But I do offer a warning to the administration. We must have benchmarks that demonstrate our progress in Iraq. I, for one, and many others, cannot support continued funding without measurable benchmarks. And we need to know if we are making progress; and if we are not, then we can employ other tactics and different measures, all of which will lead to the Iraqi Government taking on the responsibility for their own country. 
   My colleagues, the political easy thing to do is to vote for this faulty resolution because you are not willing to give a final chance for success and you have no ideas on achieving success. The harder, political vote is ``no,'' and that is what I intend to do. 
   If I have a few more moments, I just want to bring to my colleagues' attention a quote that has been declassified from bin Laden's deputy. And if you will bear with me and follow this quote. ``It is my humble opinion that the jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals: The first stage, expel the Americans from Iraq; the second stage, establish Islamic authority, and then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of a caliphate; the third stage, extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Iran; the fourth stage, it may coincide with what came before, the clash with Israel because Israel was established only to challenge a new Islamic entity.'' 
   My colleagues, that is what is at stake. The war in Iraq is a central front in the global war on terrorism and a central battleground for Islamic militant extremists in this worldwide mission to simply destroy all Western democracy. And you don't have to take my word for it. You can see this declassified deputy to bin Laden, his opinion.  
   Mr. Speaker, I will vote against this resolution. While no proposal guarantees success, a precipitous withdrawal of U.S. support would guarantee failure. The stakes are too high to fail in Iraq. It remains in America's strategic interests to ensure regional stability in the Middle East and to deny terrorists a safe haven in Iraq. 
   Certainly mistakes have been made and a change of strategy is long overdue. However, what should this change of strategy be? Should the U.S. immediately pull out of Iraq, leave the terrorists emboldened and potentially put more Americans at risk? Or do we need a new strategy to win the war and finish the job? I think the latter. 
   Instead of a politically motivated resolution, my colleagues and I have developed a strategy for victory in Iraq. We need to establish measurable benchmarks for success in Iraq while expressing unwavering support for our troops. 
   Any new strategy must be accompanied by a set of strategic benchmarks designed to measure progress in Iraq and to hold the Bush administration and the Iraqi Government accountable for their role in achieving success. Threatening to reduce the future commitment of American troops and economic aid if they are not implemented, we must enforce these benchmarks. It is important to stress that an open-ended American military commitment is both unwise and dangerous. In the business world, no successful enterprise gives enormous sums of money without accountability, and nor should we. 
   The military benchmarks I would like to see utilized include: 
   Measuring the level of Iraqi government cooperation with the U.S. Military; 
   Iraqi progress in removing terrorists and others from its own security forces; 
   Identifying the level of combat experience for all Iraqi Army battalions; and 
   Tracking the expenditure of funds supporting Iraqi defense forces. 
   The political benchmarks include: 
   Advancing a strategy to promote tolerance and co-existence among Iraqis; 
   Providing fair access to all Iraqi resources; 
   Promoting the rule of law; 
   Reforming the judicial system to ensure equal application of the law; and 
   Measuring cooperation and coordination of neighboring countries in stabilizing Iraq. 
   Why not consider a resolution that incorporates these benchmarks? 
   This resolution sends an inappropriate message to our troops. This resolution declares the new strategy in Iraq a failure before it even has the chance to be implemented. This is inconsistent with the unanimous vote the other body gave to the man designated to carry the strategy out, General Petraeus. Congress is undercutting General Petraeus and our troops at the very time they need our support. 
   As cochair of the Congressional Air Force Caucus, I joined in leading a delegation of members to Iraq. This trip provided valuable insight into our operations and conditions on the ground. The situation in Iraq poses multiple problems--Sunni al Qaeda terrorists, committed Baathists who are largely Sunni, Shiite militias, and Shiite interference from Iran. This is truly an unholy brew. 
   The war in Iraq is a central front in the global war on terrorism and a central battleground for Islamist militant extremists in their worldwide mission to destroy democracy. But don't take my word for it. Take the words from a declassified letter from bin Laden's deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri.  
   It is my humble opinion that the Jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals: The first stage: Expel the Americans from Iraq. The second stage: Establish an Islamic authority ..... then develop it and support it until it achieves the level of a caliphate ..... The third stage: Extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq. The fourth stage: It may coincide with what came before: the clash with Israel, because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity.  
   These Islamic extremists view victory in Iraq as paramount to their establishment of a worldwide Islamic kingdom. Here is what Osama bin Laden has to say about Iraq from a 2006 audiotape--``The epicenter of these wars is Baghdad, the seat of the caliphate rule. Their defeat in Iraq will mean defeat in all their wars and a beginning to the receding of their Zionist-Crusader tide against us.'' 
   Sectarian violence rages in Iraq, fanned by Iran and Syria, and this could well spill over throughout the region. Look at these charts. They show the sectarian divide in Iraq among Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds; and the other shows the regional divide between Sunnis and Shiites. 
   If Shiite Iran succeeds in exerting its influence through Shiite Iraq, it will threaten the spillover of sectarian violence throughout the Middle East and elsewhere. Here is how Amr Mousa, head of the Arab League, views this potential Iranian-backed Shiite conflict with the Sunni nations--``We will enter hell itself.'' 
   The Islamist terrorist threat is real and directly connected to defeating the insurgents in Iraq. Democrat plans to abandon Iraq will not make this threat disappear. 
   America cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past by withdrawing from a direct confrontation with radical 
   Islamist terrorists. They will continue to intensify their attacks against America, just as they did following other attacks such as in: 
   1979: 66 American diplomats taken hostage and held in Iran for 444 days. 
   1983: A truck bomb kills 241 marines at their barracks in Beirut. 
   1988: Pan Am 103 bombing kills 270, including 189 Americans, over Lockerbie, Scotland. 
   1993: Six killed in first World Trade Center bombing by militant Islamic terrorists. 
   1996: 19 U.S. service members are killed in Khobar Towers bombing. 
   1998: 225 people killed in bombings at the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya. 
   2000: Al Qaeda's attack on the destroyer USS. Cole kills 17 American sailors. 
   2001: Al Qaeda hijackers fly planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, while passengers force a fourth to crash in Pennsylvania. Total number killed: 2,973. 
   It is vital that we succeed in Iraq for these reasons: A stable Iraq dedicated to the rule of law will weaken extremism in the Middle East; we cannot allow terrorists to gain a safe haven in that nation; and curbing Iran's regional ambitions. 
   But I do offer a warning. We must have benchmarks that demonstrate our progress in Iraq. I for one cannot support continued funding without measurable benchmarks and we need to know if we are making progress. If we are not, then we can take other tactics and different measures. All of which will lead to the Iraqi Government taking on the responsibility for their own country. 
   In conclusion Mr. Speaker, one thing is for certain: The men and women fighting in Iraq must never be used as a political tool. They deserve our unmitigated support. They do not deserve political posturing. We must continue to provide the troops with the support they need to be safe and successful. I urge all my colleagues to oppose this resolution and seek a real resolution that includes military, political, and social benchmarks for success.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (EXPRESSING SORROW OF THE HOUSE AT THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE CHARLIE NORWOOD, MEMBER OF CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it is with sorrow, yet fondness, that I speak on the passing of our colleague and friend, Charlie Norwood. While in Congress, his dedication to Georgians, to patient advocacy, to business ownership and property rights, and to veterans are legendary. 
   Prior to his service in the House of Representatives, CHARLIE served his country as a Captain in the U.S. Army Dental Corps in Vietnam, and he contributed to his community as a dentist, business owner, and active worshipper in his Methodist Church. 
   I first learned about Charlie in 1994 when he was running for his Georgia district. Struck by his pluckiness and quiet steadfast determination even then, I decided to campaign for him in his district-to-be, and met his wife Gloria. And when he was elected, he immediately became a player in health care legislation, not waiting for reaching the echelons of seniority to make real contributions. 
   Through all his trials, Charlie Norwood had a sparkle, an ingenuity how to get things accomplished. His passion would at times translate into defiance at another Member. In particular, I recall such a moment at the Energy & Commerce markup on July 27, 2006 of H.R. 4157, the Better Health Information System Act of 2006, or ``Health IT'' bill. Another Member, Representative Markey, was offering some language that would have the effect of governing relations between health care providers and their patients. Well, Charlie took great exception to this, and rather angrily erupted to Representative Markey that his profession has engaged in the highest ethical standards of patient privacy since the inception of dentistry, and therefore ``I don't need you to legislate my professional ethics.'' 
   In the past couple of years, Charlie would ride in his scooter to the Energy & Commerce Committee on which we served together, and to the Floor, for debate and hearings and votes. And notwithstanding his ailing health, I was always touched by his continued friendly, high spirits. Charlie, I am honored to have known you. Rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States currently imports about 60 percent of its oil, and that number is expected to rise to 75 percent in the coming decades. 
   As a country, we need to reduce our dependency on foreign fuel sources and start implementing alternative energy sources that can be found domestically here in the United States. 
   Imported fuels such as crude oil and natural gas are costing the country billions of dollars a year, accounting for about one-third of the United States trade deficit. At $45 a barrel, liquid coal fuel is a desirable alternative to the $60 plus or more per barrel of oil we're paying today. Not only does this innovative fuel source cost less, but also coal is one of the most abundant natural resources in the United States. As Congress continues to explore the use of alternative energy sources, we need to look closely at the enormous benefits of coal-to-liquid technology.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (UNLOCK AMERICA'S ENERGY RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. A new Gallup Poll shows that 57 percent of Americans agree with House Republicans and favor more energy exploration in the United States. America needs fewer restrictions on domestic sources of oil. The U.S. remains the only oil-producing nation that has placed a substantial amount of its energy potential off limits. This includes just 100th of 1 percent of Alaska's 20-million Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This small portion of ANWR is believed to contain 10 billion barrels of oil, or more, an amount equivalent to 15 years of imports from Saudi Arabia or 30 years of imports from Hugo Chavez. The Congressional Research Service estimates that at $1.25 a barrel, ANWR would deliver $192 billion in corporate income tax and royalty revenue to the Federal Government. 
   Even more oil is located in other restricted areas throughout the United States, and still more, Mr. Speaker, in the 85 percent of America's Outer Continental Shelf, that is currently off-limits. 
   We need to favor more exploration.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
   And I want to have the opportunity to speak. I have spoken earlier on this debate, but I thought I would bring some simple common sense to my colleagues that perhaps was best brought forward by David Broder in the Washington Post. Now, David Broder obviously is more sympathetic to the Democratic point of view than they are to the Republicans, but I think he makes three points which I will also echo in my conversation today. 
   Basically, we are at the end of the debate, but we are all moving towards a decision most of us already have decided, but I have some simple common sense that I would bring to the attention of my colleagues. 
   When General Petraeus was unanimously supported by the Senate, it was with the idea that he would bring his new thoughts, his new strategy to this plan in Iraq. So don't you think, as members of this body, we should give General Petraeus an opportunity to implement his plan and not immediately come forward with a resolution that says that it is a disapproving of the decision to deploy more troops to Iraq? 
   When we deployed more troops for the Iraqi elections, why didn't you complain then? That happened twice before. We went up to almost 160,000. When we deployed more troops to ratify the Iraqi constitution, why didn't you complain back then? That went up to almost 160,000. 
   So now you are coming against a simple new strategy with the best we have in America who actually has written the manual on how to do it. You are not even willing to give him a chance. No breathing space. This nonbinding resolution shows your motives, which are to eventually reduce all funding for Iraq. 
   My third point is, you are so willing to do this, you are not even willing to look at what could happen with this new strategy. Let's say it works. Are you still going to offer these resolutions to cut off funds even though this strategy works and General Petraeus is successful? No matter what, you seem hell bent on reducing funds for Iraq. Yet we didn't hear any time before when we increased the surge for the Iraqi elections or for the ratification of the Iraqi constitution. 
   You know, in a way, Bush went to your retreat with a willingness to listen to your ideas. He is showing bipartisanship. In fact, he has a quote here which I think illustrates what the American people are saying. ``What really matters,'' quote, ``is what happens on the ground. I can talk all day long, but what really matters to the American people is to see progress.'' 
   So he realizes also that he must show progress. And we are asking for this new strategy to have a chance, and we owe it to them.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CHINESE CYBER SPIES--AN EMERGING THREAT -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, my colleagues, the control of information is critical to national security. This asset was compromised as reported in the London Times AP story in the Washington Post recently, last week. It was compromised from a cyber attack against the Department of Defense's unclassified e-mail system, which included the e-mail accounts of Defense Secretary Robert Gates. While the Pentagon does not have sufficient proof to formally make an accusation, China is the prime suspect. The responsibility is unclear, because China is home to many insecure computers and networks that hackers in other computers could use to simply disguise their locations and launch these attacks, making proper attribution difficult. 
   The Chinese Government replied, ``It has always opposed any Internet wrecking crime, including hacking, and crack down on it according to their law.'' This is not true. Last June was not the first cyber attack that points back towards China. In 2005, a group with ties to China compromised secure networks from the Redstone Arsenal Military Base, to NASA, to the World Bank. In one case, the hackers stole flight planning software from the Army. The files they have obtained are not classified, but many are strategically important enough to require U.S. Government licenses for foreign use. 
   Experts note China's military has openly discussed using cyber attacks as a means of defeating a more powerful conventional military such as ours. In fact, other governments have also been the targets of these vicious cyber attacks. Unidentified officials in Germany and Britain reported to the media that government and military networks had been broken into by hackers backed by the Chinese Army. The Guardian reported that Chinese attackers launched online assaults on the network in Britain's Parliament, the Foreign Office, and Defense Ministry. My colleagues, last month the German weekly Der Spiegel also reported that computers at the chancellery and three ministries had been infected with so-called Trojan horse programs, which allowed an attacker to spy on information in those computers. The report, which appears on the eve of German Chancellor Merkel's visit to Beijing, said Germany's domestic intelligence agency believed hackers associated with the Chinese Army might have been behind the attacks. Motives for such hacking may range from the stealing of secrets or confidential technology to probing for system weaknesses and placing hidden viruses that could be activated in case of a conflict. 
   The reported Pentagon attack was the most flagrant and brazen to date, said Alex Neill, an expert on the Chinese military at London's Royal United Services Institute. Quoted by the British newspaper, The Guardian, Neill said such attacks begin at least 4 years ago, and are increasing at an alarming rate. 
   Now, this is a substantial threat to the security of the United States and its allies. In January 2005, Japanese officials had reported that Chinese hackers were routinely attacking web sites and Internet services. According to the Korean Information Security Agency, a total of 10,628 cases of hacking were reported in the first half of the year 2004, 30 times higher than for the same period in 2003. In 2005, Chinese hackers assaulted South Korean government computers, gaining access to information concerning the country's National Assembly, Atomic Energy Research Institute, Democratic Progressive Party, and even the itinerary of the South Korean president himself. 
   Whether or not cyber attacks are government sponsored, China has become a growing focus of global antihacking efforts. In a report earlier this year, security software maker Symantec Corporation listed China as having the world's second largest amount of computer activity. Experts say the attacks originating in China often employ standard weaponry such as Trojan horses and worms, and many other sophisticated techniques. In some cases, hackers slip in after launching viruses to distract monitors, or coordinate multiple attacks for  maximum effects. China denies backing such attacks, and foreign governments have declined to openly accuse Beijing. Yet, after the threatening test of the Chinese anti-satellite weapon, the reports are further illustrations of China's pursuit of new methods of unconventional strategy. Chinese military thinkers frequently debate these strategies, including the use of attacks on satellites, financial system and computer networks. ``In the information age, the influence exerted by a nuclear bomb is perhaps less than the influence exerted by a hacker,'' a pair of Chinese colonels wrote in a key 1999 work on asymmetrical strategies titled Unlimited Warfare.  
   We must ensure the legal authority is clear for our government agencies in tracking and responding to cyber attacks. It is vital that we swiftly detect attacks, accurately identify the source and intent, and respond forcefully against all malicious intrusions.  
   My colleagues, our enemy needs to know attacking our cyber space is the same as attacking our homeland, and we will respond accordingly.

   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, many in Congress and around this country insist that the President take the advice of The Iraq Study Group. Well, the President is doing just that. The report states, ``We could, however, support a short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping missions needed.'' 
   Well, my colleagues, that is what the President is trying to do. The cochair of the study group, James Baker, had this to say: ``Setting a deadline for withdrawal regardless of conditions in Iraq makes even less sense today because there is evidence that the temporary surge is reducing the level of violence in Baghdad.'' 
   Rather than support a bill that leaves our troops in harm's way for a cause Democrats believe cannot be won, Democratic leaders should be willing to vote to allow time to let the surge work and not signal defeat.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Let me also congratulate the authors of the bill and the fine work that they have done. We have had a hearing in Energy and Commerce, where I serve, but I thought I would just follow up a little bit on what the gentleman from Louisiana talked about, a little bit about the preemption. 
   Madam Speaker, I think almost everybody in this House is for genetic protection from genetic discrimination. There have been many bills over the years that Ms. Slaughter has worked on. I think she indicated she has worked on it for 12 years. I compliment her on her perseverance. Sometimes it takes that kind of conscientiousness to get anything accomplished here. The fact we are able to get this today is a success story. In fact, the President has indicated, I think nationally, that he would like to sign this bill. So it is on a fast track, and I am sure that we won't have any trouble in the suspension passing it. 
   But one significant concern that I bring to the attention of my colleagues is a Federal preemption. I mention this as perhaps, as the Senate and the House come together, they can solve this problem. So I will continue to talk about it. 
   According to CBO, the bill would ``preempt some State laws that establish confidentiality standards for genetic information, and would restrict how State and local governments use such information in employment practices and in the provision of health care to employees.'' This bill will create, I think, a little bit of a problem, the confusion in about the 42 States that currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based upon genetic information. 
   For example, my home State of Florida is very strong with clear definitions. If we superimpose this bill, it would create a lot of confusion, I think, in my State of Florida. Many exemptions occur, HIV testing, drug  testing, forensic analysis, routine blood tests for current health would be negated. Even more frustrating for the regulated, the operative Federal-State relationship rule is whatever part of a State law is more stringent survives. The question is, who decides when that occurs? The courts? I think that is a question the Senate should look at. 
   There are better approaches, but partial preemption is what we see here. I think it should be changed. Maybe the answer is across-the-board preemption, and that is what I am recommending, or maybe allow States to apply for an exemption. I believe Florida and other States are substantially meeting this policy. 
   In any event, some Federal agency should at least adjudicate so that the regulated community is not subject to uncertainty, fines, ultimately litigation. So I asked this same question when we had the markup in Energy and Commerce. 
   So I asked during our Energy markup on March 23 about this to the staff. At that time, it was difficult to understand what their answer was. I followed up on March 27 with a letter to Chairman Dingell, signed along with a Health Subcommittee ranking member NATHAN DEAL. We have not at this point received a reply to this letter, and I just urge that somehow in the conference on this bill that we try to answer that question. 
   Finally, 11 Energy and Commerce Republicans signed our views to the energy report, which, Madam Speaker, I make part of the Record, and I support the intention of this legislation. It's good. I congratulate everybody, but I would like to see a preemption and other clear issues worked out in conference.  
   I support protection from genetic discrimination, so much so I have offered my own bills in prior Congresses. However, this bill has, some problems I would like resolved. 
   (For the record: Many people have been remarking that we have been working for over a dozen years on legislation to safeguard individuals from discrimination against due to their genetic profile when they seek to purchase health insurance or employment. 
   Well, I count myself among those waiting. For, in 1995, I was proud to be named the first Chair of the Congressional Task Force on Medical Records and Genetics, by then Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley. Congressman Gene Green (Committee Democrat) was my Co-chair, and together we held many meetings and hearings with witnesses from the genetics community, including insurance companies, the biotech and pharmaceutical industries, and patient advocates. Indeed, one of my proudest legislative achievements came in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). In the Commerce Committee markup of HIPAA, I was successful in adding two words to the list of protections: ``genetic information.'' It survived and is in the HIPAA law today. 
   And, I have continued my engagement, authoring bills in the last several Congresses to prohibit genetic nondiscrimination in health insurance.) 
   One significant concern is the lack of clarity over federal pre-emption. According to CBO, the bill would ``preempt some state laws that establish confidentiality standards for generic information, and would restrict how state and local governments use such information in employment practices and in the provision of health care to employees.'' GINA will create confusion for the 43 states that currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on genetic information. 
   Florida's law, for example, is very strong, with clear definitions. If we superimpose GINA it will create a lot of confusion. Many exemptions--HIV testing, drug testing, forensic analysis, routine blood tests for current health--would be negated. Even more frustrating for the regulated, the operative Federal-state relationship rule is whatever part of a state law is more stringent survives. And who will decide? The courts. 
   There are better approaches, but partial preemption is unsatisfactory. Maybe the answer is across the board preemption. Or, maybe allow states to apply for an exemption. I believe Florida and other States are substantially meeting the policy. In any event, some Federal agency should at least 
   adjudicate so that the regulated community is not subject to uncertainty, fines, or litigation.

   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, let me just talk to my colleagues. A new Gallup Poll just came out yesterday, and it really shows what we on this side have been talking about. 
   The poll indicates that over 55 percent of Americans are worried that the expansion of the SCHIP program would create incentives for families to drop private health coverage and switch to the public program. This goes to the very core of what we've been saying. 
   I was here in 1997 when Republicans created the SCHIP program. The Democrat leadership is creating a future entitlement train wreck, and they would be wise to listen to the American people before tying the hands of our Federal Government with more spending. 
   The poll goes on further to state that over 52 percent of Americans believe that most benefits should go to families making 200 percent below the poverty line. This was the original intent of the law. 
   The American people are asking Congress to follow the original bipartisan plan for the SCHIP program. The American people want to cover the poorest kids first; we do, too. The Democrat leadership needs to understand they're not doing the American people a favor with this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, on September 19, 2002, in a Wall Street Journal editorial, former CIA Director James Woolsey described the central challenge we face in the global war on terrorism as the United States' dependence on imported oil. My colleagues, this dependence is providing our enemy with so much leverage that defeating terrorism has become significantly harder. 
   Let me quote from Mr. Woolsey: ``We are at war. We should start by asking what we can do as soon as possible to undercut our enemies' power. Other considerations should now follow, not lead. If we do not act now, we will leave major levers over our fate in the hands of regimes that have attacked us or have fallen under the sway of fanatics who spread hatred of the United States and, indeed, of freedom itself. For all of them, their power derives from their oil. It is time to break their sword.'' 
   In order for the United States to effectively fight global terrorism and win in Iraq, we must first reduce our dangerous dependence on imported oil. Energy is the lifeblood of the United States and global economy. U.S. economic prosperity is closely tied to the availability of reliable and affordable supplies of energy. Since 1973, U.S. energy production has grown only 13 percent, while U.S. energy consumption has increased 30 percent. Even when significant increases in efficiency are taken into account, significant increases in demand are projected. 
   According to the Energy Information Agency, the United States, by 2025, is expected to need 44 percent more petroleum, 38 percent more natural gas, 43 percent more coal and 54 percent more electricity. The Department of Energy predicts by the year 2025, U.S. oil and natural gas demand will rise by 46 percent, with energy demand increasing 1 percent for every 2 percent increase in GDP. 
   Perhaps the most critical of all energy sources is oil. Just as President Bush said in his 2006 State of the Union speech, America is addicted to oil. A look at the numbers supports his claim. Currently, the United States imports about 60 percent of its oil. The Department of Energy projects this number will increase to 73 percent by  the year 2025. Furthermore, world oil demand is expected to grow significantly over the next three decades, from 80 million barrels per day in 2003 to 98 million barrels per day in 2015 and then to 118 million barrels per day by the year 2030, according to the Energy Information Administration. This will place further strains on our quest for energy independence. To make matters worse, much of this imported oil is imported from unstable, anti-American countries, such as Venezuela, Algeria, and even Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, 26.5 percent of the United States' total supplied product comes from OPEC countries, accounting for 42 percent of the total amount imported. Thus, over a quarter of the United States oil product is controlled by an unaccountable cartel of unstable, oil-producing dictatorships. 
   Alarmingly, according to the Heritage Foundation, three-quarters of the world's supply of oil is controlled by unstable or hostile regimes, most of which are unsympathetic to investor and property rights. Fifty-seven percent of world oil reserves are in the Middle East, 11 percent in Russia and Venezuela and 6 percent in Africa. The People's Republic of China just erected its first oil rigs in Cuba territorial waters in the Gulf of Mexico, barely 45 miles off the Florida coast of Miami. 
   The national security implications of having such a large amount of oil controlled by OPEC are great and serious. For example, in order to force changes in U.S. policy, OPEC countries could cut production, thereby raising the price of oil. The resulting political and economic pressure could force us to alter our policies in order to better suit the needs of these OPEC nations. U.S. dependence on imported sources of oil and gas has far-reaching economic and national security ramifications. 
   Some are willing to use oil as a tool to threaten United States national security objectives. Proclamations by al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that U.S. and western economies and their oil lifelines are legitimate targets make it clear that the oil and gas infrastructure is in peril. As James Woolsey said, we are aiding our enemies at the same time we are fighting them.

   My colleagues, this is a disease that affects 30,000 Americans living in this country, more than half of which are children. One out of every 3,500 babies born in the U.S. today has cystic fibrosis, with 70 percent of the cases diagnosed by age 2 and 1,000 new cases diagnosed each year. 
   In my home State of Florida, there are roughly 1,100 patients who suffer each and every day from this debilitating disease. It's cruel. That is 1,100 too many. These CF patients have to endure hours of treatment each day just to stay relatively healthy and maintain normal lung functions. Treatments range from daily air clearance techniques to intensive nutrition and drug therapies, and even to lung transplants in the most severe cases. 
   People suffering from CF have two copies of a defective gene, which causes the body to produce abnormally thick sticky mucus which clogs the lungs  and can result in fatal lung infections. This kind of mucus can also obstruct the pancreas, making it difficult for people with CF to absorb nutrients, simple nutrients, in food. Unfortunately, more than 10 million Americans are unknowingly symptom-free carriers of the CF gene. 
   Now, the residents of Florida have recognized there is a real need for CF care and research. There are 15 specialized centers and clinics for cystic fibrosis care in my home State of Florida, including one at the University of Florida, which I represent here in Congress. 
   My colleagues, there is no cure for CF, even though it is one of the most common, life-threatening diseases in the United States. Now, 50 years ago, CF was considered a death sentence, as there were no drugs to combat and control the symptoms. 
   In 1955, a child born with CF was not expected to live long enough to attend elementary school. Today, the median age of survival for a CF patient is 37. 
   I am proud to say there are five drugs on the market, and there's over 30 new drugs that are in various stages of development. These drugs are helping children born with CF to live significantly longer and healthier lives. People with CF are living longer. Over 40 percent of the CF population is now age 18 or older. 
   But that is not enough, my colleagues. We need more research and more funding, and we can't stop until we find the cure. I believe in the ingenuity and strong ethic of the American people. I believe we have the brain power and the drive to cure this disease today. 
   I would like to recognize the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, which has led the development of these promising treatments through an innovative business approach to drug discovery and development. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has entered into partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in an effort to find a cure, a simple cure for this disease. 
   As a result of their efforts, promising potential drug therapies to correct the cause of the disease are now entering clinical trials in CF patients, and new therapies that treat the symptoms of this disease are now helping patients every day as we speak. 
   In the past 5 years, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and its subsidiaries have invested over $650 million in drug research. I commend them for their commitment to innovation and for acting as a facilitator in the development of these important new drugs. 
   With the support of the foundation, programs like the one at the University of Florida CF and Pediatric Pulmonary Disease Center are simply improving the health outcome of patients who have cystic fibrosis. In the past 5 years in the State of Florida, CF research and care supported by the CF Foundation has totaled $3 1/2 million. 
   I urge my colleagues to recognize the achievements of organizations like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and to bring awareness to and honor to the thousands of Americans suffering from CF every day, by simply passing this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (THE STATE OF INTELLIGENCE'S UNION -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it is 6 years after 9/11, and reform of the intelligence community continues to be a primary concern for all of us. At the swearing-in ceremony of Director Mike McConnell, President Bush outlined three main categories for improvement: the need to strengthen individual agencies, increase information sharing action and improve the quality of intelligence produced. I wish to discuss this morning what this means. 
   The intelligence community has established new hiring and employment reforms to strengthen the workforce. Under the direction of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), there is now a comprehensive intelligence community plan that focuses on hiring a more diverse workforce to address the critical need for variety in languages, backgrounds, and skills. He has also appointed a chief of equal employment opportunity and diversity, and has agreed to a set of wide-ranging recommendations that the diversity senior advisory panel made in their report: ``Diversity: A National Security Imperative for the Intelligence Community.'' 
   The Director of National Intelligence is also establishing ``joint duty'' as a requirement for promotion to senior positions. This is imperative in transforming the culture to increase integration and a collaborative nature among agencies. It will also reduce ``stovepipe'' mentalities which hampered collection efforts pre-9/11. These are important reforms, Mr. Speaker, and good initiatives that have been undertaken to address the human resources challenges facing the intelligence community. I look forward to  seeing the outcome of these reforms, and hope to see even more innovative programs to strengthen our human intelligence capabilities. 
   One of the critical lapses identified after September 11, particularly by the 9/11 Commission report, was the poor information sharing among agencies and departments. Recently there have been some improvements in this area. The National CounterTerrorism Center, NCTC, recently published a report entitled ``NCTC and Information Sharing: Five Years Since 9/11, a Progress Report.'' The NCTC reports that today, following many reforms, analysts have access to dozens of networks and information systems that they were previously denied. This access is across intelligence, law enforcement, military, and homeland security communities. This enormous increase of the amount of information, while ultimately beneficial, also raised the concern of becoming overwhelmed by the flood of this new information. Therefore, the NCTC is continuously exploring new technologies to help analysts manage these volumes of terrorism-related data. 
   The NCTC also reports that they host communitywide video teleconferences three times a day to ensure awareness of ongoing operations and emerging threats. Participants in these video teleconferences can correct misunderstandings, compare notes, and share best practice ideas to enhance the capabilities of all involved. Mr. Speaker, this is a vital component to the ability to detect and respond effectively in real time to emerging terrorism threats. 
   They have also created an online counterterrorism library allowing nonintelligence community agencies easier access to counterterrorism information. This library today hosts over 6,000 users, 6 million documents, and has over 60 departments and agencies that contribute information to its files. 
   Finally, the ODNI has reformed overseas collection efforts among agencies, focusing collection efforts on the stated needs and goals of the policymakers receiving the intelligence products. In a March 4 press release from the public affairs of the Office of Director of National Intelligence, ``The intelligence community has strengthened the quality of intelligence provided to policymakers through initiatives like the mission managers concept. Among the most experienced in the intelligence community, mission managers have highly developed analytical and collection management skills and they focus on the topics of highest interest to our policymakers. This strategy allows the intelligence community to identify collection gaps and address resources to cover those gaps, ensuring analysts have the required information to support policy decisionmakers.'' They have also streamlined production of National Intelligence Council (NIC) products, increasing output and minimizing delays in production time. They have included both more effective explanation behind judgments and the inclusion of alternative views of analysts, to incorporate a wide range of opinions and combat the dangers arising from ``group think.'' 
   I look forward to monitoring the progress of these important first steps. However, it is vital that we maintain our momentum. As Director McConnell stated in his swearing-in speech, ``Taking advantage of these advances in technology, today's threats move at increasing speeds. The time needed to develop a terrorist plot, communicated around the globe, and put it into motion has been drastically reduced. The time line is no longer a calendar, it is a watch.''

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (ALTERNATIVE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States imports about 60 percent of its oil today and that number is expected to go up to almost 80 percent in the next 10 years. As a country, we need to reduce our dependency on foreign fuel sources and start implementing alternative energy sources and programs that can be found here in the United States, like coal. 
   Imported fuel such as crude oil and natural gas are costing the country millions of dollars a year and accounts for about one-third of the United States trade deficit. Imported fuels also account for about 17 percent of an increase in America's energy consumption from 2004 to 2005. 
   Now liquid coal can be developed for $50 a barrel. Compare that with $107 for oil today. Not only does this innovative fuel cost us less, but also coal is one of the most abundant natural resources in the United States. As Congress continues to explore the use of alternative energy sources, we need to look closely at coal to liquid.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (GENETIC INFORMATION NONDISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, last week the Energy and Commerce Committee marked up H.R. 493, Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act. Two other committees of jurisdiction have also voted on this same bill. 
   Many people have been remarking that we have been working for over a dozen years on this particular piece of legislation and this subject. I count myself among them because in 1995 I was proud to be named the first chair of the Congressional Task Force on Medical Records and Genetics by then-Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley. Indeed, in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) markup, I was successful in adding two words to a list of protections: ``Genetic information,'' which is in the HIPAA law today. 
   I have continued my engagement, authoring bills in the last several Congresses to prohibit genetic nondiscrimination in health insurance. While I agree conceptually with the intent, this particular piece of legislation I have mentioned earlier, gives rise to many concerns. 
   First, I can support legislation which would surgically target what people are fearing: They worry about being excluded or charged a higher rate from a health insurance agent or fired or not hired in the first place by an employer because of predictive, speculative genetic information that in no way exhibits in their current health status. 
   However, with the wording ``request or require,'' which is in the bill, this bill goes beyond that to cast a shadow upon any use of genetic information by a health plan or physician. This bill should ban misuse of genetic information, but not impede the flow of information between provider, patient and plan. 
   Let's not stifle health services, pharmacies, health records services, health counseling or health education. I think we should not fear beneficial, patient-friendly medical opportunities. We should harness those, while drawing a tighter box around the misuses that are feared. Ban misuses, not ban all uses. 
   Secondly, I am troubled by the rather murky, broad definitions in this legislation. In particular, by the definitions of ``genetic test'' and ``genetic information.'' This legislation does not clarify that information regarding current health status is not exempted by the bill's prohibition. For example, the mere fact that someone has an O or AB blood type, also detects that person has the O or AB genotype, which under the definition of this bill is a genetic test. This bill could ensnare the most routine lab test of a health exam: A blood panel to check for heart, kidney or liver functioning. 
   And beyond health applications, at the Health Subcommittee March 13 hearing, Dr. Francis Collins, head of the National Human Genome Research Institute, acceded as much. When Ranking Member Nathan Deal questioned him if this bill, GINA, covers certain tests, Dr. Collins answered: ``To the extent that those tests are conducted in a way that conducts genotypes, mutations, or chromosomal changes, they would qualify as a genetic test.'' These include forensic DNA identification tests, tests for organ donors to match organ tissues, paternity tests, and tests to select safer and more effective drugs based on your genetic profile. For example, if the bill means to sweep in genetic tests performed on cancer tumors, it will prevent tests such as Her 2 genetic tests given to women with breast cancer, designed to determine if their tumors are responsive to drug therapy. Such therapy is both risky and very costly for patients without such a specific gene marker. 
   In the employment setting, this bill muddies what an employer will be able to do in a worker's compensation or occupational substance abuse situation; very important. Currently, an employer has the right, in fact, the legal responsibility, to conduct drug tests in the name of public safety for cause, and to examine medical records in a work comp case to determine the nature of an injury. If a blood test, therefore a genetic test, is included in the medical record, a hapless employer could have an unintentional disclosure on their hands. 
   Finally, it is unclear if this legislation will preempt or create an unworkable patchwork with the nearly 40 States' genetic bans.  
   Most have a bright line distinction between ``current health'' versus ``genetic'', and excluding paternity and forensic uses. Florida's law does. And, the author of the legislation, Representative Slaughter, did herself include current health wording in prior versions of her legislation. 
   Genetic information is personal, powerful, permanent, and sensitive. Let us continue to work to make this bill a tool for protecting Americans against ill uses of their genetic profile, while not impeding the flow of information, routine employment activity, and the delivery of health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (IMMIGRATION REFORM -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I am here to discuss why past efforts to stop  illegal immigration into our country have failed. 
   Over the past several decades, immigration policy in our country has been somewhat confused and unfocused to the point that there is widespread and deepening concern that our current policies regarding immigration are not working. Poorly designed policies and weak enforcement of immigration laws have led to disturbing vulnerabilities in this country to our security, and the millions of illegal immigrants currently in our country continue to belittle the naturalization process. 
   From a national security perspective, preventing illegal entry and reducing those individuals illegally present in the United States is an imperative. An uncontrolled immigration system encourages the circumvention of immigration laws and is a clear invitation to those who wish to take advantage of our openness to cause this Nation harm. 
   Congress and the President must take credible steps to reduce illegal immigration. Federal, State and local law enforcement must be allowed to enforce existing immigration law. But because of the current lack of enforcement, the illegal population in the United States will continue to grow, the burden on local communities will increase, the stresses on civil society will become greater, and border security will become more expensive while remaining just as ineffective. Furthermore, this failure to enforce our immigration laws is tremendously unfair to the millions who obeyed the law and went through the rewarding process of obtaining legal citizenship. 
   Most individuals and families that immigrate to the United States, whether legally or illegally, come seeking economic opportunity. We respect that. However, unlike previous generations, a generous welfare, education and health system with generous eligibility draws a disproportionate rate of poor and low-skilled illegal immigrants to the United States. These thousands of low-skilled immigrants that pour into our country illegally each year drain precious resources from Federal, State and local governments. 
   In my State as in other States, they need temporary workers. I understand that. A balanced and well-constructed temporary worker program should diminish the incentives for illegal immigration by providing an additional option for legal temporary labor and, in combination with other reforms, reduce over time the current population of illegal aliens. This would foster better national security and serve a growing economy. Such a temporary worker program would be a valuable component of a comprehensive immigration reform proposal. I recognize that. 
   Nevertheless, my colleagues, enthusiasm for such a program in theory must be moderated by serious concerns not only about the failures of such programs in our past attempts and in other countries, but also regarding how a new program would likely be implemented and operate in practice. An ill-defined and poorly constructed temporary worker program would make the current problems of immigration policy unfortunately even worse. 
   In the mid 1980s, Congress advocated amnesty for long-settled illegal immigrants and considered it reasonable to adjust the status of what was then a relatively small population of illegal aliens. In exchange for allowing aliens to stay, border security and enforcement of immigration laws would be greatly strengthened, in particular through sanctions against employers who hired these illegal immigrants. 
   However, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, did not solve our illegal immigration problem. Indeed, the lessons of that policy experiment are clear. From the very start, there was widespread document fraud by applicants. Unsurprisingly, the number of people applying for amnesty far exceeded projections, and there proved to be a failure of political will in enforcing new laws against employers. 
   Two decades later, the Senate proposed another bill specifically designed to allow the overwhelming majority of illegal immigrants to legally live and work in the United States from day one and eventually to become permanent residents and then citizens. This was a form of amnesty and that is why it failed. 
   Securing a future where America's borders are no longer porous, its laws are respected, and illegal labor is replaced by legal workers and legal immigrants is an achievable objective that we can accomplish. More than any other nation in history, our country and its system of equal justice and economic freedom beckons not only the downtrodden and the persecuted but also those who seek opportunity and a better future for themselves and their families. But by allowing millions of illegal immigrants to remain in the United States without providing any new significant security guarantees at the border is unacceptable. 
   We must control our borders first, then enforce the rules and regulations at the border with more security border guards. Only after that is done should we look at a policy concerning the illegal immigrants in this country. That is what the American people want. 
   Secure our borders now, Madam Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, the ``Fully Implementing the 9/11 Commission Recommendations Act,'' does not achieve what it advertises. In fact, in many cases, it inhibits our Nation's ability to secure our citizens against attack. This bill neglects to address many recommendations, including classified oversight of the Homeland Security Department, declassification of the intelligence budget, and a shift of paramilitary operations from the CIA to the Defense Department. There are other provisions inserted in this bill, that do not appear anywhere in the 9/11 Commission Report, including unionization of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees, 100 percent screening of cargo containers, and several foreign policy initiatives, some of which have already been passed into law. 
   Incredibly, a provision in this bill would cede one of our Nation's most critical and effective national security initiatives to regulation by the United Nations. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is a 4-year-old program created and run by the United States to coordinate nonproliferation efforts by ourselves and our allies. This program's effectiveness was a key deterrent to Libya's nuclear program, and was directly responsible to uncovering the large Pakistani nuclear black market ring run by A.Q. Khan. Transferring this program to the United Nations would require participants in the program to seek the approval of these foreign governments prior to interdicting illicit WMD material, creating yet another hurdle that agencies would have to overcome prior to intercepting illegal WMD shipments. 
   This program relies heavily on shared intelligence, which is the primary reason it must not be handed over to the UN Security Council. This would jeopardize the intelligence, routes, methods and sources used by U.S. and allied forces to prevent proliferation of WMDs by rogue regimes and terrorist organizations. Allowing members of the United Nations Security Council, which in the past has counted Syria and Pakistan as members, will compromise operations, cripple the program's effectiveness and endanger our citizens. 
   In yet another disparity, the 9/11 Commission does not recommend 100 percent screening of cargo containers. However, the last Congress determined that greater security was a need, and therefore passed, with bipartisan support, the SAFE Ports Act. Under these expanded security measures, all cargo entering the country is assessed for risk long before it reaches our shores, and when designated as questionable, those shipments are thoroughly inspected. In fact, current best practices by the Customs and Border Patrol also includes random inspections both at dockside during loading and unloading, and of the trucks as they leave the port. 
   This 100 percent mandate is also incredibly burdensome financially. House Democrats expect industry, and possibly foreign governments, to cover the costs of ensuring 100 percent cargo screening of containers entering the United States by air or sea. The airlines would be expected to pay for air cargo inspections; while foreign port terminal operators 
   would be expected to pay for scanning U.S. bound sea cargo. The bill does not estimate how much this will cost, but DHS is already spending $60 million a year to scan sea cargo at six foreign ports. According to DHS, there are more than 700 I seaports that ship to the U.S., raising estimates of the costs of this program into the tens of billions. 
   Funding for Homeland Security must be split to address a wide array of threats against the United States to minimize risk as best possible. To allocate funding on any program that has little likelihood of effectiveness is egregiously irresponsible. Container-screening technology is improving, but is not yet proficient enough to scan all of those containers in a useful, accurate, and speedy manner. That is why in the SAFE Ports Act, Congress included provisions to conduct feasibility studies of the 100% container-screening proposal and of emerging screening technology. The results of these studies have not even been reported, and yet the Democratic leadership insists on pushing through this incredibly ill advised mandate without the full information, without hearings and without mark-up sessions in committee. This illogical, ill-informed approach to our national security is being pursued with only one discernable purpose, political clout by achieving passage of the Democrats' ``100 hours agenda''. 
   There is also the extraordinarily troubling provision that would grant collective bargaining rights to TSA employees. On the surface, this may seem reasonable, but it poses a clear danger to our national security. Granting unionization rights to TSA employees would allow them to strike when negotiating their contracts. Imagine a strike of TSA screeners at airports across the nation at Thanksgiving, or the during the Fourth of July holiday. It would be a nightmare--airport operations would cease or the security of our flights would be threatened from lack of adequate passenger and luggage screening. That is one reason why federal employees in positions impacting National Security were purposely excluded from collective bargaining rights when Congress passed the Labor-Management Relations Act in 1947, and affirmed again when the TSA was re-established under the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. 
   DHS must have the flexibility to move and retrain employees at will in response to the changing nature of threats against the United States. Following last July's intelligence revelation that terrorists were plotting action against U.S. flights from the United Kingdom, one critical advantage that DHS cited was the ability to shift employees to respond to this new emerging threat. Should TSA employees unionize, DHS would no longer have this speed and flexibility, weakening our responses to terrorist threats. 
   This bill is touted by democrats to implement many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, but not only does it not accomplish this, it fails to identify funding for the initiatives. In fact, only one provision in the entire bill contains a defined funding authorization: the checkpoint screening security fund, which would authorize $250 million for FY2008. Therefore, this legislation could end up only as an exercise in futility should appropriators not allocate funds for these programs. House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson conceded that he may have included more authorization levels had there been more time, ``But, in the spirit of `let's get it done,' we'll work it out.'' Ramming through legislation with the expectation that legitimate concerns and problems with legislation will be addressed at some later date is not the way to protect our citizens, and it is certainly a haphazard manner in which to pass laws. 
   National security is not an issue that should hinge on ``rough drafts'' of proposals awaiting future refinement. If there is a need to reform our nationals security procedures, which I believe there is, it is imperative that we thoroughly consider these issues in Committee with hearings and legislation mark-up sessions. We must always consider national security issues with due deference and the humbling knowledge that every initiative we pass here in Washington will directly impact the security of our constituents at home.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. As Congress contemplates an economic stimulus package to aid our slowing economy, we also must commit ourselves to reduce Federal spending. 
   As American families tighten their budgets to weather this impending economic storm, Congress should match their sacrifice. While reducing taxes is important, another aspect is to control the Federal deficits, the Federal spending. A decrease in wasteful spending would directly increase the value of the dollar and ultimately lower deficits. 
   The American people and businesses are better at deciding what to do with their money than the Federal Government. With more money in their hands, an increase in investment in our economy and in increase in personal savings would take hold and ultimately lead to a stronger and growing economy. 
   As we in Congress consider this one-time stimulus package over the next few weeks, I contend that a long-term solution to this problem is to lower spending, which will in turn lead to lower taxes and a permanent economic bounce and revitalization.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - December 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. As Chairman Barton has pointed out, it has been bipartisan, with 51 people voting for it and no one voting against it. We had a conscientious markup, particularly on several amendments. These amendments were defeated so that we had a little compromise involved. 
   A lot of Americans should realize that the Consumer Product Safety Commission came into existence in 1973 as the agency to ensure consumer products, including toys, not to pose risks of injuries to our families, illness or death to consumers. Lots of times products are not used properly, and that causes a problem.     
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission cannot guarantee safety if the consumers don't use their products properly. 
   They have 15,000 different products that they have to promulgate with standards. Fortunately, the Commission rarely has had to promulgate mandatory standards for all these products and can rely on voluntary standards that are simply developed by the industry itself. 
   This bill, as Mr. Barton pointed out, is going to be signed in very short order after we pass this under suspension. 
   Many of the Members on both sides talked about the growing compliance shortfalls with toys that are manufactured outside the United States, particularly in China. Specifically, our attention was focused on the spate of recalls which increased dramatically for toys with lead-based paints exceeding the United States limit. This was a problem we have rarely seen in 30 years since we passed the Federal ban on lead-based paint. I am pleased to report that manufacturers and retailers have stepped up to the plate in testing in response to these problems, and that's good. 
   Nevertheless, my colleagues, toys have not been the only problem this year, as imports of every type of product increasingly account for our supply of goods, particularly from China. As our imports have risen over the years, so have the number of problems that have been associated with these products that come in. But the Consumer Product Safety Commission has met this daunting challenge and, as you can imagine, with 15,000 different kinds of products, they have issued more recalls over the last 2 years than any other time in our history. Despite this, we recognized the need to provide the Commission with additional resources, which we are doing today. We authorize significant increases in their budget so that the Commission may fulfill their mission to keep defective products that can cause injury, or worse, out of the stream of commerce. 
   So, I'm pleased to report that the omnibus bill we passed this week includes increased appropriations for the Commission, so they're getting new resources. 
   This bill is good public policy that not only provides the Commission with new resources, but, as was pointed out, much, much more. It provides for new standards regarding lead paint and implements the most stringent standard ever for lead content in children's products. The bill requires testing and certification of children's products before they are ever shipped to store shelves, and provides increased penalties for companies that violate the law. 
   New laboring requirements will help facilitate effective recalls, and the bill provides greater authority for the Commission to recall harmful products and notify the public of these dangers. Very important; they have this extra recall authority. 
   We have worked with the consumer groups, industry, and the Commission to make this a bipartisan, sound bill that works effectively. So I commend Chairman Rush, I commend, obviously, Mr. Dingell, and I commend our ranking member, Chairman Barton, on their willingness to make this an open process. We talked about it, and the result is what we see today, a bipartisan bill that has the support of the House. 
   So, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I look forward to its implementation into law.

Proponents of the new Senate proposal claim it would encourage illegal aliens in the United States to reveal their true identity and all affiliations they may have. My colleagues, this flies in the face of all reason, particularly when this legislation provides potential terrorists in the United States the simple option to create new identities with the help of our own government. 
   Within 180 days after the President signs the legislation, the Department of Homeland Security would start handing out probationary Z visas. Because the bill doesn't require the alien to produce a foreign passport proving his identity, these terrorists will have little trouble getting by the system with forged documents like a fake pay stub or utility bills. A potential terrorist could walk into a Customs office and offer a false, clean name, and then go about their business. This is wrong, Mr. Speaker. That is why we should reject the Senate immigration bill.

For years I have been working on securing funding for an addition to the Malcom Randall VA Hospital in my district, which will help to correct some of the patient privacy deficiencies this hospital has been experiencing over the years. 
   This facility will address the acute needs of our local veterans by providing them with state-of-the-art, private patient rooms, and the convenience of high quality VA medical care. The funding authorized by this legislation will go toward a five-story, 245,000 square foot facility consisting of four floors of new patient beds and one floor of supporting medical services. This new Bed Tower will have 228 new beds, and will also house a 10-bed ER, Chest Pain Unit, and ENT, Ophthalmology, Urology, and Hematology Clinics. 
   The Malcom Randall VA Hospital is one of the busiest and efficient VA facilities in the country, and the veterans in my district will benefit greatly from this new Bed Tower. I thank my colleague, Mr. Filner, for introducing this important legislation, and I look forward to the completion of this new Bed Tower in Gainesville.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (THE GOVERNMENT BAILS OUT FANNIE AND FREDDIE -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, it's no secret that our country is facing economic uncertainty with a rapidly rising national debt and a lingering housing and mortgage crisis. Just weeks ago, our Congress orchestrated a sweeping effort to prop up government-sponsored enterprises--GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--which own or insure half of our Nation's mortgages by exposing American taxpayers to vast financial risk. Now, just this past weekend, the Treasury has finalized a plan to officially bail out Fannie and Freddie, a step I had hoped our government would not be forced to take. 
   It used to be argued that simply chartering Freddie and Fannie didn't mean that the Federal Government was on the hook if these mortgage giants collapsed, but now no one can make that case anymore. The recent and worrisome events occurring in the United States' housing market have revealed that the Federal Government bears significant risk in its chartering of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Although these two GSEs are supposed to make the American dream come true, the reality is that they are contributing relatively little to the overall quality of the U.S. housing finance system. 
   At the same time, they have created exorbitant risks both for the taxpayers and for the entire economic system that cannot be adequately addressed by simple regulation alone. Over the years, Fannie and Freddie have been allowed to incur $5.2 trillion in debt by borrowing $1.5 trillion and by guaranteeing mortgage-backed securities worth almost $4 trillion. Unfortunately, since January of this year, Fannie and Freddie's stock has also declined by about 90 percent. The collapse of these two, their common shares, coupled with the current credit, housing and mortgage crisis and illiquidity of our markets, has clearly demonstrated that the financial and regulatory structures we have been operating have failed us. 
   With the hasty passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (H.R. 3221), which I voted against, Congress granted the Treasury a broad new authority to inject capital into the struggling mortgage giants if that's needed. To the surprise of few, with a collapse imminent, the Treasury decided this past weekend it would transfer the control of Fannie and Freddie and place it into conservatorship, which is akin to the filing of chapter 11 bankruptcy. The Treasury will now commence with buying mortgage-backed securities from banks in the open market at the expense of American taxpayers. 
   Although this move will probably lower interest rates on home loans by, maybe, about 1 percent, the bailout won't stabilize home prices or swiftly curb the rate of foreclosures, which are currently at an all-time high. Thus, the immediate effect of the Treasury bailout of Fannie and Freddie will serve to benefit, for the most part, international stock exchanges and large central banks in foreign countries. To be specific, one of the biggest, immediate beneficiaries of this bailout will be the central banks in Asia, such as the People's Bank of China, which has billions invested in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds. 
   Four years ago, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee: ``The existence or even the perception of government backing undermines the effectiveness of market discipline,'' and he was right. 
   We must find an effective way to free our economy from the grips of this avoidable financial instability. In order to do so, Fannie and Freddie must be restructured and set on a path towards gradual privatization, for placing Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship is not a good long-term solution. Privatization is the most viable solution to mitigating the enormous risks posed by these out-of-control GSEs. 
   To be sure we never find ourselves in this situation again, Fannie and Freddie must be removed entirely from the government's account, be placed in direct competition with other financial institutions and be subjected to the effective discipline of the U.S. market. In this way, we can stabilize these important mortgage firms, restore confidence to investors and shareholders and relieve American taxpayers from the burden of another costly bailout. 
   Also, I call for an immediate investigation by this body into Freddie Mac's unreported financial results of almost $9 billion. Let's ask former CEO  Franklin Raines to explain these fraudulent audits that were presented. 
   The American people deserve better than what these GSEs have to offer. We cannot allow them to leave us with a legacy of debt to be shouldered by hardworking Americans, for as Thomas Jefferson so aptly said a long time ago, ``[the] principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling our future on a very large scale.''

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2419, a $289 billion bill which will subsidize wealthy farmers and agribusiness, increase welfare benefits, violate pay-go rules, and will not dent our current energy needs, all paid for by the American taxpayer. 
   Folks, this country is facing an impending entitlement crisis. In the next few years millions of baby boomers will begin to retire and begin collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits. However, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Social Security will begin to pay out more in benefits than it takes in payroll taxes by 2020, and Medicare spending, that is already 13 percent of our Nations budget, will double over the next 10 years. Yet, this Democrat lead Congress sees fit to grant farm subsidies to farmers who are making up to $2.5 million in income per year. 
   As crop prices soar, American farm incomes are achieving record highs. Since enactment of the last farm bill in 2002, key crop prices have grown as much as 281 percent, and total farm income has more than doubled. More and more farmers are now multimillionaires. With $20 billion in increased spending, this bill irresponsibly wastes taxpayer dollars by subsidizing an industry whose profits are soaring. The evidence is clear; the Department of Agriculture estimates that the 2007 farm income was $87.5 billion, which totals a 48 percent increase from the previous year's level of $59 billion. 
   The search for alternative energy sources is vital to our country's national and economic security. However, this farm bill will extend tax and tariff subsidies for ethanol, while keeping in place the Federal ethanol mandate. This has directly resulted in the price of a bushel of corn in this country to triple and has failed to ease our energy crisis. The ethanol mandate to produce alternative energy has pushed up the prices not only of corn, but also of crops such as soybeans that have been abandoned by many farmers during this current corn-planting bonanza. Despite these steep price increases, large subsidies for these crops will continue under this wasteful bill and rising food costs will continue to be thrown upon our citizens. 
   I support our country's farmers and agree that a Federal farm program should be in place to alleviate farming poverty. However, with crop prices rising to record-breaking levels, and farm incomes doubling over the past 7 years, I cannot support a bill that seeks to subsidize multimillionaire farmers on the backs of tax paying Americans.

   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an organization in my district in Leesburg, Florida, that is making a difference for the people of Florida. 
   Florida's Hometown U.S.A. was formed to instill in Florida's youth the value of volunteer service. Students from across the State are selected each year to participate in the program. Each year five students are selected from elementary school to high school as participants. The volunteers' focus is on helping children and the elderly by providing food, clothes, personal care items, and assistance wherever it is needed. 
   Each year the organization holds its Florida Hometown U.S.A. pageant, which serves as its main fundraiser. Florida's Hometown U.S.A. program has received recognition for the positive impact and outcome it has achieved in the local communities. 
   I want to congratulate these fine young volunteers, especially the fine young students who are selected every year, and especially program director Linda Watts, for all she has done over the past 22 years. She has enhanced the community of Leesburg which I represent. Thank you, Linda, for all of your hard work. Keep up your hard work for the program, and God bless you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the decision of British Prime Minister Tony Blair to resign on June 27th marks the end of an era in U.S.-British relationships. Blair's extraordinarily close alliance with President Bush has been a major force on the world stage since the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001. 
   The Prime Minister has been an eloquent and passionate leader in confronting global terrorism. He deserves credit for his central role in the global war on terrorism and for having the courage to act on his convictions in the face of tremendous opposition within his own party and from other European governments. 
   His steadfast support for the United States in the 4 years since 2001 and his key role in building the international coalition of the willing demonstrated principled leadership as well as vision. 
   The strong U.S.-British relationship will certainly endure under Blair's successor. However, there is no doubt that this relationship was made better because of Tony Blair.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS OF VETERANS EDUCATE TODAY'S STUDENTS (VETS) DAY -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is a simple resolution, just basically expressing support for the goals of Veterans Educate Today's Students Day, and for other purposes. I believe that in this case it will be November 10, the day before Veterans Day, when this will be celebrated. So obviously we need to support this resolution. It expresses the sense of the support of Congress for the goals of this VETS Day. 
   It is noticeable that we recognize the importance of educating the children of today about this sacrificial history of veterans and their families so close to the national day of honor for those same veterans, which is on November 11, Veterans Day. 
   My colleagues, the number of veterans today is not as large as it used to be. The children in schools are less likely to have a parent, uncle or aunt who served in the military who could tell them about their experiences. My father served in Iwo Jima. He could tell me about his experience during that Pacific war. He has since been deceased. But I remember him talking about it and how much education it was for me. So those from the Greatest Generation who have passed from this world leave behind a legacy of courage, loyalty, and honor. This legacy was picked up and continued by the next generation of veterans from the Korean War, the Vietnam War, military engagements in Haiti and Kosovo, Gulf War I, and today in the current conflicts in Afghanistan and in Iraq. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, to set aside a specific day to educate our children about the sacrifice, the gallantry of our Nation's heroes demonstrates the importance of that service. It is because of them that we still have the freedom in this Chamber and the freedom we cherish today. 
   Now, some school districts are already taking steps in this direction by inviting veterans to speak in their classrooms on Veterans Day and share their stories with the students and all the teachers. We should encourage this worthwhile educational activity in more schools across the Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of H. Con. Res. 60. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I will conclude by saying that obviously encouraging the people of the United States to participate in local and national activities, recognizing Veterans Educate Today's Students Day, or VETS Day, is something that we should remind all Americans about  how important it is and realize that it not only fosters education of our youth, but it also provides the veterans an opportunity to explain things perhaps that no one has ever asked them or taken the time to say, what was it like? So in a way, it is an opportunity for them, as well as the students. 
   I urge adoption of this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (NATIONAL HEROES CREDIT PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I think we've talked about this bill, and it's a very good bill. I thought I might take from my colleagues and just read the summary of it just to remind ourselves that H.R. 513 is to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to enhance the protection of credit ratings of active duty military personnel who are activated for military service. 
   And the question usually comes up on some of these bills, what do they cost. Mr. Brady, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, talked about that. So we have a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate that I would share with my colleagues, and it says, ``The requirements imposed on credit reporting agencies would be private sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the UMRA. CBO suspects the cost of the mandates would be minimal and unlikely to exceed the threshold for private sector mandates established in the UMRA.'' 
   So, I think we have a bill that we can all support. So, obviously on this side, we do support it. 
   The bill, as amended, will improve the protections of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by providing the opportunity for certain servicemembers experiencing financial difficulties, while deployed, to simply request that their credit record be annotated to reflect simply that deployment. It also requires the credit industry to take such deployment into consideration. 
   This new protection, my colleagues, would cover credit accounts opened before the servicemember was deployed. While these protections are important, it is also critical that Members understand that such an annotation may have adverse effects on their credit rating, despite all the existing laws prohibiting such actions. Therefore, my colleagues, the bill also requires the National Credit Bureau to inform applicants of that potential in writing. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I think that, in terms of its strong support for veterans, and in their case, when they're deployed, I urge support for the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thought again I would just say that H. Res. 770, summarized, it says ``it encourages public participation in a nationwide project that collects and preserves the stories of the men and women who served our Nation in times of war and conflict.'' 
   This is very appropriate, and we're coming to Veterans Day. And I commend Jon Porter from Nevada for sponsoring this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   In 2000, Congress unanimously voted to create the Veterans History Project as part of the American Folk Life Center at the Library of Congress. Since its creation, the Veterans History Project has collected thousands of veterans' accounts of their military experiences. My staff has actually gone down to my district with a tape recorder and was participating, recording these histories with our veterans. Each of these accounts is easily accessible on the history project's Web site and will be an invaluable source for future generations. 
   While there are several ways to record a veteran's history, the most common form of record in this project is through oral interviews. That is what my staff did. They would stand at the town square, and we notified through the newspapers that these individuals could come in. They would come in, and through a tape recorded oral interview, we were able to do that. These oral interviews are conducted all across the country by volunteer interviewers. These narrations provide a firsthand account of the courageous and patriotic sacrifices of our Nation's veterans. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I am happy that this resolution calls on all Americans to take time to interview at least one veteran in their family or their community; just a simple request. With over 17 million wartime veterans living in the United States, we have our work cut out for us. And my colleagues, I think it's imperative that we increase participation in the program while members of these great generations are still among us. And we don't have long to do so. 
   So, I want to thank Chairman Filner and the ranking member, Mr. Buyer, for bringing this important resolution to the floor. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I recognize the author of the bill, the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Porter), for 3 minutes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important resolution, H. Res. 744, obviously, recognizing the contributions of Native American veterans is important, and asking the President to issue a proclamation urging the people of the United States to also observe a day of honor for Native American veterans. My colleague from California has talked about this. It's interesting; we recognize the contributions of Native American veterans to our society and, of course, by so doing, we are recognizing their achievements, their singular achievements, if I might add. I compliment the resolution that was introduced by my good friend, the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson), and the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Ms. Herseth Sandlin) for their support and also their prescience for bringing this bill forward. 
   We have Veterans Day less than a week away, my colleagues. I think it's important this body recognize one often overlooked group of veterans. These veterans have made numerous contributions to the United States military, not just recently in World War II, but as far back as the War of 1812. Currently, there are 195,000 Native American veterans who live in the United States. According to the U.S. Army Center of Military History Web site, there have been 24 Native American Medal of Honor recipients since the Civil War. Let me just repeat that. There have been, according to the U.S. Army Center of Military History Web site, there have been 24 Native American Medal of Honor recipients. 
   During World War II, we know about the Navajo Code Talkers, whose ranks  in the Pacific Theater exceeded 400 during World War II, and in all six Marine divisions from 1942 to 1945. They were credited with saving thousands of lives and actually hastening the end of the war itself. At the time of the war, World War II, fewer than 30 non-Native speakers understood the Navajo's unwritten language. The size and simple complexity of the language made the code extremely difficult to comprehend, much less decipher. In fact, it was not until 1968 that the United States Government declassified the code. The Japanese never were able to decode this code. So that is a compliment to their accomplishments with the Navajo Code Talkers. In fact, there has been a movie made on it. 
   In Congress, we have begun to recognize the extraordinary achievement from veterans such as these. This past June, the House passed H.R. 366. This was introduced by Congressman John Sullivan of Oklahoma, naming the Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the Ernest Childers Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic. This man was a Native American from the Creek nation, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during World War II. 
   In addition, the House passed H.R. 2546, which names the Asheville VA Medical Center after another brave Native American, PFC Charles George. He also was honored with the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions in the Korean War. H.R. 2546 was passed last week by the Senate and now is awaiting the President's signature. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it is because of the gallant actions of our Native American veterans like those of Lieutenant Colonel Childers and PFC George, as well as the bravery and fortitude of the Navajo Code Talkers who served with the Marines, that I and other Members are proud to sponsor this resolution. We urge its passage. It actually recognizes the many contributions throughout the history of our Nation of our Native American veterans in protecting the freedoms that we enjoy in this country today. So I encourage all Americans, take time to recognize the sacrifice and achievement of these veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, as mentioned, the EEOC, which is the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, has accused the Salvation Army of allegedly discriminating against two of their employees in a Boston area thrift store for requiring them to speak English on the job. 
   Mr. Chairman, the amendment would prevent the EEOC from using any appropriated funds to initiate a civil action or file a motion in any courts on the grounds that the organization, in this case the Salvation Army, requires an employee to speak English while engaged in work. 
   The question I have is, how do you discriminate against a person who speaks English on the job? This amendment was prompted by this lawsuit filed in April by the EEOC against the Salvation Army, which has helped thousands of people in countries all over the world. Can't you hire people today who speak English? The two employees were given 1 year to learn English in order to speak the language you and I are speaking in the House today and the language spoken by our coworkers; however, these folks failed to try to learn even some basic English and were fired. 
   Even though the Salvation Army clearly posted the rule and gave the two employees a year to learn English, the EEOC lawyers filed a lawsuit seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars in monetary damages to compensate the employees for ``the emotional pain, suffering and inconvenience'' they suffered by being asked to speak English to the best of their ability while on the job. 
   In 2003, a Federal judge in Boston upheld the Salvation Army's policy requiring workers to speak English while on the job. However, the EEOC did not like this ruling, so they are continuing to harass the Salvation Army. 
   Now, the Salvation Army, as we all know, is a Christian evangelical organization whose sole mission is to help the downtrodden, the blind, the sick and anyone else in need. Their personnel standing on cold street corners during Christmastime is something to behold, ringing a bell on behalf of the poor. They collect and sell donated clothes and household items in their thrift stores to raise money for the poor, operate soup kitchens, and hire people that no one else will. 
   Since 1865, this organization has lived by Christ's teaching that as we do unto the least of our people, we do unto the Lord. Now this organization is in trouble for insisting its employees learn to speak English in order to better serve these lofty goals. Remember, the Salvation Army was trying to help their employees by encouraging them to simply learn the English language. 
   EEOC has crossed the line in its overzealous pursuit of companies that require English in the workplace. Only Congress can bring this organization back to its intended mission. If we don't, the continued proliferation of English-related lawsuits will cause employers facing close hiring decisions to hire defensively, to the detriment of new immigrants with marginal English proficiency. While the children of immigrants typically learn English in our school system, adult immigrants are most likely to learn or improve language skills for work-related reasons often through programs that are simply hosted by the employers themselves. 
   This arrangement is ordinarily a win-win situation. The immigrant is encouraged to gain a full knowledge skill that improves his work efforts and civic engagement, and the employer benefits from having employees that can communicate with one another. So the EEOC's policy takes a mutually beneficial situation and injects the constant fear of litigation on employers. Most importantly, since the EEOC's funds are fungible, every dollar it uses to pursue these cases is a dollar not being spent on pursuing the kind of discrimination that the EEOC was originally created to combat. 
   These are our tax dollars, my colleagues, yours and mine, paying the salaries of the EEOC lawyers, who file endless lawsuits, while the Salvation Army must use its own funds, funds that would be better used helping the poor, instead of hiring more attorneys to fight these kinds of cases in court. The EEOC should instead focus its limited resources on the current backlog of 54,265 complaints, instead of wasting time and taxpayer money on policies that serve to achieve unity in our country. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and help protect the charities like the Salvation Army.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank the distinguished chairman, and let me answer some of the criticism from that side of the aisle. 
   The gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan) talked about that this is not a recent problem, that all administrations before with regard to the EEOC have been following this pattern, and that is not true. The gentlelady from Tennessee pointed out there has been a 612 percent increase since 1996. In fact, there has been a large increase just recently. So this is not something that has been going on for the past 40 years; it is a more recent phenomenon. 
   So we here in Congress should realize that we have every right to prejudge. We have three equal branches of government. We have the executive, judicial and the legislative or Congress. We have the right to say to the EEOC, which is a government agency, the priorities you are establishing are wrong. I mean, as I pointed out earlier, this particular agency has a 54,000-case backlog, and it looks like it is going to  go to 64,000. It is going to be a 10,000-case increase. 
   Should they be spending all of their time trying to intimidate employers? Employers simply want to hire employees that speak English. Are the employees going to be so scared that when they hire this employee they are going to be sued by the EEOC because they are saying to the employee, ``We think it will be helpful for you to speak English to our customers''? 
   But as the Salvation Army did, they said, We will send you to a class for 1 year and you can learn English. So we will hire you, let you be trained, and hopefully after a year you will be conversant in English. These people didn't follow through and didn't even go to the classes. So what did the Salvation Army do, they simply said, We will have to fire you. 
   They talked to them, they counseled them, and then they said, We will have to let you go because you are not speaking English proficiently enough so that our customers can understand you, and we are an organization that simply has a mission to help and serve people, and we can't communicate with these people because you cannot speak English. So please go to this class that we are going to pay for and help you with this training. These people would not go, and so they were fired. 
   So now the EEOC lawyers are saying to its agency this case is of the highest priority. We are going to forget these 54,000 cases backlogged in America, and we are going to go after the Salvation Army. 
   ``God help us'' is the words that Mr. Obey used. I say God help us if employers in this country cannot hire employees who speak English. We have every right to judge. This is not morally wrong, as Mr. Obey said, or constitutionally wrong. This is simply Congress saying set your priorities EEOC. Let the employers hire people who speak English. And we support the concept of what the EEOC is trying to do, to enact civil legislation against people who are discriminated against in the workplace. We understand that. We accept that. But this is a case of priorities. This is a case where Congress has every right as an equal branch to say this is wrong. I commend the chairman from New Jersey for his support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of the University of Florida's finest student-athletes--the Gators great quarterback and 2007 Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Tebow. As the Representative for the University of Florida, I am pleased to take this opportunity to commend a deserving young man who has, and continues to be, an inspiration to students, athletes, and sports fans across the country. 
   Many know that Tim Tebow is an outstanding athlete and one of the best quarterbacks in the country. As a freshman, he was instrumental in helping the Gators win the  2006 national championship. This past season, Tim threw for 29 touchdowns and ran for 22 touchdowns becoming the first player in major college football history to run and pass for over 20 touchdowns in the same season. Furthermore, Tim's total of 51 touchdowns was a Southeastern Conference record and his 22 rushing touchdowns also set a new conference record as well as a national collegiate record for quarterbacks. Tim's season culminated by becoming the first sophomore to win college football's most coveted and prestigious award, the Heisman Trophy. 
   The University of Florida is now the only school in the SEC to have three Heisman winners and one of eight schools nationally to have three winners of the prestigious award. 
   While his achievements on the field are well documented, what many people may not know is that Tim is also a dedicated student who consistently maintains a 3.77 grade point average at one of the Nation's top universities. This is no easy task. His classroom excellence earned Tim first-team Academic All-American honors, becoming only the fourth sophomore in UF history to earn this honor. Tim's ability to balance his commitments to both school and football is truly a testament to his exemplary character and his desire to succeed. 
   Tim Tebow is a leader on and off the field. His parents have instilled in him a sense of community spirit and compassion for his fellow man, which is evident through his missionary work in the Philippines and his commitment to visiting hospitals across the U.S.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (END THE OCS MORATORIUM -- (House of Representatives - June 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Good morning, Madam Speaker. 
   A question for all of us: Why would the most powerful economy in the world leave so much of its own energy sources untapped? 
   Alone among all the countries, the United States has placed a substantial amount of its oil and natural gas potential off limits. Other countries have the potential to drill just off their shores, but United States' firms face strict restrictions on drilling in most offshore areas even as American drivers face sharply higher prices at the gas pump. 
   Domestic oil and gas production has failed to keep pace with the growing demand both domestically and abroad, but it's not because we're not lacking for domestic energy. Since the 1990s, the Federal Government has placed severe restrictions on new energy development, particularly in some of our most promising areas. 
   As this graph shows, Congress has placed over 85 percent of our Outer Continental Shelf off limits. Back then, oil and natural gas were cheap, and the need for additional energy was not considered significant. Also, the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill led to the heightened environmental concerns about offshore energy production. 
   Environmental concerns took precedence over future economic considerations. Soon, access to 85 percent of federally controlled offshore areas had been restricted, including the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and portions of the area off the shores of Alaska and off the eastern Gulf of Mexico. No one knows how much energy lies in those areas, but many agree there is enough to bring stability to energy markets and to make a real difference in oil and natural gas prices for many years to come. 
   According to a recent Interior Department study, restricted offshore areas are known to contain--and this is a fact--15 billion barrels of oil and 60 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but literally, when they go to estimate beyond the hard facts, the estimate goes up to 86 billion barrels of oil and even higher and to 420 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough oil to replace all of our imports for the next 27 years at current rates. In fact, it may be even higher given that most of the off-limit areas have not been thoroughly explored. 
   New technology and what we estimate based upon the 1980s is probably not correct. Our policies need to catch up with our times. Oil and natural gas prices have tripled since the 1990s. Demand continues to increase by a steady 1.5 percent per year. Imports have increased. Political stability in oil-producing nations has decreased. Domestic production has flattened, all while our ability to extract resources without environmental damage has increased dramatically. 
   With all of this energy out there, with demands at all-time highs and with prices remaining high, what has taken so long? 
   The biggest problem has been environmental concerns, being worried about a spill. What would it do to the tourist industry, for example, in the gulf coast areas? The National Academy of Sciences says, ``Improved production technology and safety training of personnel have dramatically reduced both blowouts and daily operational spills.'' 
   The danger of such spills has been greatly reduced. Of the more than 7 billion barrels of oil pumped offshore in the past 25 years, 0.001 percent--that is one thousandth of 1 percent--has been spilled. In fact, even during Katrina and Rita, during winds that reached 170 miles per hour and during lashing waves that took out a quarter of America's domestic energy production, no significant spills were reported. Furthermore, Cuba wants to let the Chinese drill in some of the very parts of the gulf that American producers are forbidden to touch, some as close as 45 miles off the Florida coast. 
   Do we truly believe the environmental safeguards of Chinese energy firms are better than ours? 
   It's time we stop assuming that all energy exploration is bad. Most takes place too far from the coast to be seen, and we haven't even had a spill from offshore drilling in over 40 years, neither has Canada, which permits drilling off its Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in the Great Lakes where some rigs are closer to U.S. shores than American producers are permitted to drill. 
   Madam Speaker, America's energy problems are partially self-imposed,  and that needs to end. Congress overreacted in the 1990s, and it needs to undo that damage. Our need for affordable energy will not decrease, and the time has come to lift the restrictions on offshore energy production and to let U.S. producers do what they can do to meet our growing energy demands. It's time for this Congress to get serious about bridging the growing gap between supply and demand. Opening the Outer Continental Shelf to environmentally sound exploration could be just the way to do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and accomplishments of a terrific Member, former Congressman Henry Hyde. He's often recognized for his wisdom and his eloquence of speaking. But, frankly, there were some other sides of him that were very precious. He was a man of quick wit and a keen sense of humor, to which I was always a willing audience.  
   Above all, he was passionately committed to protecting and improving the lives of Americans, all Americans, both born and the unborn. He was an effective pro-life advocate, through prohibiting Federal funding of abortions with the Hyde amendment and his advocacy for the ban on partial-birth abortions. Conservative estimates indicate that there are about 2 million Americans alive today as a direct result of his work. 
   Henry Hyde leaves behind a legacy that inspires and challenges those of us who remain behind today. 
   My deepest condolences and sympathy to his family, and may God bless Henry Hyde.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (THE INFORMED CHOICE ACT, H.R. 223 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday there was a pro-life rally here in Washington, DC. In fact, the 22nd annual rally. I thought I would take a moment and talk about some of the innovations involved with ultrasound equipment which is very beneficial for women who are pregnant who wish to look at the fetus. 
   Recently, my colleagues, National Geographic presented a 2-hour program charting the fetal development of several mammals with the use of new generation ultrasound imagery. Physicians created a stunning portrait of a mammal in utero, but just imagine the reaction of parents today when viewing a 3-D fetal snapshot of their unborn son or daughter smiling back at them. 
   Professor Stuart Campbell, one of the world's leading experts in obstetrics, believes that ever improving imagery, particularly moving from 3-D to 4-D scanning, which are inching closer and closer to actually displaying real-time movements, represents the tip of the iceberg for fetal behavior study. 
   As with these amazing images, ultrasound technology provides parents-to-be with a window into the womb which can result in a stronger parent-child bond, better prenatal treatment and also supply doctors with obviously an advanced understanding of fetal development and behavior. 
   Today's ultrasound equipment is better than ever and the technology will improve even better over time. Such images allow physicians to readily identify critical health problems such as spina bifida, heart complications, neural tube defects, and genetic syndromes. Ultrasound imagery brings many benefits to women, their unborn children and, of course, to our health care system in general. Continued research, breakthrough developments, and preventative care could save millions of dollars. 
   Public health advocates know that access to early, high-quality prenatal care is key to maternal and newborn health. Therefore, this prenatal care should include ultrasound equipment. Sonograms can diagnose serious complications that can be easily avoided if discovered early on during a pregnancy. Four-dimensional imaging shows objects in 3-D moving close to real time. Doctors have long known that fetuses move, but the physical behavior revealed by these scans is expanding upon their knowledge exponentially. The possibilities of improving the health of women and their unborn children are endless. 
   Mr. Speaker, these advanced ultrasound images can give women an opportunity for better prenatal health and decrease risks during pregnancy not only for themselves but obviously for their unborn child. Unfortunately, there are a lot of women today that cannot afford access to this critical medical service. These underprivileged  women do not have the option of safeguarding their health and prenatal well-being. Therefore, I have introduced the Informed Choice Act, H.R. 223. This legislation authorizes Health and Human Services to establish simple grants for not-for-profit and community-based health clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment. The centers that purchase these machines will be able to provide free examinations to women who are unable to obtain access to this critical care. That is, women that are poor. Each year, these pregnancy centers serve hundreds of thousands of women, ranging from girls barely in their teens to women in their mid to late thirties. Many of these women are among the poorest of the poor. For them, the free care that they receive is an essential lifeline. Access to ultrasound equipment is clearly one of the best things that this Congress can do to promote women's health and prenatal care. 
   Women understand the importance of ultrasound equipment. A recent poll confirms this. In order to provide women in crisis pregnancies with sufficient prenatal care and the full scope of information about their pregnancy, I urge my colleagues today to cosponsor my legislation. It is clear that these women view ultrasounds as an essential resource, a resource for women who are faced with unplanned pregnancies struggling with that prime decision. Additionally, the Focus on the Family organization found that an overwhelming 84 percent of women surveyed decide against abortion after viewing an ultrasound of their unborn baby. 
   Women have a right to know what is going on during their pregnancy. These ultrasound images, specifically with the 3-D and 4-D technology, depict fetuses beyond 24 weeks sucking their thumbs, sticking their tongues out and even making emotional faces. 
   So again, my colleagues, I urge you to join me in protecting the health of women and their unborn children by cosponsoring the Informed Choice Act, H.R. 223. This bill is about giving vulnerable women the information they need about their pregnancy and making this critical technology available to all Americans.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (AIR FORCE GENERAL MOSELEY AND SECRETARY WYNNE SHOULD BE HONORED, NOT FIRED -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the June 5 forced resignations of Air Force Secretary Michael W. Wynne and Chief of Staff General T. Michael Moseley represent the first time in United States history the top uniformed and civilian leaders of any service were ousted simultaneously. The actions of Secretary of Defense Gates are totally unprecedented and deserve deeper scrutiny and inquiry. 
   Successful leaders must focus on today's problems while simultaneously anticipating future challenges. The tenures of Moseley and Wynne were defined by these characteristics. They cultivated a service that was second to none. 
   Moseley and Wynne developed and employed new technology, such as the unmanned aerial vehicles that are yielding unparalleled effects on the battlefield. They also recognized that the Air Force has to adapt to a changing world, and they directed the service to build competencies in new areas such as cyberspace and alternative fuels. And finally, Wynne and Moseley took action to re-capitalize the Air Force's aging fleet with a wide array of assets, including the tanker, the F-22, and the next generation bombers. These are steps that will prove essential as the service confronts future challenges. 
   Secretary Gates' real reasons for the firing of Secretary Wynne and General Moseley may never be known. However, I have come to believe that his stated reasons do not necessarily match up with reality. The publicly stated reason was primarily because of the violation in sending nuclear control units to Taiwan. Perhaps the real reason for the firings is because of disagreements on the strategic defense of this Nation. 
   The parts that were in violation were removed from the nuclear control list in 1991. The parts shipped were just special lamps. Moseley and Wynne had approved a correction on this matter and were spending over $1 billion to make those corrections. If Secretary Gates, or others in the Pentagon, had some concerns, they could have voiced those concerns much earlier. 
   In addition, it is important for the Secretary to release the full report by Admiral Kirkland Donald, who investigated the case of the mistaken shipment to Taiwan. Admiral Donald's findings directly led to the firing of Moseley and Wynne, and the report should be made public as soon as possible. I call on the Secretary tonight to make this report public. 
   Now, there have been reports that Moseley and Wynne constantly clashed with the Secretary of Defense's office over greater procurement of the F-22. In order to avoid a showdown with the Air Force, the Defense Department decided that instead of closing down the F-22 line, it would restrict how many planes the Air Force could buy and leave the ultimate decision to the next administration. 
   The F-22 will serve as replacements for the aging F-117s and F-15s. The Air Force needs a minimum of 381 F-22s to fill out its 10 air and space expeditionary forces. However, it has been authorized funds for only 183. As a result, the Air Force must keep selected F-15s and F-16s in service much longer than had been expected. Mostly and Wynne fought hard for the F-22 against the wishes of Secretary Gates and his office. 
   Now, considering the impressive record of General Moseley and Secretary Wynne, one must ask why they were forced to resign. While I certainly understand and share the Secretary's concern regarding the Air Force's control over its nuclear inventory, I think the reason for the firings extends far past his publicly stated reason. 
   We had a clash of philosophies here. Moseley and Wynne were not leaders that were content with simply toeing the line for today. They were pushing  hard for the future. This garnered much criticism, with many suggesting that it is impossible to adequately focus on today's challenges if one is also thinking about the future. That's what Secretary Gates believed. He even went so far as to deliver a speech where he disparagingly termed this concept as ``next-waritis.'' Is it not the responsibility of the Secretary of Defense to plan for the future defense of this Nation? 
   Many mistakes that Moseley and Wynne were blamed for can be laid squarely at the feet of the Pentagon leadership. Without a real commitment from the Secretary of Defense' office, many of those problems will persist. To ignore this trend is simply irresponsible. General Moseley and Secretary Wynne understood this. Unfortunately, it led to their dismissal.  
   Responsible military leaders do not have the luxury of focusing on the present at the expense of the future. Failure to anticipate, adopt and learn lies at the core of military disasters. Given the stakes, ``next-war-it is'' is a sacred duty, not a reason for decapitating the leadership of the Air Force. History has taught us repeatedly that those who solely fixate on today's problems will be woefully unprepared to address tomorrow's challenges. Iraq and Afghanistan are obviously important, but we must also respond to global trends and realize that future wars may not always mirror our past conflicts. 
   We must support our military leaders who aggressively tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. Firing Moseley and Wynne for taking this comprehensive view is simply irresponsible and sets a disastrous precedent. Instead, we owe them a debt of gratitude for all they did to help win today's fight and help the nation posture for the future. They understood the complex array of challenges facing the country and I stand resolute in my support for continuing this encompassing approach--the nation cannot afford to consider any other option. 
   Many of the mistakes that Moseley and Wynne were blamed for can be laid squarely at the feet of the Pentagon leadership. Without a real commitment from the Secretary of Defense's office, many of these problems will persist. We cannot ask aircrews to fly in combat missions if their airplanes are falling out of the sky due to structural fatigue. We cannot afford the cost of inefficiencies within the Department of Defense that is created by unnecessary overlap in roles and missions. We cannot ask our Airmen to undertake missions if they are not supported with adequate budgets to facilitate those missions that we as a nation ask them to fulfill. 
   To ignore these trends is simply irresponsible and could prove devastating for the nation. It takes an immense amount of time, planning, and resources to posture for these challenges and we will not have the luxury of any of these elements when what was once a seemingly distant future threat becomes a critical challenge for today. General Moseley and Secretary Wynne understood this. Unfortunately, it led to their dismissals.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, today we will again vote on a Government-run health insurance program for children: one that only a handful of people in the Democrat leadership have crafted, and one which only a handful of  people received before it was introduced under the cover of night. The Democrat leadership, in the 110th Congress, has continually attempted to ram through legislation that has completely ignored the legislative process, and time after time nothing has been accomplished. This behavior is why this Democrat-led Congress has an abysmal 11 percent approval rate. 
   The facts provided by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, state that the bill before us today will provide free Government-run health care to a family, including adults, earning more than $60,000 a year. This bill will also increase taxes on tobacco, the revenue of which will not be set aside for this program, but rather will be put into the Treasury for general use. In addition, this bill allows over 10 percent of the funds allotted to provide health care for low-income children to be used by adults, therefore limiting the amount of money available for needy children. Finally, this legislation fails to ensure that illegal aliens, both children and adults, will not take money away from low-income American children. CBO estimates that under current documentation requirements, 3.7 billion taxpayer dollars will be spent on providing health care to people who have broken our laws and come to our country illegally. 
   The flaws in this legislation are evident and, in my opinion, correctable. Yet, the Democrat leadership refuses to allow this bill to go through the legislative process, a process that has worked in this Chamber for centuries. It is my hope that the Democrat leadership will release their grip on power and allow the legislative process to create a true bipartisan bill so that our Nation's low-income children may receive quality, efficient, and responsible health care.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (COAL TO LIQUID AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States currently imports 60 percent of its oil, and that number is expected to rise to 75 percent in the coming decades. As a country, we need to reduce our dependency on foreign fuel sources and start implementing alternative energy sources that can be found here in the United States. 
   Imported fuels such as crude oil and natural gas are costing this country millions of dollars a year, accounting for about one-third of the U.S. trade deficit. At $45 a barrel, liquid coal fuel is a desirable alternative to the $120 or more barrel of oil. Not only does this innovative fuel cost less, but also coal is one of the most abundant resources in our country. 
   As Congress continues to explore the use of alternative energy sources, we need to look closely at the enormous benefits of coal-to-liquid technology.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, for the last two weeks the Democrats have continued their political games. They have failed to correct the inherent flaws in this legislation and at a closer section by section look it is clear this legislation contains numerous errors. 
   Section 101: provides an appropriation of $9 billion in 2008, 25 percent more than governors of both parties have told CMS would be necessary to fully fund SCHIP next year. 
   Section 211: provides a new citizenship documentation option, but what this new provision does is completely erase the stricter citizenship requirements enacted in the Deficit Reduction Act. The Social Security Administration states that this provision will not guarantee that applicants who use false Social Security Numbers will be identified thus clearly opening the door for millions of illegal aliens becoming enrolled. 
   I hope the other side stops using these children as political pawns and crafts sound legislation that does not throw away tax dollars for votes.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (RECOGNIZING OVER 200 YEARS OF SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PRINCIPALITY OF LIECHTENSTEIN -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank my distinguished ranking member and my good friend from Florida and also the chairwoman of the subcommittee. I appreciate your words that you said earlier, and I think you succinctly outlined why this resolution is so important, and I compliment you on your speech. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, if you heard the word ``Liechtenstein,'' and you didn't know anything about this resolution, and you were out on the street and you were talking to people,  and you said to them, what does the word Liechtenstein mean to you, there would probably be a number of things they would say. But I'll bet you one of the things they would say is it sounds like a word of integrity. It sounds like a word of independence. It sounds like a word of idealism. It sounds like a word of responsibility, and it sounds like a word of charm. 
   I have been there. It's a very charming country, it's a very responsible country, it's an independent country, and it's a country that represents idealism, much as the gentlelady from California has talked about when she mentioned that this country had been very responsible. 
   As mentioned, it's 34,000 people. It's a small nation, and accomplishes far more as mentioned earlier in social, political and financial influence than its small size would indicate. Nestled between Switzerland and Austria in the European Alps, Liechtenstein has established a stable and growing democracy, the type of government that we can all be proud of. 
   For over 200 years it has maintained a constitutional monarchy with a vibrant Parliament that employs a strong system, and this is what we believe in in a republic system of government checks and balances. Along with myself and other colleagues, we have had the privilege of visiting Liechtenstein. On several occasions I was introduced to its fascinating history and the people and its commitment to freedom during the last centuries. 
   The Liechtenstein family of Austria was given the rights to the land in 1713, and the area gained the status of an independent principality of the Holy Roman Empire in 1719 under the name Liechtenstein. When, in 1806, Napoleon defeated the Holy Roman Empire, the conquered Emperor made Liechtenstein a sovereign country. 
   Now, my colleagues, unfortunately, the people of Liechtenstein were not granted the full rights and liberties that come with this sovereignty. As under Napoleon, the French occupied the country for the next several years. However, in 1815, within the new German Confederation, Liechtenstein regained its full independence. 
   This country has a long history of diplomacy and peaceful relationships with its neighbors. In 1868, after the Confederation dissolved, Liechtenstein disbanded its army of 80 men and declared its permanent neutrality which, amazingly, was respected throughout both World War I and World War II. That is a feat of diplomacy. 
   In 1989, Prince Hans Adam II succeeded his father to the throne. Then 10 years ago, Prince Adam accomplished a diplomatic feat by settling a 60-year long dispute with Russia over the Liechtenstein's family archives, which had been confiscated during the Soviet occupation of Vienna in 1945 and later moved all to Russia, more specifically, to Moscow. 
   After World War II, Liechtenstein became increasingly important as a financial center. In 1978, this country became a member of the Council of Europe and joined the European Free Trade Association, the EFTA, in 1991. Liechtenstein has been a member of the European Economic Area since May of 1995, and is continuing to work to harmonize its economic policies more closely with the European Union every day. 
   One of Liechtenstein's most industrious resources is its people. It invested much effort in education, and this is something we can all be proud of and respect, they boast a literacy rate of 100 percent.     
   The United States and Liechtenstein have enjoyed a positive relationship for many, many years. In 2002, Liechtenstein and the U.S. signed a mutual legal assistance treaty which focused largely on jointly combating money laundering and other illegal banking activities. In addition, from the beginning of the global war on terror, this country took the initiative and has been a valuable and proactive partner in tracking down the finances of international terrorist groups. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the dangerous world we live in today. In the years following the dreadful attack of September 11, we have been honored by the support and compassion of our friends around the world. We appreciate that. 
   While it is necessary and just to condemn countries for the threat they pose, I believe it is equally important and vital to honor countries for the support that they provide to us. Liechtenstein is one of those countries whose contribution should be recognized. For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to take a closer look at the unique nation of Liechtenstein and join with me this afternoon in honoring this wonderful country. And my hat's off to them, and I urge passage of the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (REGRETTABLE REMITTANCES -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, the immigration problem has been a topic of contentious debate for years now, with few results. The influx, both legal and illegal, of immigrants from Mexico to North America numbers at a minimum about 500,000 people a year. It is clear that the majority of these immigrants are coming to our country for the better wages to provide for their families. And this is the heart of the problem. The Mexican economy is continually stunted in its growth by fiscal mismanagement, corruption, and a perpetual dependence upon foreign aid and remittances. Mexico must make tough decisions and get its economy in shape. Until then, Madam Speaker, we will continue to face massive immigration from the south. 
   While we are painfully aware of the problems illegal immigration is causing our society, consider what it is doing to Mexico in the long run. The massive immigration is draining many villages across Mexico of their important labor pool. Families are separated while the husbands and fathers choose to cross our borders to get better lives for themselves and for their families. Mexico is slow in reforming their economic policies, in part perhaps because of the influx of money from the remittances from the United States that enables them to continue their unhealthy policies. 
   Let me explain. The money sent in the form of remittances amounted to about $23 billion in 2006, according to the Bank of Mexico, the country's central bank. That amount is up almost sevenfold in a dozen years. As that number has grown, the fee for remitting money has dropped from an average of about 9.2 percent in 1999 to just about 3 percent this year, according to Bancomer, a Mexican bank. 
   Sending money back to Mexico has become cheaper partly because the amounts have become bigger. It was about $290 on average 8 years ago, and now is up to over $350. More importantly, according to the Bank of Mexico, over 90 percent of remittances are now sent by electronic wire transfer compared with only 50 percent in 1995. In rural poor communities in Mexico, even the 3 percent transaction fee is a huge chunk cut out of a remittance check. That is why the Bank of Mexico and America's Federal Reserve are running a program called Directo a Mexico, or FedACH International Mexico Service, to cut the cost further for these folks. 
   In this program, people receive an overnight transfer from an American bank account to a Mexican one. The two central banks act as middlemen, taking a cut of about 67 cents no matter what the size of the transaction. According to Elizabeth McQuerry of the Federal Reserve, banks then typically charge $2.50 to $5 to transfer about $350. In total, this new program cuts the costs of remittances by at least half. In America, 200 banks are now signed up for this service compared with just six that signed up when it was initiated in 2004. So far, the program is just beginning, handling about 27,000 transactions a month. However, another point of serious concern is that about 26,000 of which are Social Security payments made by the American government to beneficiaries in Mexico. 
   One kink in the program was that most of Mexico's poor, who are often the intended recipients of the funds, do not have bank accounts to pay them into. So to ensure that these funds can still get to Mexico, they developed another program, run by Bansefi, a Mexican government bank, that allows people in America to open bank accounts for their relatives in Mexico. Their relatives can then use these accounts to withdraw the money deposited through the remittance program. 
   Madam Speaker, another question is, do the legal and illegal immigrants themselves have accounts to send money from? Statistics indicate as many as 70 percent do, according to a recent report by the Bank of Mexico. This is largely because hundreds of American banks, eager for deposits, will happily open accounts for people carrying only a Mexican consular identity card, rather than requiring official United States Government identification. This allows people without officially sanctioned rights to be in this country to send money out of it. As a result, the Mexican bank has seen rapid growth, with 3.4 million accounts  now open, compared to just 850,000 in the year 2001. 
   If this trend continues, Madam Speaker, it will enable the Mexican government to continue to operate as it is today. Their economy will continue to stagnate, immigration will continue to bleed across our border, and the Mexican people will be caught in a downward spiral for generations to come. 
   Obviously another part of any immigration reform is making sure that U.S. banks only open accounts for persons who have legally sanctioned rights to be in this country and not illegal aliens.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. I thank the distinguished chairman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, has been here in Congress the longest, he is the dean of the House of Representatives, and I am sure that he remembers under the Clinton administration when they attempted to expand the discounts for a segment of the population using this same approach you are doing with H.R. 4. In fact, this occurred in 2000 in a hearing on the Veterans Administration. I would like to take you through this, Mr. Dingell, and perhaps even be willing to let you reply to some of the questions I have for you. Because if you think you can repeal the law of economics, you can't, because in 1990, Congress gave Medicaid access to the low prices that are achieved by the Veterans Administration and the results were not good for our veterans. 
   The drug manufacturers in turn reacted. What did they do? It ended up that the deep discounts that the veterans were getting were not provided. In some cases the VA saw the prices for the drugs for our veterans go up by 300 percent. That is why the American Legion has come out against this bill, H.R. 4. They feel it is going to impact veterans so significantly that the prices will go up, like they did in 1990, 300 percent. 
   Advocates of this bill claim that negotiations will lower drug prices for Medicare part D beneficiaries. When I look at my congressional district, almost 80 percent of the seniors on Medicare are covered with drug coverage from Part D and they are all satusfield. So I again can't understand in light of the fact it is going to perhaps see cost-shifting to the veterans in this country like the American Legion thinks, why would you want to change something that is working so fabulously after all the extensive work that the seniors have done to comply and get involved?  
   Various times during the Clinton administration, not the Bush administration, the Clinton administration, proposals were made to expand the discount veterans enjoy to a wider population, just like you want to do today.     
   One was a simple demonstration to add some Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, FEHBP, participants to the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Drug Pricing Program and later to extend the FSS to the Medicare population. Does this sound familiar to my colleagues? So back in 2000, July, the Clinton administration wanted to do precisely what we are doing today. The veterans had a hearing on this. Testimony was offered by the Clinton administration. The Clinton administration officials came out, and let me give you one of their quotes: 
   This is from the honorable Edward Powell, Jr., Assistant Secretary for Financial Management, Department of Veterans Affairs. He said: ``VA is concerned about any significant cost impact to its program resulting from this pilot ..... '' 
   I would just conclude that, Mr. Dingell, this has already been tried. It doesn't work. 
   Veterans' Drug Prices Go Up With H.R. 4 Passage 
   Advocates of H.R. 4 claim that negotiation will lower drug prices for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. This is bad legislation for several reasons. Of special concern to me is the harm it would do to veterans who rely on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care for affordable medications. 
   Various times during the Clinton administration, proposals were made to expand the discounts veterans enjoy to wider populations. One was a demonstration to add some Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan (FEHBP) participants to the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Drug Pricing Program, and later, to extend the FSS to the Medicare population (sound familiar?). On the former, I chaired a hearing July 25, 2000. Testimony, and later analysis, revealed that expanding the discounts veterans get to OPM would have increased drug costs to veterans. Ultimately, the SAMBA demonstration was not carried through because of this objection. 
   Here is some testimony from that hearing: 
   ``..... VA is concerned about any significant cost impact to its program resulting from the pilot .....'' The Honorable Edward A. Powell, Jr., Assistant Secretary For Financial Management, Department Of Veterans Affairs. 
   ``We are concerned that this pilot will increase the cost of pharmaceuticals purchased by the VA and will result in diminished health care for sick and disabled veterans.'' Richard A. Wannemacher, Jr., Assistant National Legislative Director For Medical Affairs, Disabled American Veterans. 
   ``Perhaps it should go without saying, but I must call your attention to the fact that Congress already has spoken on the issue of expanded access to FSS pricing on several previous occasions. In fact, I am aware of at least four separate laws over the past 10 years enacted purely to correct the unintended adverse consequences on VA of changes in federal pharmaceutical pricing laws. In each of these cases. the unintended consequences were the result of a law passed by Congress to achieve some other purpose, and VA was an injured bystander.'' Robert B. Betz, Ph.D., Executive Director, Department of Veterans' Affairs Pharmaceutical Procurement initiative Adding Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan Participants to the Federal Supply Schedule Drug Pricing Program. 
   Following my hearing, an August 2000 GAO report, Prescription Drugs: Expanding Access to Federal Prices Could Cause Other Changes, stated, ``Drug manufacturers could respond to a mandate that they extend federal prices to a larger share of purchasers by adjusting their prices to others. `` 
   Still further, former VA Acting Secretary during the Clinton Administration, Hershel W. Gober, wrote in the Sept-Oct 2004 issue of DAV Magazine ``Similarly, in 1999, when attempts were made to extend the FSS pricing schedule to the Medicare population we estimated that extending discounted government prices for pharmaceuticals to the Medicare population would increase the VA's annual pharmaceutical costs by $500-600 million. Now, years later, the impact will be even greater on the already constrained VA budget if FSS special discount drug prices are extended to the Medicare population and states.'' 
   Why are Democrats proposing this harm to veterans again, when Medicare Part D is working? 
   Medicare beneficiaries are already receiving substantial drug discounts, through plan negotiation that works just as FEHBP works for federal and legislative employees, including Members of Congress. Do not increase costs for your veterans. Oppose H.R. 4. H.R. 4 will endanger the health, lives and budgets of veterans.

   Mr. STEARNS. I thank the chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit will mean that under section 4, the Secretary's actions shall not result in drug price increases paid by veterans. This means, my colleagues, includes the Department of Veterans' Affairs or veterans themselves. 
   Certainly what both distinguished chairmen have mentioned is clear. I think that all Members should understand that. I support the motion to recommit.  
   H.R. 4 will most certainly increase VA drug prices. (1) This happened in 1990, Congress gave Medicaid access to VA, shooting up some VA drug prices 300 percent. (2) Next, when the Clinton Administration's Office of Personnel Management tried to expand VA's discounts to a group within FEHBP in 2000, Clinton's own VA balked, as did a witness from Disabled American Veterans. (3) Just recently former Clinton Administration VA Acting Secretary Hershel W. Gober, wrote in a 2004 issue of DAV Magazine that VA estimated in 1999 ``extending discounted government prices to Medicare would increase VA's annual drug costs by $500-$600 million''. 
   Please don't turn your back on the brave men and women who defend our Nation. Support this motion to recommit in order to ensure that H.R. 4 will not adversely affect drug prices for veterans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Venezuelan president invoked Fidel Castro as the premier socialist model which, in his theory, is the economic model for not only Venezuela but the entire world. 
   Mr. Speaker, my observation about his speech is that it represents a defining illustration of the dichotomous philosophies of ownership and freedom that free markets versus state-owned markets present. For example, Chavez demonstrates this with his continued move to nationalize electrical and telecommunications companies. 
   Here in Congress with the new majority, they are starting to hammer with this heavy hand of the Federal Government down on small businesses, pharmaceutical companies, energy companies, health insurance and telecommunications industries. I hope that we will carefully examine the consequences of these decisions before repeating the mistakes of socialism. State-owned enterprises are never the solution

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Madam Speaker, according to the Energy Information Agency, the United States electricity demand is projected to increase up to 40 percent by the year 2030, and other countries are projecting similar increases. The rapid industrial development of both China and India is already placing great pressure on global energy supplies. 
   Nuclear energy can help meet this growing demand by providing a clean, abundant source of electricity. Other countries seem to understand the potential benefits of nuclear power and have either commenced constructing, or have developed projections for new nuclear power plants. Countries like China, India, and Russia are already building new nuclear power plants. Even smaller countries like Vietnam and countries in the Middle East have begun exploring nuclear power as they too are facing demand shortages and they are feeling the pressures from the industrialized world to reduce CO  
   2 emissions. 
   The time has come for all of us to remove regulatory impediments and allow nuclear energy to continue helping this country to meet its growing energy demands.

<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, there is a double standard that is occurring in the wake of the largest government bailout in history. Warren Buffett yesterday announced he will invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs, the investment bank at which the Secretary of Treasury Paulson used to be the CEO. The struggling investment bank is attempting to raise capital and has wooed Buffett into his plan by offering his company preferred shares in return's for Buffett's bailout investment. 
   And herein lies the double standard. The Treasury Secretary, who happens to have close ties with Goldman Sachs, wants authority to use taxpayer dollars to bail out private financial companies, including his own firm, while taxpayers will get nothing at all in return but bad debt. 
   If taxpayers are going to get stuck bailing out bad debt, shouldn't they get some kind of Buffett deal as well? Clearly this government bailout is fraught with nothing but double standards and conflicts of interest.

<DOCNO>Mr. STEARNS. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, let me thank my distinguished colleague for yielding. 
   And I think her comment about the ``human wrong commission'' is appropriate, and I think that is a very apt way to explain it. When you talk about all the work they did, and she mentioned Darfur, that the Human Rights Council of the U.N. was unable to even pass a simple resolution dealing with it, that is unbelievable. 
   But where did they spend most of their time? That is a good question we could ask. Do you know where they spent most of their time? Condemning Israel. The Council's sole country-specific resolution censured Israel and adopted a decision to discuss human rights violations committed by Israel in the Palestinian territories permanently and in all the Council's meetings. Every Council meeting would discuss Israel's alleged abuses against Palestinians, without mentioning Palestinian provocations or their aggression. It is just unbelievable. In fact, the Council adopted a resolution that strongly condemned Israel for ``violations of human rights and breaches of  international humanitarian law in Lebanon.'' In Lebanon, without reference to provocations by Hezbollah. Talk about a ``human wrong commission.'' This is it. 
   So I am so gratified that this amendment has been accepted. I have a bill, H.R. 225, that outlines this amendment. I had an amendment last year on this subject in this appropriations process. We got 163 votes. But we lost. And I think a lot of people said, well, the U.N. is starting reforms in house. Let's give it a chance with its Human Rights Council. So we said, okay, we'll give it a chance. But, by all assessment it failed. In fact, the words of Peggy Hicks, the global advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, sums it up when she said: ``The new Human Rights Council must be more than the dysfunctional old commission by another name.'' 
   So from that, to the comment of the Miami Herald when they wrote, ``Why should these wolves guard the hen house?'' 
   I ask that we pass this amendment, and I thank my colleagues.  
   Take the so-called reforms to the membership of the council. The original proposal by the former Secretary General Annan (AH-NON) was to reduce membership to enable the council to be smaller and more agile in acting against human rights offenses. Indeed, the UN did reduce the number of members--from 53 down to 47. These 47 UN members are elected to three-year terms on the UNHRC. The new geographic quota system ensures a majority of membership slots for the world's least democratic regions. The African and Asian regional groups control a 55% majority--even more than they did on the former commission. Governments that routinely violate fundamental freedoms in their own countries shouldn't be setting the standards for anyone else. 
   Under the new council, a country can be suspended from council membership due to continuing human rights abuses only if two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly agree to do so. That is the only protection against human rights abusers being elected to the council. However, in practice this provision is useless. Less than half of the General Assembly agreed that Sudan is guilty of any human rights violations. If the General Assembly cannot agree on such a blatantly clear cut case of human rights abuse, how can we expect them to agree on suspending membership of countries that are human rights? The answer is, we can't. Known abusers like Russia, China, Azerbaijan, Cuba, and Algeria were all elected members this last session. 
   Finally, let us look at their actions. Under a General Assembly resolution, the Council has responsibility for ``promoting universal respect for the protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner'' and it must ``address situations of violations of human rights, including gross and systematic violations, and make recommendations thereon.'' There have been several opportunities for the Council to act with numerous cases of human rights abuses around the world. In Darfur, there are 2.5 million people displaced by the violence, 385,000 people in immediate risk of starvation, and over two million dead in the 22 years of violence. But the Human Rights Council was unable to pass a resolution on Darfur. Neither did it act regarding the lack of civil and political rights across China, the 13 million women in Saudi Arabia who live in fear of beatings if they go anywhere alone, or the dire human-rights conditions of 23 million people in North Korea. It also failed to address the Iranian President's incitement to genocide or the fact that his country's legal system includes crucifixion, stoning and amputation as viable punishments. 
   Ambassador Bolton stated at the creation of the new council, ``We want a butterfly. We're not going to put lipstick on a caterpillar and declare it a success.'' As a result, the Administration announced that it would not seek a seat on the council in 2006 but would continue financial support, and may seek membership in 2007 if the Council proves effective.

   Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Speaker, the recent reports of substandard conditions at the outpatient facility at Walter Reed Medical Center are deeply disturbing. The brave men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our country do not deserve the shoddy conditions, nor do they deserve to be trapped in the bureaucratic morass that has engulfed Walter Reed. 
   It is necessary to put into place a seamless program for our veterans from the time they are injured through rehabilitation and home care and work support. I urge Secretary Nicholson of Veterans Affairs to do just that. 
   The proper treatment of our wounded members of the Armed Forces is not a partisan issue. It is a moral issue. And Congress needs to ensure that our injured brave men and women receive the best, most advanced, and most timely medical care possible. Anything less would be immoral and a dereliction of our duty.
