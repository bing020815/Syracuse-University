<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (HONORING ARMY SERGEANT JON M. SCHOOLCRAFT III -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and recognize the ultimate sacrifice of a brave Ohio soldier, Army Sergeant Jon Michael ``Mike'' Schoolcraft III. 
   Mike attended high school in Wapakoneta and went on to study auto body repair at the Apollo Career Center in Lima. Teachers, coaches, family members, and friends all described Mike as a remarkable, reliable, hardworking young man who excelled at every activity in which he was engaged. 
   In his time on this Earth, Mike had a positive impact on people in his life. When he decided to join the military shortly after the September 11 attacks, he touched the life of every American family that lived under the blanket of safety he helped provide. 
   Mike Schoolcraft died on Saturday, January 19, while serving America in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. In recognition of his valorous service, he was posthumously promoted to sergeant. 
   Mike is survived by his new wife, Amber, who lives in Hawaii. Mike's mother, Cynthia, along with many friends and loving family members, lives near his boyhood home. His father, Jon, lives in Indiana. 
   Mike stood up and volunteered to serve this great country. He fought to promote freedom. He gave his life in defense of his family, his community, his State and his Nation. 
   For this, each and every American owes him and his family a great debt of gratitude.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for putting this hour together. I thank the folks who are participating and those who were able to go on our trip when we went to, we were up in ANWR, up in Alaska to see. 
   You know, the thing I just feel so strongly about is, Americans realize we live in the greatest country ever. But they are frustrated. They are frustrated by the fact that this Congress, if you saw the news yesterday, this Congress has run the largest deficit in history. $482 billion is the projected deficit this year. 
   They are frustrated that this Congress won't act on increasing the supply of energy, won't act on drilling more offshore, drilling more in Alaska, won't act on bringing down the price at the pump, bringing down the price of energy, won't act on those things that are necessary to help every single family across this country. 
   A few months ago, in our district, I had the opportunity to be in one of our Federal judge's courtroom for the ceremony where new Americans take the oath of citizenship. And I don't know if you have ever had a chance to participate in those ceremonies, Madam Speaker, but when you get an opportunity, it is an emotional experience to watch these, in my case, it was 36 new Americans, raise their hand, take the oath and become an American citizen. And when they completed that oath, the smile on their face, when they now realized that they were a citizen of the greatest country in the world, it is special to see. And frankly, those Americans, those new Americans, as all Americans, deserve better from their Congress. 
   The idea that we are going to leave here without taking an up or down vote on increasing supply on drilling offshore, on drilling in ANWR, is just wrong, and they deserve better. 
   One of the things that we learned that the gentleman from California has pointed out in some of his comments and remarks, when we were in Alaska, I will just be frank with you. If ever there was a place that we should be producing oil, it is in ANWR. Alaska is a beautiful State, except in ANWR where we were. When you went and looked across that area, this was a desolate, barren place that has over 10 billion barrels of oil waiting to be brought to production, waiting to be helping with our supply needs, waiting to be helping with the price at the pump that families are paying, and it is just something that we need to go do. 
   And as the gentleman points out, technology is our friend in this area. The footprint needed now on the surface to go down and get a much larger area subsurface is so small, and we can do it in an environmentally safe way. 
   I thought it was interesting, and my colleagues will recall this as well who were on the trip, that we flew over ANWR in propeller planes, prop planes, so we were flying pretty low to the ground. When we flew over ANWR I didn't see any wildlife. I am sure it was there, but I just thought it was sort of ironic and somewhat of a coincidence. We didn't see it. As I told the press, we didn't see caribou, we didn't see, you know, polar bears. We didn't see Bambi. We didn't see it. What we saw was a barren, desolate place which, as I said, has over 10 billion barrels of oil that needed to be brought to market. 
   But when we were on the ground, as the gentleman from California pointed out, in the Prudhoe Bay area, in that production are, where we have been taking oil out of the ground, bringing it to market for 30 years, when we were on the ground there in that area, at the pipeline itself, mile marker 0, pump station Number 1, we saw the caribou. They were right there. In fact, we saw one caribou trotting across the airport runway where we landed the plane as we flew into the Prudhoe Bay area. 
   So the idea that we can produce this in a way that is going to be friendly to wildlife, it is already there. We saw proof of that firsthand. This is something we need to do. 
   As I said, the American people get it, and the fact that their Congress doesn't is frustrating. It is frustrating them. It is frustrating for those of us who want to drill more, who want this legislation to pass so we can get started on bringing down the price right away. 
   They get it. And I am confident what is going to happen over the August recess, you know, is there is an old line in politics that most politicians don't see the light; they feel the heat. And I think when some of these Members go back home, they are not just going to feel the heat from the August summer weather, they are going to feel the heat from families and constituents back home who tell them, we need to drill; we need to go get more supply. 
   The American people get it. It is time that this Democrat-led Congress get it. I am still confident we can get a vote on this before the election, hopefully, when we come back in September, and we are going to continue to push on that. 
   And with that I would yield back to my good friend, the gentleman from California.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. One of the arguments we hear is just what the gentleman brought up, it is going to take 8 to 10 years to bring this production. We forget about the fact that, as you indicated, ANWR is only 70, 75 miles away from the existing pipeline. We have already got that infrastructure in place. 
   And as the gentleman indicated earlier, it used to be 2 million barrels a day moving through that pipeline. Today it is 700,000. If it gets to a certain level, it drops to a certain low level, it becomes physically, the feasibility physically is just not there to continue to maintain it. And frankly, from an economic standpoint, there needs to be a certain volume of oil moving through that every day. 
   This place is right next door, 75 miles away. And the infrastructure is in place. It will take a lot less time to get that oil to market and help every single family.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I just want to ask the gentleman a question. He comes from Louisiana. 
   Isn't it true that the oil production facilities offshore in your State in the gulf that during Katrina, that terrible disaster that hit our country, hit your State so hard, but isn't it true those production facilities withstood that hurricane and there was no spill, no environmental hazard whatsoever during that entire storm?

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Today in the Budget Committee we had a hearing today where we were talking about the increased price in food. We had two economists that were a part of the panel, and I asked them how much--you think about the fact that every commodity price is up. I asked them, I said, How much of all of these other commodity prices, the price being driven up, is attributable to the price of fuel? And they couldn't give a percentage, but they said it's a lot. 
   And it's not just a lot. When you think about the farmer and the fact that his input costs and just putting diesel in the tractor to plant the crops and harvest and cultivate the crops, but it's all our distribution. You have got to move all of these products that my friend from Tennessee listed, that my friend from Georgia talked about in agriculture. You have got to move them across this country. 
   Fuel drives up every single other commodity price, and that's why, again, it highlights and underscores the fact that we have got to pass legislation that allows us to get more supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (REPUBLICAN FRESHMEN THIRD QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE 110TH CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - September 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Let me thank the gentleman from California for putting this together. I appreciate the chance to be with you and some of my colleagues from the freshman class. 
   I particularly want to reference the tone that the gentlewoman from Minnesota brought to the discussion this evening. She talked about the optimistic can-do spirit that has always been a part of this country and that is alive and well today. Frankly, we are going to need that spirit when we confront the challenges that we face. 
   I call it the David attitude. You may remember the old story from Scripture. When the Israelites were 
   camped against the Philistines, and every day the Philistine giant would walk out and issue the challenge. He would ask: Who will fight Goliath? 
   The Israelites' response was: He is so big, we can never defeat him. But David's response was: He is so big, I can't miss. 
   That is the attitude we need to confront the challenges we face. You think about the challenges that America faces today, unprecedented in our Nation's history. 
   First, we have the terrorist threat as real and serious as it gets. We have this debate in our culture over whose set of values are going to win. There is a core set of principles, a traditional set of American values that made this Nation special. We should not be afraid to defend and protect and promote those principles and values. 
   But the challenge I want to focus on tonight is fiscal discipline. This is so, so important. Many of us have been back home over the last 6 weeks talking to all kinds of folks across our congressional districts. Many times what I do when I am speaking in front of a group, I say, you all may find this a surprise, but the Federal Government spends a lot of money. Everyone starts to laugh. And I say, they spend a heck of a lot of money. 
   The Federal Government spends $23,000 per household per year. We have an $8 trillion national debt. We have spending that is out of control. If we don't get a handle on that, what we are going to do to future generations is going to be difficult and it is going to make it tough for us as a Nation to continue to be number one economically. 
   I like to remind folks that the way the world works today, the economic superpower is also the leader in the military area. The economic superpower is the military superpower. Right now that is the United States of America, and I believe the world is safer because of that fact. We want America to lead diplomatically, we want America to lead militarily, and we want America to lead economically. It is important we do that. When America leads, the world is a safer and better place. And we want to make sure that continues. 
   In order for that to continue, we have to get spending under control. Over the course of the budget process, the budget that the majority party brought forward would in essence raise taxes over the next several years over $200 billion. When they look at scaling back the good tax cuts that were put in place back in 2001 and 2003, that have helped our economy respond to some of the hardships we faced after the 9/11 attacks and the recession that followed, we need to make sure that we get spending under control. 
   We always hear about tax-and-spend elected officials, tax-and-spend politicians. In fact, I would argue it is the opposite. It is spend and tax. Spending always drives the equation. We have to get spending under control. 
   In the appropriations process that we went through this summer, 12 different spending bills that finance the government over the course of the fiscal year, of those 12 bills, nine are nondefense. To those nine bills we offered a series of amendments that would have held spending at last year's level. It wouldn't have been a cut. It would have simply said to the government, the government that already spends $23,000 per household, it would have simply said: We want the government to spend what we spent last year. After all, all kinds of families have to do that, and all kinds of taxpayers have to do that, and all kinds of businesses have to do it from time to time. Why can't the Federal Government do the same thing? 
   Yet we heard from the majority party we can't do that. If we would simply spend what we spent last year, the sky would fall. The world would end. We have to have more of the taxpayers' money. That is the argument we heard. But it was not a cut; it was simply level spending. If we would have been able to do that, we would have saved taxpayers $20 billion and helped to begin to put us on a path to deal with the financial problems that will come if we continue to deficit spend. 
   Don't take my word for it. A former governor on the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Edward Gramlich, said this: ``Budget deficits lead to less economic growth and a lower level of economic activity than would otherwise be the case.'' 
   Mr. Walker, the comptroller general said, ``Today, we are failing in one of our most important stewardship duties: our duty to pass on a country better positioned to deal with the challenges of the future than the one we were given.'' 
   One of our fundamental challenges as people elected to public office is to make sure that the next generation has it better than we did. If you think about what has really allowed America to grow and prosper, we are the greatest country in the world for all kinds of reasons and all kinds of policies that we have, but in the end it is that parents have been willing to sacrifice so that their kids can have life a little better than they did. That kind of philosophy should be present in how we run the United States Congress and how we run government and how we spend taxpayer dollars. 
   Unfortunately, those amendments weren't passed and we were not able to save over $20 billion to help to begin to put us on a path towards greater fiscal responsibility. It is important that we do that, and it is important that we do it for the future of Americans. But we are going to get there. 
   The gentlewoman from Minnesota is right; Americans always figure out a way to address the obstacles and hurdles that are in front of us, and we will figure out a way to do this. We just need to keep talking about it and stay diligent. If we do that, we will put our country on the path that it needs to be fiscally so we continue to be that leader economically, militarily and diplomatically. 
   I appreciate what the gentleman from California is doing in helping to lead our freshman class and thank him for a chance to be a part of this hour this evening.     
   I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio because he is right. Many people talk about the tax and spend, but really it is the spending that drives it. Just from last year, with the bills that were passed on this floor with the largest tax increase in American history, they increased spending by 9 percent. A lot of people ask out there: What was the spending on? How did you go about doing it? I think that is what we are going to talk about tonight. 
   Before I get to our next speaker, I just want to show a couple of little slides here about where we are going. First, you see the promise that was made, that the gentleman from Illinois talked about, what Speaker Pelosi had said: ``Democrats are ready to lead, prepared to govern, and determined to make you proud.'' 
   Today, we sit at an 11 percent approval rating of this new majority. That is the lowest in the history that they have ever taken the poll. Lower than in the years of Watergate. Lower than when we had to ration gasoline during the years of President Jimmy Carter. Lower than in 1994 when the public decided after 40 years they wanted to change the majority here and put the Republicans in charge. It is now at the lowest level. 
   Why? And why is that spending taking place? I want to tell you an example, and I actually saw this on the news the other day, and I credit the news, Mr. Speaker, and CBS doing a story on this. What are we spending our money on? You sit around that table and you decide where you put your money away and where you go to save. Let me tell you a little story. It happened right here on this floor. 
   I was sitting down here and I was watching, and one of those spending bills, the Health and Human Services, there was $2 million put in. You say was it put in for education? Was it put in to make America greater? It was put in by a Member, Mr. Speaker, to name a library after himself. Two million dollars was spent. What did it say within here that it needed to be? You needed $2 million for the new Rangel Conference Center, a well-furnished office for Charles Rangel and the Charles Rangel Library. In the brochure, when you look at this library for a college that the library is not even there yet, it will say it will be as nice as President Clinton and as nice as President Jimmy Carter. Well, those libraries were funded by private funds. Those people were Presidents. 
   Now, what do you say? Maybe this is something that every chairman of Ways and Means would do. It just so happens the Member that served and represented Kern County, where I represent, was chairman of Ways and Means just a year ago. What did he do with his papers? He didn't name a library after himself. He took his papers to the junior college, Bakersfield Junior College, and gave them to them, where the kids can go and look and read. 
   Well, you know what happened? Just like Mr. Jordan had said, there were many amendments on this floor, many amendments by this freshman Republican class that said we want to get spending under control. There was an amendment by a Congressman from California, John Campbell, Mr. Speaker, that wanted to take that $2 million out. He thought that wasn't the best way to go about it. Much as the Congressman from Illinois said, earmarks. This is what an earmark is all about. 
   Well, just behold, the Congressman that had put this in, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rangel, came to this floor. He said he was proud of this. One of the Congressmen asked him: ``Well, if it's going to name it after yourself, should we name one after ourselves?'' He said: ``No, they don't deserve it. They haven't been here long enough.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the monument to me, but it is the monument to me paid by taxpayers. It is a monument to me, where not even the college asked to name it after him. He asked to name it after himself. 
   I am proud to tell you that all 13 freshmen Republicans voted for the amendment to strike out this earmark, to stop this type of activity. This is why we ran, this is what we said we would do, and this is not what the Democrats in the majority party said they would do when they were in control. 
   This is what has got to stop. This is why spending is 9.3 percent higher, and it's paid by taxpayers' money. I don't think the Members across this country wanted this to take place, I don't believe this person was the President of the United States, and I think individuals that are chairmen of Ways and Means ought to look for the path of what Congressman Bill Thomas did when he was chairman of Ways and Means, he gave his papers to a junior college. He didn't put $2 millions in to have nice furniture and an office and a librarian, to be as nice as the presidential libraries are. 
   Having said that, Mr. Speaker, we have some more Members with us tonight. We have an individual from Tennessee, the First District of Tennessee. He served in the legislature back there. You may recognize him. He is on the floor quite often talking about bringing America back, finding solutions here. 
   I yield to Congressman David Davis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill because it will hurt our economy and deny working Americans the right to vote--free from intimidation--by secret ballot. 
   I'm sure that each of my colleagues can boast of successful union and non-union employers in their districts. I had the opportunity to tour a number of these businesses in Ohio's Fourth District over the recess. 
   These companies and the workers they employ represent the best America has to offer. They are the reason our economy is the envy of the world. 
   Today, our economy is growing faster than in the 70s, 80s, and 90s. We've improved our competitiveness with good public policy like tax cuts. But we still draw our strength from good old fashioned hard work and values. This bill is antithetical to every principle that makes America great. 
   Removing the secret ballot protection for workers invites the type of coercion described by one of our constituents, Clarice Atherholt of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, in testimony before the Senate. She told of unsolicited home visits by union organizers and other high-pressure tactics, saying that ``[m]any employees signed the [union authorization] cards just to get the UAW organizers off their backs, not because they really wanted the UAW to represent them.'' 
   So much for ``employee free choice.'' 
   Madam Chairman, America faces a number of critical challenges. We must continually focus on improving our economy and remaining competitive in the world marketplace. 
   We're making progress, but this bill represents a step backward. It has drawn opposition from every pro-growth, pro-business voice imaginable, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer a word of caution about the proposed PAYGO rules which will hurt this body's ability to keep our economy moving forward. By putting more money into the hands of families and taxpayers, the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 have helped stimulate our economy, create jobs and cut our Federal deficit in half. The proposed PAYGO rules wrongly identify these types of tax cuts as ``deficit spending'' and will all but eliminate our ability to provide additional tax relief to the families and taxpayers we represent. 
   It will also set the framework for repealing the tax cuts that have already been enacted. This amounts to a two-pronged threat to the pocketbooks of the families and taxpayers across Ohio and across America. 
   Mr. Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I wholeheartedly support the earmark reform contained in this rule, and I strongly support the spending restraint at the heart of the PAYGO concept, but I believe these rules will, in effect, take money out of the hands of families and taxpayers, hurting our ability to grow our economy and cut our deficit in a fiscally responsible way.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the Chair, and I also want to thank the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member. I have great respect for their work, particularly the ranking member, who is a friend, colleague and actually neighbor of mine. I appreciate his work over the years here in the United States Congress. 
   This amendment is pretty simple. It takes spending levels in the bill back to the fiscal 2007 year levels; represents a $1.3 billion savings to taxpayers and families across the country. 
   Mr. Chairman, government spends too much. And I said ``government.'' I didn't say Republicans or Democrats. Both parties need to work on this area when it comes to public policy. 
   But today the Federal Government spends $23,000 per household. Excessive spending hurts America. Deficits hurt America, and a rising national debt hurts America. 
   You don't have to take my word for it. Our staff went through and we looked at the Budget Chairman, Mr. Spratt's committee, some notes from their committee hearings on the budget. And I want to just quote from Dr. Edward Gramlich, former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. He said this: ``Deficits represent negative public saving, which tends to drive down national saving. Lower national savings means a smaller stock of capital for the future, which reduces the productivity and wages of future workers. Budget deficits lead to less economic growth and a lower level of economic activity than would otherwise be the case.'' 
   Excessive spending leads to deficits, leads to lower economic growth. Excessive spending leads to tax increases, all bad for our growing economy, all bad for American families. 
   And it's particularly, I think, important to recognize why this is so crucial that we get a handle on it as we think about the marketplace we find ourselves in today, the changing international market. 
   Just a couple of numbers. Four weeks ago the Wall Street Journal reported that China's economic growth rate, annual growth rate, is 10.4 percent. Now, think about this: one billion, 300 million people in China with a growth rate of 10.4 percent. That's what we're competing against. 
   There was a point in the past where elected officials could maybe enact policies that weren't in our best interest or weren't good for our economic growth. But now, because of the fact that the competition is so stiff, it's important that public policymakers get it right. Keep taxes low, keep spending under control. 
   In the end, Mr. Chairman, it's not just about deficits and the national debt and GDP. It's about people because, in the end, it's people who pay taxes. It's people who have to deal with this debt and the deficits that we're causing by spending at these levels. 
   I want to also quote from the same document from Chairman Spratt's committee, from the Comptroller General, Mr. Walker. He said, ``Deficits matter for the world we leave our children and our grandchildren.'' Mr. Walker said this, and I quote, ``Today we are failing in one of our most important stewardship responsibilities, our duty to pass on a country better positioned to deal with the challenges of the future than the one we were given.'' And that's so true. 
   This amendment is real simple. It's going to allow families and people across this country to keep more of their money to spend on their goals, their dreams. And it's simply taking us back to last year's fiscal level. 
   There are all kind of families, all kinds of individuals across this country who are living on last year's budget. A simple, across-the-board amendment that says we're going to do what so many American families have to do all the time, and we're going to live within our means. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my opposition to S. 5, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. Like H.R. 3, which we considered earlier this year, and H.R. 810, S. 5 would use taxpayer funds to destroy human life. 
   Some of my colleagues claim that embryonic stem cell research is essential to finding cures to a range of diseases. This could not be further from the truth. On top of the fact that embryo-derived treatments have been fraught with problems, including the widespread occurrence of tumor formation, there is now a host of increasingly more successful alternative treatments that offer tangible results to suffering Americans and their families. 
   Research has demonstrated that various forms of adult stem cell materials, umbilical cord blood and amniotic fluid are an excellent source of pluripotent stem cells. These materials have yielded highly successful, groundbreaking treatments for Brain Cancer, Breast Cancer, various forms of Lymphoma and Leukemia, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, spinal cord injury, Sickle Cell Anemia and Krabbe Disease. Treatments employing umbilical cord blood have been particularly successful and the list goes on and on. Just recently, a new study by American and Brazilian researchers published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated the use of stem cells taken from 13 patient's own bodies to reverse the symptoms of Juvenile Diabetes. These patients have been able to live so far without insulin-some as long as three years. Just this morning, the Associated Press reported a new report from three independent teams of scientists that have been able to produce the practical equivalent of embryonic stem cells in mice without destroying any embryos. Thus far, ethical forms of stem cell research have yielded treatments for over 73 different diseases while well-funded embryonic research has thus far only yielded tumors. 
   Mr. Speaker, every time my colleagues in the house trumpet the necessity of destroying embryos, scientific studies come along to prove them wrong on point after point. Rather than forcing taxpayers to fund the destruction of human life, we should be putting our resources into the types of ethical research that are rapidly providing the treatments that Americans so greatly desire.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the Chair. 
   I want to thank the Chair of the committee and the ranking member for their good work and the committee's work. I know for the Chair in particular, I want to congratulate her on the first bill coming through her subcommittee, a very important subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. So I appreciate the fine work done there and the oversight of the visitors center. The passion with which the ranking member spoke about Emancipation Hall I thought was right on target. So I appreciate the work done. 
   This amendment, just like the amendment I offered last night to the Foreign Operations bill, simply says this: instead of increasing spending by 4 percent, let's hold the line. I articulated reasons last night in the long debate that this body had over why that is appropriate, why that makes sense. Because there is in fact a crisis looming for this country if we don't get control of the spending here in the United States Congress, in the United States Senate and the United States Government. 
   It is important that we recognize that. I articulated last night too, don't take my word for it. Yesterday's Washington Post talked about this growing problem that is coming in the very near future, and it is important we understand that. 
   I won't go through all the arguments again here, because I know we have had a long debate and people want to get on their way and get back to their district. 
   I will just say this: ever-increasing spending inevitably leads to ever-increasing taxes. The American families, the American people are overtaxed because our government spends too much. It has been a problem for both parties. We need to get it under control. 
   Millions of families, millions of families across this country are going to live on last year's budget. It is not too much to ask the United States Government, in particular the United States Congress, to do the same. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The American people need to understand this, Madam Chair: $3.1 billion is what this bill spends. My amendment would say $3 billion, $3 billion to run the United States Congress. You ask American families that, they would probably say, you know, that is probably enough. They can probably get by on $3 billion versus $3.1 billion. That is all this does. As the gentleman from Texas pointed out, in the course of the appropriation bills we have been dealing with, this is fairly fiscally responsible. But $3 billion is enough to run the United States Congress. 
   That is all this amendment would do, keep us where we are right now. Things are working fine now. Why can't we do that in the future?

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for yielding. 
   I just want to follow up on the gentleman from Georgia's comments. He is exactly right about the defense portion of this budget. It is critical at this time with the terror threat that we face that we do what is right by the defense budget. In 1945, 38 percent of gross domestic product was spent on the defense. Today it is 3.8 percent at a time, as I said earlier, where we have terrorists around the world who want to do our families and our country harm. 
   Normally when we talk about budgets, and folks have pointed this out, we get focused on the numbers, on the data, on the policy, and I think all too often we forget about the people, the families out there who are impacted by our decision. And I am hopeful over the next few weeks that we really focus on the impact our decisions are going to have on families and taxpayers and business owners. 
   I am reminded of a story of a constituent of ours a few years ago who wanted to meet with our U.S. Senator. And our constituent is a successful businessman in the manufacturing sector, and we were discussing the whole issue of trade and competing with China and India. And we sat down with our United States Senator, and our constituent took the piece that they make, and he had taped to that piece two pennies, and he took that manufactured piece of steel and he slid it across the table to our Senator, and he said, Senator, those two pennies, those 2 cents, represent our labor costs in that piece. He said, we can compete with anybody on labor. We are so efficient, our processes, our systems. What we do in our business, we are so good at it, we can compete with anybody. He says, what makes it tough for us to compete is the things you guys do, and he pointed right to our Senator. 
   It is the things the politicians do. It is the high taxes. It is the high regulation. It is the ridiculous spending we have heard others talk about here over the last hour. Those are the things that make it tough on the families and taxpayers of this great country to compete; to start their business; to go after their goals, their dreams; to pursue those things that have meaning and significance to them as a family. 
   And I am hopeful, as we proceed on this debate over the next weeks, several months, that we will remember the business owners and the families out there who are making it and doing the things that make this country the greatest Nation in the world. 
   I appreciate the time we have had here. I appreciate the gentleman from California and this opportunity to share with the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (IN MEMORY OF THE SEVEN OHIOANS WHO PERISHED IN GEORGIA BUS ACCIDENT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise in solemn remembrance of seven Ohioans whose lives were cut short by a tragic bus accident on the morning of Friday, March 2, 2007, in Atlanta, Georgia. Though words cannot express the depth of their loss, we honor their memory and offer our condolences to their families, friends, teammates, and classmates of these seven individuals: 
   David Betts of Bryan, Ohio 
   Scott Harmon of Elida, Ohio 
   Cody Holp of Arcanum, Ohio 
   Jerry and Jean Niemeyer of Columbus Grove, Ohio 
   Tyler Williams of Lima, Ohio, and 
   Zack Arend of Oakwood, Ohio. 
   In the midst of this tragedy, I was heartened to see the selfless way these families and communities pulled together to support each other in a time of need. It reminds me of what is special about America. 
   I was also humbled by the outpouring of kindness from concerned families in Georgia and around the country. Just minutes after the accident, complete strangers were opening their homes to our families and offering their condolences and prayers. 
   While we grieve their passing, we know that they will live forever in the hearts of their loved ones and will eternally be remembered by the Bluffton University family and the people of Bluffton, Allen County and west central Ohio.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate the chance to say a few words. I was over making phone calls in my office and clicked on C-SPAN and saw what you guys were talking about and thought I would come over and maybe just share a few things. 
   For those who are advocating that we just up and leave, that our military come home, that concept scares me to death because of the message. And I know you have talked about this some here on the floor this evening. The message that sends to the people who want to do us harm and want to do people harm all over the planet is a dangerous message and it scares me to death. 
   And I am reminded of, if folks will remember, shortly after the 9/11 attacks, that terrible day, where the President gave several speeches, where he talked about the fact that if you are a country that harbors terrorists, finances terrorists, trains terrorists, and are looking to produce weapons that are going to cause great harm to a great number of people, if you are doing those things, we, the United States of America, are putting you on notice that we are not going to tolerate that. And it was amazing that shortly after those speeches that Moamar Kadafi, a guy who hadn't necessarily been a great leader around the world and not necessarily a good guy, how quickly after those speeches Mr. Kadafi suddenly found the Lord and saw the light and said, wait a minute, I want to cooperate with the United States of America now in their fight against terrorism around the world. He saw the message. He got the message. Now, if we do what some are advocating in the Out of Iraq Caucus, some are advocating that we just up and leave and not win in Iraq, not succeed in our mission, for those who are advocating that, think about the message that sends to the Kadafis of the world and how dangerous that message is for the credibility of the greatest Nation in history, the United States of America. 
   That is what scares me to death about those on the other side and what they are pushing not only in this supplemental but what they have been talking about for several months now. That is a scary, scary message when it comes to our foreign policy and the success of our mission and the safety of our men and women in uniform who have been fighting the good fight, defending those principles and values that make this country great. That scares me to death. 
   And that is a simple point I want to make, but I think it never hurts to reinforce that point, which is so fundamental and why we are still engaged in  this struggle and why I think it is so important that we win and we continue to do what the Commander in Chief and General Petraeus want us to do over there in Iraq today.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I appreciate the gentleman's yielding. And the gentleman is exactly right. Of course we wish things had progressed quicker and faster. We wish all our men and women were home. But there is good news to talk about. And one fact that I think gets lost sometimes, every single life that is lost is a tragedy. We wish it didn't happen, whether it is our service men and women in uniform or whether it is an Iraqi civilian in that country, but the truth is there have been fewer American service men and women killed in 2006 than there were in 2005. There were fewer American service men and women killed in 2005 than there were in 2004. Of course, you would never know that fact if you just listened to the national news every night. 
   There are good things happening, as the gentleman pointed out. The other thing I would just say is this: to get the kind of country that we need there and the kind of things happening that we need to happen, it is going to take a little time. I am reminded that in 1776 we declared independence. We made our quest for liberty and freedom here in the United States. It took us 13 years to get a Constitution that works and is still serving us well today. And we came from a culture that appreciated liberty and appreciated freedom. 
   It is going to take some time for this nation, which has never really known freedom or liberty, to get to that point where they can value those principles that make our country so great. So good things are happening, and we should talk about those more in our quest to make this country work. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and appreciate Dr. Gingrey's work on this legislation and other legislation. I think he is right on target with this Parental Right to Decide Protection Act. 
   Like the doctor, I, too, understand the importance of vaccines, but I also understand, as the Representative was talking about, the importance of parents having control and the ability to direct their children in the upbringing of their children. 
   My concern about this, what we are seeing being done in the States around the country is just what Mr. Gingrey talked about, this mandatory approach to this vaccine. In fact, we have legislation that has been introduced in my home State, Ohio, which would, if, in fact, it would pass, would require parents to opt out of the program; not take an affirmative step and opt in, but instead opt out, and instead puts the onus on parents to go in the other direction. 
   One of the things I believe in so strongly is that we policymakers should make decisions based on what is best for families. We should filter things through a fundamental question: Does it help families? If the answer to that question is yes, we should be for it. 
   My concern with what we have been talking about here this evening in this mandatory approach is that it undermines the importance of families, undermines the role that parents have to play in the upbringing of their children. 
   America is a great country. It is the greatest Nation in history for many reasons: the rights we have; the fact that we have the right to vote; the freedom of speech; the freedom of assembly; the freedom to go after our goals, our dreams; the rule of law; all those wonderful things in the Bill of Rights and our Constitution and our heritage and our history that make America special. 
   But one thing that makes this country special is this idea that parents are willing to sacrifice and do things so that their children can have life a little better than they did. Those youngsters in turn will do the same thing for their kids. It has been that concept and that approach and that phenomenon that has truly made America prosper and grow over the years. 
   Again, my concern is that this moves in the opposite direction and begins to undermine that.     
   You think about all the things that parents are willing to do to help their kids and make decisions in their best interests, and they should have that same prerogative here. 
   I was reminded of legislation that we dealt with, Doctor, in my time in the Ohio General Assembly. We dealt with a bill that actually required, a good bill, I voted for it, before a minor, and, again, we are talking, as I think you indicated in your opening remarks, we are talking about 6th graders here, young ladies. We dealt with the legislation in my time in the Ohio General Assembly which required parental consent before a minor could get a tattoo or any type of body piercing. 
   Yet here we have something this important, this serious, and it would require parents opting out, not opting in on the front end. I think it's important to keep those concepts in mind as we move forward.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I appreciate the gentleman's comments there. You know, it's almost as if there is this underlying belief in the way many of these proposals are structured, that the State knows better than mom and dad. We all know that is not the case. Even though some parents sometimes may make poor decisions on behalf of their kids, on behalf of their children, in the vast majority of cases, parents make infinitely better decisions than the State, than the politicians, than the bureaucrats can ever dream of making. 
   Then this whole approach seems to undermine that concept which has, again, been fundamental, I believe, to the greatness of our country.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I just want to pick up on where Congressman Garrett had kind of emphasized what he had talked about. It is almost as if some people are saying parents aren't smart enough. Parents are smart enough to figure out where their kids need to go to school. They are smart enough to help and save and invest and help their kids get a college education. 
   They are smart enough to forgo opportunities for themselves and make sacrifices so their kids can have a little better life than they did and further that American Dream and further the prosperity of this country. Yet somehow they are not smart enough in this area. 
   I think it is important we never undermine that basic fact that parents know best. We had sent a letter to the Governor of our State. We have had legislation introduced in Ohio. I said in that letter, I said, in addition to this bill, this concept is being introduced in Ohio making inappropriate suppositions about the promiscuity of 6th grade girls. I share the view of many that this will lead to further erosion of the rights of parents to instruct the upbringing of their children. 
   Again, that is why the sponsor of this bill has so appropriately named it, protecting parental rights. That is so important. 
   Again, I just wanted to, before I have to leave, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia and the gentleman from New Jersey for his remarks this evening.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (FOURTH QUARTERLY REPORT OF THE FRESHMEN REPUBLICANS -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate the chance to address the Chamber tonight and be with my freshmen colleagues who have fought the good fight on spending. We have heard a lot about spending and taxes. 
   I gave a speech last week back in the Fourth Congressional District in the great town of Findlay, Ohio. And I said at the start of that speech, I said 1 year in Congress has confirmed what I suspected: with the exception of the military, with the exception of our good men and women who wear our uniform, with that exception, the rest of the  Federal Government doesn't do anything well. 
   And I asked the audience, tell me how the Department of Commerce improves your family's life. Tell me how the Department of Labor improves your small business. Tell me how the Federal Department of Education improves life in our schools. How does it really help our teachers, our school board members? Most importantly, how does it help our children in our schools across this country? And of course the answer was nobody knew. Nobody knew what all this big government does. 
   In fact, today there was a story in our Columbus, Ohio paper. It is a Cox News Service story written by Marilyn Geewax, and the headline is: ``Federal Finances a Mess.'' And the date line says: 
   ``Washington. The Federal Government finances are in such a disarray that the Nation's budget watchdog said yesterday that he was unable to sign off on the books. Comptroller David Walker said the Treasury Department's annual report wouldn't be acceptable in the private sector.'' 
   In quotes, he said this in his speech at the National Press Club: ``If the Federal Government were a private corporation and the same report came out this morning, our stock would be dropping, and there would be talk about whether the company's management and directors needed a major shakeup.'' That is what our comptroller had to say about the Federal Government. 
   And yet what did the majority do this first year in Congress? They tried to tie the hands of our troops, that one area of the Federal Government that does a great job. And in the rest of the government, they increased spending, as my colleague from California pointed out, over $20 billion. $20 billions in increased spending for the Federal Government that, we all know, according to the Comptroller, is a mess. And it is important we recognize that. 
   And I am proud to be associated with these members of the freshmen class who have spent so much time this year trying to get a handle on Federal spending and bring it back into line, because we recognize a few facts, just a few numbers. And my colleague from California and the previous speakers have pointed this out as well. We have a $9 trillion national debt. Each citizen, each American citizen's share of that national debt is $30,200. And here is the real concern: when you have out-of-control spending like this, it inevitably leads to higher taxes. And we have already heard from our good friend from Tennessee who talked about the tax burden currently facing families. We heard from the from Minnesota about the tax burden that the AMT is going to impose on over 20 million Americans. 
   If we don't get a handle on spending, there is going to be real consequences on this country, and here is why it is so critical. If we want to make sure that we promise to our retirement systems, if we want to make sure we leave our children a debt-free Nation, and if we want to make sure we can compete and win in the international marketplace, then we have to begin to control spending. And that is why, as my colleague from California pointed out, I was proud to work with our class this summer, and we offered a series of amendments that would do just that. 
   It was interesting, during those debates, when we got up and spoke about why it was important to hold the line on spending and begin to save taxpayers' dollars, begin to allow families to keep more of their money, it was interesting during that debate, the other side said: We can't do that. We have got to increase spending. We have got to increase spending, in some cases two and three and four times the rate of inflation, because if we don't, the world is going to end, the sky is going to fall. Everything terrible is going to happen. And yet, you know what has happened, as has been pointed out already this evening? We didn't pass those spending bills, as the law requires, by September 30. 
   So since that time, over the past 10 weeks, we have been functioning under what we call a continuing resolution, which is a fancy way of saying we are living on last year's budget, exactly what the amendments we proposed were going to do. We are living on last year's budget. And do you know what? The government is running. The sky hasn't fallen. 
   And my argument is, if we can do it for 10 weeks, we can probably do it for 10 months, and we can probably do it for a whole year and save my taxpayers, as my friend has pointed out, over $20 billion. 
   When you think about the size of government, there is a great line that Thomas Jefferson had. He said: When the government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. 
   Now, with that statement in mind, ask yourself a question. If sometime tomorrow you get a knock at your door and you go and you answer your door, and the gentleman standing there identifies himself and says, Hello. I am Mr. SMITH and I am with the IRS, is your first response, Oh, joy. One of my public servants is here to help me today? Of course not. 
   We all understand government is too big and we need to reduce it. And the reason we need to reduce it is because we understand one fundamental fact: moms and dads can spend the money better than we can. Moms and dads can do a better job than the bureaucrats in this Federal Government that the headline even says is a mess can do when it comes to spending their money. 
   Think about that typical family out there. One of the reasons America is the greatest Nation in history is because moms and dads have been willing to sacrifice so that the next generation, so that their kids can have life a little better than they did.     
   If we don't get a handle on spending, it is going to be tough to continue that great tradition that has helped make America the best. The same comptroller who was cited in this article that is in today's papers, the same comptroller had this statement to say: ``We are failing in our most important stewardship responsibilities. We have a duty to pass on a country better positioned to deal with the challenges of the future than the one we were given.'' 
   That is our challenge. That is what this class is about. We want to make sure that we get a handle on spending so we can do what is right stewardshipwise and pass on to our children and our grandchildren the same great America that we inherited. That is what made America great, and that is what we have to do as we move forward. 
   It starts by getting a handle on spending so we can keep taxes low and we can compete in this international marketplace. 
   I thank the gentleman from California. His leadership continues here in the United States Congress, and I am proud to be associated with that in our freshman class.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. You're exactly right. We always hear this line, tax and spend politicians. It's actually the opposite. It's spend and tax. Spending drives the equation. And when Congresses spend and governments spend so much, they do just what our friend from Tennessee described, they take money away from families and spend it on earmarks, spend it on this big government that as we've already figured out tonight is a mess according to Comptroller of the Treasury. So you're exactly right. 
   And what the Democratic majority has proposed this year in their budget to satisfy all their spending is the repeal of the tax cuts that were put into place in 2001 and 2003, tax cuts that give a child tax credit to children and dependents, great concept for families. Tax cuts that lowered the income tax rates, those are going to go up. The child tax credit is going to go away, the death tax is going to up and the dividend tax is going to go up, in addition to a whole other list of taxes they've also unveiled. 
   So the reason it's so critical to control spending is because high spending inevitably leads to higher taxes. And when you tax and tax and spend and spend, you take money away from, as our friend from Tennessee has pointed out, the typical family out there, the moms and dad who want to invest. 
   Think about the typical family that was described by our friend from Tennessee. Typical family, they get up every day, they go to work. They go to church on Sunday. They take their kid to soccer practice, they take the kid to Little League. They're putting money away for college education. All those things, and yet you have a Congress who spends things on like, as you pointed out earlier, Congressman McCarthy, a monument to themselves in their district. Think about that. A sitting Member of Congress who uses taxpayer money to name a facility after himself while he is a sitting, while he's in Congress. Unprecedented. And yet that's what we saw with this Congress. And it's all driven because they want to spend and spend and spend. They think they can spend your tax dollars better than you as a family, you as an individual taxpayer can spend it. 
   So again I appreciate this chance to talk about these things this evening. More importantly, I appreciate the opportunity, as our friend from Tennessee has pointed out, to fight for those things that I think really matter to families and work with my colleagues in our freshman class. And I yield back.

I represent in the Fourth Congressional District we have Airstream, some of the finest trailers in the world that people use to go camping. It's a wonderful, wonderful product. And you talk about the CAFE standards in this bill which would arbitrarily, some government-mandated standard that fleets would have to meet. It's tough. It's difficult to pull an Airstream with a Volkswagen. I mean, you need something bigger. And that's why we have to approach this. We all want to do things, but we've got to approach it in a reasonable way when we're thinking about the impact it's going to have on our economy, and as you point out on our districts and on our ag community as well.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues today in opposition to taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood, and I particularly want to thank Congressman Smith for his long-time leadership on this most important issue, as well as Mr. Pence for his introduction of the legislation that will do just what we've been talking about this evening. 
   Let me just reiterate a few of the numbers that the gentlelady from Minnesota pointed out. Planned Parenthood had over $1 billion in revenue last year, $115 million in profit, $952 million in net assets. That's bad enough, I mean, that they're using our tax dollars to fund a practice that is wrong, that is immoral. 
   But add to it this fact--and I want to cite and the gentlelady did this as well--cite The Wall Street Journal article where Planned Parenthood talks about the fact that they're going to raise $10 million to fund their political action committee. 
   So to just put it into plain language, think about what's going on here in this practice. Planned Parenthood is using your tax dollars to raise more money to run against your candidate to elect someone who will give them more tax dollars. Stated even more simply, using your tax money to run against you and run against the candidates you want to support, those pro-life candidates. That's what they're doing. They want to keep electing people that will keep this process going forward. 
   This is just wrong, and it should stop. And the gentleman from Texas was so right when he talks about those pregnancy resource centers, those crisis pregnancy centers out there who are doing the bake sales. Our church, we help support one where they give each family a bottle and you fill it up with coins and you stuff a few dollars, raising money just any way they can to protect human life because they understand it's sacred. They understand it's precious. Contrast that with this practice that we see here that Planned Parenthood engages in, and frankly, contrast it with what the previous speaker just said. 
   The wisdom and the vision the Founders had when they started this place, when they started the greatest country in history, the Founding statement: ``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.'' 
   I think it's interesting to note the order the Founders placed the rights they chose to mention. Can you pursue happiness? Can you pursue your goals, your dreams, those things that have meaning and significance to you and your family if you first don't have liberty, if you first don't have freedom? And can you ever experience true liberty, true freedom, if government doesn't protect your most fundamental right, your right to life? 
   That's what this legislation is about. It's about protecting that most sacred, that most precious, that most fundamental right that the Founders understood was central to what we call this thing America. And that's why I'm pleased to support my colleagues in this legislation this evening. I appreciate the work of the gentlelady from Minnesota and, of course, Congressman Smith and the entire Pro-Life Caucus.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the ranking member. 
   Madam Chair, I rise today to express my opposition to the so-called Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 
   Far from actually protecting new workers, this legislation will add confusion and contradictions to title VII's existing protections. We have already heard from speakers who talked about the ``perceived'' sexual orientation language in this bill. And it would violate the traditional bases used to determine protected status, those being an immutable characteristic, a history of economic disenfranchisement and political powerlessness. All of the protected classes that currently exist in title VII meet these standards, while those individuals this legislation seeks to protect do not. The current title VII protections are sufficient to protect our Nation's citizens. Expansion would only lead to confusion and more litigation. The previous Republican speaker talked about this. He talked about the contradiction that exists between sexual rights and religious rights. If this legislation is approved, it will certainly be challenged in court and produce a clash with religious freedom and expression. 
   And then, finally, two other things I would like to address. ENDA, I believe, has the potential to severely hurt business. Not only will the religious exemption fail to cover nondenominational religious elementary schools, high schools and colleges, but it may, in fact, force employers to violate their personal convictions and hire individuals that they determine may not be in the best interests of their business. Business owners with religious convictions should be free to apply those convictions to their hiring practices. 
   And I guess I would just close by saying, most importantly in my mind, this legislation, I believe, would undermine the institution of marriage and thereby undermine that key institution in our culture, which I believe in the end ultimately determines the strength of our entire society, and that being the family institution. You think about one of the reasons America is so great is because moms and dads and families sacrifice for the next generation. I believe this legislation has the real potential to undermine the importance of families in our culture and in our society and in our country. 
   For those reasons, Madam Chair, I would oppose the legislation. I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the chairman. 
   The amendment before you would reduce the appropriations in the bill by $3.2 billion, as was just read by the Clerk. 
   Even though the majority party will call this a ``cut in spending,'' this is not a cut. This is simply returning the level of spending in this appropriations bill to last year's level. It is level funding, spending the same dollar amount we spent last year. Again, as I have articulated on this floor several times in the appropriations process on other pieces of legislation, it is exactly what all kinds of families across this country have to do. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the work of the committee. I don't bring this amendment because I don't appreciate the work that the committee does; I bring it because our country and our government do face a real financial challenge in the future. If we don't begin to get a handle on the spending that this Congress does and that our government does, we are going to have real problems. 
   The best way to begin to start that, when you think about the challenges and problems that loom in front of us, with entitlements, with Social Security, with Medicaid, with Medicare, the way to start that process, to get a handle on the fiscal crisis that is looming, is to start right here and say, you know what? It is probably not too much to ask for the Congress and for the Government of the United States to spend the same amount that they spent last year. That is why I bring this amendment forward. 
   I would also point out this: Inevitably, when you continue to increase spending and increase spending and increase spending, it always leads to greater taxes. People talk all the time about tax-and-spend politicians. In truth it is just the opposite. It is spend and tax. Spending drives the equation, and that is why we have to focus on spending if we don't want to raise taxes on the American people, which we surely don't want to do. 
   Yet the other party is talking about doing exactly that. All you have to do is look at recent press clippings where they talked about raising the tobacco tax to deal with the SCHIP program. They have talked about raising taxes on the top marginal bracket to begin to address the AMT. Both are bad ideas for families, bad ideas for our economy, and not the direction we want to proceed. 
   Again, I bring this amendment forward because I think it is something that we have to begin to focus on as we look at the financial situation that is just around the corner for this country. All kinds of families, all kinds of taxpayers, all kinds of business owners have to live on last year's spending. It is not too much to ask our government to do the same. It is not to much to ask that our government do exactly what families all across this country have to do. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, just a few comments before we use the remaining few minutes of our time as well. 
   Think about this. The ranking member of the Budget Committee pointed out the facts, what's in this bill, the numbers, the budget, and what's going on. But it's always important to come back and focus on how that translates into the lives of the American people and American families. 
   I think it's important just to remember and think about the typical family across this country. They go to work each day. They go to church on Sunday. They make their house payment. They make their car payment. Maybe they're paying their kids' private school. They're saving for college. They may be saving for a family vacation. They don't get an automatic 7 percent, in this particular bill $3.2 billion, increase. They don't get that. They have to budget. They have to learn to live on less many times. 
   And that's all this amendment says is, you know what, let's just spend exactly what we spent last year, because if we don't. And we keep on this spending train that we're on, there will be tax increases. And then that family I just described, it's going to be tougher for them to pay for that vacation, pay for their kids' school, pay for the shoes for soccer practice and Little League and pay for all those things that families have to pay for. That's why this is important. 
   It begins to put us on the path to deal with the problems that are certainly going to be there if we don't start getting a handle on spending. That's why I bring the amendment forward. That's what all our speakers have talked about, because it's that important that we begin to do the right thing here. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the dean of our delegation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues from Ohio in expressing great shock and sadness at the passing of our friend and neighbor Congressman Paul Gillmor. 
   As previous speakers have mentioned, Congressman Gillmor was in our district last week with the flooding. I had the opportunity to just visit with him yesterday, as Congressman Tiberi mentioned as well, at the airport before we flew down here. You just can't believe this has happened. 
   Paul was a husband and a father. He was a proud Republican, an Air Force veteran, as others mentioned, with Vietnam era service, and a long time congressional leader on international leaders. 
   Prior to his distinguished service in Congress, he made his mark in the Ohio legislature with an impressive 22-year career in the Ohio Senate, and as Congresswoman Pryce mentioned, three terms as senate president. 
   I had the unique opportunity to work with Paul on issues that affected our part of Ohio. I counted on him as a staunch ally in promoting the workers and the mission at Lima's Joint Systems Manufacturing Center, our tank plant in Lima, Ohio. 
   We also shared in challenging times, including the tragic Bluffton University bus crash earlier this year, and more recently, as I mentioned, the flooding that took place and devastated many areas of both of our districts. 
   I served with Paul's wife, Karen, in the general assembly, although she was on the senate side and I was on the house side, and got to know their family a little bit over the years. Our family's prayers are with her and the entire Gillmor family as they attempt to find peace in the midst of this tragedy.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (THE WAR OF PRINCIPALITIES -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the Speaker for his patience this evening. I want to thank Congressman Forbes for putting the previous Special Order together on our religious history here in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it. There is a debate going on today in our culture over whose set of principles, whose set of values are going to prevail. There are those of us who understand the significance of faith, the importance of faith in public life, the importance of faith in America and our entire history and our entire experience, those of us who understand that faith has been central to making us the greatest Nation in human history versus those on the secular side who think we need a more secular culture. That is the debate. 
   And it is important that we weigh in on that debate. It is important that as we wage that debate and argue for the importance of faith in our culture and our public life that we recognize the religious history in the entire American experience that we have so enjoyed. I believe the American people get it. I believe the vast majority of families understand what the Founders understood, that faith is central to who we are as a people and to the great place we have as the greatest country in history. 
   It has been said many times already by previous speakers, but I think when you think about some of the things the Founders said, I love what Franklin said when they were in the midst of debate, and he was advocating for prayer before, so they could get through this impasse that they found themselves, he made the statement that if a sparrow can't fall without His knowledge, is it likely an empire can rise without His assistance? The Founders understood the importance of prayer. They understood the importance of faith. 
   And as many speakers have also referenced that document that I would argue next to Scripture, second only to Scripture, the greatest words ever put on paper, the Declaration of Independence, where the Founders wrote, ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,'' fabulous language, this almost romantic vision that the Founders had about what this country would offer to its people. They understood that we did, in fact, get our rights from the Almighty, and it is government's job not to grant us privileges, not to grant us rights, but to protect the rights we have by the very fact we were created in God's image. 
   And that fundamental principle is different from any other country in history. And again, it sets us apart. And so it is important that we recognize this history and recognize this debate that is going on and not be afraid to stand up and defend those principles that make us special. 
   I think it is appropriate that I end with one of my favorite Scriptures in II Timothy where Paul writes to Timothy. He says, ``I fought the good fight, I finished the course, I have kept the faith.'' And that is our charge as Americans, to fight the fight, to finish the course and to keep the faith that the Founders understood was central to making us the greatest nation ever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in strong support of this important resolution. Today we pause to remember nearly 3,000 who were killed, and thousands more who were injured, on that fateful morning 7 years ago. We remember the unspeakable evil we saw that morning, the terror that confronted us on our own shores. But we also remember the heroism of countless ordinary Americans who did extraordinary things that tragic day and in the weeks and months that followed. 
   Like the firefighters, paramedics, police officers, and other first responders who rushed into crumbling burning buildings, risking and giving their lives to do their duty and to save others, and, of course, the millions of Americans who gathered in church to pray, in communities centers and schools to organize relief for victims, and lined up around the corners to give blood. When evil confronted America that day, we did not flinch, we did not back down, and we did not surrender. 
   In the 7 years that have passed since that day, our Nation has remained on offense against the threat of radical Islamic extremism. It is a struggle that will define our generation and shape the next American century. We did not choose this battle, but we will meet it, as Americans always have, and we must be victorious. 
   I would again like to express my gratitude to the United States Armed Forces. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have answered the call of their country in her hour of need. They and their families have made countless sacrifices. Over 4,500 have given what President Lincoln called the fullest measure of devotion to their country. As long as this threat exists and Americans troops are deployed in harm's way, they must have the full support of this Congress. On this day when we look back and remember, let us gain strength from the examples of bravery and courage we have seen over the last 7 years. We must honor the legacy of the fallen and stand united against the continued threats to our country. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in renewing our commitment to these principles that have made us the home of the brave and will continue to keep us the home of the free.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, the folks on our side, we certainly care about the security of the United States, we care about the security of the homeland, but we also care about how the tax dollars of American families are spent. 
   The previous speaker talked about the right to vote on earmarks and how some of those people are going to vote for these earmarks. But it's not just about the right to vote on earmarks. It's about the right of American families and American citizens to see what those earmarks are that their elected officials may vote for or against. 
   I guess I look at this in this light, to paraphrase the line from the movie, ``show me the earmarks.'' Show me the earmarks. Because when you see the earmarks, then you are going to see where the money is going. That's what the American people want to know. We have talked about the term transparency a lot in this debate, because the reason it's so important is the lack of transparency inevitably leads to more spending.  
   That's just the way it works. We have got to know what's going on. If we don't, more spending is going to occur. If you don't take my word for it, look at the numbers. This bill increases spending 13.6 percent. It's spending that always drives. Spending is the problem. We hear the term, the old cliche with politicians, tax-and-spend politicians. It's really the opposite. It's really the opposite. It's spend-and-tax politicians. Spending drives the equation. 
   If you think about this, the spending contained in this bill, in the budget we passed that was passed a few weeks back, that spending inevitably will lead to higher taxes. Every single good tax cut that has been put in place over the last 6 years, under the Democrat spending plan, is going to go up, money that would be in the pockets of families to spend on their kids, their goals, their dreams, things that their kids care about, things that their family cares about, their business to reinvest it there. All those things that they would like to spend their money on, those taxes will go up, take money from the hardworking family of this country and give it to government. That's what we are talking about. 
   That's why we are talking about some of these issues. We want you to show me the earmarks, show us what's there so we can see where ultimately the spending will go and the American people, more importantly, can ultimately see that. 
   I am reminded of a debate that I had back in my days of the State House. There was a tax increase that was moving through our assembly, I was opposed to it, and I remember a reporter coming up to me and saying Jordan, you are so opposed to this tax increase, you think it's so bad for families and taxpayers across the State of Ohio, he said. But where's the outcry? Where are those families storming the State House to talk about this huge tax increase that you are fighting against? 
   I said, you know, they're too busy working to pay those taxes to storm the State House. That's the truth. We have got to remember the families out there who have been working hard, making their businesses succeed, making their families reach their goals and dreams they've set. We have got to remember those as we go through this debate. 
   I would be happy to yield to my colleague from North Carolina who is, I know, the sponsor of the second amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for putting this hour together. I thank my friend from California too for his focus on keeping taxes low, which the gentleman from Georgia made the right point: Whose money is it? Does it belong to the families of this 
   country or does it belong to government? 
   The families of America know that they can spend their money better than government. They can invest it in their kids, their grandkids, their goals, their dreams, their ideas, their principles. They can do it better than government can. American families know that taxes are too high. Think about the typical family, the typical family in this country. When you factor in local, State and Federal taxes, all those taxes that my friend from California went through that you pay in just a typical day, when you factor that in, the typical American family spends 50 percent of their income, 50 percent of what they make, what they bring in, that they can invest in their kids, their grandkids, their future, they have to give to some level of government. 
   As the gentleman from Georgia pointed out, when you think about what has happened this year in this Congress, we had a budget bill passed that doesn't extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that have helped our economy, that have helped families have a growing economy, the tax increases in there that result in huge, huge taxes in the future on American families. We had an energy bill that raises taxes on domestic energy companies. We had a  farm bill, a farm bill, one of the most bipartisan pieces of legislation that typically moves through the Congress, had a tax increase in it. 
   We had the SCHIP bill that the gentleman spoke on earlier in this hour which had a tax increase in it. And just this day on the floor we had a Trade Adjustment Assistance Act that also had a tax increase in it. And, as my good friend from Georgia pointed out, we now have what is appropriately called the mother of all tax increases coming, which will raise $3.5 trillion, $3.5 trillion on American families across this country. 
   It begs the question: Why do politicians want to raise taxes? It is real simple. Because politicians like to spend money. You always hear ``tax-and-spend politicians.'' It is actually the opposite. It is spend-and-tax. Spending always drives the equation. 
   That is why this summer my good friend and I and several other members of the Republican Party offered a series of amendments which said let's hold the line on spending. Let's do what families have had to do from time to time, what business owners, as my friend from California pointed out, have to do from time to time, what individual taxpayers have to do from time to time. Let's just spend what we spent last year. 
   After all, if you ask the typical American, do you think government spends a lot of money? Do you think maybe there is just a little bit of waste in the Federal Government? And everyone knows instinctively, of course there is. So we said, let's just spend what we spent last year. 
   You know what? Right now we are operating in a continuing resolution, which is a fancy way of saying we are living on last year's budget, even though the Congress was supposed to have budgets in place by September 30 and start a new budget. So we are living on last year's spending. 
   When we argued these amendments this fall, that is what we wanted to do, the other side told us, oh, the sky is going to fall, the world is going to end, all kinds of things are going to happen. You know what? For 4 weeks now we have been doing just what we offered in those amendments, living on last year's budget. And, guess what? Kids are going to school. The government is still running. Nothing terrible has really happened. If we can do it for 4 weeks, we can do it for 4 months, we can do it for the next year. 
   Here is why this is critical. If we don't begin to get a handle on spending, it hurts us in our economic position around the world. And right now Americans understand this as well. The market is so competitive, we have got to keep taxes low, keep spending under control so our economy can grow. 
   There was a point in the past, there was a point in the past coming out of World War II where America was uniquely situated; it didn't really matter if elected officials, if politicians did some dumb things. But now it matters. Now the competition is so stiff we have got to get public policy right. 
   Just think of some of the numbers we have to deal with today. We have 300 million people in this country. We are competing with the Chinese, who have 1.3 billion. It is critical that we do things right so we can remain the economic superpower, because here is the way the world works. 
   The economic superpower is also the military and diplomatic superpower. Right now there is one country that fits that definition, that is the United States of America, and that is a good thing. The American people recognize instinctively that the world is safer and better when America leads. If in the future that is some other country, that is a scary thought. We want America to lead. 
   I kind of joke when I say I think the only folks who don't get that concept is the editorial page of the New York Times. But Americans understand that the world is better. I love what Cal Thomas said. He was talking one time about how sometimes the national media doesn't see things the same way that a typical American family does. He had a line when he was talking about the New York Times. He said, ``I get up every morning and I read my Bible and the New York Times so I can see what each side is up to.'' There is certainly some truth in that statement. 
   It is important for America to lead. The way America can lead economically is to keep taxes low, keep spending under control, and, if we do that, American families, American business owners can create those jobs and make our economy grow so that we have a prosperous future, just like America has always had, and that will allow America to continue to be the greatest country in the world. 
   So I thank the gentleman for his time tonight and for his focus. He is so right on target. And my good friend from California as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The gentleman mentioned his recent trip out to the Mexican border in the State of Arizona. I had the pleasure of accompanying you on that trip and found that very insightful. 
   As we begin to move into this debate this session of the Congress, I think it is important that we keep some principles in mind. And, hopefully, these principles, I think, if they are followed, will help us arrive at the right public policy decision. And I think there are just three key ones. 
   And the first one is and it has been mentioned by the previous speakers this hour, but the first one is we have to focus on security first. As we discovered down at the border with Secretary Chertoff, it is important that we secure the border and we do that first. I think the former Speaker of the House has made the statement, does an antiballistic missile defense system make a lot of sense when a terrorist can rent a truck and drive it across the border? That is an important thing. It is about security. 
   When we were down there on our visit, a few things stuck out in my mind, and the American people understand this. The first is how real this problem is. As the gentleman from Iowa knows, we were in a helicopter flying out along the border, and the pilot came over the intercom and said, Look out the window right there and you will see some aliens attempting to cross right now. And we literally saw approximately 20, 25 people coming across. We were flying right along the Mexican/United States border, and we saw 25 people trying to cross the border illegally, and they attempted to hide under a tree. There wasn't much cover out in the desert, as the gentleman remembers, but there they were. And they had the clothes on their backs and jugs of water in their hands and they took off running back to the border. But it just reinforced in my mind what the American people need understand about how real this problem is. 
   The second thing that I think I came away with from that visit is the fence is working. As the gentleman from Virginia pointed out, where they are constructing it right now is having an impact. And obviously the strategy of our Secretary of our government is to put the fence up first in those areas where it is going to have the best and greatest impact, and that is in the urban areas. And it is working, and it is a double fence, as the gentleman talked about. And it is making a difference. 
   The other thing that is making a difference out there is our National Guard, our good men and women in the National Guard who are helping build that same fence where I know you welded and we all had a chance to do a little welding there. They are providing more eyes to see the illegals as they attempt to cross, and they are helping with that fence. But security has to be priority number one, as we think about the policy that makes sense for our country. 
   The second principle that has to guide this debate, and, again, it has  been highlighted already, is the idea that our country is great because we have a lot of great principles that were there at the founding and are still present today. One of those fundamental principles that makes America the greatest Nation ever is the concept that the rule of law matters. And when people willingly, knowingly violate the rule of law, there have to be serious consequences. And that is why amnesty as a policy makes no sense for people who willingly and knowingly violated the law. 
   And, finally, the third thing I would point out, and I think sometimes as we focus on making sure we are securing our borders and following the rule of law, one of the things that seems to get left out in the debate is we should welcome people, we should welcome immigrants who want to come here legally. I mean, immigrants have always been a great treasure to this country, have always added to the greatness of this country. And for those folks who want to come here and learn our culture, learn our language, learn English, we should welcome them. 
   And who can fault people who want to come to the freest, greatest Nation in history? So if they want to do it the right way, the legal way, we should work on a policy that also helps the bureaucracy work better to help those people who want to be a part of the American culture and want to be a part of this great country. 
   Madam Speaker, this is the greatest Nation in 
   history. And for people who want to come here for the right reasons, we should welcome them here. If these three principles drive our policy, I think we are going to get at the right policy and I hope we do, but it has to be driven by these three principles, and security has to be of paramount importance. 
   And I appreciate the gentleman from Iowa's leadership on this issue and others here in the United States Congress.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, my opposition to this proposal is clear and fundamental. It raises taxes. It is not fiscally responsible. It does not protect Social Security, and it does not protect the interests of families, who as the cornerstone of our society, deserve to be the very first consideration in each of our legislative decisions. 
   I am pleased to support Mr. RYAN, ranking member of the Budget Committee, and my colleagues on the Republican Study Committee on the conservative alternative to the budget blueprint before us today. I was pleased to offer a tax cut amendment to this legislation that would have extended the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 at least until 2012. Unfortunately, the amendment was not accepted, but I rise today to say that my opposition to H. Con. Res. 99 does not end with runaway taxes and spending. 
   True, the proposal has excessive spending that mortgages our children's future on government programs. 
   True, the proposal raises taxes on families and businesses, reinstates the ``marriage penalty'', reincarnates the death tax, and cuts the child tax credit in half. 
   True, these tax increases, the biggest in American history, will cost the average Ohio family thousands of dollars in higher taxes. 
   But what is most troubling is that the entire budget is based on a premise that is antithetical to what makes America great. 
   This budget postulates that economic security ..... a ``Great Society'' if you will ..... is just another government program away. 
   It says that the tax cuts currently in place, which have led to private sector growth with 7.6 million new jobs, 42 straight months of uninterrupted economic growth, the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 12,000, record levels of investment, and record low unemployment ..... tax cuts that have helped every American family regardless of income, are better left to expire. 
   It says that the $392.5 billion of additional tax dollars Democrats expect spend over the next 5 years are better spent on government programs than in the pockets of American families. It says that what we need is more government, not more jobs, not more economic growth, not more money working its way through our private sector economy. 
   Just 3 months into this new majority, the tax man has come twice, and he is coming again. 
   Mr. Chairman, April 15, the day American taxpayers love to hate, is still 18 days away. But today, March 29th, is the day the American taxpayer will come to fear. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on record tax hikes.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (GETTING THE NATION BACK ON TRACK -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for yielding, and appreciate this opportunity that RSC has put together to talk about taxes and spending and some of the challenges we face as a country. 
   We live in the greatest country in the world, but we do face some serious challenges. Obviously we face the challenge of terrorism, the threat from people who want to do our country harm and who don't believe in the great values that made us the greatest country in human history. 
   Also, we face another challenge, and that is the challenge of dealing with the fiscal situation that confronts us as Members of Congress. Just some numbers. The previous speaker from Missouri talked about tax issues. It is important to understand, you hear from time to time tax-and-spend politicians, it is really not that, it is really spend and tax. Spending drives the equation, and we have got to get Federal spending under control. 
   Just some numbers. The greatest economy in human history is the U.S. economy. It is the largest economy ever, a $14 trillion annual economy. 
   The second largest economy in the world is the nation of Japan, approximately $3.2 trillion. 
   The third largest economy, if I can use that term, is the Federal Government. We all just saw the budget that came out last week, a $3 trillion Federal budget. We have a $3 trillion annual operating budget, and we have a $9 trillion national debt. The Federal Government spends $23,000 per year per household; the top 25 percent of income earners pay 84 percent of the taxes. So when you hear these elected officials say we have to give tax cuts to the middle class, we are going to tax the rich, it is already happening. So when people talk about only taxing the rich, what they really mean is they are going to tax taxpayers. Every single family is going to pay more. 
   We have to get spending under control if we are going to keep taxes low so families have more of their money to spend on their goals and their dreams, their kids and their grandkids. 
   Last year I was proud to be part of the RSC who worked hard at lowering spending. In fact, we didn't really work to lower spending. What we said to the majority party is, let's spend what we spent last year. We offered a series of amendments. The way the process works around here is we have to have 12 appropriations bills in law by the end of our fiscal year, which is September 30.     
   So as those bills were moving through, we offered a series of amendments that said, let's spend what we spent the previous year. After all, all kinds of families, all kinds of business owners, all kinds of taxpayers in this great country have had to do that from time to time. Doesn't it make some sense for the Federal Government, where everyone instinctively knows we have waste in spending, doesn't it make sense for the Federal Government to maybe just live on what they did the previous year? But no, the majority party wouldn't do that. And they increased spending on those bills at three and four and in some cases five times the rate of inflation. And all we said was, let's just hold the line. 
   And the argument we got when we offered our amendments was, you know what, if we can't spend more, the world's going to end, the sky's going to fall, all kinds of terrible things are going to happen. We just can't do that. We've got to spend more. 
   Well, as the process unfolded, and so that the American people understand, Madam Speaker, we didn't have any one of those bills, not one single bill was enacted by September 30. And so on September 30, we had to pass what's called a continuing resolution, which is a fancy way of saying, let's live on last year's budget. 
   A few weeks into that, I came to this floor, same spot here, and gave a speech. I said, you know, a few months ago, a few weeks ago we had talked about the fact that we wanted to hold the line on spending and we were told that if we didn't increase spending, all kinds of bad things were going to happen; the sky was going to fall, the sun wouldn't come up. 
   I said, you know what? For the past 6 weeks we've been living on last year's budget and imagine this: The government's still running. The sun's still coming up; the world hasn't ended. I said, how can that be? And my rhetorical question was, You know what? If we can do it for 6 weeks, I bet we could do it for 6 months, I bet we could do it for a whole year, and save the taxpayers a lot of money and, more importantly, and maybe most importantly, begin to better position ourselves as a country to deal with the long-term problems that we know are out there. 
   It is important that we get spending under control because when we do, we can make sure our economy continues to grow, we can keep taxes low, and we can let families have the kind of resources they need, their resources, to spend on their goals and dreams. 
   The last thing I will say is this before yielding back to the gentleman from South Carolina. 
   The way the world works is this: The economic leader in the world is the military leader in the world. Right now that is one country, the United States of America, and that's a good thing. It is good when American leads. 
   You know, folks at home in Ohio, folks back home in Carolina, they get it. They understand that instinctively. I think maybe the only people who don't understand that fact is the editorial page of the New York Times. 
   I love the line Cal Thomas has, syndicated columnist Cal Thomas. He talks about how normal people perceive things, and how sometimes the elite national press perceives things. And he has a great line. He says, I get up every morning, I read my Bible and the New York Times so I can see what each side's up to. And there's some truth to that statement. 
   It's important that we lead economically. We can do that by keeping spending low and keeping taxes low. And when we do that we can be the leader of the world, which is a good thing for safety around the planet.  
   With that I would yield back to the gentleman. I appreciate again his putting this hour together and talking about this very important challenge that we face as a country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 6842, and in support of the Childers amendment, I support the amendment for three reasons, first it's just basic respect for the second amendment. The founders got it right when they put the second amendment right after the first. 
   Our founders understood how important this principle was in ensuring our basic freedoms in a constitutional republic. 
   I want to support the Childers amendment also for the fact that it respects the Supreme Court decision in the Heller case. This bill, in its current form, would allow for restrictions and regulations to be imposed that run contrary to the expressed opinion in that court decision. 
   When given the chance to implement commonsense legislation that protects the second amendment rights and respected the Supreme Court, the D.C. City Council instead enacted an emergency bill, completely in defiance of the Court, that banned most semiautomatic pistols, the firearm most often used by families to defend themselves. 
   They banned operable firearms in the home, requiring an individual to assemble and load and fire them only after an attack is under way and instituted costly and intrusive and convoluted registration process. 
   Finally, the last reason, I think, that the Childers amendment makes so much sense, is it's just good common sense. As the individual from Indiana pointed out, criminals aren't stupid, they are just bad. 
   Bad guys aren't dumb, they are just bad, and here is the dynamic that is at work. If you have a bad guy, a bad guy out there on the street trying to figure out which home he is going to rob some night, and there are two adjacent properties side by side. In one driveway is a pickup truck with a gun rack and a bumper sticker that says, ``I love the NRA'' and ``Palin for President.'' 
   In the very next driveway, you have a Volkswagen with a Greenpeace bumper sticker and, respectfully, ``WAXMAN for President'' bumper sticker as well, which place do you think he is going to target for a crime? 
   That's the dynamics that is at work here. Criminals now have to stop and think, as previous speakers have pointed out, about this family may, in fact, be now able to exercise their second amendment rights to protect themselves, their family and their property. 
   That's the basic fundamental constitutional right we want to protect with the Childers amendment. That's why I oppose the underlying bill and support the amendment.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, America is the greatest Nation in history with the greatest economy in history, a $14 trillion annual economy. To remain the number one economy, we need a real energy plan, not a sham. To help families across this country, we need a real energy plan, not a sham. 
   Here is the Democrat plan: no real offshore drilling; no drilling in ANWR; no nuclear power; no lawsuit abuse reform; no revenue sharing with the States. But you know what is in the plan, tax increases. Think about that. At a time when we want our economy to grow, they are raising taxes. At a time when we need more oil, they are going to tax the very people who produce the oil. 
   This is a terrible plan. It doesn't help our economy stay number one. It won't help American families, and that is why we should vote ``no'' on the Democrat plan and support the Republican plan that does the right things for our country.

   Chris attended middle and high school in the Shawnee District before graduating from the Apollo Career Center in Lima, Ohio. He's remembered by many as a quiet man, but one with the ability to make people smile; someone who earned people's respect and led by example. 
   Christian Neff died on Wednesday, September 19 in Iraq while serving America in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Age 19, he is survived by a loving family and friends in Allen County and beyond. 
   In reading of Christian's life and speaking with his mother, I was touched by the dramatic impact he had on the lives of so many. 
   A young man of deep faith, Chris stood up and volunteered to serve his country. He fought to promote freedom. He gave his life in defense of his family, his community, his State and his Nation. For this, each and every American owes him and his family a great debt of gratitude. 
   Christian will be deeply missed. But the strength of his character and the courage he demonstrated through his service will live on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, the United States of America is the greatest Nation in human history. And that is due to a number of reasons, number of facts, number of truths that make that so. But certainly, one of those is the document we call the United States Constitution. And on giving the District of Columbia a voting Member in Congress, the United States Constitution could not be more clear. And let me just read what other Members have read: ``Article I, section 2, the House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the people of the several States. No person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the age of 25 years and have been 7 years a citizen of the United States and who shall not, when elected, be an inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. Further, when vacancies happen in the representation from any State, the executive authority thereof shall issue writs of election to fill such vacancies.'' 
   State, State, State. Three different times the word State is used. The District of Columbia is not a State. I can't help that inconvenient fact, as someone has said earlier. But those are the facts. You don't have to be a lawyer. You don't have to be a judge. You don't have to sit on the Supreme Court to understand what the Constitution says. 
   This bill is unconstitutional, and that is why I oppose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, for those Americans brave enough to be watching this proceeding right now on TV, I'd ask them to sit down because I have some shocking news to share with them. And here it is: The Federal Government spends a lot of money. 
   Big surprise; right? 
   How much money are we talking here? How about $23,000 per year per household. 
   My guess is that with the exception of our military, it's tough for the average American to name one thing the Federal Government does well. 
   This budget proposes to spend more than $3.1 trillion. That, Mr. Chairman, is not an easy thing to do. To reach $3.1 trillion, the Federal Government will have to spend $100,000 a second, 6 million bucks a minute, over 350 million bucks an hour every day for the next year. Whoever thought that Senator Dirksen's line about ``a billion here, a billion there'' would become outdated? 
   Mr. Chairman, we've heard of tax-and-spend politicians, but I believe it's spending that drives taxes. And reckless out-of-control spending has put us on a path for economic disaster. 
   And don't take my word for it. Ask outgoing Comptroller General David Walker, who is sounding the alarm across the country about the unsustainable rate at which Congress is spending. 
   The American people instinctively know that Congress has an insatiable appetite for spending. They can see it. In terms of real dollars, Congress has quadrupled spending over my lifetime. 
   The question is, for what? Why do we need four times more Federal Government today than we did in 1964? It's not the military. Defense spending's impact on the budget has decreased by almost two-thirds in real dollars. This, while earmarks have skyrocketed and mandatory spending has grown tenfold. 
   The real change has been in the mindset. Simply put, Congress has grown to accept the ``nanny state.'' Some Members of this body have grown accustomed to the numbers in this budget. But believe me, they are staggering to the American people, and the people of the Fourth District of Ohio. How staggering? What if, instead of spending $23,000 per family, the Federal Government spent only $20,000 per family? We could jump-start this economy with $400 billion in tax cuts, and we could balance our budget virtually in 1 year. 
   Mr. Chairman, the sirens are blaring. The alarms are ringing. We need to answer the call and put our fiscal house in order. And we can start by voting ``no'' on the Democrat budget.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, like the Speaker, growing up a Big Red Machine fan, I still remember those teams with Johnny Bench, Joe Morgan, Tony Perez, in sixth grade, watching that series. 
   I rise to recognize the most recent achievements of the Boston Red Sox and commend their victory in the 2007 Major League Baseball World Series. In the last few years, the Red Sox have distinguished themselves as one of the most dominant teams in baseball. Of course, this was not always the case. 
   After winning their fifth World Series in 1918, their regular season successes were often met by postseason disappointment. Those were the old Red Sox. 
   In this century, we have the new Red Sox, the team that entered the 2004 playoffs as a wild card and then proceeded to mount one of the most memorable comebacks in baseball history down three games to zero against their arch rival, the New York Yankees. 
   They came back to win the American League Championship Series and ultimately went on to break the Curse of the Bambino, winning the 2004 World Series in four straight games against the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2007, after winning the American League East Division, the Red Sox again faced adversity in the American League Championship Series down 3-1 to that other great team in Ohio, the Cleveland Indians. They persevered, winning three games in a row to once again represent the American League in the World Series. 
   The Red Sox went on to win this series again in four games, sweeping the red-hot Colorado Rockies behind the leadership of Manager Terry Francona. The 2007 Red Sox did it all. I congratulate them and their team and the entire Red Sox community.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of this resolution. Obviously, as a result of these devastating floods this summer, we had eight counties that were declared disaster counties in our State, 4 1/2 of those counties I had the privilege of representing. The other 3 1/2 counties were represented by our late friend, Congressman Paul Gillmor. 
   I want to commend Congressman Gillmor's staff for the help of Paul, of course, when he was with us, and then his staff for the great assistance they provided our office and others as we worked through this. 
   I also just want to take a moment to thank those local leaders, both our police, our fire, our EMS people, our local public officials and our State public officials who did just an outstanding job and also commend our Federal officials. FEMA was there in Ohio, the leaders were there, Director Paulison, as well as Mr. Preston with the SBA, and then they have been in Ohio for several months serving families and individuals and local governments who were devastated by these floods.  
   The thing, I guess, that really stands out for me, in the midst of this devastation, it was so neat to see how communities come together, how people work together and all kinds of acts of kindness from family member to family member and from neighbor to neighbor and community to community. It was amazing to see what takes place when devastation hits an area. 
   The resolution just expresses our commendation for those individuals, those local officials, those families, those people in west central and north central Ohio who did such an outstanding job dealing with the devastation that took place.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the passing of seven of this Nation's young students. On the morning of October 28, 2007, a fire quickly swept through the beach house in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, where they were spending a weekend. 
   Six of the seven were students at the University of South Carolina. The seventh attended Clemson. All were filled with much promise. 
   With this in mind, I express my deepest condolences to the friends and families of the seven. Rest assured that you are in all of our thoughts and prayers. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the entire community of Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, for its response to this tragedy. From the very onset of the flames, local citizens rushed to alert and assist  emergency responders. These responders then worked bravely to rescue those trapped inside, aid the injured, and extinguish the fire. 
   Unfortunately, the blaze was too powerful and claimed seven young lives. However, without the adept response of all involved, the tragic toll of this blaze would have surely been higher. It is with all this in mind that I would like to take this opportunity to commend those involved in the response. Our sincere gratitude goes out to all of you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, government spends too much money. Ask any American family, is government so lean, so efficient, has it tightened its belt so much that it just can't cut anymore, it has to spend what this bill purports to spend and wants to spend? And if you ask a typical American family that, you're going to get an overwhelmingly, No, government is too big; it spends too much. 
   And if you don't believe the American people and American families, look at the numbers. We have a $3 trillion budget we're dealing with here. We have an $8 trillion national debt. The government spends $23,000 per American household. We have an entitlement crisis that everybody knows is going to happen here in the next 10 to 15 years when you think about what we face in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. And then this bill grows, over last year's spending level, 2 1/2 times the rate of inflation, 5.9 percent increase over last year, $1 billion increase in spending over what we did last year. 
   My amendment is real simple. Frankly, it's the same amendment I've offered, now this is the ninth time. All non-defense related appropriations bills we have offered this amendment to, and the amendment is real simple. It says we're not going to cut anything; we're just going to spend what we spent last year. A pretty modest first step in beginning to get a handle on the spending that is out of control with the Federal Government. 
   Because one thing I know for certain, I've said this several times, but it's so true in my time in public life. We always hear about tax and spend politicians. The truth is, it's spend and tax. Spending always drives the equation. More and more spending inevitably leads to higher taxes and more taxes. In fact, we've seen that from this body over the last several weeks, tax increases on American families, American business owners, tax increases that hurt those families, hurt our businesses, and ultimately hurt our economy. 
   This is a simple amendment which says, let's spend what we spent last year; after all, all kinds of families, all kinds of taxpayers, all kinds of business owners have had to do that time and time again. It's not too much to ask the Federal Government that has a $3 trillion budget, an $8 trillion debt, and spends $23,000 per household, it is not too much to ask the Federal Government to do the same thing. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   And just let me ask the question of the American people: Do you think, instead of spending $18.8 billion, do you think government can get along with spending $17.7 billion? We made it last year on that; didn't seem to be too much to ask before. We always hear it is a devastating cut when it's not even a cut.

We want to spend what we spent last year. The reason we don't want to increase spending is because everybody knows, the American people know this, when you increase spending and spend and spend and spend, it leads to tax and tax and tax. And that's what hurts those same families the gentlelady was talking about. 
   When you take more of their money, money that they could invest in their kids, pay for their kids' education, pay for that vacation they want to take as a family, all kinds of things they want to spend it on, when you take that away from them, that's what really taking away from families is all about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Founders had it right. We are created with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuits of happiness. It is interesting the order the Founders placed the rights they chose to mention. Can you pursue happiness if you first don't have liberty? Can you ever go after your goals and dreams if you first don't have freedom? And do you ever have true freedom if government doesn't protect your most fundamental right, your right to live? 
   H.R. 3 devalues human life. It ends human life, and it does so with taxpayer dollars. This is the wrong kind of message to send. It is the wrong thing to do. 
   On this issue, the science is also clear. The morals are clear, and the ethics are clear. We do not have to end life to protect it. Today, as has been pointed out earlier, American doctors are performing all kinds of positive research without taking human life. Embryonic stem cell research is not producing results, even after 25 years and millions of dollars of taxpayer money. 
   Like other pro-life Members of this body, I support ethical research that protects life, but embryonic stem cell research does not. 
   Mr. Speaker, the ethical decision is the smart decision. That is why I oppose this bill, and hope others do as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Founders of our great Nation got it right. We are created with certain inalienable rights, and among those rights are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is in defense of the first of these rights--the right to life--that I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 3, the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. Like its cousin, H.R. 810, which failed to pass the legislative process during the last Congress, H.R. 3 would provide new Federal auspices and funding to destroy embryos for use in embryonic stem cell research. 
   Like the other pro-life members of this House, Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support the many forms of ethical stem cell research taking place in our country today--research that has already yielded invaluable treatments for over 70 health conditions. Among these are successful treatments for Brain Cancer, Breast Cancer, various forms of Lymphoma and Leukemia, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, spinal cord injury, Sickle Cell Anemia and Krabbe Disease. 
   Research has demonstrated that various forms of adult stem cell materials, umbilical cord blood and, as described in a Washington Times article from January 8th, amniotic fluid are an excellent source of pluripotent stem cells. Such ethical sources have yielded all of these effective treatments and offer hope for Americans suffering the ravages of disease. In many cases, these materials are taken from the patients themselves and so offer a better therapeutic match than materials taken from the embryos of other humans. Furthermore, expansion of the resources designed to gather and store these materials will increase the number and frequency of successful treatments. 
   Despite these significant facts, many in this House are pressing for Federal funding for embryonic stem cell research, which necessitates destroying human embryos and, thus, human lives. The pre-born are precious human beings from the moment of conception. They deserve our protection and love and no benefit--perceived or otherwise--should persuade us to allow their destruction. All of this added to the fact that embryonic stem cell research has never yielded a successful treatment for any disease, in spite of millions in annual funding (the NIH spent $38 million on human embryonic stem cell research in 2005) and 25 years of animal and human research. In recent years, embryonic stem cell research has also been marred by fraud through the falsified cloning reports of Dr. Hwang Woo Suk. 
   Some people have argued that pre-existing human embryos now in storage must be used for research because they  are destined for destruction anyway. This is not borne out by the fact that the vast majority of human embryos were created for family-building and that families can adopt and have adopted these embryos and had children. 
   Mr. Speaker, we must not make a morally repugnant choice in the interest of expedience and we must not play God with human lives. We must defend the lives of the pre-born while facilitating ethical forms of stem cell research that have produced concrete results and hold great promise for the future. This is most consistent with a compassionate regard for all life--young and old.

   Mr. Speaker, today the Supreme Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003, which was passed in the House, in the Senate, signed by the President and became Public Law No. 108-105 in November of 2003. 
   As others have stated this evening, this is a victory for the health of women across this country. It is a victory for unborn children. It is a victory for life, and, as I have said, people have indicated it is a victory for America. 
   I just want to take a minute to thank all the pro-life volunteers across this country who are really the reason we have this celebration that we have today. Those of us in public life, those of us charged with forming public policy, we get approached just about every day by lobbyists and interest groups. And they want to talk to us. They want to influence legislation. They want to be a part of this process where the laws and the taxpayer dollars are spent. And they want to do all those things because they have a financial interest at stake. But the people who articulate that life is sacred, the people who advocate for protecting the sanctity of human life, they have nothing to gain financially by talking to us. They have nothing to gain financially by being involved in this movement. They simply do it because it is the right thing to do. They understand life is precious; life is sacred. They understand. That is why they work in our crisis pregnancy centers. That is why they help unwed mothers, because they understand how precious life is. And they understand, and others have talked about this. They understand what the Founders understood, that life is precious. And, as they said in the Declaration of Independence, that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I think it is interesting to note the order that the Founders placed the rights they chose to mention, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Can you pursue happiness, can you go after your goals and dreams if you first don't have freedom and liberty? And do you ever have true freedom and true liberty if government doesn't protect your most fundamental right, your right to live? 
   And that is what we celebrate today. Again, it is a testimony to the hard work of millions of pro-life people across this country. So I want to commend you and again say what a great day for America.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank the chairwoman of the committee for her hard work and the entire committee on this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the bill for many of the reasons that the ranking member has cited. I believe the bill shortsightedly tries to move a good organization, the U.S. Small Business Administration, further from its original mission of helping create, strengthen and maintain small businesses across our country. 
   The SBA was created by the Small Business Act of 1953. Its mission was to stand up for small businesses, and its main focus, other than loan guarantees, was promoting small businesses for Federal contracts. Since then, the SBA has grown to become the largest backer of small businesses in America. It has made progress toward its goal of improving small business and the engine of our free market economy. 
   Of late, though, the SBA has done more in fueling small business to coordinating disaster relief for businesses and homeowners. This is certainly a worthy goal, but again, one that strays from its fundamental mission. As the ranking member pointed out, this bill would require the SBA to provide loans it once denied as bad risks. It would also allow recipients to receive disaster relief. 
   Small businesses are successful in part because they are uniquely focused on their mission, and because they watch every single penny. This RECOVER Act will further blur the focus of SBA's mission while making it impossible for them, or us, to protect the integrity of tax dollars. 
   Finally, I would urge my colleagues to support the amendments that the ranking member plans to offer. Those will, I think, improve the legislation and make it worthy of everyone's support in a broad, bipartisan manner. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 1/2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jefferson) who represents and has been very active in the committee addressing the issues of the Small Business Administration Disaster Loan program.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the Chair. 
   And let me, as I did yesterday when I offered a similar amendment to the appropriations bill we dealt with then, let me start by thanking the chairman and the ranking member and the committee for their work. I have the utmost respect particularly for the ranking member. I have respect for the chairman as well, but particularly the ranking member, who comes from the great Buckeye State. I appreciate his service over the years to Ohio, not just in northern Ohio, but to our entire State. 
   I bring before the body again an amendment. This is the fifth time. And as I said yesterday, I don't do this to be a pain in the neck, I do it because I think government spends too much money. 
   In this particular bill, the increase over fiscal year 2007 spending levels to what's in front of us today and dominating our debate is a $2 billion increase. And so my amendment would simply say, let's not increase the budget by $2 billion in this appropriations bill. Let's simply do what all kinds of families are doing across this country, let's spend last year's level. Let's live within last year's budget as all kinds of taxpayers, all kinds of families, all kinds of business owners are having to do across this country. It's not too much to ask government to do the same. 
   Here is why it's important. It's important because there is a growing financial crisis coming for this country, which is the entitlement programs, which we're not even talking about today. Whether it's entitlement programs or discretionary spending, which we are focused on today, we've got to get a handle on spending. There is no better place to start than today and say, you know what, let's live with what we lived on last year. 
   The other reason it's critical that we do this, and this is just as sure as the sun is going to come up tomorrow, whenever you spend and spend and spend, it inevitably leads to tax and tax and tax. I've said every single time I've presented this amendment, and it's every bit as true today, that it's not tax and spend, it's spend and tax. Spending drives the equation. If we can hold the line on spending, we can keep taxes low on American families, on American taxpayers and on American  business owners. That's why this amendment is so important. 
   Let me just point to a couple of specific things. The bill in front of us today increases spending 9 percent over last year's budget. Now again, there are some great things in this bill. And as I said earlier, I commend the chairman and the ranking member for the work they've done and the committee's work as well, but I want to point out some of the things that taxpayer dollars are going to be spent on. 
   First, the text of the bill weakens an existing provision in current law that prohibits funds from being used for any needle exchange program in the District of Columbia. Taxpayers might want to know that their dollars are going to be spent for something like that. The text of the bill weakens the existing provision in current law that prohibits Federal funds from being used for the District of Columbia Domestic Partner law, something taxpayers I know in the Fourth District in Ohio, but probably all across this country, would like to know. 
   And then the third one, and I will just point out, the IRS, that wonderful agency that so many Americans and so many taxpayers love, is going to get a $550 million increase over last year's budget, 5 percent over last year's budget. I said yesterday on the floor, in the course of our debate, that when you get all this additional government, all this new government, all this new spending, it reminds me of a statement from one of our great presidents, our third President, Mr. Jefferson. Mr. Jefferson said, ``When government fears the people, there is a liberty. When people fear the government, there is tyranny.'' 
   Now, with that statement in mind, just ask yourself the simple question: American taxpayers can ask themselves a simple question; if next week when we're home someone knocks at our door and we answer the door and they identify themselves as, hello, I'm Mr. Smith and I'm from the IRS, is your first response, oh, joy, one of my government servants is here to help me today? I mean, that's what American taxpayers are in store for. That very agency that they have not the fondest respect for is going to get a 5 percent increase in this bill. 
   Again, Mr. Chairman, I don't think it's too much to ask for government to live on last year's budget. That's what this amendment does. 
   I appreciate, again, the work that the committee has done, but I think it's certainly within reason to say we can keep spending where it was last year again, like all kinds of families are having to do across this country. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, before yielding to the distinguished ranking member, just let me say a couple of things in response to the chairman. We certainly care about the Chair, but, Mr. Chairman, we care about the American taxpayers as well. 
   Tax cuts go to taxpayers, not the rich. Tax cuts go to taxpayers. But we have had to debate this every single time we have brought these series of amendments forward when you talk about cutting the bills, drastic cuts, the-sky-is-going-to-fall cuts. All we are saying is, let's spend what we spent last year.  
   Now, only in Washington when you spend the same amount of money that you spent last year is that called a cut. Only in Washington. Back in Ohio, back in Urbana, back in Lima, back in Findlay, no one would call that a cut. They would say, you know what? The government is getting by on what they did last year. That is probably something they should do, when they're talking about a $3 trillion budget that they spend each year. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan), the distinguished ranking member of the Budget Committee.

   Mr. Chairman, let me just reiterate what the previous speaker said. Look, we heard the term ``devastating cut.'' As the gentleman from Texas indicated, we want to level-fund. We don't want to give a $550 million increase to the IRS. We want to level-fund the IRS and other agencies contained in this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, the principal role of our Federal Government is to help keep America safe. 
   As such, we in Congress must make our national defense a top budget priority. 
   This means we must pledge our steadfast support to American troops serving both at home and abroad, and we must renew our unwavering commitment to homeland security, in recognition of the dangerous world in which we live. 
   H.R. 1585, the National Defense Authorization Act, makes a genuine effort to achieve each of these goals. That's why I will vote for it, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
   In 1945, at the end of World War II, the defense budget of the United States represented 34.5 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. By 1968, that number had shrunk to 9.8 percent. Today, the number is less than half of that: about 4.3 percent. 
   Certainly, the overall dollars spent on defense have increased as our economy has grown, but it is clear that our priorities have shifted. This bill, while not perfect, commits to funding our defense budget in a way that many of us would have thought impossible just a few months ago, given the nature of the debate at that time. Some would argue that the tenor of the debate on national defense has shifted from talk of cutting off funds for our troops in battle to this bipartisan bill. 
   Some of the bipartisan provisions contained in this defense funding blueprint include: Continued support for our troops in harm's way, serving in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom and elsewhere. $4.1 billion for state-of-the-art Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to help protect our soldiers from IEDs. Increased Army and Marine Corps active duty end strength, as well as a 3.5 percent pay raise for all members of the armed forces in 2008, and guaranteed pay raises in 2009, 2010, and 2011. $1 billion in new funding for National Guard equipment to benefit both our homeland security and national defense missions. 
   These are great and welcome achievements for our national defense--achievements that each of us can be proud to support. But make no mistake: this bill is far from perfect. The measure contains some critical funding cuts that, in my opinion, will hurt our ability to protect our homeland and our national defense interests from missile attacks. 
   The Democratic bill guts funding for a ballistic missile defense system capable of intercepting missiles in each phase of flight. This type of program can help protect against growing threats in a changing world. Though I was pleased we Republicans were able to restore some of the funding for this important program through the amendment process, I am disappointed that cuts still exist. But in terms of helping achieve our most critical role--keeping America safe--this bill has, and deserves, bipartisan support.  
   Again, Mr. Chairman, though there are some aspects of this legislation that I clearly oppose, it is an important step in the direction of making national defense and homeland security a continued priority of this Congress.  
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended. 
   The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises. 
   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Weiner) having assumed the chair, Mr. Pastor, Acting Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1585) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for military activities of the Department of Defense, to prescribe military personnel strengths for fiscal year 2008, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 403, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to express my opposition to H.R. 1592, the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act. 
   This measure represents an unprecedented departure from the deeply rooted American principle of equal justice under law. 
   Justice should be blind. It should be equal for all Americans, and it should be rendered in a criminal justice system that does not take such issues as race, gender, and religion into consideration. 
   It makes no sense to me that crimes committed against one citizen should be punished any more or any less than crimes committed against another, which is what this bill will do. 
   Violent crimes that are not aimed at a certain class of people, like those committed recently at Virginia Tech, are just as reprehensible as those that are committed for other reasons. 
   Yet this bill would likely treat the senseless, random violence at Virginia Tech less harshly than other, less ``random'' crimes. 
   Even worse, the bill asks local law enforcement to infer if a crime was committed ``because of'' bias toward a protected group. This  essentially means that one's ``thoughts'' or ``feelings'' might be evidence of hate, and can be considered when determining whether a crime was indeed a ``hate'' crime. 
   Let me say that again. The bill would ask law enforcement to consider one's potential ``thoughts'' as evidence of ``hate.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, this is the dangerous, likely unconstitutional threat that has caused great concern to so many residents of Ohio's 4th Congressional District. 
   Upon consideration of this bill in the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Speaker, I sent you a letter, co-signed by many of my Republican colleagues on the committee. The letter expressed concern about H.R. 1592's ``thought crime'' provisions and their potential to categorize individuals who share spiritual or gospel messages as hate criminals. 
   In the letter, we noted that the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed Resolution 060356, which castigated Cardinal William Levada and the Catholic Church for opposing the adoption of children by homosexuals. The resolution, perhaps prophetically, describes the Church's policy using such words as ``hateful,'' ``discriminatory,'' ``insulting,'' and ``callous.'' 
   It is easy to see how this type of inflammatory anti-religious assertion emanating from a governmental body is disconcerting to those who espouse deep religious beliefs. 
   This so-called hate crimes bill not only discards the fundamental American legal principle of equal justice, it also lays the groundwork to criminalize individuals and groups that might not share the liberal values of places like San Francisco. 
   It is rather ironic that on this, the National Day of Prayer--a day where Americans gather to celebrate our religious heritage--liberal members of this House are uniting to pass a bill that could deem their prayerful voices as ``hateful.'' 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I want to thank the Chair of the committee and Congressman Cooper and Congressman Towns for all their work and our ranking member of the committee on the bill. But, Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. It is unfortunate in a bill that has been worked on by both sides so well that we have an amendment now that I think is going to be somewhat divisive. But I believe the amendment may arise from the U.S. Attorney's investigation that consumed so much of our time earlier in this session, particularly the time on  the Judiciary Committee. That investigation showed no wrongdoing in the dismissal of U.S. Attorneys and no undermining of the institutions of the Department of Justice. 
   As time drags on, though, people wonder, why did we spend so much time on this issue? Maybe the majority feels the need to show some results. Perhaps that is why we have this amendment before us today. But the U.S. Attorney's investigation did not show any need to realign the responsibilities of the Office of Professional Responsibility and the Office of the Inspector General. It certainly did not show that OIG should swallow up OPR, which would be the effective result of the amendment before us this afternoon. On the contrary, these offices have quietly gone about their investigative activities and we have seen no great difficulties arise from the exercise of their duties. 
   But apart from the U.S. Attorney's investigation, the amendment clearly is unwise for other reasons. Both OPR and OIG are needed in their current structure. OPR was established to ensure that the Department of Justice's thousands of attorneys follow all applicable professional rules of conduct. OIG performs an equally critical but very different function of pursuing investigations into general criminal wrongdoing and general administrative misconduct by the Department. 
   This important distinction calls for two different offices to work on these two issues. As conferees underscored when Congress created the Office of Inspector General in the 1980s: ``The conferees do not intend that the IG should render judgments on the exercise of prosecutorial or litigative discretion in a particular case or controversy. Unless a unique set of circumstances dictate otherwise, the conferees intend that reviews of such prosecutorial or other litigative discretion in a particular case or controversy is an appropriate role for, and may be delegated by, the Attorney General.'' 
   The Attorney General has delegated that authority to OPR. No basis exists to question this policy today. Unlike OIG, OPR is staffed and led entirely by career lawyers. Political background cannot be considered when appointing anyone to a position in the Office of Professional Responsibility. Thousands of current and former Department lawyers can attest that OPR's independence is undisputed and that the Office of Professional Responsibility has never allowed the manner in which it investigates or the results it reaches to be influenced by any political appointee in the Department. Any Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General being investigated by the Office of Professional Responsibility is automatically recused from participating in the matter. The most recent example of this is the U.S. Attorney's investigation itself. 
   I only scratch the surface of the reasons to preserve OPR as it is. As anyone with substantial experience knows, this office can be relied upon to make the hard calls and find attorney misconduct when it has occurred, enabling the Department of Justice to take the proper disciplinary action. 
   I would call the House's attention again to the need for legislation to address serious crime issues. Republicans have introduced those bills but they continue to languish. Responsible citizens don't want to hear that their loved ones or their neighbors were hurt or killed because the majority in Congress could not bear to solve the Nation's problems with the opposing party's solutions or to turn away from the hunt for political victims. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, Congress right now is a dysfunctional place. We've got terrorists who want to kill us, and we can't pass the FISA law. We've got $4 gas, and we can't drill for more oil. And now in the face of a $10 trillion national debt, we have a budget in front of us that has the largest tax increase in history and is the largest budget in history. It just doesn't make sense. 
   In this time of economic uncertainty, with record-high energy prices, with the cost of food and fuel taking an increasing share of the family budget, Congress has a moral responsibility, a moral responsibility, to find ways to tighten its belt. Congress should be laser focused on cutting wasteful and redundant spending from the Federal budget in order to lower taxes to let families and business owners and taxpayers keep more of what they earn. 
   This budget, the largest in human history, does exactly the opposite. It has the largest tax increase in history to pay for the largest spending in history. This budget spends $100,000 per second, $6 million per minute, $350 million an hour every day for the entire year. It spends more than $23,000 per family, again, a record amount. Does the average American family feel they're getting their $23,000 worth from the Federal Government? It sort of reminds me of I think it was Will Rogers, who said, if we ever get all the government we pay for, look out. 
   Mr. Speaker, this reckless, out-of-control spending is not only unneeded; it has put us on a path toward economic disaster. 
   And I will be the first to admit Congress' spending problem wasn't created overnight and the blame does not lie in the lap of one single party. In terms of real fiscal year 2000 dollars, real dollars, Congress has quadrupled spending over my lifetime with both parties sharing in the blame. Our priorities have shifted dramatically from national defense and toward entitlement spending. It has become clear to me that here in Congress, the dials are always set to ``spend.'' It's spend and tax. That's always the program. 
   I think back to the amendments I offered last year during the appropriations process, nine amendments that would have saved $23 billion by simply asking Federal agencies to do what all kinds of families have had to do: spend the previous year's amount, hold the line on spending. These amendments were defeated on party-line votes, with Members of the majority claiming the sky would fall, the world would end if we could not increase spending at three or more times the rate of inflation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions. 
   This motion to recommit is simple and straightforward, one of these important issues that I think we can all agree on, and, frankly, an issue I would have brought as an amendment in committee if I had thought about the idea then. It says that people who are not compliant with their court-ordered child support arrangements, deadbeat dads, are not eligible for the expanded Federal benefits included in the bill. 
   This motion sends a clear message to the American people that we have respect for their hard-earned tax dollars they send to Washington, DC. The underlying bill, however, sends a far different message about the priorities of the majority party in Congress. 
   Think about it: American families are paying more than $4 a gallon for gasoline, but are we acting to bring more energy to this country? America faces unprecedented terrorist threats from abroad, but are we renewing legislation to help better secure the homeland? Are we addressing out-of-control Federal spending? Are we acting to better secure our borders? We are approaching a $10 trillion national debt, a problem that threatens our Nation's economic future, but are we cutting spending or reforming the out-of-control earmark process? 
   Here is what Congress is doing, Mr. Speaker. Congress is spending its time and energy on H.R. 5781, a bill to give Federal bureaucrats, including deadbeat dads, a new handout, a vast expansion to the already generous benefits package they receive at the expense of  the American taxpayer, at the expense of every single American family. That is our priority? That is our answer to $4 gasoline, expanding benefits to Washington bureaucrats and deadbeat dads? 
   I ask you, Mr. Speaker, what will you tell the folks about back home? What will you tell the folks who are worried about the economy, worried about higher taxes on the horizon, worried about paying more than $4 a gallon for gasoline for the rest of the summer? Will you tell them not to worry, that their problems belong on the back burner? That the priority of their Member of Congress is to take their tax dollars and expand the benefits package of deadbeat dads in the Federal workplace? Will you tell them that these deadbeat dads, who already receive among the richest benefit packages in the Nation, are more deserving of relief than law-abiding families and taxpayers of your district who are paying $4 a gallon for gasoline? 
   Mr. Speaker, like most issues, the people get it. The American people know what the priorities of Congress should be. Millions of them have signed petitions and communicated to our offices that we need to focus on their priorities. They know our priorities should not be giving deadbeat dads a new taxpayer-funded benefit. They know we should adopt this motion to recommit and move on with the important business facing our Nation. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is another old line that I think is appropriate. ``Most politicians don't see the light; they feel the heat.'' With $4 gasoline, possibly headed for $5 this summer, can you handle the heat you will feel back home once your constituents find out that your priority is to lend a hand to deadbeat dads, or will you see the light and join me in supporting this motion to recommit? 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I thank him for his work with the Republican Study Committee. His leadership there is just so valuable. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just make a couple of points about this tax increase that has been talked about this last hour, this largest tax increase in the history of the United States of America, why it is such bad policy for our country. And I want to just focus, as I said, on two points. 
   First of all, I think it's important to recognize how the competition is stiffer today. And what I mean by that is this changing dynamic that we see in the world market. There was a point maybe in the past where elected officials, where politicians could afford to make poor decisions, poor policy decisions and because America's economy was so far ahead of the rest of the world, we could succeed in spite of the bad policies that were enacted. But the facts today are such that it is important we get it right and we not put additional burdens on families, on taxpayers, and on our economy if we are going to compete in this world market. 
   Just a couple of facts. Think about this: China has 1.4 billion people. The country of India has 800 million people. The United States of America, we just hit a population of 300 million last summer. So, again, two countries, over two million people that we are competing against. China's economy is growing at about 10 percent. India's is growing at about 7 1/2 percent. If we are going to compete against those emerging countries who are moving towards middle class, if we are going to compete, we have got to have the right kind of policies in place. Tax increases are not the right kind of policies on our families, on our business owners, on our American economy. It is important we recognize that. 
   I have related this story to the Chair of the Republican Study Committee before, but I think it captures just how important it is to understand the dynamic that we find ourselves in in this point in history. 
   We have a constituent who has been very successful in manufacturing. And he wanted to, a few years ago, sit down with our United States Senator and talk about this dynamic that is taking place in the world market. And so we helped put together a meeting, and he sat down with our United States Senator around the conference table. He took one of the pieces, the piece that they make in their manufacturing plants and he had taped to that piece, he had two pennies taped to it. And he slid that 
   piece across the table to our U.S. Senator and he said, Senator, those two pennies taped to that piece, those represent, those two pennies represent our labor costs in that piece. He said, competing with China. He said China and India aren't beating us on labor costs. What makes it tougher, he said, we are so efficient. Our systems, our processes are so good we feel like we can compete with anybody in the world. What makes it tough for us to compete is the stuff you politicians do, and he pointed right to our Senator. He said it is the tax increases, it is the regulation, it is the litigation, it is those sorts of things in our economy, in our policy that make it tough for us to compete. 
   We have got to recognize that when we are competing in this world market today, it is important we get it right, because, again the competition is so stiff. 
   And then of course the other reason that has been talked about very eloquently, I think, this evening, why it is bad policy to raise taxes. It is not just because it is bad for the economy. It is not just because we have all this focus when we are dealing with the budget where we talk about budgets and numbers and revenues and projections. It is bad because it is about people. It is about families. And when you think about what really makes our country strong, what has allowed the United States of America to be the most prosperous Nation in history, it is the fact that we have that key institution that has been so strong, that family institution. And really, I believe what makes America so great, it is this idea, and the chairman was just alluding to this, it is this idea that moms and dads are willing to sacrifice so that their kids can have life a little better than they did. And then that next generation, as they grow up, they do the same thing for their kids and their grandkids, and it continues. And it has been that cycle that has allowed America to prosper. 
   If we are going to take an additional $2,500 per family away from them, away from their checkbook, away from their pocketbook, away from their goals, their dreams, the things they want to spend it on, we are making it tougher for that American Dream to continue. We are making it tougher on the families, that key institution in our culture. And that is why this budget, this $392 billion tax increase is wrong for our country when we think about competing in the world market, and it is wrong for families who make this country so great in the first place. 
   And with that I would yield back to the chairman of the RSC and thank him for his work here this evening and for his continued work for families across this country.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the work of the chairman of the committee and the ranking member. The motion to recommit that we  have in front of us is an insurance policy. It will guarantee that no funds in the bill go to lobbyists or lobbying activities. This motion, in other words, is a step towards breaking that link between legislation and lobbyists. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3246, as we have heard from the language here on the floor today, is intended to aid the economic and infrastructure development in economically distressed regions of the country. Taxpayer dollars should be used for that purpose, and that purpose only. 
   The motion does two things: first, it prevents any of the funds authorized by this bill from being used to lobby or retain a lobbyist for the purposes of influencing a Federal, State or local government entity or officer. Second, the motion prohibits funds to pay for expenses related to the membership of an individual or entity in an organization or association. 
   Mr. Speaker, the majority promised in its opening-day rules package, section 202 of H. Res. 6, to end the K Street Project. This motion to recommit is policy that all Members should support. In fact, when this same language was offered to H.R. 569, the Water Quality Investment Act, it was approved by a 425-0 vote. That same act came out of this same committee, and the full House in unanimous fashion supported this same language. 
   Again, Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is an opportunity to improve the bill by adding explicit language to make sure that taxpayer dollars are used for their intended purpose. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the Chair and the Members who are present here. 
   This is the fourth time I've offered this amendment to an appropriations bill. I don't do it to be a pain in the neck. In fact, I appreciate the work of the chairman, I appreciate the work of the ranking member, and I appreciate the work of the committee and staff. I know they look at these line items, look at these programs, go through and do the hard work that all committees do. I appreciate all that work. I simply bring the amendment forward because I believe government is too big and that government spends too much. 
   This amendment doesn't cut spending. This amendment, like the previous ones I have offered, simply says we're going to hold the line. We're going to spend the same amount we spent in the last fiscal year. Nothing more than that. That's all the amendment does. It allows the committee who understands these programs, who does the work and puts this bill together, to go back and look and figure out where those cuts should happen using their expertise that they've developed in this committee to do that. It simply says, it's not too much to ask government to do what millions of families have to do across this country, live on last year's spending levels, live on last year's budget. 
   It is important we do this, in my judgment, for two reasons. Again I have articulated these each time I've brought this amendment forward for the body to consider. The first is there are financial problems, financial concerns, some would even say crisis looming for America if we don't get a handle on the spending. $3 trillion budget. This bill increases spending by over a billion dollars in this one area. The more we run up deficits, the more that leads to debt, the more that leads to less saving, the more that leads to less economic growth, the tougher it makes it in the future to deal with the economic crisis that is in fact coming. 
   Again, you don't have to take my word for it. All kinds of experts have talked about this, whether it's entitlement programs, discretionary spending, it's government spending and there are problems looming if we don't begin to get a handle on the spending levels that we appropriate. There is no better place to start than right now, saying, let's just do what we did last year. Let's just hold the line on spending. 
   The second reason that this is so important: whenever you start to spend and spend and spend and have these kinds of things take place, it inevitably leads to greater taxes. I've often heard the phrase tax-and-spend politicians. It's actually more appropriate to say spend and tax. Spending drives the equation. The more you spend, that leads to taxes in the future. If you went out and asked the American people, Mr. Chairman, is government too big or too small, my guess is the vast majority of Americans would say it's too big. 
   Think about this: government spends on average $23,000 per household. We've got a $3 trillion annual budget that we spend on. Many of those things are appropriate, but overall if you ask the American people is government too big or too small, they would say it's too big. If you asked them the same question, are Americans overtaxed or undertaxed, my guess is the vast majority of Americans would say we're overtaxed. In fact, a typical family, 50 cents of every dollar they spend goes to some level of government in the form of taxes. It's not too much to ask government to hold the line on spending, to live on what we did last year, to live on the same amount.     
   That's what this amendment does. I bring it forward, not to be a pain to the committee, I appreciate their work, but simply to point out it's time we get a handle on spending if we are going to be able to let or help America have the economic growth that we need to see happen in this country in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Washington State is recognized for up to 20 minutes.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, before recognizing the gentlelady from Tennessee, I would just point out this, we always hear this, devastating cut. This not a cut. This is simply saying we are going to spend what we spent last year. 
   In fact, last week we had this big debate on the legislative branch bill and on other appropriations bills, and the majority party was pointing to the President's request. What we spent last year is actually more than what the President requested in this budget. 
   Devastating cut, I mean, we always hear, it's interesting, politicians who spend the tax dollars of families and individual taxpayers across this country, always say the sky is going to fall if we can't get more of your money and spend it on things we think are important. 
   All we're saying is you know what, it's not too much to ask that government do what families do all the time, and that is spend on last year's level. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlelady from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I just want to know which is it? We just heard from the distinguished chairman from Washington that Republicans spent too much; so we are going to spend more. We heard about  the spending by the Republicans. And we just heard from the other gentleman that we cut, cut, cut. I want to know which is it? 
   All I know is this, what is in the bill, and in the bill it says this: The Commission on Climate Change, $50 million of taxpayer money for this new Commission. National Park Service, a $199 million increase, 10.8 percent above last year. The National Endowment for the Arts, a 29 percent increase. We heard a debate about this yesterday, an agency that many Americans find offensive using their tax dollars: $160 million, a 29 percent increase. National Endowment for the Humanities, $19 million, an increase of 13 percent. 
   Which is it? Did we cut all the time or did we spend too much? I want to know which it is. 
   What I do know is that in the bill, there are all kinds of excessive spending. That is why we just want to say hold the line, let's keep it where it is right now. 
   And I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN (Mr. McGovern). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlelady for yielding me this time, and for bringing this fine amendment forward and for her work on fiscal responsibility in her time here in the United States Congress. 
   I want to make a couple of quick points here. First, the list that the chairman just went through, he kept using the term ``cut.'' Let's be clear to the American people in particular that the gentlelady's amendment is not a cut, it is an increase of 4 percent. What the gentleman was referring to was the spending levels at 4.5 percent which the bill contains within it. All she is saying is let's increase 4 percent instead of 4.5 percent. Again, only in government-speak, only in Washington can that be termed a cut. She is not cutting at all. She is just saying let's not increase it quite as much. 
   A couple of other things we have heard in the course of the debate this afternoon which I think has been healthy. The chairman indicated that he wants to move on, we need to limit debate and get out of here. Look, 40 minutes on three amendments, 2 hours total on debate, on the most fundamental question, the most fundamental issue the United States Congress deals with: How we spend the taxpayers' money. So 2 hours debate on what level that should be is not too much debate. Frankly, we should have more on this fundamental question. 
   The other point that the majority party makes is, and again, I find this logic fascinating. Republicans spent too much, so we are going to spend even more. It is amazing that is the logic that the other size entails and brings forward in each of these appropriations bills. 
   Talking about the spending contained within this bill, let me just cite a couple of things. 
   The Commission on Climate Change, a brand new commission, $50 million on the Commission on Climate Change, adaptation and mitigation, a new, additional study on global warming, as if we haven't had enough studies on that already. So $50 million on that. 
   The National Park Service, $199 million increase, 10.8 percent above last year. 
   National Endowment for the Humanities, $19 million increase, 13 percent above last year. 
   Environmental Protection Agency, the Agency that the gentleman said that if it didn't get the right amount of funding, people would lose sleep over, $361 million, or a 4.7 percent increase above last year. 
   And of course, my favorite, and I am sure the favorite of the American taxpayer, National Endowment for the Arts, a $35 million increase, 29 percent above last year. 
   There is all kinds of additional government contained in this legislation. I am reminded of the old statement by our third President, Thomas Jefferson. He said: ``When government fears the people, there is liberty. When people fear the government, there is tyranny.'' Now keep that statement in mind and ask yourself the question: If next week when we are back home on break and you are at some friend's business and someone walks up to the  door and knocks on the door and the individual identifies himself, I'm Mr. Smith and I am from the EPA, the Agency that gets a 4.7-percent increase in this bill. If you are that individual who owns that business, is your first response, oh, joy, one of my government's servants is about here to help me today. 
   That is what this debate is about, and 2 hours debate on the most fundamental question that the United States Congress deals with, how we spend taxpayer dollars, is not too much debate. 
   We should debate this long and hard and we should support the amendment of the gentlewoman from Colorado. It simply slows down the rate of government growth, slows down that government that Jefferson warned us about in his statement. I certainly support the gentlelady's amendment, and thank her for bringing it forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, we have offered this amendment for the eighth time. 
   Let me just help set a framework before I talk specifically about the amendment. Today we have approximately a $200 billion annual budget deficit. We have an $8 trillion national debt. We have a budget that we have been debating over the last several weeks and will complete the spending process of that next week, but we have a budget of $3 trillion annual budget. 
   We have an entitlement spending crisis looming, when we think about what's going to happen in the next 10 to 15 years relative to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. We have got a crisis that we have to begin to deal with. 
   Today, today the Federal Government spends approximately $23,000 per household. Now, with that as a frame work, I think it's fair to ask, is government too big or too small? If you ask that question of the average American family, my guess is when they think about those facts, $200 billion deficit, $3 trillion annual budget, $8 trillion national debt and an entitlement crisis that is looming, and a Federal Government that spends $23,000 per American household, if you asked the average American family if government is too big, my guess is they would probably say yes. 
   All this amendment does is begin to take that first step, that modest first step into getting our spending under control. 
   It says this: instead of in this appropriation bill, instead of spending $53.5 billion, let's just spend $52 billion, which happens to be the amount that we spent last year. So it's not a cut, as our friends on the other side will most assuredly say when it's their turn to speak. It's not a cut; it's simply level funding, holding the line on spending. It's a 3 percent reduction from what's in the bill, simply going to spend what we did last year. 
   That's not too much to ask when you think about the context we find ourselves in today in the United States of America. Here is why it's important, and I have said this every single time. 
   Again, every time I bring this amendment, I always articulate to the Chair of the subcommittee and the ranking member and the Chair and ranking member of the full committee that, you know, I don't do this to be a pain. 
   I really believe we have to begin to focus on reducing spending. I appreciate the work that the Appropriations Committee does. I appreciate the work of the subcommittee. But if we don't begin to get a handle on spending, we are going to have problems economically in the future. 
   The way it works is spending inevitably leads to more taxes. The American family is already overtaxed. That's why it's important. We start to get a handle on spending, so we can reduce the tax burden that the families across this country face. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of our time.

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, just a couple of things. I want to pick up on what the gentleman from Texas was talking about, families, and a lady from a family from our district, Theresa from West Liberty, Ohio, a small town in Ohio, said, when talking about spending, talking about taxes, talking about the growth of government, talking about the fact we've got an $8 trillion national debt, a $3 trillion budget, the government spends $23,000 per household, and all we're asking for in this legislation, all we've been asking for in each of these amendments, is to fund government at the same level we did last year, which all kinds of families have to do just like this family in West Liberty, Ohio. 
   ``We're in the middle class, and we're the ones the tax hikes hit the hardest. We're trying to put our kids through college. Can't government live within their means?'' 
   I mean, pretty straightforward. It's amazing how the American people get it. If you ask the American people in this framework, all this spending, all this debt, all this deficit, is it too much to ask to say, you know what, Government, just spend what you did before. And the playbook from the other side never changes. As the gentleman from Texas articulated, we want to spend what we spent last year in this appropriations bill. Not a cut. We want to spend what we did last year. Yet the other side will say, if we do that, the sky's going to fall, the world's going to end, everything will be terrible. Oh my goodness, we won't have cops on the street. 
   That's just baloney. We want to spend exactly what we spent last year, because if we don't, the ramifications, the consequences for future generations, as the gentleman from Texas pointed out, are huge. And it starts with the entitlement programs that everybody knows, Republicans and Democrats know, everybody knows those are going to be problems in the future. 
   That's all this amendment does. It's not Draconian cuts. It's not devastating. It's not the end of the world. It's not the sky is falling. It's saying, you know what, instead of spending $53.5 billion, which is what this legislation wants to do, let's spend $52 billion, exactly what we spent last year. 
   Mr. Chairman, that doesn't seem to be too much to ask when we're thinking about the context we find ourselves in, and, frankly, when we're thinking about the competition we face today in the international marketplace. 
   As the gentleman from Texas pointed out, our Comptroller has pointed out the problems we face. It's critical that we begin to get a handle on that. That's why we bring the amendment forward, that's why it makes common sense, and that's why I urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

Again, I don't think it's too much to ask for government to do the same, particularly when you look at the facts and the financial situation that we're facing. 
   With that, I yield back the remainder of our time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, one of the previous speakers from the majority party talked about how this legislation in front of us has reduced the number of earmarks. I believe his quote was there are 41 programs that have been eliminated from last year's appropriation bill. Nevertheless, this bill increases spending $10.8 billion more than the President requested, 7.7 percent more than the President requested. It is $7 billion, or a 4.6 percent, increase over last year's appropriation. 
   So my amendment is real straightforward. It says we are not going to go back to the President, we are not going to cut it, using the term ``cut'' to the President's requested level, we are going to go back to last year's funding level, a level funding amendment, a hold-the-line amendment, whatever you want to call it. It is certainly not a cut, although that has typically been the argument made by the other side of the aisle. 
   This is the sixth amendment I have offered in the appropriations process. Each one has been the same, to hold the line on spending. I don't do it to be a pain in the rear to the committee or to the ranking member. I appreciate the work of the committee and our ranking member and those involved on this committee in bringing this bill forward. 
   I do it because we have a spending problem. We have a spending problem in this Congress and in this government, and there is going to come a day  when we are going to have to deal with it. There is no better time to start than now, and no better place to start than to say let's just hold the line because here is what happens every single time government continues to spend and spend and spend. It inevitably leads to higher taxes, higher taxes that hurt our economy, higher taxes that hurt our standing in the international marketplace. But most importantly, higher taxes that hurt families out there trying to do the things for their kids and their grandkids so they can experience the American dream. 
   If you don't believe me that spending is going to lead to higher taxes, all you have to do is look at yesterday's Roll Call where there is a story. In fact, we just had the distinguished chairman from the Ways and Means Committee down here defending an earmark in his district, but he is talked about and the article talks about the tobacco tax that they are looking to put on the American people to fund increased spending. 
   The old line, it's tax and spend, tax and spend politicians; it's actually the opposite, it's spend and tax, spend and tax. Spending drives the equation, and that is why we need to begin to get a handle on spending. That's what this amendment does. 
   In the course of offering these amendments over the last several weeks, we have consistently heard two arguments from the majority party. The first is the old devastating cut argument, that somehow if we just spend what we spent last year, that will somehow be terrible and the sky will fall and the world will end and everything will go to chaos. I find that hard to believe in light of the fact that countless number of American families have to do that all the time, live on last year's budget. But somehow, government never seems to be able to do that. 
   The other line that we have heard, and I find this one somewhat amazing, but the line is how dare Republicans talk about holding the line on spending because you increased spending over the last several years as well. I am fascinated by that argument because the argument, when you boil it down, is this: Because Republicans spent too much, we are going to spend more. 
   So I fail to see the logic in those two arguments. What I do understand is this, Mr. Chairman. Government spends too much. Families know how to budget. We should be able to do the same thing. Families don't just get an automatic 4.6 percent increase in their budget. We should look to hold the line on spending. That is what this amendment does. It will help set us on the path of fiscal discipline so we can begin to deal with the big problems that I referenced earlier that are going to be out there with entitlement spending, and begin to get a handle on our budget so that our economy can continue to grow and prosper. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, before yielding to my friend and gentleman from Arizona, let me just respond to one thing real quickly. 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee talked earlier about all the new spending, and the other side has a definition for success for them is more spending. Our side actually believes the definition of success should be success. 
   And I always look at education. I came from the general assembly in Ohio, and one of the things you focus on so much in the general assembly budget process is primary and secondary education. And if you look at what's happened, and this is for every State, but I can just give you the numbers on Ohio. 
   We have 612 public schools in Ohio. In 1977 we had 2 million K-12 kids. Today we have 1.8 million. So we've had 200,000 less kids in K-12 public school, 612 districts in our State. Over that 30 years, 200,000 less kids. Dollars spent per pupil, dollars spent per aggregate, dollars spent for facilities, dollars spent any way you want to define dollars spent adjusted for inflation is a tremendous increase. 
   So you have got 200,000 less kids. So you've got the graph going this way. The economists have always got these graphs. Graph coming down on number of students, graph going up adjusted for inflation, and what are the results? It's a straight line. So you spent a boatload more money on 200,000 less kids to get the exact same result. So more money may mean more learning in some places, but to make the blanket statement more money means more education, more money means more learning is simply not true, and the facts are on our side. 
   So we define success as actually being success, not giving more money and hoping that good things are going to happen, and if they don't, you know what we're going to do, give them more money next time. We don't define it that way. We say if kids are really learning, that should be success, not the fact that we've given them more money. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).

   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Yes, sometimes facts are a strange thing. The Federal Government does not have a revenue problem. 
   Revenues increased by 14.5 percent in 2005, 11.6 percent in 2006, and are projected to grow an additional $167 billion, or 7 percent this year, because we let the American family keep more of their money, spend it on the things they want to spend it, instead of saying to them, you know what, we are going to increase spending 4.6 percent in this bill and $20 some billion in this appropriation process that we have done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding some time and for his work in putting this together and his passion and intensity and energy that he brings to the Congress and what he has done in our freshman class. I appreciate the remarks of the previous speaker. He talked about Tax Day, and he is right on target when you think about the amount of money government takes. 
   And I just want to start with a question. And there is probably a few people watching, probably mostly in the gentleman from California's district. Most people in Ohio are smart enough to get in bed at this hour. But there are a few people watching out there. And I just want to ask those Americans who are watching, do you think government has enough of your money already, or do you think they need more? And my guess is the vast majority of people in California who are watching, or in Ohio who are sleeping, understand that the government, the billions and billions and the trillions and trillions that the government takes in already is probably enough. 
   And the gentleman from Michigan was great in outlining what is at stake and what the Democrats want to do, because the Democrats obviously think different. The American people think, you know what, the government probably takes enough of my money. But based on what took place 2 weeks ago with the budget that was passed by the majority party, over the next 3 years the spending they want to do is going to take more and more money out of the private sector, where good things happen in our economy, where jobs are created, where prosperity takes place, more and more money out of the private sector and more money from the families across this great country, in Ohio, in the Fourth District, and across the Nation as whole. 
   So I just want to provide some perspective and context and framework for why that is a bad thing. And I think we just start with this basic premise: the stakes are high today. It is important that the elected officials, the politicians here in Congress, get it right for a change. There was a point in the past where, in spite of bad policies that the politicians may have enacted, America, because we were so uniquely positioned coming out of World War II, we were the economic superpower. We were the economy that was growing. It didn't really matter if bad public policy was put in place. We were going to excel. We were going to prosper in this world market in spite of the things that the politicians might have done. 
   But today the stakes are high and the competition is stiffer. And I just want to give some facts and figures and I will yield back to the gentleman from California. But recognize the framework we are in. Today, China has 1.4 billion people. India has close to 800 million people. Those two countries, over two billion people. United States of America, we just hit 300 million population last summer. Those two economies, China and India, over two billion people combined in those two countries, China's economy is growing at approximately 10 percent annual growth rate. India is growing at about 7, 7 1/2 percent annual growth rate, quickly moving towards middle class. The competition is stiffer. And it is important today when you think about those numbers, those facts, those figures, that we in elective office do the policies right. 
   Raising taxes on business owners, raising taxes on families, $400 billion, as the gentleman from California pointed out, doing those things makes it tougher for our families, our small business owners, our economy to compete in that world market. And that is why it is important we not go along with these tax increases. That is why it is important we try to keep those tax cuts that are in place, so that family and businesses can prosper. It is that fundamental. The gentleman from Michigan was exactly right. And he ticked off, he read off the tax increases that will happen under the Democrats budget plan. And it is important we not go there. 
   I always come back to, you know, the very first thing we did in this Congress, the majority party, the Democratic Party enacted some PAYGO rules, which sound great. But what those PAYGO rules did was make it easier to raise taxes. 
   The last thing this Congress did before we went home for Easter break to see our constituents and visit our districts, the last thing we did before we went home for the Easter break was raise taxes. So they started off the Congress by making it easier to raise taxes. The last thing we did before we went home for break was raise taxes. And so that should tell you what is at stake here and why it is important that we fight for the American families, like the gentleman from California has been doing, and it has been a pleasure to serve along with him in that regard. And I will yield back some time and we can discuss some of this maybe as we move along.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (A QUARTERLY REPORT CARD -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, again, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And you talked about a $400 billion tax increase. I just come to the question, how many Americans think that government can spend money better than the private sector? How many Americans think that the government can spend money better than the small business owners in our communities? How many Americans think that government can spend that money better than the families that live in our districts and make this country great? That is the fundamental question. 
   And the gentleman from Nebraska was right on target when he talked about families. So often we get so focused on the numbers, the budgets, capital gains, dividends, tax rates, tax brackets, all this fancy political speak, and we forget in the end it is about people. It is about moms and dads having more money in their pockets to spend on piano lessons for Sally, soccer lessons for Johnny. 
   Saving for college is a huge thing. And I have got one in college, and I am paying them right now, writing those checks. That is what it is about. In the end, it is about families. 
   Jefferson had a great line. When you think about the size and scope of government, how big this government is going to grow under this proposal, Jefferson said, ``When the people fear the government, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, there is liberty.'' 
   Just ask yourself this question, as government begins to grow: If tomorrow you are at home and you get a knock at your door and you answer the door and the gentleman identifies himself and says, ``I am from the IRS,'' is your first response, ``Oh, joy, one of my public servants is here to help me today''? Of course it is not. 
   We have to understand that. If we want families to have the liberty and freedom they need to do what is best for their kids and their grandkids, we need to let them keep more of their money. And that is what our struggle is when we go forward, to try to make sure we can allow families to keep more of their money. 
   I know that is why I came to Congress and I know that is why the gentleman from California came to Congress and the gentleman from Michigan and the gentleman from Nebraska as well. So that is what we need to do, and that is what we are going to continue to do as we move forward.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (BUDGET SCHOOL -- (House of Representatives - April 02, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentlelady for yielding and for her leadership on this special order hour and her leadership in Congress and her work with the RSC along with our chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government spends a lot of money. The American people understand that instinctively. In fact, let me give some context to it. 
   The United States' economy is a $14 trillion annual economy. The second largest economy in the world is Japan, approximately $4 trillion annual economy. The third largest economy, if you define it this way, would be the Federal Government. So 1 year of spending by the Federal Government would be the third largest economy in the world. $3 trillion, the largest budget in history, is what passed on this floor 4 weeks ago. 
   Again, to provide a little context to that. $3 trillion budget. That's the Federal Government spending your tax dollars, the American families' taxpayer money for families in Ohio and across this country spending at $100,000 a second, $6 million a minute, $350 million an hour. I mean, even by politicians' standards, that is spending money like crazy.  
   The Federal Government spends, again, just to provide some context, and I appreciate the work that everyone has done and what the previous figures have said. The Federal Government spends $25,000 per year per family. Instead of spending $25,000 per family, if we would just spend $20,000 we could balance the budget in 1 year. Just spending $20,000 per family, we could do it. 
   The previous speakers have talked about the tax burden that was also contained in this budget, $600 billion in taxes. You always hear about tax-and-spend politicians. I actually argue that it's just the opposite. In fact, the gentleman from Tennessee just talked about this. It's spending tax. Spending always drives the equation. 
   So to make sure that this $3 trillion could be spent, this budget contains the largest tax increase in the history of our country. At a time when families are already dealing with tough economic situations in their family and in their communities, the last thing we need is higher taxes. 
   You can compound all of this situation by what we heard last week. And I just want to read from the trustees' report, the 2008 Social Security and Medicare trustees' report, because I think it's poignant to this, a discussion about where we are at this point in our Nation's history. The trustees said, We are increasingly concerned about the inaction on the financial challenges facing the Social Security and Medicare programs. The longer action is delayed, the greater will be the required adjustments, the larger the burden on future generations, and the more severe the detrimental economic impact on our Nation. 
   The longer we wait to do anything, the tougher it is going to be to address it and fix the problem. 
   In fact, outgoing Comptroller General David Walker has said this: We run the risk, for the first time in American history, turning over a worse financial picture to the next generation. It's never happened before in the history of the United States. 
   One of the reasons we are the greatest countries in history is because parents make sacrifices for their children so they can have a better economic situation, a 
   better life, a better standard of living than what we have. We run the risk of beginning to turn that. We have got to begin to address that. 
   I just want to bring up two simple concepts that were proposed in the Budget Committee by Members of the Republican party and the RSC. We offered two simple ideas. One was, it's time for a second Grace Commission. If you remember, President Reagan put together the Grace Commission. He had outside business people come in and look at the Federal Government, look at the government, say, Where is the waste? Where is the fraud? Where is the redundancy? Where is the ridiculousness? Let's get rid of it and save taxpayer money and better spend taxpayer money. 
   Back in the 1980s, they identified $400 billion in waste, fraud, and redundancy. Certainly we can find some savings by doing that. The Grace Commission, unfortunately, was defeated in committee. 
   We also offered an amendment that said let's hold the line on spending. Outside of the military, let's just hold the line, and let's keep the baseline lower, which saves us a lot of money in the outyears. And we made the argument in committee that this won't solve the problem, but this will better position our Congress, better position our government to deal with what we know is coming, to deal with what the trustees reported last week is coming relative to Social Security and Medicare. Two simple ideas that we couldn't even get passed in committee because the majority party wouldn't go for it. Things that we need to do to long-term begin to address the situation. 
   As the previous speaker said, and I will close with this and turn it back over, he's confident that we will get this right. I am, too. Not because the politicians in Washington get it but because the American people do. The old adage is often true: Most politicians don't see the light; they feel the heat. And they feel the heat from their constituents because their constituents have the common sense of the folks, like in East Tennessee and back in western Ohio as well, and they understand the situation is real, they understand it's time for politicians and elected officials to step forward and say, Enough is enough. Let's fix this because it's about our kids and about our grandkids. 
   That's why I applaud the leadership of the gentlewoman from Tennessee.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his amazing service to our country. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. There have been many good arguments made as to why this resolution is not in the best interest of our military, not in the best interest of our country. But I want to focus on one point, and that is just how real and how serious the threat of terrorism is, because that is what this struggle in Iraq is really about. And I am just going to read the list of terrorist attacks against Americans, and we have heard this list before, but I think it is important to refocus on this: 
   In 1979, 66 American hostages were taken in Iran. In 1983, 241 Marines were killed in Beirut. In 1988, 189 Americans were killed in the PanAm bombing. In 1993 in the first World Trade Center bombing, we lost six Americans. In 1996, 19 servicemembers were killed in the Khobar Towers bombing. In 2000, 17 American sailors lost their lives in the USS Cole. And, of course, in 2001, that date we all remember, 9/11, 2,973 Americans lost their lives in the World Trade Center bombing, in the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania. 
   When you think about the actions of these terrorists and how real and dangerous they are, I am reminded of last summer when the Pope made a statement in a speech about the radical element, small but radical element, within the Islamic faith and the violence associated with that element. And the reaction to the Pope's statement about violence among this radical, but small, element, the reaction to his statement about violence was violence. It was the destruction of churches, the destruction of buildings. It was the taking of a life of an innocent nun in Italy. That is what we are up against. 
   This Democratic resolution puts us on a path towards leaving Iraq before victory is attained. It puts us on a path that will cut funds to our brave men and women already in battle. It puts us on a path that is wrong for America. And, most importantly, I think, it puts us on the wrong path that will most assuredly embolden the very people who are responsible for the terrorist acts I just listed. 
   If you remember, shortly after 9/11 the President gave a series of speeches where he outlined a policy. He said if you are a country that harbors terrorists, if you are a country that provides financing to terrorists, if you are a country that trains terrorists, if you are a country that is producing weapons that are going to harm vast numbers of people, if you are doing those things, we are going to put you on notice that we are not going to tolerate it. 
   And if you remember, it was amazing how quickly Moammar Kadafi in Libya found the Lord and saw the light and how quickly he was willing to say, I am going to work now with the United States. He understood that when America says something, we mean it. If we just do what this Democratic resolutions puts us on the path to do, I am afraid of the message it sends to the Kadafis around the world and what that can mean for the future safety of Americans and for our military. 
   This is a great country. We have been able to overcome whatever challenges have presented themselves to us throughout our history. And it is important that we have the same resolve as we approach this challenge. 
   I am just a freshman Member of the Congress; and just a few weeks ago it was put on display about what is so great about America, as we said, in this Chamber during the State of the Union address. And during that speech, the President pointed up to the gallery, and he highlighted some great Americans, some American heroes. And the one that stuck out in my mind, and many of you may remember this, was Wesley Autrey, the subway man. And I thought it was so amazing to see what this man had done and how that contrasts with the actions of the terrorists. Wesley Autrey in the subway, willing to jump in front of a train on the track to save a complete stranger simply because he was a fellow human being. Contrast that action with the action of the terrorist who will jump into that same subway, blow himself up to kill as many innocent people as he can. 
   What is great about this country is the respect we place on human life, the preciousness and sacredness that Americans have for human life. That is the difference between us and the terrorists. That is why it is so important to confront these folks wherever they choose to fight us. Right now that place is Iraq. That is why this resolution is bad. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we should not pass a resolution in which politicians second guess our military leaders in the field. We should not pass a resolution that will embolden our enemy. And, most importantly, we should not waver in our commitment to protect human life and to confront the evil that is among us. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on the resolution

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for his compassion and his commitment to protecting all life, defending those defenseless and his tireless work, and my colleagues as well, who understand that all life is sacred. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, as other speakers have done, I want to thank those thousands of families, thousands of young people, thousands of Americans who gathered today in our Nation's Capital. They too understand that life is precious, life is special, life is sacred and it should be protected in all forms. 
   I really want to thank them for two things, and I said this today at the rally. First, I want to thank them for having the willingness to engage in the struggle. I learned a long time ago that nothing of meaning, nothing of significance happens by hanging out on the sidelines. You have got to be willing to get in the game step, you have got to be willing to get out of the shadows, step in the game if you are going to make a difference. 
   That is what Americans were doing today here in our Nation's Capital. I also want to thank them for something else. One of the things that all of us as Members of Congress deal with are those interest groups, those lobbyists who want to come talk to us about all kinds of issues. 
   I say this every chance I get to talk about the life issue. We have all kinds of lobbyists who want to come talk to us, then to talk to us and influence the way things work here in Congress, the way legislation is passed. The reason they want to talk to us is they and their clients have a financial interest at stake. 
   But the people who came to our Nation's Capital today, they had nothing to gain financially for doing what they did today. They simply did it because it was the right thing to do. They understand that the truth is the truth, and that life should be protected. I reassured them today. I think we are going to win. 
   It may take some time, but America always gets it right. Sometimes it takes us a while, but we get it right. We are making progress. We wish it would happen quicker. It has been 35 years now in this struggle. We wish it would happen quicker, but we are getting closer. Someday in this great country, the greatest Nation in history, we will get it right and every single human life will be protected. 
   I said to many of the folks that I had an opportunity to speak with today, you know, stay positive, because in America things do work out and the truth does prevail in the end. 
   I told them the story from scripture, and I will finish with this before I yield back to my old friend. The old story from scripture is so appropriate, I think, in that we should stay positive. The story goes, when the Israelites were camped against the Philistines, and every day the Philistine giant would walk out and issue the challenge, Who will fight Goliath? The Israelites' response was, He is so big we can never defeat him. 
   But David's response was, He is so big I can't miss. That is the attitude we saw on display today in our Nation's Capital. That's the attitude that has always been a part of the American experience. That is the attitude we need as we go forward. We will win this effort and all life will be protected in this country because you have great people like Mr. Franks from Arizona. I appreciate his time tonight in scheduling this hour for us.

<DOCNO>Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and the Congressman from Michigan for their work on this amendment and their longstanding commitment to protecting human life. 
   This is about two fundamental issues that have been talked about here on the floor. First, taxpayer dollars shouldn't go to organizations, whether those dollars are cash or in-kind, shouldn't go to organizations that perform or promote the taking of innocent human life. Second, it recognizes the more fundamental principle, life is precious, life is sacred, and government's fundamental responsibility is to protect the weak from the strong, to protect those innocent individuals whose lives are being taken. 
   This is good public policy. We should keep it in place. It's consistent, frankly, with our heritage and with our history. I always like to remind folks of what the founders said when they talked about that fundamental document that started this great experience we call America: Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   It's interesting to note the order the founders placed the rights they chose to mention. Can you pursue happiness, your goals and dreams, if you first don't have liberty? And do you ever have true liberty, true freedom, if government does not protect your most fundamental right, your right to live? 
   This amendment is consistent with the founders' vision, it's good policy, and we should adopt it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. JORDAN of Ohio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, Members of the House, I don't pretend to know exactly how the billions of dollars in the Foreign Operations bill should be exactly split up and allocated, that's the work of the committee. And I appreciate the work of the Chair, the ranking member and those Members of the Congress who are part of that important committee. 
   What I do understand is this: Government spends too much money. In fact, if you would talk to the American people, go out and poll the American people, talk to the families across this country and ask the simple question, does government spend too little or does government spend too much, is government too small or is government too big, does government take too much of your money in taxes, my guess is the vast majority of Americans across this country would say government is too big, takes way too much of my money and spends way too much. 
   This amendment simply says this: We're not going to cut anything. We're just going to say it's appropriate for government to live on last year's level, just like all kinds of individuals, all kinds of families, all kinds of businesses across this country have to do. 
   Specifically it would do this: It would reduce the total appropriations in the bill by $2.9 billion, taking it right back, keeping it right where it is at last year's spending level, while providing discretion for the administration to avoid any reductions in funding for the State of Israel. In simple terms it says this: We understand that special bond that the United States has with the State of Israel, and we're going to protect that; but we also understand government spends too much money, and it's appropriate that we say enough is enough, we have to hold the line on spending. 
   And here's why it's critical: There is a financial crisis around the corner waiting for the United States, the people of this great country. Read Pete Peterson's book, ``Running on Empty,'' talking about the entitlement problems, what's happening with us, if we don't get spending under control, what it's going to mean to our economy in the future. 
   Read today's Washington Post, front page of the business section, the entitlement column has pictures of the six leading Presidential candidates, three from each party. It says, ``Stumping for Attention to Deficit Disorder.'' It talks about this very problem. 
   There is a financial crisis around the corner that we have to deal with. It's important we start now by simply saying let's hold the line. 
   Second big thing why this is so important. Spending inevitably leads to tax increases. Spend, spend, spend leads to tax, tax, tax. The American people are overtaxed, we don't want to tax them anymore. In fact, we need to lower taxes so we can compete in the international marketplace we're in right now. 
   We've got to deal with the financial situation that confronts us. We've got to hold taxes down. That's why it's important for us to start here and simply say we're going to hold the line on spending. Millions of families, millions of individuals, millions of businesses across this country are doing that very thing. It's not too much to ask the United States Congress to do the same thing. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
