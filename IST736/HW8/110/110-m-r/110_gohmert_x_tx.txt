<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it seems what we're experiencing here and have been for the last 6 months is just the eternal optimism. I love that in the Democratic majority. But it's like the fellow that fell off the tall building and at each floor was heard to say, ``I'm doing okay so far.'' The trouble is, you're going to have the day of reckoning. And here we had the 6-month extension back August 4. Now, we've heard the majority leader come in and say, Well, it was basically, in so many words, it was the White House's fault because they could have given us this information about the immunity of the companies, and that's what's held this up. But if you go back to August 4 and the vote that did not have the immunity in it, there were 41 Democrats that voted for it and 181 Democrats that voted against it and 9 didn't vote. It was the Republicans that passed this. It didn't have anything to do with immunity. It had to do with one group wanted to make sure our intelligence protected us and had the tools they need, and the other was more concerned about the rights of terrorists. 
   Now, I would submit to you that this isn't about 6 months. It's not about 15 days. We could put it off 30 days, another 6 months, but the day of reckoning is coming. And our enemies that want to destroy our way of life, they don't think in terms of 15 days, 30 days. They think in terms of generations, and they've got to be defeated. 
   So I understand and I appreciate my dear friend, Mr. Kucinich, and the concerns about civil liberties. I'm concerned about them, too. But when it involves, as this act does, a foreign terrorist on foreign soil, and I know the concern is, Well, what if they call an American citizen? And I'll leave you with this: I would submit to you, if your friends are getting calls from foreign terrorists on foreign soil, again, tell them to tell the terrorists not to call them at home and they'll be okay. 
   We need to pass this. We need to give our intelligence the tools they need.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the work of Chairman Peterson, and I've had numerous conversations with my friend Bart Stupak, and I know that a lot of work has been done on this bill, a lot of efforts have been made because of our concern over unfair and inappropriate speculation. And it is a problem, and it has I think been a contributor to some of the rising prices. 
   One of the concerns some of us had is what about airlines, like Southwest Airlines, who have been able to hedge against inflation by getting these commodities contracts. And we were advised the Air Transport Association, which Southwest is a member--I don't know for sure that they support--but the Air Transport Association has come out in support of the bill and thinks it will help but it doesn't feel like it goes far enough. 
   This is something I'm going to vote for, and I appreciate all the hard work by Chairman Peterson and my friend BART STUPAK, but we still come back to the biggest problem on prices being that there has been a tremendous increase in demand, especially through India and China, and we have not had a commensurate increase in the supply. 
   Supply-and-demand forces are at work. No matter what we do here in Congress, we're not going to decrease the forces of supply and demand on the market. That's what we need to be doing. We need to drill here, drill OCS, drill ANWR, and you know, some people keep saying 10 or 15 years before they'd come on line. The information that I heard was that since there's a pipeline 74 miles from the area of 1002 in ANWR, we could have that coming into the country, to this part of the country, the continental, within 3 years, that we could be bringing in OCS gas and oil in a similar amount of time. That's where we need to go. 
   I appreciate the work here, and I'm glad you're doing it and I will vote for it. But we need to increase the supply if we're going to help America. That's where the help is required.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, back on January 22, I got up here at this very spot because we had passed a bill that week that was going to force the price of gasoline to skyrocket upward. A year later it's up a dollar. Today we passed another anti-energy bill. 
   You know, there are a number of States in this country who just say we want to use all the energy but we don't want to produce any. So there are States like Texas, Louisiana, a number of States, we're cranking out all the energy we can to help the Nation. This bill we passed today not only says we have got lots of energy we're not going to let anybody produce, but we are going to penalize the States that have been more than team players and we are going to force the price of gasoline higher and higher. 
   So I hope my colleagues across the aisle, as gas goes up towards $5, will also come to the floor and say, ``That's right, it's $5 a gallon, and we are proud of it. We did that for you; so you can thank us.''

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Chairman, we have heard people on the floor today say basically that eliminating the secret ballot will not affect the ordinary worker's rights. 
   Madam Chairman, some of us grew up in schools that were public schools, being taught by teachers who were members of the Democratic Party. I loved those teachers and they were very honest people, and they said and they taught and they drilled into us the secret ballot was one of the most important developments in democracy. It separated the United States from other totalitarian and dictatorial governments. 
   Now I have people coming here on the floor that I don't know as well as my beloved teachers saying those teachers were mistaken or lying, they don't know what they are talking about. And what I am getting to believe is, this isn't up for the ordinary workers, this is playing to the officers of hard-working American union members. 
   I would submit when we have people say in letters and on the record that the secret ballot is important to avoid intimidation, when they would come to my courtroom they used to ask, are you lying then or are you lying now. I won't ask.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank our subcommittee chairman, and I thank our full committee chairman and subcommittee ranking member as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. As it has been said, there exists in America an open sore that is yet to be remedied. I note that sometimes people see an amount of money that is being spent and say that is too much money. But in this case, there is an injustice that cries out for healing and for addressing. 
   When one American, regardless of race, creed, color, gender, religion, national origin, when one is struck down, then all of us are struck down. We need to address this. Now, I am not one of those who believes that we need to run forward and apologize for the sins of others that we didn't commit. But in this case, this bill addresses an injustice. 
   We have the power. We have the wherewithal and the ability to address this wrongdoing and this injustice. If we were not to take action, then this body would owe an apology, and I do not want to see that become necessary. 
   There are times that we hear moving testimony, and our heart is moved. But we know for the greater good of the country we must do something else. This is one of those cases in which we heard testimony that was very moving, and the heart is aligned with the head. This requires action. I appreciate the leadership moving this forward so that this injustice, this open sore, can finally be addressed.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (THE OFFICIAL TRUTH SQUAD -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. And I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia yielding, and appreciate the work he's been doing and pointing out some real economic truths. Some of these things are just so basic. As we've talked about before, you mentioned before, Ronald Reagan said we don't have a taxing problem, we've got a spending problem. And he was so right. 
   But over the last 2 1/2 years, Mr. Speaker, that my friend from Georgia and I have been here together, we've seen lots of indications, lots of signs out in front of offices talking about the national debt, and your share is so much. And I just think those are so good and so helpful. 
   As we see here, Blue Dog Coalition, today the U.S. national debt is $8,809,000,000, and your share is $29,000. I mean, that's just staggering. And frankly, you know, I've begun to think I want one of those signs, because we know who's in control. And there are those of us for the last 2 1/2 years, or the last 2 years that we've actually been here, that have been trying to push this body into having more economic responsibility. And we did see, last year, great strides made in the first time that discretionary spending wasn't just held even, it actually was cut. So we were making some real progress. 
   We saw the Federal revenues come streaming up, as the gentleman from Georgia points out, that real progress is being made. And so I just want to applaud what has been done because really it's consistent with the efforts that so many of us have made, like earmark reform. We were trying to get earmark reform. And it only took a few dozen conservative Republicans to band together and not vote for key legislation unless we got some earmark reform.     
   And that is when we finally got some earmark reform. Of course, you wouldn't know it to listen to me. They never talked about what we got accomplished, but being able to object, make a point of order on earmark reform. But I think this is a good idea to keep reminding everybody of how high the debt is, how much everybody's responsibility is. And, frankly, I want one of these signs. I may have to change the name to the ``Blue Hound Dog Coalition'' or something, but I would like to see everybody encouraging this Congress to move as we were able to push the Congress in doing in the last year or so, and hopefully there are people on the other side of the aisle that will be able to push the Democratic majority away from this just uncontrolled spending. Not only is the President's request up in most every area, but the proposals for appropriations from the Democratic majority just skyrocket above that in so many areas. 
   So I don't know what the gentleman from Georgia intends to do. But I tell you, I like reminding the majority it is time to do something. We made some real progress the last 2 years, and I am hoping that folks are not going to let that die. Even though there is a major effort to try to get that killed, I think we should keep pushing, keep pushing. I just encourage all Republicans get a sign outside your door. Let's remind folks, not just the 36 that pushed for earmark reform. Let's get everybody out there reminding the majority. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia's yielding, and I would just encourage you in all your efforts, let's get this done.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from Iowa for yielding. 
   Of course, Iowa is going through some tough times right now and our hearts and prayers go out to the folks there. 
   Energy is a huge problem around the country. My friend from Iowa was talking about the production of oil in Alaska, and it's amazing, but so many people were saying back in the days when there was talk of building a pipeline up to Prudhoe Bay, that if that pipeline is built, it will destroy completely the last 2,700 head of caribou that exist in the area, that they just would not be able to exist in that area any longer. 
   Well, the pipeline got built, and, as it turns out, those 2,700 head of caribou found that when the oil, warm, comes out of the ground and goes through the pipeline, the pipeline is warm. 
   We have subsequently found that now, when the caribou want to go on a date with each other, they will invite each other to come to the pipeline. Apparently the pipeline actually makes them a little bit amorous. Now, all these years later, we are up to 30,000 head of caribou. 
   Now, I grew up in Texas, and we used to hear, a few decades ago, that, my goodness, if they start building these deep-water rigs off the coast of Texas, it will destroy fishing in the Gulf of Mexico from now on. That's what we heard. 
   Now, if you want to go fishing, deep-water fishing in the gulf, your best bet is to go out to one of those drilling rigs, the platforms, because they have acted as an artificial reef. We have got all this additional fish and aqua particular life around those platforms. It's just further evidence that man and animal, fish, the environment, can work together to each other's good. 
   Now, I know the rules are you are not allowed to recognize people in the gallery, and I won't do that, but I can tell you that the students in Henderson Middle School know that people and oil and gas drilling rigs can actually survive together. 
   People in Nacogdoches, people like the Reynolds family, they know. You can survive in areas where there are drilling rigs. Not only that, you can proliferate and do well. So in my district there in east Texas, as someone said here yesterday from east Texas, we kept the military afloat in gasoline in World War II from east Texas, the east Texas oil and gas field. 
   Many don't realize the Germans potentially could have driven us to the sea if they had not run out of gasoline during the Battle of the Bulge, but they did run out. That is something that we have got to constantly keep a weather eye on, and I am proud to represent a district that understands the seriousness of having the energy we need and that $4 a gallon gasoline headed to $5 a gallon gasoline is a travesty for people. 
   I have got hardworking union people in east Texas. I have got hardworking folks in all kinds of jobs who are struggling to get by. This Congress, for the last 18 months, has done nothing to help produce more of our own energy. 
   I am so grateful to have a friend like my friend, Mr. King, from Iowa, who understands that. I am proud to represent people like the students from Henderson Middle School who understand these concepts and understand we can work together for the greater good of mankind of the United States of America, of aquatic life, plant life, and all be better for it. 
   I appreciate my friend from Iowa yielding, and I appreciate the effort you are making to educate America on exactly what we can do to help ourselves if the majority party in this Congress will allow us to help ourselves. 
   With that, I yield back to my friend, Mr. King.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (A CLEAN SUPPLEMENTAL TO FUND OUR TROOPS -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon an extraordinary thing did happen when we had a vote on a supplemental with all kinds of strings attached to it to fund our troops in harm's way. 
   The Democrats have the majority. They have the ability to pass that funding without a bit of help from the Republicans. 
   Many of us on the Republican side of the aisle were quite concerned, however, with the strings, with the linkages that were made to this bill to help our troops do their job. One, for example, was that in the second amendment, which we knew would pass, provisions there existed to create hard and fast deadlines for pulling our troops out of Iraq. 
   We all want to see our troops home. We all want to see our troops back with us. And those of us who go over to Iraq and see them in harm's way, we long for the time of having them home completely. But the vast majority of those guys in record numbers re-enlist because they know they're doing good. They know they are making a difference. And when you go over there, you see it. I was in Kurdistan in December, in the northern area of Iraq. Construction booming, things going well. 
   We have made a difference with the surge. It is a profound difference. We have al Qaeda on the run. They're making last-ditch efforts to try to stop what's going on. We have the Iraqi people that are there working for themselves, more soldiers, more police trained than ever. There are really good things going on. And were we to pass a supplemental that was linked to that second amendment with the time deadlines, the message would be a message of hope for all those who hate us and want to destroy us. And that is: ``If you will just hold on a little bit longer, we will have the Americans put their heads between their legs and go cowering away, as they did from Vietnam.'' We could have won Vietnam; we can succeed in Iraq. 
   The great state of Iraq is so close to governing itself. Just like John Adams wrote to Abigail, what people have only dreamed of, governing themselves is so close, within our reach. We can't give it up now. It's so close. Iraq is there. We cannot hand our enemies and the Iraqi enemies, the enemies of liberty, this kind of win. 
   So we voted ``present.'' If the Democrats had had enough votes, then they would have passed the supplemental by itself and it would have been linked to the second amendment that would have required the time deadlines for withdrawal and would have given hope. As it was, we couldn't vote against our troops, many of us, but we voted ``present.'' 
   The first amendment that we took up this afternoon failed; so now we have got to come back with a clean supplemental to help our troops. And the  crud in there about the $52 billion tax hike at a time when the economy certainly can't afford that, let's get the linkage out to admitting and saying we are defeated, we can't win, giving our enemies a victory, get all of that stuff out of there. No more linkages like that. No more tax hikes. Just a clean supplemental to give our troops the wherewithal to do what they need to succeed. That's the message we needed coming out of today. And that's why so many of us voted as we did. We voted for victory for our troops. 
   And I will never forget the words of Travis Buford's mother. Travis was killed over in Iraq. And as I stood near his coffin with his mother, it was an emotional time, and I said, ``Is there anything I can do?'' 
   She gritted her teeth and she said, ``Tell the Congress to shut up and let the military do their job.'' 
   That's what we need to do. Let the military have the wherewithal to succeed, as they can, without the linkages to failure so that we can keep our head held high and, what's more, perhaps go 7 more years without being attacked here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, regarding the recently revealed abuses of power and process by the FBI, Director Mueller has now indicated that he should have provided adequate training, experience and oversight. He is right. 
   But it also ignores what may have been one of the underlying contributors to the ultimate problem now revealed. Director Mueller has for some time now changed personnel policies at the FBI that he knew would drive out some of his best agents with the most and best experience to handle such very sensitive PATRIOT Act powers. When a director decides that his policies are far wiser than others, even as he sees that he is driving many of his best, most experienced agents and employees out of their supervisory roles, he has an even greater burden to see that his agents are trained. 
   Some tried to advise him of the damage to the ranks of experience that he was causing by what he thought to be innovative personnel management. He did not listen, and he did not ensure that the turnover he was creating left adequately trained personnel. 
   It is a wonderful thing when a leader goes against all the critics to do what he knows to be right, and he is, in fact, right. However, when a leader goes against critics who tried to tell him he was wrong, and he is later proved to be quite wrong, he should do the noble thing and step down without further ado. 
   Director Mueller has stated himself he must take the responsibility, and he is right. He must and he should. He should step down.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate so much my friend from Hawaii across the aisle pointing out what he did. I would like to pick up on that. We are not just talking about lower fuel costs. That is extremely important. We are talking about that. 
   We are also talking about jobs. In my district alone, we have a huge plant there. Their feedstock is natural gas. They produce plastics. They produce all kinds of great things. If we did an actual test and checked, did a survey, I would bet you that most of the jobs there are held by Democrats. So even if you just looked at it politically, my goodness, we are losing Democrats' jobs by not bringing down the price of natural gas. 
   On top of that, it does cost other jobs when you raise the price of natural gas. For a country like ours that has natural gas all up and down our coast, east, west, down around the Gulf, there is a tremendous supply west of Florida in the Caribbean. We have all this natural gas. Yet what breaks my heart is that I see we are building new liquid natural gas ports on our coast so we can bring it in and become more dependent on people who don't like us. 
   It makes no sense at all. It is clean burning. It helps the environment. Yes, my friend indicated that we ought to be drilling in ANWR. Yes, we should. The caribou proliferate when we give them a good warm place to mate, like the pipelines, as has already been shown. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my friend, Mr. Peterson, bringing this amendment. I would like to yield the remainder of my time to him.

   We had heard for the last couple of years the term ``culture of corruption''; and, frankly, one of the things that I looked forward to is an end to all this discussion about corruption that tarnishes each one of us. And I know for all of the people whom I am close to it is a big deal as far as our reputation when it is tarnished. 
   And so what I would submit is that in the last 2 weeks that we have not cleared a culture of corruption; that a cloud of corruption has hovered over this body, it hovers over me now, tarnishing all that we are and that I am.

   If you look underneath that in that same page, it references Speaker Gingrich, who rose to a question of personal privilege in order to clear the air and the cloud and allegation of corruption that had arisen. And then, beneath that you will see a reference of a precedent from Speaker HASTERT in 2000 who rose to a question of personal privilege to clear the air and clear the question of malfeasance over the issue of the selection of the Chaplain.

But there is really one person that could clear the air. 
   For so long people in this country cynically say: It is not what you know, it is who you know. Many of us say: That is not the case. 
   I believe if the Speaker would come forward, rise to a question of personal privilege, Madam Speaker, we could get this thing resolved and get it behind us so it is no longer an issue, and figure out how in the world a group, a territory got exempted that actually benefits a company in the Speaker's own district.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   We have heard complaints from across the aisle today alleging that oil and gas leases being addressed right now were negotiated in a culture of corruption. 
   Mr. Speaker, if the Democrats have evidence that the Clinton administration that negotiated these leases did so  corruptly, it needs to be brought forward. If that evidence is there, the Attorney General can go forward and rescind these leases and get damages. Maybe that is some of the evidence that Sandy Berger was stuffing in his socks to steal away. But if we don't have the evidence, then it is not right to go forward and break contractual words of this country and this Congress. 
   Once upon a time there was a king who broke his word regularly, like the Democrats are trying to do here, and our forefathers came forth with a document that said when in the course of human events it becomes necessary to dissolve the political bands which have connected one with another, that is what started this country when the king started being so arbitrary and capricious as this. 
   Now our forefathers tried to protect against that, so they inserted in the Bill of Rights a fifth amendment provision called the takings clause that says you shall not take private property for public use without just compensation. 
   Now this bill basically says if you don't renegotiate your lease, you can't get any more leases on your existing lease. You can't have economic benefit. That is one of the things. The Penn Central case from 1978 made clear what the test was, and this rises to the level of a regulatory taking. 
   In this bill, the Democrats are also going to try to change the Tax Code and deprive the oil and gas industry of a deduction that every other industry has. And what it will do is, in effect, prevent domestic drilling, drive us to more foreign oil and send money to our enemies. We should rename the bill the ``Chavez Shelter Bill'' or the ``Terrorist Assistance Bill'' or maybe the ``National Insecurity Bill.'' 
   Gas prices will skyrocket, and if that is what somebody here wants, they will be happy. Look, I am not happy with the deal that the Clinton administration cut. It was not a good deal, but a country cannot go about breaking its word. That is not the right thing to do. 
   What the majority wants to do is what was done in ``Animal House'' after a freshman pledge's car was wrecked. He got an arm around his shoulders and the words, ``Son, you messed up. You trusted me.'' That's not the way to run a government.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, apparently we are going to start today on debate of a resolution, the meat of which simply indicates, Resolved by the House of Representatives that Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq; and Congress disapproves of the decision of President George W. Bush announced on January  10, 2007 to deploy more than 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. 
   Now, Mr. Speaker, the record has been clear. The new commander for Iraq, General Petraeus, has had hearings and has now been confirmed unanimously by the Senate. The outgoing commander of Iraq, General Casey, has had hearings and has now been confirmed as the new chief of the United States Army unanimously. Both commanders and their subordinate commanders have indicated that these additional troops are needed. 
   We hear talk that we are supporting our troops, but basically the message to the troops is, Yes, with our lips we say we support you but with all of our actions we say, We don't believe a word you say. We don't think you know what you're talking about. We don't want to give you what you say is necessary to protect yourselves and to win the day in Iraq. 
   There are no proposed solutions in the resolution that we will debate this week, no proposed fixes, nothing proposed to help anybody. It just says, We disapprove, we don't agree with the generals, the commanders, those who are in the theater, those that have come from the theater who are on active duty. 
   Now, you will always have some retired generals and commanders who are not happy that they are retired and who will take their pot shots, but here again there are no new solutions, no new efforts in Iraq. The Democratic Party does not propose to change anything. So this resolution, I guess, could be more properly categorized as stay the course, stiffen the enemy, start our collapse, because when you say to the world and to all of our enemies, We don't believe our commanders, we don't believe they know what they're talking about, we don't believe they know what they need, we're not going to have any new solutions, what you are doing to the enemy, you are stiffening their resolve. Materials that have been found in Iraq have indicated just that, that the Americans don't have the stomach, they ran from Vietnam, they didn't keep their commitments to the people of South Vietnam. Even after the Paris Accord, they did not keep their commitment. The new larger Democratic Congress in 1975 even cut off all the funds and millions of people in Southeast Asia lost their lives. In 1979 while I was stationed at Fort Benning, we were attacked. It was an act of war. And we did nothing. We begged to have our hostages returned. We did nothing. And those are the kind of things that the enemy goes back to in saying, we don't have the stomach to do this. In 1983 when our barracks was bombed in Beirut, we withdrew. In 1993 when the World Trade Center was attacked, we did virtually nothing on the international front. Then throughout the nineties, the attack of the USS Cole, Mozambique, Somalia, Africa, time and again, time and again we showed we didn't have the resolve. This must be the time we stand firm, tell our enemy, We will defeat you, we have nothing but solutions. This resolution, the stay the course, stiffen the enemy, start our collapse resolution, is not the way to go. I hope our fellow Members of this House will do the right thing. We will try something new. We will try to help the troops. We will give them what they ask. The Democratic stay the course, stiffen the enemy and start our collapse resolution is not a solution.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my dear friend from Georgia for yielding. 
   This has been a really difficult week. Having spent the weekend with my constituents that were hit by a hurricane in east Texas, and then coming here to Congress and figuring, surely we can put party issues aside because, frankly, when I was in the district, it was around, I don't know, the wee hours, and one sheriff that was helping said, now, you know I'm a Democrat. I said, you know I don't care. It doesn't matter. And then I get back to Washington and that's all it's about. You know, the Democrats have the majority and they were determined to shut out any ideas from the Republicans. 
   There was a wonderful bipartisan bill, as you pointed out, the Abercrombie/Peterson bill had 38 Democratic cosponsors that understand the importance of energy. Twenty-four of them voted against their own bill when that was made as a substitute. 
   And it's just incredible how something is being rammed down on the Nation when we can't afford it. People need gasoline. They need diesel. Some of those guys pointed out, they've lost power. There are no hybrid generators, and that's what's keeping about a third of my district going.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (VOTERS MADE A MISTAKE TRUSTING DEMOCRATS -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there is something awry in this House. You know, we have heard for the last 2 years I have been here in Congress about how if the Democrats were allowed to be in the majority, there was going to be openness, Mr. Speaker, there was going to be transparency, there was going to be bipartisanship; and yet right here the first rattle out of the box we have 3 weeks where the Republicans are not allowed any input whatsoever. Oh, we can come to the floor and fuss about it, but that is not input, there are no amendments, there are no changes that were allowed to be made. But now this week, we are beyond the 100 hours. And of course that was pretty ironic because promises, pledges, I assure you we are going to have openness, we are going to be bipartisan, well, when they saw around election time it was, gee, they had a chance of taking the majority, what did they do? Well, we don't want to keep that bipartisan promise, so let's change that. How can we do that? Oh, we will make a new promise. We will promise we are not going to keep our prior promise and we are just going to ramrod some things through in the opening days of Congress. Then they found out they enjoyed that, they liked that. Don't let them have any input. That is not right to Americans that nearly half of Americans are not allowed input into what goes on. 
   But this week takes the cake. Unbelievable. We have a bill that has only, as far as we can find out, had input from Congressman Obey and Senator Byrd, it is the Obey-Byrd $463 billion earmark. Now I have got some folks up here from my district from Lufkin, Texas; the mayor is here, the city manager. In fact, nine of my 12 full counties had never voted for a Republican for Congress before, they are conservative Democratic counties. They don't run their counties and cities this way. They don't say the mayor is going back in the back rooms and is going to put together the budget for the next year. We are not going to have any kind of hearings, we are not going to allow any input. And here in Congress, in the past we have had review by subcommittees, and then the subcommittee hearings and taking testimony, and then we had a voting it out of subcommittee called a markup. Then we had review by the full committee. Then we had input from both Democrats and Republicans. Then we had a voting it out of committee. And then it went to the Rules Committee, and then the Rules Committee considered it. And then it came to the floor. And then there were opportunities for amendment, not on $463 billion of American taxpayer money, no, not here. There is no subcommittee, no committee, no Rules Committee. Well, they may take it to Rules, but I am not sure about that because it won't matter. It is coming to the floor tomorrow for a vote on the $463 billion Obey-Byrd earmark. That is not openness and transparency. I don't care how many new promises you make to break your old promises, that isn't right to the American people of my county, my county seats, Gilmer, Jefferson, Tyler, Longview, Marshall, Carthage, Henderson, Nacogdoches, Center, Hemphill, San Augustine, Lufkin; they would never run their city governments like this, they would never run their county governments like this. People would run them out of office if they tried to do what is going to be done tomorrow with $463.5 billion of America's taxpayer dollars. That is just not right. That is not right. 
   You know, Democrats had kind of run the budget process in the ground, and people had enough. They saw the way Senator Byrd cost us hundreds of millions or billions of dollars building an FBI facility in West Virginia. They saw the way the earmarks got out of hand under Democrats, so they voted in Republicans in 1994. Republicans did a great job, welfare reform, bringing the budget to where it balanced. And then they got a little complacent, some of my colleagues got long in the tooth and forgot why they were there, and so we got voted out. And the Democrats said, trust us, we have learned our lessons, we are not going to let this happen again. And all I can think about over and over again is that line in Animal House where after the senior fraternity members had wrecked the young freshman pledge's car, the guy put his arm around the young freshman and said, in effect, well, you messed up, you trusted me. Well, voters trusted Democrats with the majority. And now, as we consider $463 billion Obey-Byrd earmark that didn't have input from our friends across the aisle or Republicans, you messed up, you trusted them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Well, I certainly appreciate my good friend, Mr. Burton, yielding, even though I rise to say how much I agree with the gentleman from Illinois about the greatness of Lovie Smith. 
   Chicago Bears' head coach Lovie Smith is a Super Bowl-bound gentleman. He was born May 8, 1958 in the wonderful town of Gladewater, Texas in my home district in the middle of east Texas. He grew up in Big Sandy, Texas, was voted the boy most likely to succeed in the class of 1976 in Big Sandy High School. He was also part of  three State football championships there in Big Sandy, Texas, where they do know good football. 
   After playing college ball at Tulsa, where he earned two-time All-America and three-time All-Missouri Valley Conference honors, he began his coaching career at his hometown high school in Big Sandy, Texas. 
   Now, 2 years later, Lovie Smith began coaching collegiately at Tulsa, Wisconsin, Arizona State, Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio State. After coaching the linebackers for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and then helping the St. Louis Rams return to the Super Bowl, Lovie Smith eventually found himself in Chicago as the defensive coordinator for the Bears. The team allowed the fewest points in the NFL in 2005 and ranked second in overall defense. He was named the 13th head coach in Chicago Bears history on January 15, 2004. Coach Smith was named the Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year for 2005. 
   Lovie Smith and his wife, Maryann, have three sons, Matthew, Michael and Miles, as well as twin grandsons, Malachi and Noah. 
   Now, Big Sandy City Hall tells us today that they have 1,275 residents; and within that delightfully proud town, there is a street in which Lovie Smith's childhood home was, where he grew up. It burned down a couple of years after they moved, but that street is now marked with a sign that bears the name of Lovie Smith. Coach Smith responded to that naming: ``Where else would I want it to be? Those are my roots; that is where I grew up. Most of who I am today came from that street. There is no other place I would want a sign with my name on it. I am proud of where I came from.'' 
   Let me tell you, Madam Speaker, we are certainly proud of Coach Lovie Smith in east Texas.

And in 2 months of talking about raising taxes and more regulation and one committee chairman talking about  how he is going to undermine the President's national security policy, in just 2 months we have this terrible damage to the stock market, to the economy. Unbelievable. They were saying last night on the news that this is the biggest drop since 9/11. In 2 months of talking about all these new plans, we are going to cost people jobs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we have heard about the CAFE standards. Most of us think they are a good idea and that that will help us conserve more energy. 
   But the truth is we shouldn't be paying the highest natural gas prices in the world when we have perhaps the first but at least the second most generous deposits of natural gas in the world. We have perhaps the most coal in the world, and we could be using it. We could be driving down the cost of energy if it were not for the policies that were put in place this year. 
   Now, this bill doesn't help that. In fact, it drives prices the other way. I understand, I have some colleagues in here who believe that if we can drive the price of gasoline high enough, drive the price of carbon energy high enough, then the alternatives become the way to go and everybody goes to them more quickly. I understand that. 
   Some of us, though, like me, believe that a free market will drive the prices and drive the market in the right direction. So as the price of energy becomes higher, as we use more of our own God-given deposits in this country and use them wisely, have zero emissions, that the alternatives will come in naturally without this artificial demand to drive it there. 
   The point is a lot of this legislation will end up, in conjunction with what we have already done this year, driving the price of gasoline to $5 a gallon. That is what happens when you interfere to the extent we are interfering with this legislation and others this year. 
   The thing I would ask is that as the price of gasoline is driven to $5 a gallon with legislative interests that is being pushed this year and next that, please, the people that have pushed it come down here to the well, to the floor and say, ``That's right, gas is $5 a gallon. We think in the long run you'll be better off and we are so proud that we made your gasoline $5 a gallon.'' That's where we're headed. Let's be honest about it, and then those who did it take credit for it when it gets there.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, Youth With a Mission, or YWAM, and the rest of the Nation grieved over the tragic Colorado shootings that resulted in the death and injuries of YWAM's staff and former students. Our deepest sympathy goes out  to the family and friends affected by this terrible tragedy. I rise to honor and encourage YWAM as an international ministry whose largest North American training facility is located in my district at Garden Valley, Texas, where I visited numerous times. 
   YWAM trains Christians of many denominations and ages with their express purpose being to know God and to make Him known in obedience to the Great Commission which says they are to go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation. YWAM currently operates in more than 1,000 locations in over 149 countries with a staff of nearly 16,000. I have also had the opportunity on multiple occasions to meet different YWAM staff and students when they have visited this beautiful city here in Washington, D.C., before embarking on short-term mission trips. 
   When I speak with these individuals, I am overwhelmed by their passion for their ministry and sincere love for people they have yet to meet. They truly strive to follow the example of Christ by offering themselves as selfless, humble, and loving servants. 
   The Declaration of Independence says that we are endowed by a Creator with certain inalienable rights. Our Creator endowed this Nation with these individuals who have now been killed. Each of these dear people were a gift to this Earth and to this country. And although we are very disappointed that we did not get to keep those gifts as long as we wished at their Earthly location, we can still thank God for each day that we had them. 
   We are not promised life without hardships. To the contrary, those who take up their individual crosses, especially for the sake of Christ, can expect to face greater trials and persecution. For this Nation's entire history, until now, Christians have had a place, a country, where they were not persecuted. But that unique time is changing. In this day of political correctness, often Christians are the only groups it is acceptable to verbally assault. The Apostle Paul reminds us that we should consider everything a loss, including our own lives, compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage the staff and students at YWAM during this difficult time. 
   C.S. Lewis had kept a journal of sorts after his precious wife, Joy, had died. In one entry, he said, in effect, that he missed her so much he wanted her back. But he realized how very selfish that was. His wife was in heaven. She was in paradise. It was not in her interest to return to a land of tears from a land where there is no sorrow. Lewis went on to say that we are told Stephen was the first martyr. But he said, as I think about it, didn't Lazarus get the far rawer deal? If you review the Bible looking for quotes from Lazarus after he was brought back from the dead, you will not find them. I will bet he was not a happy camper. 
   In any event, we can look forward to the day when we can be reunited with these friends from YWAM. But may those at YWAM find strength and encouragement from friends, from each other, and from these words: may God bless those at YWAM and may He continue to shine His face upon them.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we're talking about e-mails. We're talking about the rule on e-mails for Federal agencies, for the White House. But the truth is, the e-mails that keep coming in are desperate. What we saw in the last week were people running out of gas in greater numbers than ever before. 
   The Democratic Party, the once proud party, always talked in terms of helping the little guys. The little guys are suffering. The little guys are hurting. We're losing union jobs because our energy has gotten so expensive in this country and we're overtaxing some of the people providing the jobs.     
   Gas is going from $4 to $5, and this Congress could make a huge difference, and we're talking about e-mails. The e-mails say we need help, do something. And we can. And I know that we have some courageous Democratic friends across the aisle that want to do something and could do something, but the Democratic leadership seems vested in this idea that really we won't say it publicly but $20 a gallon for gas would be a good thing because people would quit driving and that would save the planet, not realizing when you tank an economy, people quit caring about the environment, as they should, because they're worried about having food, having shelter, taking care of their families. And we could help them if we bring the right bills to drill now, to mine what we have. 
   Those of us who believe in God have got to believe God is sitting there going, Look at what all I gave you in the way of natural resources. And yet the last bill to come out of our Natural Resources Committee this last month was to put our last best source of uranium off-limits for some made-up, contrived emergency that doesn't exist. I think the bill will end up being unconstitutional, but it still shows we're still putting our resources off-limits. 
   If you're worried about killing caribou, we have seen that when we put a warm pipeline out there in the middle of the Alaskan wilderness area, then the caribou thrive. They go mate around the pipeline. We're up over ten times the number of caribou we used to have. If you're worried about killing fish off the coast by drilling, we have seen in Texas it creates artificial reefs, and that's where people go fish now. 
   We can help the people and the environment if we will use what we have got because in the years to come, the archivists are going to come pull e-mails and see that the number one concern of people right now in this country was energy and all we wanted to talk about was e-mails and scenic trails when they haven't got gasoline to drive to those trails. 
   Let's help Americans where they need help. Let's do the right thing. Let's work on energy and producing what we have got.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Virginia. 
   I rise in opposition to this. Here we are talking about e-mails from the White House and the executive branch when all we're hearing from the people in America is you've got to help us with energy prices. 
   Now, I realize there may be, if you look at enough e-mails from the White House, you may find out they're getting the same messages that all of us are getting: help us with energy prices, we're desperate. 
   Now, what I was hearing was from retailers, from restaurateurs, from people that are providing jobs, from people who have jobs and they're hanging on just by the skin of their teeth. They're union jobs, hardworking folks like that, that are just trying to make ends meet, and now they're at the end point where they're having to use their credit cards to pay for gas to get to the job so they can get paid so they can pay down their credit card enough to buy gas the next month. I'm seeing more and more people running out of gas on the interstate. They're getting desperate. And what is so sickening to me is knowing that in the last year all these different resources are becoming so much more clear that we have. 
   You know, we have been told, some of us, that there may be 900 billion to 1 trillion barrels of oil left in the entire Middle East, and then we hear that from that black shale that's in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, that we could recover three times that much at least in barrels of oil that could supply this Nation. 
   We've heard for all these decades now, for 3 decades, gee, let's don't go after ANWR, it will take 10, 15 years. Well, the latest information, as my friend from Alaska has pointed out, is there's a pipeline 74 miles away. It can be flowing to this country, this continental U.S., within 3 years. 
   And when you think about the Outer Continental Shelf, we may have more natural gas out there than any country in the world. We have been so blessed with natural resources, and yet, instead, we're making our citizens struggle just day-to-day to make ends meet. We're losing jobs. People are laying people off. 
   And I know--and I said this over a year ago--I know we have friends across the aisle who believe that perhaps even $20 a gallon gasoline would be a good thing because it would save the planet because people would quit using it. And as Al Gore said, the internal combustion engine was the worst invention ever created for the destruction of man, something along those lines. 
   And the fact is, we do need to move to the alternative energy sources. We need to do that. But it's going to be 30, 40 years before we can get there, and in the meantime, it appears now we have enough natural resources, we could tell some of these other countries to kiss our backside and we don't need your fuel anymore. We can do it with what we have ourselves, and we ought to be doing that. 
   We ought to be doing coal-to-liquid. We ought to be using ANWR, and what's more, if you look at the royalties that could be obtained from all of that wealth of resources, we could cut taxes and create some of the programs that my friends across the aisle want to do. Do all of that with the massive revenue that would come in. Everybody would win, but until we get realistic and want to help folks, all we're going to be doing is talking about e-mails. 
   So let's do the right thing by the people that send us here. Let's help them with their energy costs. It is getting desperate, and it's time to put that word and all that wind being created--you talk about carbon emissions. There's no worse carbon emitter than this floor of the House of Representatives, gosh, with all the wind being generated. 
   But let's do something constructive and put it into action.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Chairman, my time is short. I'll get right to some of these issues. I just have a copy of the bill here. 
   Under the definition of ``religious organization,'' it actually excludes by definition schools, institutions that have been started by churches in which they set up their own boards, because it requires that the institution has to be in whole or in substantial part controlled, managed, owned or supported by the religion. So free-standing educational institutions, bookstores, things like that, would be opened up. Because there is so much language, I think while the Boy Scouts felt they were safe by the past litigation, but this opens up that whole new can of worms and we can expect more litigation against the Boy Scouts. 
   To add in some of these things like, you can bring a lawsuit for discrimination if you don't like your conditions. I had one lawsuit that went nowhere because a woman claimed she was moved from working on copper to working on aluminum and that was an insult. Under this, that's a legitimate lawsuit if you have manifested, acted or had people perceive you in such a way that they think you may be homosexual. 
   What this does is it invites people to come apply for a job, and if they feel like they may not get a job, make utterances like, well, you think I'm gay, that's why, and they will have a lawsuit. I can guarantee you, many lawyers will encourage their clients, the employers, to pay something just to make it go away. 
   Training programs are listed. If you don't get the seminar, then you can go in and say, you didn't give me that trip because you think I'm gay. There may be a lawsuit there. In fact, you could, and lawyers in some circumstances, I would say most circumstances, will say, yeah, you ought to settle with these guys because they can take you to the cleaners. 
   There is a provision, though, here. Isn't it nice, we have a provision in here that says States shall not be immune under the 11th amendment. This legislation is just going to set aside an amendment to the Constitution legislatively. My goodness. That's pretty bold. Pretty bold. Then we get down to what the real issue may be here, attorneys' fees on page 18. You're getting attorneys' fees. All the tort reform that occurred on med mal, this will bring litigation many times over if this becomes law. But the good news for the United States is, we have a provision in here, the United States will not be subject to punitive damages. Don't have a provision like that for States and for employers. So look out. 
   What this Congress is now attempting to dictate is which religious beliefs and moral beliefs the majority believes are okay and which religious beliefs it feels are not okay. This will actually encourage people, whether they are gay or not, to flaunt or manifest what may be perceived to be characterizations to help the lawyers.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I read a sign almost every day, they are out in hallways all over, from the Blue Dog Coalition, and as of today, it says today's U.S. national debt, $8.807 trillion; your share, $29,000. There's some of us all the time we have been in the House been trying to do something about that. We have been trying to bring down the deficit. We have been trying to with our own party, the Republicans, with the Democrats now in the majority, get spending reined in.  
   Also, in our Natural Resources Committee, as well as other committees around, we have been trying to find answers to our energy problem, because, let's face it, we're funding our enemies, people that want to see us, have damage done to our way of life, if not destroyed. 
   So how do we get around this energy debacle where we keep using fossil fuels that keep funding our enemies? I heard a chairman say a moment ago, there is no silver bullet. I couldn't agree more. We need every single aspect of energy, all of the alternative energies, all of the energy sources we have, that includes drilling the Outer Continental Shelf and areas where it would be safe to do so. It includes drilling in ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska, and here we've got $142 million that is in issue here. 
   As the saying goes, $142 million here, $142 million there, before long, we are talking about real money. People in our hometowns, they understand, this is a lot of money, may not be to some of us up here in Washington, but, as we have seen recently, as we have seen recently the last couple of weeks in Natural Resources, people keep wanting to study things, let's study this. 
   We were ready to go on a biomass program. In the energy bill marked up last week, we are going to back up 10 years and have another study on that. We have these programs ready to go, and we keep wanting to back up and have more studies done. 
   What we really need to do is just move forward. Some of these studies, when left to the private sector, they are going to recoup their money and their profits. Let them pay for these things. They are making all these profits. Why should we use taxpayer dollars to do that? 
   So we have coal that if the bill becomes law that was passed out of Resources, it's going to make it harder to utilize the coal we have. All these different alternative energy sources are available, and we keep wanting to use money to study them. 
   What occurs to me, when I hear there is no silver bullet, is not only do I agree that there is no silver bullet solution, but I keep feeling like, because we keep appointing studies and keep wanting to spend taxpayers' hard-earned money to study things, instead of just going ahead and producing, that the silver bullet may be in the Chamber that's pointed to our Nation's collective head here. 
   It's time to quit studying. It's time to move forward, it's time to use money for purposes that are not those that should be done by the private sector, and then we can get back to money. 
   Then, lo and behold, all those folks have been saying we really don't want to raise taxes even though it looks like it's going to be the largest tax increase in American history. All those who say we don't want to raise taxes, it's this $142 million here, $142 million there. Before you know it, we may even be able to lower taxes even further. 
   So I will encourage my colleagues, let's quit studying, let's quit spending money that could be going back to taxpayers if we are not going to need it for something more pressing, quit studying, start producing and then that silver bullet won't be aimed at our head.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, on Thursday evening, July 26, Gregg County, my home district, First District of Texas, will gather for a day of remembrance in honor of our great servicemembers who were held as prisoners of war or were missing in action. 
   July 26 is a special day because it will be the 63rd birthday of U.S. Air Force Captain Clyde Campbell, around whom this occasion is centered. 
   I, unfortunately, will be unable to attend since I will be here in Washington DC, but I send these remarks. Unfortunately, Captain Campbell will also be unable to make it on his own birthday celebration because he or his remains have not been brought home from Laos. 
   Clyde Campbell was born in Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1944, and graduated from Longview High School in 1962. After graduating from Texas A&M University, he answered the call to service and joined the United States Air Force. An ambitious and talented young pilot, Captain Campbell was stationed at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Airport Base in Thailand, ready to sacrifice his all for the Nation that he loved so dearly. 
   In March 1969, he took off in his Douglas A1 Skyraider on a bombing  pass, but Captain Campbell's plane was shot down and crashed in Laos. 
   I will speak more about Captain Campbell during Special Orders.

   July 26 is a special day because it would be the 63rd birthday of U.S. Air Force captain Clyde Campbell, that is the man around whom this occasion is centered. 
   I, unfortunately, will be unable to attend since I will be here in Washington. Unfortunately, Captain Campbell will also be unable to make it on his own birthday celebration because he or his remains have not been brought home from Laos. 
   Clyde Campbell was born in Eagle Lake, Texas, in 1944, and graduated from Longview High School in 1962. After graduating from Texas A&M University, he answered the call to service and joined the United States Air Force. An ambitious and talented young pilot, Captain Campbell was stationed at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Airport Base in Thailand, ready to sacrifice his all for the Nation that he loved so dearly. 
   In March 1969, he took off in his Douglas A1 Skyraider on a bombing pass, but Captain Campbell's plane was shot down and crashed in Laos. 
   It is now 2007, almost 40 years later. Although his crash site has been identified, Captain Campbell's remains are in a land that is not his home. 
   The Campbell family has spent nearly four decades requesting help to have this patriot returned. But so far, that help has not come. I am ashamed that the Federal Government has not used anywhere near the devotion to giving his family closure as the devotion Captain Campbell provided this Nation in her time of need. 
   This family deserves better. Captain Campbell deserves better, and I, as are many others around here, am determined to see that his remains are removed from Laos and given a proper burial here in the United States. 
   He and those who gave their last full measure of devotion for this country, as well as their beloved family members who have waited so long, deserve action, and they deserve results. 
   Captain Campbell and the Campbell family deserve our deepest gratitude for their sacrifice. May God bless them and comfort them, and may God and the Campbell family forgive this Federal Government for its 30 years of inadequate service to them.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (THE BAILOUT BILL -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, today we passed a truly historic bill because the Secretary of Treasury had come forward and told us that if we didn't pass it, we were to be afraid, be very afraid. 
   So people were beginning to panic around the country. Credit was freezing up. It was before and even more so after he spoke. And so it was necessary that we do something. 
   For most of us, we heard from a lot of people saying please don't bail out Wall Street, don't give them $700 billion. The last couple of days we heard from car dealers, from bankers, from shopkeepers, small mom and pop businesses about to go out of business saying you've got to do something. So Secretary Paulson's scare tactics had worked. The underlying problems may still be there. In fact, some of them are, and we still need to address them, and I have confidence that we will. 
   The underlying banks had money. The community banks, solid. But there is a crisis of confidence and lending is coming to a halt. 
   Now, some problems in the industry were created by Congress where we forced people to lend money to people they wouldn't have otherwise. That's a problem. That needed to be fixed. But we were told basically in theory by the Secretary that this would be a type of shock and awe, that we would put so much money into the Wall Street market that it would shock the economy and people would respond favorably and everything would be great as a result. 
   I, like my friend Ms. Foxx, hope that this works. I don't think it was necessary. I think it was problematic. And it ought to scare people when the government says, we need $700 billion to bail out an industry and that will make everybody better, and please raise the debt ceiling by $1.3 trillion. I thought it was just $700 billion. Well, we raised the debt ceiling by $1.3 trillion today just in case. 
   Apparently, the good news is we will spend $700 billion completely at the Secretary of the Treasury's whim, as he determines. You will see in the bill, those that bothered to read it, over and over ``as the Secretary determines,'' ``as the Secretary determines.'' And then we are going to have to hire some people to manage all these assets that we're buying. That may be outside the $700 billion. Maybe that's why we need to raise the limit to $1.3 trillion. 
   But being an historical fan, being such a student of history, you cannot find in the history of the Nation a time before when this government, this Congress, had so much faith in one person that they said, ``Here is $700 billion. Do with it as you will. Make our Nation well.'' 
   Now, if you go back before our Constitution of 1787, you will find that one time something like this was done, in 1776, December 27 to be exact. Many of the people that had signed up in the Army had done so for 6 months, and they signed up around the time of the Declaration of Independence; so their time was going to be up in January. The Continental Congress heard that many of them would not reenlist; so they were scared. 
   George Washington never asked for this kind of power, but they knew this man. They knew he was not in it for himself and he wouldn't reward his friends. He was doing everything he could, to the tune of sacrificing his life and his fortune to help create this great land. So they gave him this power. He didn't use it. When he tried to get the guys to enlist, he gave one of the most impassioned speeches, and his pure leadership and example was enough to inspire them. 
   Well, there's a picture in the Rotunda just down the hall of him coming in. He wrote Bible verses on his resignation, and he tendered the resignation and did something no one had ever done in history: led a Revolutionary Army, won the Revolution, and then came in, resigned, and went home. Nobody had ever done it before or since. They could trust that man. 
   I've studied history. I am a fan of George Washington. He is a hero of mine. And Secretary Henry Paulson is no George Washington. 
   So let me leave you with this: When you hear anybody in the government say ``We're going to take your tax dollars and we're going to make you money,'' then that's when you need to be afraid because they have moved over into the socialist realm. And you can always make more money than the government can. 
   That's the thought I leave with you, with the hope and prayer that this does inspire the confidence that was looked for so the economy does free up. I had hoped leadership would do it, but now apparently it will take $700 billion, and may God help us all.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1100, CARL SANDBURG HOME NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE BOUNDARY REVISION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule today and it goes back to the experience we had on the floor and in committee. 
   Mr. Bishop had offered an amendment in the National Parks Subcommittee that would have improved this bill, in my opinion, because his amendment would have reduced the number of acres that are being added to this so-called park. This was not Carl Sandburg's original home. The acreage being added or sought to be added is not even available for view from the Sandburg home. It was not part of the original home. So it made sense that an amendment like this ought to have a vote and it did. 
   When it came time for a recorded vote, the subcommittee chairman promised to hold the vote open for 15 minutes. About 8 to 9 minutes later, though, for some time the vote on the amendment was passing, once there was one more vote ``nay'' than in the affirmative, between 8 and 9 minutes later, the chairman closed the vote, even though he said he would leave it open for 15 minutes. He closed it as I walked into the door and others alerted him, and actually he never said that  the vote was closed. He simply asked the clerk for a count at that point, and when it was pointed out to him that the vote had not been closed but simply a count asked for, and that I was there when he did that, he still refused to allow my vote, and my vote as reflected would have been ``aye.'' That would have tied the vote. We all know there were others on the way, though we knew not how they would vote. But I was promised that my vote would also be counted in the record but it, in fact, did not. 
   And we went through a series of parliamentary inquiries to make sure that the chairman had every opportunity to do the right thing, and so that it was not quite as clear as it became, that there was only one reason that vote was held open, and that was to foreclose the opportunity to pass this amendment. 
   Now, the House rules say that a record vote shall not be held open on the floor for the purpose of changing the outcome of a vote. Clearly, that's what happened here. Clearly, it would have changed the outcome of the vote, at least as I came in, to a tie with other people coming if the vote had been held open as long as the chairman said he was going to. 
   But the promises of bipartisanship in this Chamber, as we saw it yesterday, as we saw in this subcommittee hearing, are about as hollow as some of the other things around this floor. 
   Now, as far as the rule, it should have been open to this amendment. The amendment should have been part of the original bill, but through this procedural folly, it was not. And so I object to the rule. I rise in opposition to the rule, and I would encourage our colleagues across the aisle to remember their promises. 
   I know it's been clear back to November and all those campaign promises leading up to November, and that's a long time, even though the Attorney General is being condemned for forgetting things further back than that. Nonetheless, we won't get into questions of hypocrisy. I just ask you to remember your promises about bipartisanship and open government, because this rule forecloses the openness that we were promised we would have, especially when it pertains to a good amendment that deserves consideration before this floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we've heard a number of comments about we've just got to bite the bullet  and do this. We heard the same things about let's bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We've got to take this one step. And then we heard from the former chairman of the FDIC, guys, you don't realize, if you do this, you are going to start the dominoes falling. 
   People have talked about this precipice. 
   Making this vote, passing this bill is jumping into the precipice because next we have got to come bail out the community banks that are doing just fine. If we would allow the banks to value these mortgage-based securities at the very value Paulson wants to take taxpayer money and buy them, they would be okay. Washington Mutual wouldn't have failed. We hear about we did the right thing with Chrysler and New York. Those were loans. This is putting the government in the position of buying all these things. 
   And as the FDIC former Chair said, when the Federal Government buys them, they immediately become worth less. That is the way it is. That is the way it will be. 
   And nobody seems to ask, who is it that is going to manage these assets? I have been asking. And finally the answer I got was, well, of course, we're going to have to outsource that. 
   You're going to outsource it to the very people that caused the problem. We're going to give them billions for assets they have mismanaged. And then we're going to hire them to manage those assets. 
   Please, please don't betray this Nation's great history. The committees used to do good work and ferret this stuff out.     
   They haven't been allowed to do their work, or they would have done a better job. Let the committees do the work. Let's get a better bill, and save America from Congress hurting it by jumping off this precipice.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (DON'T PANIC AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - September 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this was a historic day. There was a bill in which we had Members who meant well, who had come to this floor and said, look, I understand we all have these principles, and this violates some of our principles, but we need to set those aside in order to avoid risk here. Well, first of all, that is a faulty premise. I just couldn't think of anything but the Declaration of Independence, when the people who founded this place came forward and said the principles of not having the king, not having the Government run everything are too important. And they signed their name where everybody could see, pledging their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor, saying, ``On these principles we will stand or fall.'' 
   And I think today the House, by its vote, said we're standing on the same principles. But not only that, these are the principles on which this Nation has become the greatest Nation in the world and the most prosperous. We can't abandon those principles. 
   So to have a bill that would come before Congress that basically gave the Secretary of the Treasury incredible powers--he was going to be able to bail out any bank in the world with American taxpayer dollars, the only exception was a central bank of a foreign government, but other banks that weren't central banks of other governments could be bailed out. And then, looking at judicial review, as that's my background, it was extraordinary. Nobody was going to be able to object legally and have a chance of prevailing under the standards that were set forth. 
   So the American people need to hear this message: Don't panic. You saw a Congress bipartisanly come in here and stand on principle and want you to know, don't panic, we are going to address this. We're going to come back, it will take a couple of days, and we'll look at the other solutions. One of them was proposed by the former Chairman of the FDIC and said, look, Paulson wanted $700 billion of American taxpayer money to buy these mortgage-based securities that, because the market is frozen, they have no value. And he is going to put a value on there, and it would be either the value, if you do a discounting based on the cash payments made on that mortgage, how regularly they're made, there's a way to get a formula and put a value on there, or you can base it on a discounted value of the underlying property that is securing that mortgage. 
   And then you have a value. And that's what Secretary Paulson was going to come in and spend to buy these assets with American taxpayer dollars. The FDIC former Chairman said, look, if you will just allow these banks to value these assets, what they're really worth and what Secretary Paulson was willing to come in and pay, then they're not under water, the banks don't fail. Washington Mutual didn't have to fail. And even when it failed, all those people that had money with Washington Mutual, they woke up the next day, they had the same money in the account, it is now under a JP Morgan name. And the same way with Wachovia; all their deposits, as I understand it, they have been purchased, and the people can wake up tomorrow and know they've got all that money, it's just under a different name, in the same amount. 
   Don't panic. When Roosevelt said, ``All we have to fear is fear itself,'' that is so true right now because this Congress is committed to principle in a bipartisan way. And I appreciate my friend, Ms. Kaptur, and her diligence in pursuing this. And we've heard some of the same presentations. And we're going to come back with a better bill; and if we don't, we're going to keep doing it until we get it right. 
   Some of the other proposals were excellent. You know, rather than make American taxpayers buy these things--including in, possibly, foreign countries--why not just say, look, if you will come and buy these assets, you won't have any capital gains on the income you make off of these, that encourages the free market to flow. 
   We have heard--I was not aware--that there may be hundreds of billions of American dollars in foreign banks. And one idea was, if you say we will allow you to repatriate those hundreds of billions of dollars if you will bring them in, no tax, no penalty, and buy these assets to help things along, that brings America money. 
   There are all kinds of fantastic ideas. And we are going to be stronger in America if the fearmongering will go away so Americans can use their own judgment and understand that this was a good thing today. Please don't fear, please don't panic. We're going to come back from this stronger, with our principles intact.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   With regard to the remarks just made, Mr. Chairman, I think what is happening here from the Republican side is not an objection to funds for national security; it's the secret funds for Democratic security we're concerned about. 
   So we've also heard discussion from the chairman of the committee about a circus. We heard the term ``circus'' numerous times, and that's what got my attention. It got me to thinking about a circus. Most of us have been to circuses. Let me tell you about a circus. 
   A circus, it's not the most expensive circus, but it's one where you have some trained dogs, maybe they're yellow, maybe they're blue, but you have some trained dogs who get in a line and run in a circle, jump through hoops when the ringmaster tells them; they sit when the ringmaster tells them. These blue, yellow dogs, whatever color dogs, they stand on their hind legs and dance when the ringmaster tells them. They do what the ringmaster says, and it's against their instincts for their own security, it's against their instincts for their own well-being and  their family's well-being, but it's all to please the ringmaster. Now, that is a circus. 
   Now, regarding earmarks, we did have earmark reform last year, and when I heard all of the promises from the other side about there was going to be even greater earmark reform, I thought, you know, that really could be a good thing. But the old saying around Washington is that no matter how cynical you get, it's never enough to catch up, and I'm beginning to see there's something to that because all those promises about taking our earmark reform and going much further went out the window. 
   As the minority leader said, we had earmark reform. We went directly after the airdropped earmarks so there could be no airdropped earmarks that would not be out of the shadows. Out of the shadows, we're told illegal immigrants need to be brought out of the shadows; they're out on the street marching. The only thing that seems to be in the shadows is these secret earmarks, and that is what we're about. 
   Now, it would have been a great improvement if we could have moved further, but the truth is there were dozens of us in the Republican side last year that went to our leadership and said, we're not voting for appropriations unless you give us some earmark reform, and what we got was reform on airdrop. I wasn't leader of that, but I was sure proud to be part of it. We had Mike Pence, Jeb Hensarling, we had Jeff Flake leading the charge on those things, and because a few dozen, and I tell this, Mr. Chairman, through the chairman and hope that people across the aisle, whatever color dogs they may present themselves to the public to be, will understand that a few dozen people talking to their leadership that they're not voting for a bill until there's some earmark reform gets the leadership's attention. We got it on this side, and the Democrats can get it on their side once they get on their own hind legs when they're not instructed by the ringmaster. 
   Now, there is a cloud of corruption that has been over this body. We dealt with it early on when we thought there was going to be minimum wage reform, and then we found out there was a secret exception, and then some said that it actually benefited someone or a business in the Speaker's own district, and we never heard the Speaker address that. 
   Some said, well, there's a problem in the carbon footprint we're creating. Then we find out, well, some are saying there's an excessively large jet, and these kinds of questions arose. 
   We find that a Democrat's indicted, and only then, even though months and months ago we see an 80-page search warrant affidavit with all kinds of information, it's only after indictment that the majority moves forward. 
   We also know that there's an investigation ongoing, and the question has been raised is it appropriate for someone under investigation by the Justice Department to actually control the Justice Department's budget. There are all these kinds of things. 
   We have had a chairman of a committee who had an earmark question, and then it's never been a denial that he threatened somebody that raised an issue. Did we bring that earmark into the sunlight? No. We not only didn't bring it into the sunlight, the person that tried to do that was threatened. And when he brought up the threat and the violation of ethics rules, then that was tabled.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we've heard a number of things, what this is or isn't about. We're told it's not about the protections for the country, but it is about that. And I have great respect and admiration for our chairman, Mr. Conyers. 
   But we were told, also, well, gee, the reason we need more time is the White House has delayed giving us documents. But if you really want to get to the bottom of this, you go back to August 4 when we took a vote on FISA being extended for a number of months. There was no immunity in there. There was no issue about is the President going to turn over documents. Forty-one Democrats voted for it, nine didn't vote, and all the rest voted against it. They were against the protections for this country and FISA. 
   Now, we need to try to eliminate risk to the country, not political risk to a party. And I understand sometimes you have Members that see the dangers to America, gee, that exposes the country to great risk and if we don't do something and something terrible happens, then we've exposed our party to terrible political risk. This shouldn't be about political risk. We need to do what's right for the country. 
   The chairman had said there are other key differences and there are. But those are important to note as well. 
   Our friends across the aisle somehow think it shreds the Constitution if we tap a terrorist in a foreign country and he calls an American. I've said it before and I'll say it again. The solution to that is not that we not tap into that known terrorist in a foreign country; it's that the friends of those concerned about this in America, tell your friends to have their terrorist buddies not call them at home. That's real easy. Then they don't have to worry about this bill. 
   But if terrorists that are known terrorists in foreign countries call them in this country, then they ought to be at risk for having them tapped. Once we know that there's somebody here, then they go get the warrant and that addresses it. But you cannot restrict it otherwise without doing great harm to our protection in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we are told that those who have refused to learn from history are destined to repeat it, and it is true. We are not learning from history. 
   I love the President, and I disagree about Iraq. But last night, the statements that came to a conclusion had an extremely faulty premise, and that premise was that the Federal Government is the only one that can properly manage these assets long enough, that has the patience. 
   That's ridiculous. We serve in this Congress. We can't even keep the same incentives in place for a year or two. 
   China, we just heard, is now telling its banks, don't loan to us. They are totalitarian, and we should be concerned about it, but they are moving toward capitalism. Let the private sector make its money and pay us tax. We are moving that way. 
   This will be the biggest socialist move in American history, and it breaks my heart that so many are thinking maybe this is all we can do. The Soviet Union lasted 70 years when they did this type of thing. 
   We won't make it that long. I beg colleagues on both sides, let's look at this and not move socialist.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we are going to miss the Honorable JERRY WELLER and do appreciate all he has done for this country, not just for the people of Illinois. 
   Well it is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to pay tribute to a constituent, a good friend, a former colleague, Judge Cynthia Stevens Kent, who will be retiring at the end of this year following 25 years of judicial service. So I wanted to make this tribute a part of the permanent Congressional Record so that people in future generations would know of this great judge. 
   Throughout her years of faithful service to the State of Texas, Judge Kent has gained the respect and admiration of friends, colleagues and especially fellow judges. Her knowledge of the law and commitment to bettering the judiciary is not just well known in east Texas but throughout the country. East Texas has been blessed to have such a wise leader. And it's truly a better place to live because of her hard work. 
   After receiving her law degree from South Texas College of Law in Houston, Judge Kent moved to Tyler, Texas, with her husband, Don. She opened her own law firm, but in 1984 she left the lucrative practice to dedicate herself to public service. For 4 years she served as judge of the Smith County Court at Law Number Two. She oversaw misdemeanor criminal cases, workers' compensation cases, substantive civil cases, condemnation cases, mental health, probate, juvenile, family law and appeals from justice of the peace and municipal courts. 
   After 4 years in that capacity, Judge Kent was successfully elected as the first woman to serve on the Texas 114th Judicial District Court serving both Smith and Wood counties. As judge of this court, she has overseen felony criminal cases, divorce and family law, juvenile, land claims, election contests, very substantive civil cases, workers' compensation, contested probate matters, and juvenile law in general. She has diligently presided over this court for the past 20 years. 
   Now throughout her career, Judge Kent has established herself as a wise, hardworking, law and order judge. There is not much question about that. She has cleared a large backlog of cases while gaining a reputation among criminal defendants as a judge you wanted to avoid. 
   Judge Kent is widely known for her strong commitment to teaching and to furthering her own legal education. During her time on the bench, she received a masters of judicial studies from the National Judicial College, and she is currently working toward candidacy for a Ph.D. She served as a faculty instructor at the National Judicial College teaching ``advanced evidence'' and ``handling capital cases.'' She has spoken and taught at countless judicial conferences, seminars and courses throughout the country, all the while dedicating herself to the east Texas community by serving as a volunteer instructor at Texas College in Tyler, Texas. 
   Judge Kent has written and co-authored numerous publications, and she has served on a variety of boards and associations. Most recently she was chosen by Governor Rick Perry to be a member of the Governor's Criminal Justice Advisory Council which is tasked with the difficult job of reviewing the criminal laws in Texas. It's undeniable that Judge Kent has distinguished herself as one of the Nation's leading judicial scholars. 
   Throughout all of the many demands of her professional career, Judge Kent has managed to raise a wonderful family with the love and support of her  husband, Don Kent. The Kents have been married for over 32 years and have three sons, Drew, Jarad and Wayne. 
   Judge Kent's dedication and commitment to God, her family, the law and to faithfully serving east Texas is evident not just from the accomplishments already mentioned, but from the admiration and kind words of almost anyone across the region. She has been a wise judge, a dependable colleague, a patient instructor and a dear friend whose leadership has been an inspiration to so very many. Whether you agreed or disagreed with her, you never wondered where she stood. ``Shy and withdrawn'' were never adjectives used in the same sentence with her name. 
   During my years as a judge, I served at the opposite end of the courthouse on the same hall, same floor. It was always such a comfort to know that as difficult questions arose on exceedingly complex and even life-and-death cases, I had a knowledgeable friend whose judgment and advice could be trusted at the other end of the hall. All it took was a walk down the hall to her office or she to mine for an insightful, methodical discussion of the law to arrive at a proper solution. I was always in awe of just how amazing she was at multitasking like no one I had ever seen. She is truly an extraordinary person. 
   Judge Kent is to be congratulated for her so many years of dedicated service, and now with retirement, she should be thanked for her committed devotion to the people of east Texas. My condolences on the other hand also have to go out to Smith County residents on the loss of such a dedicated jurist. 
   May God bless Judge Cynthia Stevens Kent and all of the work that she has done. 
   Now Madam Speaker, at this time I would like to yield such time as he may consume to my friend from Illinois, Mr. John Shimkus. We have been in a financial crisis, we're told, and my friend, John Shimkus, has been talking about something that could have avoided the whole problem. 
   And I would yield such time as he may consume.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Here we have been hearing so much about the financial crisis, and the Secretary of the Treasury has said that we need $700 billion to bail out Wall Street. He doesn't use those words. It's so ironic. We've been hearing Boone Pickens talk about $700 billion. But he has been talking about the massive transfer of wealth from the United States to countries, many of whom don't like us, where we're buying their oil, when we could be producing our own if the majority would just let us do so. 
   So when we talk about a financial crisis, and we talk about that influx of $700 billion being spent on American energy and American jobs being created, because I know you and I have talked about it before, and you haven't touched on it tonight about the effect of that $700 billion being spent on our shores in ANWR. Do you want to touch on that?

   Mr. GOHMERT. Looking at the map that the gentleman from Illinois had prepared, it is ironic to me. Like up in New England, we see the area that is off limits for drilling. Well, it is not that New Englanders are against drilling the Outer Continental Shelf. In fact, apparently they are 100 percent for it, as long as it moves up the coast just a little bit and our friends from Canada drill right off of their part of the coast. Then our friends from Canada, as the gentleman has indicated, are gracious enough to pop it back down and sell it to us. 
   Now, I don't know if those sands under the Outer Continental Shelf are such that those formations, that pool is actually draining some of our oil that they are selling back to us, or our gas and selling it back to us. But if so, that is awfully gracious of them to do so, to sell us back some of our own oil and gas. 
   Then we have people saying under no circumstances whatsoever do we ever want any drilling done less than 50 miles off our coast. Well, you look at Florida, the map that you have got there, you see Cuba, they are 90 miles from the Florida coast, which nowadays under international law most countries claim 200 miles out, except where you share an area like that, in which case you split it. 
   So now Cuba is being kind enough to other countries, whether it is Russia, China, Venezuela, to allow them to come drill within 50 miles of the Florida coast, and, who knows, maybe they will be willing to sell us back some of our own oil and gas too for an appropriate profit going to those countries. But how ironic. They say they are against it, but it is not really being against it. It is just in our little backyard area. 
   I was amazed as the gentleman was talking about the arguments that have been made for some months, and I have got to say, I thank the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Shimkus, who has been the leader on this issue and been terrific about it. John Peterson from Pennsylvania, we are going to miss him. He has been a great leader in discussing energy. 
   But as we talked about it through August, Ralph Regula came and spoke one day on the floor without the mikes and with the lights dimmed. I did not know until Mr. Regula pointed it out, he was on Resources back in 1981, and, of course, President Carter had signed an executive order. And in that order, and Ralph had that as well, he had said that the Outer Continental Shelf was such a vast great resource for energy for America, and the two words that stuck in my mind in President Carter's order was that it should be ``developed expeditiously.'' 
   Well, according to Ralph, they got lobbied in 1981 by wealthy beachfront property owners on the California coast. They didn't want to see a platform out there within their sunset. They lobbied hard and eventually they won. Okay, we will give California a moratorium on drilling off their coast. 
   According to Ralph, immediately Florida beachfront landowners, the wealthy, not the poor and the downtrodden, not the hardest working in America, but the wealthy beachfront property owners, and I am proud of them, I am glad they are able to do that, they came rushing in. Wait a minute, you gave a moratorium to the wealthy beachfront property owners in California. We need to have one in Florida. So, they lobbied hard enough, had the wherewithal, the money to do a good job lobbying, and they got a moratorium. 
   And Ralph said, he said when they gave the moratorium to California, the committee will rue the day we ever did it, because that was 27 years ago. Then Florida got theirs. Then other States started coming in and saying, you gave it to California and Florida, we ought to get one too. That is where that came from. 
   Of course, in Texas, pretty pragmatic, we heard lots of horror stories. If you put platforms out there, it will kill all the aquatic life. You will never get another shrimp or fish out of the gulf. 
   Lo and behold, we have the platforms out there. They withstood category 5 hurricanes as far as not leaking. Some of them were destroyed, but they still didn't leak. And I kind of thought it looked pretty, you know. The sun sets, and out there you start seeing lights twinkling on the horizon, it is platforms. I know I am getting energy from it, and it is a whole lot better than having tankers come along and leak. 
   I was amazed, and that came because of the discussion we had with the lights dimmed, the microphones off, and Ralph Regula giving us a little bit of history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate the input, the insights. This deals with the energy issue, but it deals with the financial crisis in America. As the gentleman alluded to, this has helped contribute to a perfect storm in America for a financial crisis. But we are not hearing people on the other side of the aisle, and we haven't heard Secretary Paulson say, you know what, that kind of infusion of wealth could really boost the country, and then you wouldn't have to worry about bailing out the greediest among us that were on Wall Street and drove some companies into the dirt. Instead, what we have heard is we have got to spend $700 billion to build this governmental entity that will start managing assets. 
   Now, I think the world of the President. I think history is going to be good to him. He is an honorable, noble man. The biggest problem he has I  think is what Jeff Foxworthy says about people that speak with a southern accent; people hear the accent and immediately deduct 50 IQ points from how smart they think you are. 
   He is much smarter than people give him credit for. But he has listened to people like Secretary Paulson and others who have told him it is all gloom or all doom, and then has come before us and he said last night only the Federal Government could be patient enough to manage these assets. 
   I immediately thought, in the Resources Committee 2 years ago, in the last Congress, we put in a biomass 
   incentive program where we would incentivize people to help create this alternative energy source. People bought into that, like we wanted them to, and they started building biomass plants. And when they are about to come on line, this Congress in the Resources Committee comes back and knocks that out. They say, no, we are not going to do that incentive program anymore. We are going to spend several million dollars to study, to see whether it is really feasible. Of course it was feasible. People relied on the government's promise that they would have an incentive, and then we yanked it out from under them. 
   So when I hear somebody say how patient the Federal Government is, we can't even keep the same tax incentives in place for 2 years so that people can take advantage of them. They know they would have trouble trusting the Federal Government. 
   Then I can also tell you as former outside counsel for the RTC and FDIC, I can't go into individual cases, but it is public knowledge and you can talk to anybody who ever dealt with the RTC or FDIC, when people knew the government owned an asset and they were needing to sell it, even if they could sit on it for a number of years, they always knew if the government owns it, we can pay less and get away with paying less than if a private entity owned it. They knew that. 
   The same way, if the government was going to buy it, they knew they should hold up the Federal Government, because eventually they would get what they want, and that is just the way it works. The private sector is the better place. 
   We have had some people who were greedy and ran these things into the ground. This Congress previously, as Congressman Frank and Senator Dodd, forced requirements on lending that caused them to make loans to people that couldn't repay them. We have had questions arise now as to potentially many of those loans may have been to illegal aliens, or, as they say in Great Britain, irregular migrants. But there is an accountability issue, and Congress has not done a good job of holding these people accountable, and that needs to start. 
   I am working on a bill, and some people are not real crazy about it, but there needs to be accountability. In the public sector, publicly traded businesses, there is a concept in contract law called the corporate veil. So if you are acting as an officer of a corporation and you commit some act of negligence, the corporation can be sued, but not pierce the corporate veil to go after the officer because he was acting on behalf of the corporation, unless you could prove he was acting outside that course and scope with the corporation. Then you might pursue him personally. 
   I would like to see if an officer makes decisions that a reasonable and prudent officer would not have made under the same or similar circumstances, and it is one of the or a proximate cause towards the demise, the bankruptcy, the insolvency of the corporation that is publicly traded, then perhaps there should be no corporate shield, and in the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy judge could look at the assets of that officer and make a determination legally, was this negligence, was it a proximate cause for the insolvency or bankruptcy, and, if so, let's bring those millions back you got from your golden parachute and put them back in the employee pension fund or to help some of the debts that you ran up before you left them high and dry. 
   There are things we can do. I am not getting a lot of traction on talking to friends on that, but, who knows? We may get them back. 
   We heard this morning that China banks have been told by their government not to make loans, one-day loans to U.S. banks, because they are concerned about their solvency. It is amazing that China would need to teach us a lesson about capitalism. 
   But I do thank my friend from Illinois. I appreciate your participation and insights into energy, because it is such a huge part of the solution to our financial crisis. So I thank you. 
   I was intrigued when a number of our Members went over to China 3 years ago. We talked to a number of CEOs about why you moved your company, why you moved your facilities, your plant, to China.     
   I figured the answer would be solely, well, it was just cheap labor. But the number one reason was that their corporate tax was half of what our corporate tax is in the United States. Then not only that, but China was willing to negotiate even lower taxes for a period of time to incentivize their coming to China. 
   Then you talk to them further, China has had some very polluted bodies of water, some of them were told if you will come and set your factory up on this body of water that's totally polluted, start using the water from that body, put it back clean, then we will cut you a better deal on corporate tax, and that it was well worth it for them to take advantage of that. So China was using corporations to help clean up their environment that they had made such a mess. 
   Having been an exchange student to the Soviet Union back in 1973, I am quite familiar with the fact that over there, any money that was paid was supposed to go into the Federal Government. That was socialism. Then everybody got a check got a check from this central government. That's how socialism worked. 
   I didn't realize, until I went to China, they don't do it that way. The Chinese do have a totalitarian government, and it's cause for great concern, but they have also noticed that in Hong Kong, and around the country, if you incentivize entrepreneurship and just take a part of that success, you make a whole lot more money than if you just make everybody bring in to the central coffers and then split it up equally. 
   That didn't work in the New Testament, when the New Testament Church tried. It ultimately resulted in the Apostle Paul saying, if you don't work, you don't eat. 
   It didn't work when the pilgrims did it. When they came to America they had a compact that they just bring into the central storehouse and then divided up equally. But then that ended up causing people, pilgrims, to notice, well, I am killing myself working here, and he is not working as hard I am, and he is getting the same amount, so they quit working. 
   I will never forget going to a collective farm, outside of Kiev, and I spoke just enough Russian back in those days when I could ask a question. I was intrigued because it was midmorning, around 10 a.m. or so, and there were a bunch of farmers sitting around in the shade. 
   I asked, you know, when do you work? Anybody that's worked on a farm back in east Texas or in west, anywhere in Texas, knows if you are going to work out there, you get up early, and you do everything you can as early as you can, because it starts getting hot. It was the same way there. I said, when do you work in Russia, and they laughed. One of the men, and I am not sure how many rubles he said, but he said, I make the same number of rubles if I am here in the shade or out there in the sun, so I am here in the shade. 
   That's why socialism doesn't work, and that's why, when we had this proposal from Secretary Paulson to have the government seize this massive amount of assets and then manage them for years and years, we could see this is the biggest step towards socialism that we could have ever imagined in this country, couldn't believe it was being proposed by our administration. 
   It's still unbelievable to me. We know the principles. As I have said before, I started making speeches in junior high and in debates in high school talking about the free market and entrepreneurship. If you set the American spirit free, it's amazing what they could do. 
   Now they want to come in and have me say that that was all a lie? I don't  believe it was a lie. I believe the government makes sure everybody has a level playing field, punish the wrongdoers, punish the evildoers, but then keep that level field available out there to play on, and then let entrepreneurship reign. 
   That's the best way to go. That's not what's proposed here, so there was a bunch of others. We had a plan that we proposed in the Republican Study Committee that would cut capital gains, cut income tax or anybody that will come in and buy these assets. 
   Boy, you think about that, we would stir up the market, get them excited about coming in and making money. It would be fantastic. We wouldn't have to create this huge bureaucracy to do that. It just comes back again to the USSR that lasted 70 years, because it was doomed to failure, couldn't stand, versus the free market. 
   You look at Ireland. I was talking to somebody from Ireland, and I understood them to say their corporate tax was 12 percent, China 17 percent, we are double that. France and Germany saw the way Ireland has become, I believe, the fourth fastest-growing country in the world, as companies are flocking in there, more jobs, better standard of living. 
   France and Germany, who had been tending towards socialism are now realizing, whoa, if we will just cut our taxes, then people will flock into here like they are into Ireland and like they have been into China to do business. 
   Now, I appreciated my friend, Mr. McCotter, pointing out that Secretary Paulson could end up with a piece of paper, he was hoping to come away from their discussions today, come out, wave a piece of paper in front of the cameras, say we have this agreement, and this means fleece in our time, because Americans taxpayers would not be well served. 
   I appreciate my time is about to expire, and I appreciate the time tonight to talk about these issues, but there has got to be accountability. I believe you will have full cooperation in making people fully accountable on both sides of the aisle, but let's don't turn $700 billion of the economy over to the government. Let's incentivize good conduct. Let's incentivize the free market at work because socialism doesn't. 
   I yield back and appreciate this opportunity.

I take off my hat and hair in tribute to the Louisiana State University Tigers and also to the relationship that Texas and Louisiana have shared. Through the years, Louisiana has helped Texas. After Katrina, Texans were proud to assist Louisiana. When we heard that Louisiana State University needed a quarterback, then my hometown, Tyler, Texas, was proud to yield one of its best, Matt Flynn, to LSU to help them in their time of need. 
   I watched Matt Flynn play high school football 4 years there at Robert E. Lee High School in Tyler, and we are so proud of Matt. He comes from good lineage. His dad, Alvin Flynn, played quarterback for Baylor University. His mother was the director for many years of the Tyler Junior College Apache Belles and took them to national fame. And Alvin did take a lot of Flak because his son didn't follow his footsteps and play quarterback at Baylor University, but such is the nature of Texans and East Texans. When they see someone in need, as they saw LSU, it was their heart-rending desire to help them and to send them our best, Matt Flynn. 
   So congratulations to LSU. We're proud of Matt Flynn, and we're proud of what the Tigers did in making actually the whole Nation proud.

   It seems like it would be inappropriate to bring up legislation that we are going to have a hearing on today, hate crimes. The hate crimes bill we take up will say we should protect more those with gender identity issues, with homosexuality issues, things like that, than college students, because the message of the bill is this: the hate crimes legislation says the majority of the Congress says that if you are going to hurt someone, if you are going to shoot them, brutalize them, please, make it a random, senseless act of violence like in Virginia. Don't hate them while you're hurting them. 
   That is a ridiculous message to send with legislation and I hope we will rethink it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, some of our Democratic leaders say they just cannot agree to give immunity to the telecommunication companies for helping after 9/11. Perhaps the reluctance comes from massive contributions from law firms suing these patriotic companies. 
   Back in the days immediately after 9/11, we didn't know who all was involved in the most violent attack on U.S. soil. We didn't know if another attack was coming the next day or where or who would strike next. In that context, the telecommunications companies were asked to help their country, and they responded. Just as we had men and women respond all over this country to the Nation's call to help fight the forces of evil, these companies responded by helping, and now many in the majority are letting them be shot by friendly fire. These countries heard the cry for help from our Nation and responded, yet some in this body want to hang them out to dry on a firing line as targets for some of their biggest contributors. Let's pass FISA, with immunity from friendly fire.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (ESTABLISHING MARCH 2008 AS NATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE MONTH -- (House of Representatives - April 01, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate Mr. Conyers, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for whom I have great respect. This bill was on the calendar to take up in weeks past, but it was pulled a number of times, resulting in it being taken up at this time. We are grateful that it has been allowed to come to the floor. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 945, and I want to commend my good friend and fellow Texan, and also fellow recovering judge, TED POE, the original sponsor of this legislation, for his dedication and commitment to the issue of criminal justice. 
   The goal of this resolution is to raise awareness and promote education of the criminal justice system by establishing March as the National Criminal Justice Month. It is important that Congress encourages Americans to learn more about the criminal justice system, and the approximately 3 million Americans who work within the system. 
   As a former prosecutor, judge and chief justice, I have been honored to be involved with some of our Nation's best who work in the criminal justice system for some time. Throughout that experience, I have been consistently impressed with the professionalism and the ability of the public servants who work in the field of criminal justice. These brave and dedicated Americans work every day to make our country safe for ourselves and for our families. 
   Further, it is important to recognize the gains that have been made in combating crime across the Nation. Crime rates began dropping within the last 20 years as more tools were given to law enforcement and the more dangerous criminals have been locked up for longer periods of time, though there are some who are working to reverse that decade-long trend. 
   I have great respect, as I said, for the Judiciary Committee chairman, who mentioned the reference to this being called a prison nation; and it is tragic that we have so many people who are locked up. I must say that one of the things that concerned me and drove me from the bench were having an increasing number of people who ended up in the criminal justice system before me as a district judge, having allegedly committed felonies, and in the cases I  am talking about where they admitted them, told about their background, had testimony about it in court, but it began to break my heart. 
   Back in the 1960s, we had legislation called The Great Society legislation that was well intentioned. There were single mothers that were seen to be trying to survive with only a deadbeat father to help. And the Federal Government looked, saw the need and said let's help these people. They began giving checks to women for each child born out of wedlock. And I began having more and more young mothers, some older mothers, who would have a child out of wedlock, many times encouraged to do so by people they respected and loved, and they found out rather quickly that check will not allow the individual to live a decent living and take care of the child. So they would have another child, thinking that two checks would help, and then three. 
   It broke my heart that our Federal Government had lured people into a rut and not given them a way out. So it is important that we be careful in considering legislation that we pass. Of course, everybody has to be responsible for their own actions, but the legislation we pass is important, and I think it is wonderful that my friend, Mr. Poe, has sponsored this legislation, and that our chairman, Mr. Conyers, has encouraged this and supported it, in establishing March as the National Criminal Justice Month. 
   Congress will provide an opportunity now to educate Americans through this designation about the criminal justice system, and will make Americans more aware of causes and consequences of crime, as well as how to prevent crime and how to respond to crime. This resolution will also recognize and applaud the efforts of law enforcement officials, judges, court staff, and the many probation and parole officers who work with offenders to help them reintegrate into the community. Those are all important positions. We appreciate them all. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (COMMENDING DAVID RAY RITCHESON AND RECOGNIZING HIS EFFORTS IN PROMOTING FEDERAL LEGISLATION TO COMBAT HATE CRIMES -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to pay tribute to David Ray Ritcheson, having met him, talked with him, and heard his testimony at the Judiciary Committee. 
   David Ray Ritcheson was truly a brave young man who had a horrible act committed against him. His early departure from this life made his story all the more tragic. The crime committed against him earlier in his life is one that should not be tolerated under any circumstances. The applicable State law dealt with that crime in such a way that I understand the main perpetrators received life and 90 years as sentences. 
   On hearing the sad testimony by David at our hearing, everyone was moved with a sense of outrage. Yet, on closer examination of what the majority was trying to do, it caused me to ask if there was anything in this hate crimes bill that would have changed anything about David's terrible situation. After all, the hate crimes bill has no sentence higher than life. It's not a capital situation.     
   The answer was, and is, that there is nothing in the bill that would have really made any substantive difference in David's situation. 
   It is also tragic that any acquaintances of David who did not know the details of the brutality against him before apparently came to know about it through his courage and the national attention focused on him and the display of courage at our hearing. That is further testimony itself to his courage. But the ridicule at home that followed his testimony is also tragic. It is sad that he chose to end that life of such incredible potential. 
   David's earlier display of courage and the unfairness and outrage he faced deserve attention. He deserves a heartfelt salute. His family has our thoughts and prayers with them, especially in this loss of such a beautiful soul with so much potential. 
   But the bill being touted in this resolution does not bring us together. It divides us by saying that some people in this country are more important to protect than others. It divides by saying, for example, that those tragically killed at Virginia Tech are not as important to protect as a transvestite with gender identity issues. The bill further seeks to squelch religious teaching about immorality. 
   I stand here on the floor today to salute David Ray Ritcheson, an incredible young man. I want with all my heart to vote for a resolution to pay him proper tribute as well. But, unfortunately, I cannot vote for a resolution that, since it includes a pursuit and an adulation of the hate crimes bill, I cannot see the use of this tragedy to vote to give accolades to a bill that I think harms America and divides us. 
   If there is a recorded vote, I will vote ``present'' out of my incredible respect for David Ritcheson. But my ``present'' vote will also avoid the hypocrisy of my saying I support the hate crimes bill when I believe it harms the country, it harms religious teaching, and it would not undo what was done to David. 
   I look forward to any opportunity to do anything to pay tribute to David Ritcheson standing on its own.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to my friend across the aisle, the idea of assisting with counseling for anyone who has been through something so traumatic as what David Ritcheson experienced is a good idea. I would support a measure of that order. 
   Matthew Shepard was mentioned, as was James Byrd. Of course, most of us are familiar with those situations. Mr. Byrd was attacked because he was an African American. He was brutally drug behind a vehicle. And if I had my way and could put into law the law I would like to address that, it would be to allow the family of the victim to choose the terrain over which to drag the defendants, if they were convicted, and the rope by which to drag them. But, again, capital punishment was not an issue in this hate crimes bill. 
   Mr. Byrd's perpetrators, two received the death penalty, as I recall, and one received a life sentence, and that was State resources without the assistance of the Federal Government. With Matthew Shepard, I believe there were two life sentences in those cases, which would further not have been enhanced. 
   But I look forward to the day, as Martin Luther King said, when we are judged by the content of our character, not the color of our skin, and I would submit not by any other factors over which we have no control. 
   When it comes to a hate crime bill, we ought not to be dividing. A transvestite deserves protection. David Ritcheson, my goodness, deserved protection. We should work together to bring this Nation together, not divide it by saying some people deserve more protection than others. 
   Again, I think the idea of counseling, it might have served David well because, goodness knows, he had been through a great deal of trauma. Perhaps that would have assisted him in not bringing a permanent end to a temporary problem, which made it all the more tragic. 
   So I would welcome the opportunity, if something in the form of legislation along those lines were to arise, in working with my colleagues on the other side.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (CAMPAIGN EXPENDITURE TRANSPARENCY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The majority says they want to end the culture of corruption. There has been both the appearance of impropriety here in Congress and, in some cases, actual impropriety. These improprieties, despite any demagoguery, know no party bounds. 
   But the big elephant in the room that no one wants to talk about, in recent years, has involved other issues, issues like spouses going to work for major companies who have large government contracts and benefit from having an employee in the lawmaker's home. Does the Democratic majority seek to end this problem with this bill? No, they don't. That might step on important toes. 
   Another major problem that is not transparent is spouses themselves who lobby. Does the Democratic majority seek to end or regulate that by this bill? The answer is, no, they do not. That might step on too many important toes here in Washington. 
   So who will be affected by this bill in which the Democratic majority avoided any hearings to gather evidence and thereby prevented any opportunity for people like me to come forward with evidence and move toward this lack of transparency in this back-room process to shove it down our throats here on the floor? 
   It is said that they want to stop officeholders from enriching themselves or their families. I am one of those who would be affected, and it may be helpful to know exactly what kind of an effect it will have. 
   My story is this: While practicing law in Tyler, Texas, it became apparent that we had a major problem in one of our highest-level trial courts. I tried for months to find someone with the  experience and qualifications who would step up and run against this incumbent Republican. 
   I could not find anybody, since people said, well, he was the first Republican elected in our county, so let's just let him stay. No one is owed a public office. 
   I was reluctant to take a pay cut and go to work at the courthouse, but in November of 1991, having found no one at that point who was willing to step up, my wife and I decided that that was our lot in life, for me to bring in less money, but help by making our community a better place in which to live. There was a tremendous backlog of felony cases in which the defendants were out on bond and had not gone to trial. 
   I got elected. Though the backlog was staggering, and new cases continued to pour in in record numbers, within 10 years I had helped, and with the good help of a good district attorney, we moved and reduced the number of pending cases, trying cases, record numbers, moving cases. We reduced the number of backlog cases by 80 percent or more. 
   Some years later one of my daughters said, while I was still on the bench, ``Daddy, we have to watch our spending, and you could make a lot more money. Why don't you?'' I said, ``Sweetheart, if I have not taught you that there are some things more important than money, then I have failed.'' She said, ``I know, but it would be nice to have some big money come in from time to time anyway.'' 
   My wife and I felt our best contribution that we could make to our community, our State and our country was for me to be a judge, and that's what we did. After years on the bench, it became clear that we desperately needed some legislative changes, and I believed it a constitutional violation to legislate from the bench. 
   When a term to which I was appointed to finish as chief justice of an appellate court expired, I had to decide whether or not to stay on the bench in a justice role or wait and potentially run for Congress. Again, my wife, my partner, and I made the joint decision to step out in faith, not take a sure job, and potentially run for Congress. 
   After leaving the bench, I successfully completed the ruling training and testing to become a recognized international arbitrator as well as a mediator, and was told I had the potential of making in a month what a Congressman makes in a year. But this country needed help, and it seemed to my wife and me, after much consideration, consultation and prayer, that this was a place, once again, where I could help.     
   My wife Kathy has an MBA in accounting, had done excellent accounting work and had done so before she was invited to substitute at a high school for students with problems. She loved, as she said: ``Seeing the light come on in these young people,'' and she taught there for years before I began to run for Congress. 
   She gave up her teaching job and worked for months without pay toward our goal. She is an incredible organizer and the most trusted friend I could have. We had the same goals of making this a better country. She knows our district; my supporters know her and love her and trust her. She makes constant appearances for me when I can't be there because of conflicts here in the District. She is invaluable to my reelection and works tirelessly, including in the evenings, when the day's appearances do not allow her to do her job then. 
   As far as my family situation, we have one daughter who graduated in May from college and two more to go. 
   The laws are such now that you really have to have at least one campaign employee even in nonelection years, and that hardworking confidante has been my wife. We began to pay her what she could make teaching, and it was completely transparent. Everything, as both sides know, has to be filed, and the public knows we are a campaign team with full transparency because of existing laws requiring transparency by campaigns. She gets paid much less than she could in business and has been offered more money in another job, and that is also why this has been a mutual sacrifice. 
   One other thing: when we committed to make this run for Congress in 2003, which we knew would be over a 1 1/2 -year process, we gave all the energy, all the effort, all the work. We truly pledged, as was put in the Declaration of Independence, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. 
   Because I was running and could not provide the money production I had been before being a judge, my wife and I struggled with the decision, and ultimately decided to cash out my judicial retirement as well as her teacher retirement to live on while we pursued this dream of making America better. 
   As most of America does not know but Members of Congress here do know, there is no great big fat cat retirement for Members of Congress, despite the e-mails people may read at this time unless someone has been here for many years. And, yes, Mr. Speaker, America should know that we are all enrolled in Social Security here in Congress. It may have not always been true, but it is now. 
   An article recently indicated that, according to financial disclosure reports, I am the poorest Texan in Congress. As one other Texas Member of Congress said just a couple of weeks ago when he heard my wife and I both cashed out our hard-earned retirements to make a run for Congress, he said, Wow, you really did come here for all the right reasons. And I would certainly like to think so. 
   But if this bill becomes law, there will be no rich Members of Congress reined in, no blatant abuses will be ended. None of the people who have gotten enormously wealthy while in public office will feel any pinch at all. If this bill becomes law, I will now have to fire my comparatively low paid but imminently trusted and qualified, actually overqualified, and currently only campaign employee despite the complete transparency and financial disclosures that are currently required. This bill doesn't drain the swamp, as has been represented, but protects the big swamp while adding another hurdle for anyone who does not have wealth to get here. 
   In this job, it is important to have a spouse who can make campaign appearances when necessary or helpful. A couple in which both need to work to put kids through college will have more difficulty in getting elected, because you can't afford to have one or both not work still make appearances and put kids through school. 
   My wife, as said earlier, works long and late, often at home at night to fulfill the requirements of a job which keeps getting more and more difficult because of the burdens placed by this body in an effort to look like we are reining in corruption. This bill does show, though it does not affect anything that is already transparent, it does show when it comes to doing something meaningful to end this corruption, the majority is going to look the other way and not talk about the elephant in the room. 
   This bill, as I say, will not affect the major problems in Congress; but if it were to become law, it will end a beautiful partnership. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. And I do appreciate the comments that have been made from my friend from California. And I would agree. I was not aware that anyone had ever been paid commissions or a spouse or a Member of Congress had ever been paid commissions. That's entirely inappropriate. And I would agree on any measure that would go forward on that basis, making such a process inappropriate. 
   I do find it troublesome that, at the same time, we want to demonize paying somebody less than what would be the going market value for services for the most overqualified person and the most trusted person to do that job. 
   I always appreciate allusions to my home State of Texas, but Texas does have a lot of things that I think would be good for us to adopt here. They're only in session 180 days every other year. That may be something else we want to look at doing in following Texas. 
   But also, in Texas, the campaign laws do not necessitate, as I believe the Washington, the Federal laws do, a full-time, every-year campaign office. 
   Mr. McCarthy, though, I would point out, never said anything about speed. His objection, and one of my objections, is about process. We were promised the most open government in history when the Democratic majority took over. That was something to which I was looking forward to, even though we were not going to be in the majority, and so far this is yet one other straw on the camel's back that indicates that's just not going to happen. 
   But let's face it. There are problems with improprieties in Congress, but there are so many requirements with campaigns regarding transparency that if someone is actually working there and making an appropriate wage, that appears to me to be about the most transparent thing a candidate and a spouse can do. It's nothing behind the scenes, there's no behind-the-scenes lobbying. There's no in-home lobbying. There's nothing of that nature. You have a partnership, and I think that can be a good thing, although I agree if there are abuses, as the gentleman pointed out, those should be addressed. 
   So, in any event, I know that my friend Mr. Schiff and my friend Mr. Castle are both honorable men, and we disagree on what should be done on this bill. But I came forward today because I just could not simply get on the rah-rah bandwagon that I felt like many people would be getting just to make it look like they wanted to end improprieties, when really what this is dealing with is something to say there's something being done about ethics. The bottom line is that the elephant's still sitting in this Chamber, big as ever, getting bigger, and so far that elephant has not been addressed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I'm not sure that I would say that the financial pressures we're holding off in the State legislature in Texas is greater. They have a great deal more flexibility in many ways. 
   But the gentleman, as I understood to say, indicated there's no way to know when a campaign is paying family. And we just had to file financial disclosures. I had to list the sources of income for my wife. And as I understand it, there's also, you would, even if your children or other immediate family members have different names, I can see if there's something that's not required for disclosure in that financial disclosure form that we could have legislation and make that so that it heightens the transparency. 
   What I disagree with is the overall ban on allowing two people who sacrifice their lives, their fortunes, their sacred honor to be able to work together full time to continue to run for office. And there apparently are areas that need to be addressed, that need to be considered. But I come back to the fact that apparently the reason this seems to be rushed into the room is because people more powerful would say, we'll do the little things that may make people feel like we're doing something, but we're not going to address the big issues that really are hurting this body. 
   But anyway, there are some things that apparently do need addressing. I'm all for transparency. I think sunlight is truly the best disinfectant. But since this bill goes much further than that, then I do urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it seems like not that long ago, but it was a year or so ago, we heard repeatedly: We're losing in Iraq. We're losing in Iraq. We've got to have a policy change. We're losing in Iraq. We've got to have a policy change. And we got a policy change. 
   It's kind of refreshing to hear so many say we're winning, and a little bit surprising to hear we're winning, so we need a policy change. We're winning, so we need a policy change? We know if we pull out too quickly, we don't leave a stable area. 
   Hearing comments earlier about somebody won't listen to anyone else; they get no input. I thought they were talking about the Democratic majority. Just today on FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, I'm told at 1:30 that we've got to have amendments in by 4 o'clock on a bill that we weren't even allowed to see. You want input? Let's start it right here on the floor. 
   I heard comments about Vietnam mistakes. The biggest mistake that history teaches us about Vietnam was that it was micromanaged from Washington. If you want documentation, go to Sam Johnson's book. After the carpet bombing finally took place and we went after and took it to them, the bombing stopped, we gave away the farm at Paris, and as the prisoners left the Hanoi Hilton, one of the leaders said, ``You know, you Americans are so foolish. If you'd have kept it up another week, we would have had to unconditionally surrender.'' But we were micromanaged from Washington. 
   We show the greatest reverence for those who have given their last full measure of devotion not by pulling out before we leave a stable area, but by seeing that we finish the job and leave a stable area so they will not have died in vain. 
   I leave with a comment of Travis Buford's mother as we stood there by his casket in Nacogdoches, Texas at the funeral home earlier this year. I said to his mother as we stood near his coffin, ``Is there anything I can do?'' She gritted her teeth and she said, ``Go back and tell the Congress to shut up and let the military finish their job.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there's great concern all over the Nation for those who follow what is going on in our financial institutions. That concern is entirely appropriate. 
   There's great anxiety all over the Nation by hardworking men and women who do not know how they're going to be able to continue to pay the soaring energy costs for both their vehicles and their homes. 
   Yet, still, the Congressional leadership continues to refuse to put a piece of legislation on the floor for a vote that could immediately send us well on our way to energy independence by allowing us to produce that with which this Nation has been so blessed. 
   There's much anger over the disgusting immorality of corporate executives who padded their own pockets with millions of dollars by creative bookkeeping and representations that mortgage securities had value that they did not actually have. 
   There's incredulity in America over Members of Congress who have spent years decrying the culture of corruption, only to have information come out raising questions about failures to pay proper taxes under the income tax laws that may have been written by such person. 
   There's incredulity that the FBI might find cold hard cash secreted in a freezer 3 years ago, causing people to wonder why nothing has happened. 
   There's amazement from those who have bothered to notice that last year a vote could be lost by the Democratic majority, fair and square, then the rules be changed to allow a different outcome. 
   There's astonishment among those who have bothered to notice that the majority leadership could continue to advertise on-line that this would be the most open Congress in history, with complete use of the committee process, and each bill being subjected to full amendment opportunities and across-the-board input, yet, we continue to have the most closed and dictatorial Congress in memory. 
   While people in America were being overwhelmed by killer gasoline prices and home energy costs, the United States Congress took 5 weeks off. When over 100 Members of Congress played by the rules and signed up in a timely manner to speak for 5 minutes on the last day of our session in July, before the 5-week recess, the majority party used that majority, yet again, to cram down an abrupt adjournment on us to prevent our speaking with the microphones on. Yet, we spoke with the microphones off anyway. 
   When points of order have been raised regarding rules violations or alleged ethical malfeasance, the majority has used their power to table legitimate objections to prevent the violations from being corrected and from even being called violations. They've even gone so far as to have the transcript of the proceedings in this Chamber changed to cover up the inappropriate behavior and rulings from the day before, but the video certainly revealed the truth. 
   I simply could not and still struggle to understand how this body could go so far off course. When we find that our Nation has been brought to the brink of financial failure, there was fear with wailing and gnashing of teeth. 
   But we find that in 2002 and 2003, when the Bush administration was pushing for and demanding reforms of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just to try to avoid this type financial disaster that they foresaw, the efforts at reform were blocked by people against whom allegations have now arisen in the Senate who were reported to have gotten sweetheart deals from the financial industry. The foresight of such potential problem is to the Bush Administration's credit. But the failure to continue to beat the drum, warning that something was amiss does fall at the feet of the administration and Members on both sides of Congress. 
   There's one word that can prevent the destruction of our little experiment in democracy, as some of our forefathers referred to it, that could also prevent the destruction of a family, of a company, of a society or of a government or a Nation, and that word is accountability. 
   When Adam and Eve were convinced there was no accountability, they fell from grace. 
   When the only man mentioned in the Bible who was said to have a heart after God's own actually had no earthly accountability, King David himself committed atrocious wrongs. 
   When people are convinced that there is no accountability for sexual relations outside marriage, and there turns out to be consequences of a pregnancy, some think it would be punishment to allow a child to be born alive. 
   When the highest officers in a company think they can raid the retirement funds of their longstanding employees and be mega-wealthy, with no one to whom to account, they raid whatever is in the company as if it were their own. 
   Some corporate leaders allow workers to come into this country illegally, just so the owners can pocket a little more profit, despite the fact that it diminishes the society and Nation from following the rule of law and for being a Nation of laws. 
   And though these same people can't see it coming, history makes very clear that such violations of the rules of law will destroy a Nation and society. It makes this Nation appear, at times, to be a corrupt Third World Nation where the law just does not mean much. 
   When a society believes that if it feels good, do it, and there is no accountability, society ceases and an animal kingdom full of the basest instincts of animals takes over. 
   When Members of Congress think that they're too big and important to ever be accountable, they display hubris or arrogance and engage in tawdry financial dealing with the taxpayers' money. When people in government begin to feel that there is no accountability for them, they will allow massive overspending that the country cannot afford. They will create monuments to themselves with other people's money. They will allow the vast national wealth to be sent to other countries that do not like us very much, just so the energy does not have to be produced in the backyard of the selfish. 
   In 1995, the House and Senate both passed a bill that would bring about drilling in what Jimmy Carter, as President, designated for drilling, because there is no wildlife there. It's a perfect place for drilling. And that is in the coastal area where there are billions of barrels of oil. But President Clinton vetoed the bill. 
   In the last Congress, we passed a bill to provide for drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf, but the Democrats blocked it from getting the required 60 votes to allow cloture in the Senate, so there was no vote up or down on the bill itself in the Senate, and it died there; while our country was dying. 
   Here our country is in a terribly difficult time with these extremely high energy rates, and our Democratic leadership still supports sending $700 billion a year to nations, many of whom do not like us. If that $700 billion sends familiar, it's because it's also the amount that Secretary Paulson says that we need at this time to save the mortgage and financial system. 
   Congressman JOE BARTON proposed that, in this time of financial crisis, why not open up ANWR out of necessity? Why not open up the Outer Continental Shelf and use the billions of dollars that will come from that to help  mitigate the expense of financial crisis here? 
   What a great idea. But the majority leadership does not see that this Nation will have an accountable judgment day where we will be accountable for what we did not do to use the blessings that we have here in this Nation of tremendous amounts of energy. 
   So what will it take to get people here to see that you cannot spend unabatedly, and you cannot send money overseas with reckless abandon without an accountability, a judgment day coming? 
   There will indeed be a high price to pay. As Chuck Colson once said, you cannot have the morals of Woodstock and not have the current problems. If you do have people whose world view is that if it feels good you should just do it then, as Chuck Colson says, you're going to have Columbines. 
   When the message of a majority of those serving in Congress is that we will only follow the rules when it is convenient, then the message to the world is that we will not be bound by the rule of law, as we will change it whenever we want to suit us as we please.     
   When our Nation's children see the adults sending such a clear message by their conduct, and the rules don't apply to us if we don't want them to, according to the majority, then you can expect the Nation's children to soon follow suit. That leads us to Enrons among the adults, the Fannie Mae fiascoes among the adults. And from our children, you begin to see wayward kids thinking maybe it will feel good to shoot people, so let's see. 
   Well, if there's a higher power, there's a reason for accountability. If there is no higher power, then there is no reason to worry about our accountability. You can get away with all you want in this life with no adverse consequences at all. For those who think there is no ultimate accountability, no ultimate judgment of the universe, I would point you to the discussion C.S. Lewis had in his book ``Mere Christianity.'' 
   He had said that when he was an atheist, he used to love to tweak Christians by saying, ``Why don't you just admit that there cannot be a just God over the universe when there is so much injustice in the world?'' And no matter what the Christian would say, he would come back and say, ``Yes, yes, yes. That's all well and good. But wouldn't it be easier just to admit there cannot be a just God over the universe when there is so much injustice in this world?'' 
   Eventually, it hit him like a ton of bricks. How could he say--and who was he to say--that there was injustice unless there is some absolute, unwavering outside source of right and wrong? If there were not such a universal source of right and wrong that is written on the hearts of people, then how could anyone ever know or say that there was injustice in the world? You couldn't know. 
   Once you come to grips with the fact that there is a universal source of right or wrong in the world, then you have to come to grips with the fact that there must be a good God that made it so, and there will be accountability some day. Therefore, no one will ultimately be above the law. 
   Now, not everyone sees everything exactly the same, of course. C.S. Lewis noted that that just because some can sing closer to the notes printed on a page doesn't mean the music doesn't exist. It just means some do a better job of hitting closer to what the exact and appropriate note is. 
   There is right and wrong in the world, and most people innately know that. But they rationalize--and we find it all across the House and in Congress--people rationalize that it is more fun to say there is no God, perhaps no Creator so they don't have to feel guilty or consider that some day someone will judge them. 
   So long as we recognize, as our founders did, that there is a Creator who has endowed us with unalienable rights, then we should recognize that we have a duty to protect those rights for the sake of ourselves and those that follow. Perhaps that is why there is such an effort underway to sterilize and remove God or any reference to Him from all public buildings and documents these days. 
   If we keep mentioning God, as the founders of this Nation did constantly, then it reminds us that we will some day be accountable even if we get away with things today. 
   People do not like to feel guilty so they want to strike God out of everything. For example, as our society progressed to the point that we were too smart, too elusive to be accountable to God, we had our first national memorial in 2003 open that does not anywhere in it mention the word ``God.'' First memorial to do that. That was the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial. In all of those acres at the expansive memorial, there is no mention of God, Creator, Providence, Holy Trinity, Holy Spirit, Lord, all of these different names that were in our founding documents. They're still found throughout our documents, if anyone cares to look. 
   Nor is there any mention of the Latin words that are found in our official great seal that's on the back of every dollar bill. If you don't believe it, pull it out and look. Those Latin words are ``Annuit Coeptis,'' meaning He, God, has smiled on our undertaking. 
   Those words are also found around the Capitol and in the Senate Chamber and in the congressional prayer chapel. 
   Franklin D. Roosevelt was a leader of this Nation who believed strongly in accountability and that there was a God before whom that would happen. 
   On June 6, 1944, D-day, President Roosevelt went on national radio and did an amazing thing as President: he led the Nation in prayer. And I would like to just read that for you at this time. 
   And for those that may look in, Mr. Speaker, they will be able to know from the poster, this is President Franklin D. Roosevelt's prayer during his radio broadcast to the Nation on June 6. Here is that prayer as I read it verbatim as President Franklin Roosevelt gave it. 
   And understand, as President Roosevelt prayed this prayer, our soldiers were dying fighting valiantly during D-day trying to save the world and make it safer for democracy. This was his prayer: 
   ``My fellow Americans: 
   ``Last night when I spoke with you about the fall of Rome, I knew at this moment that troops of the United States and our allies were crossing the Channel in another and greater operation. It has come to pass with success thus far. And so in this poignant hour, I ask you to join me in prayer.'' 
   President Roosevelt went on, ``Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free a suffering humanity. 
   ``Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness to their faith. 
   ``They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and hard. For the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. Successes may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the righteousness of our cause, our sons will triumph. 
   ``They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the violences of war. 
   ``For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice arise, and tolerance and goodwill among all Thy people. They yearn but for the end of battle, but their return to the haven of home. 
   ``Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive them. Thy heroic servants, into Thy Kingdom. 
   ``And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas, whose thoughts and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to rededicate ourselves for renewed faith in Thee in this time of great sacrifice. 
   ``Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the desire is great, I ask that our people vote themselves into a continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, invoking Thy help to our efforts. 
   ``Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks to redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the material support of our Armed Forces. 
   ``And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our sons, wherever they may be. 
   ``And, O Lord, give us faith. Give us faith in Thee; faith in our sons; faith in each other; faith in our united crusade. Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but fleeting moment--let not these deter us in our unconquerable purpose. 
   ``With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and racial arrogances. Lead us to the saving of our country, and with our sister nations into a world unity that will spell a sure peace--a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, reaping the just rewards of their honest toil. 
   ``Thy will be done, Almighty God. 
   ``Amen.'' 
   That was a prayer of our President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
   Now, in the 1950s, senator majority leader Lyndon Johnson was sick of having churches harp on him over alleged immortality, so he fixed them. He added a provision to the charitable institution laws that governed churches that says in fact you could not maintain your charitable tax-free status if you got involved in politics. That dramatically changed the Nation that had been known from our beginning. 
   There again, majority leader Johnson's efforts were an attempt to prevent judgment for what was alleged as improper conduct. No one enjoys accountability. But to have a free Nation, a just Nation, a prosperous Nation, and a blessed Nation, there must be accountability. 
   Then in 1962, an unaccountable Supreme Court that begins every single session with a prayer that God will save that honorable court, they changed nearly 200 years of precedence by ruling there could be no prayer in schools. 
   As mentioned in 2003, the first national memorial opened as the FDR Memorial that never mentioned God. In 2004, the second memorial in United States history opened that did not mention God anywhere either. That was the World War II Memorial. 
   Understand, these are both beautiful memorials. They're just Godless, yet their subjects were certainly not. 
   Amazingly, the park service had quotes from Eisenhower and Roosevelt in the World War II Memorial that had to be cut right at the right place so their quotes would not mention ``God'' or ``Almighty God'' as those two gentlemen and great leaders did. 
   I have a Bible here. My aunt says my uncle, my late uncle, got when he entered World War II. On the front, it says--it has got a metal cover--``May the Lord be with you.'' He said he was issued this as he went into the Army. 
   Right inside the fly leaf there's a message. It says, ``The White House, Washington. As Commander in Chief, I take pleasure in commending the reading of the Bible to all who serve in the Armed Forces of the United States. Throughout the centuries, men of many faiths and diverse origins have found in the sacred books words of wisdom, counsel, and inspiration. It is a fountain of strength. And now as always, an aid in attaining the highest aspirations of the human soul.'' 
   Signed Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
   They used to issue these to people going into the service. 
   Let me read to you the speech that was given on the floor of the United States Senate by Senator ROBERT BYRD on June 27, 1962, which is the day or two after the Supreme Court ruled there would be no public prayer in school. 
   I'm reading it as Senator Byrd's speech appeared in the CONGRESSIONAL Record. 
   And Mr. Speaker, I've got a chart here that says it's Senator ROBERT BYRD's speech on the Senate floor, June 27, 1962. 
   And this is what he said. Senator Byrd, 1962: 
   ``In as much as our greatest leaders have shown no doubt about God's proper place in the American birthright, can we, in our day, dare do less? 
   ``In no other place in the United States are there so many, and such varied official evidences of deep and abiding faith on God in the part of Government as there are in Washington. 
   ``Every session in the House and Senate begins with prayer. Each House has its own chaplain. 
   ``The Eighty-Third Congress set aside a small room in the Capitol, just off the rotunda for the private prayer meditation of Congress. The room is always open when Congress is in session, but it is not open to the public. The room's focal point is a stained glass window showing George Washington kneeling in prayer. Behind him is etched these words from Psalm 16:1 `Preserve me, O God, for in Thee do I put my trust.' 
   ``Inside the rotunda is a picture of the Pilgrims about to embark from Holland on the sister ship of the Mayflower, the Speedwell. The ship's revered Chaplain Brewster, who later joined the Mayflower, has open on his lap the Bible. Very clear are the words, `The New Testament according to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.' ''     
   On the sail is the motto of the Pilgrims, ``In God We Trust, God With Us.'' 
   The phrase, ``In God We Trust,'' appears opposite the President of the Senate, who is the Vice President of the United States. The same phrase, in large words inscribed in the marble, backdrops the Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   Above the head of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are the Ten Commandments, with the great American eagle protecting them. Moses is included among the great lawgivers in Herman A. MacNeil's marble structure group on the east front. The crier who opens each session closes with the words, ``God save the United States and this honorable Court.'' 
   Engraved on the metal on the top of the Washington Monument are the words: ``Praise be to God.'' Actually, parenthetically, the words are Laos Deo, Latin, meaning ``Praise be to God,'' and actually, again parenthetically, that was put on the east side of the top of the Washington Monument for a purpose. Because those, so many decades, years ago, wanted it such that when the sun touched the Nation's capital, Washington, D.C., the first thing that the sun would touch would be the Latin words, Laos Deo, ``Praise be to God.'' Interesting. 
   Lining the walls of the stairwell are such Biblical phrases as ``Search the Scriptures,'' ``Holiness to the Lord,'' ``Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.'' 
   Numerous quotations from scripture can be found within the Library of Congress' walls. One reminds each American of his responsibility to his Maker: ``What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly and love mercy and walk humbly with thy God,'' Micah 6:8. 
   Another in the lawmaker's library preserves the Psalmist's acknowledgement that all nature reflects the order and beauty of the Creator, ``The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork,'' Psalm 19:1. And still another reference, ``The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not,'' John 1:5. 
   Millions have stood at the Lincoln Memorial and gazed up at the statue of the great Abraham Lincoln. The sculptor who chiseled the features of Lincoln in granite all but seems to make Lincoln speak his own words inscribed into the walls. 
   He said, ``That this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.'' 
   At the opposite end, on the north wall, his Second Inaugural Address alludes to ``God,'' the ``Bible,'' ``providence,'' ``the Almighty,'' and ``divine attributes.'' 
   It then continues: As was said 3000 years ago, so it still must be said, ``The judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'' 
   On the south banks of Washington's Tidal Basin, Thomas Jefferson still speaks: ``God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a Nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God? Indeed I tremble for my country  when I reflect that God is just, that his justice cannot sleep forever.'' 
   These words of Jefferson are a forceful and explicit warning that to remove God from this country will destroy it. 
   Those are the words of Senator ROBERT BYRD back in 1962. 
   We have a visitor's center, the Capitol Visitor's Center, CVC for short. It cost over $621 million. It is slated to open December 2 of this year. So far, it had been completely sterilized of any mention of God in any form. It was not until over 100 Members of Congress sent a letter and followed up repeatedly with more concern that we finally got a concession this past week that ``In God We Trust'' would be put above the mock-up of the Speaker's rostrum area there in the visitor's center, because what had been there before was a fraud and a deception and attempted to represent that there was no ``In God We Trust'' above our Speaker's head. 
   There will also be accountability someday for this majority leadership playing so fast and loose with the rules. When rules and laws don't matter, then we lose this blessed country that was founded as a Nation of laws, because people are not perfect. People need rules. We need accountability. That means that the majority leadership, if they play by the rules, they're going to lose a vote every now and then, and that's okay. Don't break the rules just to keep from losing a vote. The rule itself is too important to do that. It also means that the Speaker and other leadership of the majority must abide by the rules as promised, and the promises are actually still on the Speaker's Web site but have not been followed as expected. 
   Let me just read you from the Speaker's own Web site. This is from the Speaker's Web site, as I pulled them off today. 
   ``Every person in America has a right to have his or her voice heard.'' It would have been nice if that had been remembered the last day of our session on August 1 before there was a 5-week vacation. We didn't get to have the microphones on so we could be heard. 
   But it continues: ``No Member of Congress should be silenced on the floor''--it would have been nice if somebody had noticed that--``as has been the practice of Republican leadership in the United States House of Representatives.'' A little slap there. Anyone smell hypocrisy? 
   It goes on and says: ``Respectful of both the wishes of the founders, and the expectations of the American people, we offer the following principles for restoring democracy in the `People's House,' guaranteeing that the voices of all the people are heard.'' 
   That just makes me sick to read those words and to think about what's happened in the last year and a half. 
   Then it goes on. It says: ``Bipartisan administration of the House. Our goal is to restore accountability, honesty and openness at all levels of government. To do so, we will create and enforce rules that demand the highest ethics from every public servant, sever unethical ties between lawmakers and lobbyists, and establish clear standards that prevent the trading of official business for gifts. Honest leadership''--on the speaker's Web site it said--``is not a partisan goal. It is the key to a stronger union.'' I agree. 
   But it goes on to say: ``We must all work together to put the progress of all Americans ahead of the special interests of the few.'' I certainly agree with that, too. 
   It goes on and says: ``With honest leadership and open government, America's leaders can once again focus on the urgent needs of the American people.'' 
   How about energy? American people need energy. They need cheaper energy. We need to get off the addiction to foreign oil. They're not addressing that. We took off on a 5-week vacation when the people needed us most. 
   The Web site goes on and says--this is the Speaker's Web site--``bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee and committee markups, with appropriate referrals to other committees. Members should have at least 24 hours to examine a bill prior to consideration at the subcommittee level.'' 
   Boy, that would have been nice last week when we got 
   slapped with an energy bill that didn't go through subcommittee, didn't go through committee, had not one single Republican getting to have any input in that energy bill last week, and it was posted, as I recall, at 9:45 the night before we had to vote on it. It would be nice if these things on the Speaker's Web site were followed. 
   ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   How long has it been on a bill of any substance that the minority was given an opportunity to have amendments? Closed rules over and over and over and over.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (ANXIETIES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. The Web site goes on to say: ``Members should have at least 24 hours to examine bill and conference report text prior to floor consideration.'' 
   Oh, that's another thing. We don't even have conference reports anymore, because if we had a conference, then there would be Republicans from the House that would be required to get to have input, and that's not going to happen. So the conference reports instead became Democrats getting together, working out in the Senate and the House--though, I think they may have let some Republicans in the Senate throw in a line or two--but nobody from the House. Not fair, not open. 
   And it says that it ``must be reported before 10 p.m. for a bill to be considered the following day.'' They found a way to completely avoid the conference process so that rule doesn't even matter anymore. 
   Now, the promises on the Speaker's Web site are so far from what's been happening in this, the most closed-door Congress in history. All I can say is that because of the vast abuses, at some point the majority will change again. Maybe not this year. At some point it will, because the American people begin to notice eventually, and some eventually will be shocked by the broken promises that were never fulfilled. 
   You can only fool the American people for so long before they figure it out. There may even be consequences for people across the aisle, apparently only for show, being on an energy alternative bill and then having two dozen of those people--it was their bill, and they voted against it, having already acknowledged that was the best bill. Maybe there will be consequences for doing that. 
   Accountability and fairness also mean that if people are going to use electric or fossil fuel-produced energy they should not try to prevent people who are not as wealthy as they are from being able to have the same opportunities to purchase that fuel on less income, that they would have to allow more to be produced to do that. 
   It means if you're going to use energy, then allow us to get it in America so it produces American jobs, increases America's gross national product, creates a better standard of living for more Americans. It will stop funding Nations that allow their assets to slip into the hands of those who want to destroy us. You cannot keep sending money abroad and not have a day of accountability when it will come back to haunt and truly hurt us badly. 
   It's time to quit sending $700 billion a year out of this country for energy that we have. Sure, let's produce the renewables. We have got to go to those for our future. And alternative energy sources would be terrific. 
   Some of us have come up with innovative things that will allow us to go way into the future with cheap energy, but right now, as my farmers tell me, we can't find a Prius tractor. When electricity was lost for days because of this Hurricane Ike that came through my district, as people pointed out to me, there are no hybrid generators. They run on fossil fuel. 
   Accountability to strengthen the Nation means that children have to have rules, and that when a man and a woman voluntarily have sexual relations, they have made their choice, and they will be accountable and bear the consequence of igniting a life in this world. 
   Accountability means that if you're a CEO of a company and you run a corporation into the ground, you should not receive millions of dollars in severance and a thank you for your greedy destruction. Instead, you should have to pay.  
   So, tonight, I want to close with a motion and a supporting speech made by Benjamin Franklin.     
   Let me set the stage here. 
   The American Revolution, you remember the Declaration of Independence, 1776. And then the war went on for 7 years. We got to 1783. The revolution was won. There was a Treaty of Paris, 1783. I did not know until I came to Congress, as a historian, history degree I've got, I didn't know until I saw an original copy in the State Department of the Treaty of Paris of 1783--this was a critical document because this was getting Great Britain to acknowledge in writing that the United States was a country that was and should be free and they would have to recognize that. So they wanted it in the name that even Great Britain would be afraid to break and breach. 
   I was shocked. It starts with big, bold letters at the top of the Treaty of Paris that forced Great Britain to recognize us; in these big, bold words it says, ``In the name of the most Holy and undivided Trinity.'' 
   Then we had the Articles of Confederation in this country, but they were too loosely woven. There were a number of problems, no common currency; there were problems and haggling between the States. And by 1787, it was very clear that if the Nation was to survive, it was going to have to have a new constitution. 
   So they went to George Washington and said, we need you to come back to preside. And he said, I did my part as God led me to do and you appointed me to do; I did my part. And they said, You don't understand; the 13 colonies will only come back together if you are willing to preside because they know you, they know your heart, they know you're not in it for yourself; you proved that the day you surrendered all power, as had never been done in the history of the world, surrendered all power and went home; won the revolution, commander of the military. You know, when you do that, historically, you could be called Czar, King, Caesar, whatever you want to be called. George Washington didn't do any of that. 
   When King George, III heard that Washington might resign after the revolution and just go home, he knew history, he said that would never happen. He said, in his exact words, ``If Washington were to do that, he would be the greatest man alive.'' He probably was. 
   So then we come to have the Constitutional Convention, with George Washington presiding. They went on for nearly 5 weeks with no success. At that point, Benjamin Franklin was recognized by the President of the Constitutional Convention, George Washington. And Benjamin Franklin rose to his feet and this is what he said--his exact words as recorded by James Madison with help from some of the others there. Benjamin Franklin: 
   ``Mr. President, the small progress we have made after four or five weeks close attendance and continual reasonings with each other--our different sentiments on almost every question, several of the last producing as many noes as ayes, is, methinks, a melancholy proof of the imperfection of the human understanding. We indeed seem to feel our own want of political wisdom, since we have been running about in search of it. We have gone back to ancient history for models of government and examined the different forms of those Republics which having been formed with the seeds of their own dissolution now no longer exist. And we have viewed modern states all around Europe, but find none of their constitutions suitable to our circumstances. 
   In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark to find political truth and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us, how has it happened, sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to illuminate understanding? In the beginning contest with Great Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayer in this room for the Divine protection. Our prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. 
   ``All of us who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favor. To that kind of Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing our future national felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance? 
   ``I have lived, sir, a long time. And the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth--that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, sir, in the Sacred writing that, ``except the Lord build the House, they labour in vain that build it.'' Firmly believe this; and I also believe that without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than the builders of Babel. 
   ``We shall be divided by our little partial local interest, our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter, from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance, war and conquest. 
   ``I, therefore, beg leave to move that henceforth prayers employing the assistance of heaven and its blessing on our deliberations be held in the Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the clergy of this city be requested to officiate at that service.'' 
   According to the record, Mr. Sherman seconded the motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, that was George Washington's recognition of Benjamin Franklin, and the words I read are verbatim from Benjamin Franklin. 
   We've begun every day here in this House, here in session with the prayer, just as Franklin moved and requested. There is a higher power; there has to be accountability. Decisions in this body must be made in deference to the Father of Lights, as Benjamin Franklin called Him, and doing so with prayer, and as Franklin prayed, that God will illuminate our understanding. 
   We are in a perilous time, and it is time for responsibility and accountability, or otherwise, we lose this precious country. 
   It is time now for the majority leadership to stop playing so fast and loose with the rules and with enforcement of the rules. It is time that, after 2 years in the majority, that promises of opportunity to amend bad Democratic bills be fulfilled. It is time that rules apply to CEOs, to speakers, to committee chairmen, to leaders, and the leaders start leading by example. 
   George Washington said, back during the revolution, these words: ``A people unused to restraint must be led, they will not be drove.'' He led from the front. When I was in the Army, they taught you to lead from the back. Not Washington, he led from the front. He said, ``A people unused to restraint must be led, they will not be drove.'' 
   As someone pointed out previously, we have the only National Anthem whose first verse ends with a question: Oh say does that star-spangled banner yet wave, o'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? The answer as to whether that banner will yet wave depends on whether this Congress begins to acknowledge some accountability and do the right and the wise thing, not the convenient, not the political thing, do the legal, ethical and moral thing, not the Woodstock thing. 
   May we get back to following God's directives so that this does not cease to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. May we get back to those things that cause God to pour out his richest blessings.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it is important to look at the words of the Constitution themselves. It says very clearly, and this is Article I, section 2. This is what talks about who will comprise the House of Representatives, who will comprise the Congress. It says ``it shall be composed of members that come from the several States.'' It is very clear. 
   Now, all of the people that testified before the Judiciary Committee who were supporting this amendment through legislation said, well, they base that on section 8, which says we can exercise exclusive legislation over the district. But once you open that door you have opened Pandora's box, because that same clause, that same paragraph says, exercise like authority over all places, that should include things like places where we have forts, magazines, arsenals, dark yards and other needful buildings. Once you go there, then every military institution in America could have a representative. Every needful Federal building in America could have a representative. That is what happens when you start bending and twisting the Constitution. 
   Now, these arguments were had when the Constitution was written. Alexander Hamilton lost. And there is a good position that people should be able to elect their representative, and that was discussed. But I would submit to you that Washington, D.C. is also the only city in the entire country that every Senator and every Member of Congress has a vested interest in seeing that it works properly, that water works, sewer works, and no other city in America has that. 
   In conclusion, let me just say, south of Columbus, Georgia, used to be an old blacksmith iron work shop with a sign above the door that said ``All types of bending and twisting done here.'' And I would humbly submit the Constitution should not have the same sign on the front of it. The Constitution is clear. Let's don't bend and twist it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend, the gentleman from Iowa, the Honorable Mr. King. I have been hearing most of the hour you have been talking about the concepts that I know you and I hold so dear. 
   There was a group from my hometown, Mr. Speaker, Tyler, Texas, that had come to Washington. They are an inspirational group. They are from Grace Community School. I took them around the Capitol tonight. They know their history. It is great when you see education work.     
   You see the very things you have been talking about, the free market, at work, and that free enterprise works and that really get backs to our very founding, the Judeo-owe Christian values that were so often espoused as the Declaration of Independence was written. 
   I have had people say the Constitution itself, there is nothing at all like it. By the way, you cannot send out a letter with the letters addressed or dated as you date them because it says like for today, March whatever day, all my letters, whatever day, ``in the year of our Lord,'' now this year 2007. I was originally told by the franking people, we do not believe you can send that out with ``in the year of our Lord'' on there; that may be inappropriate. My comment was, if you are saying it is unconstitutional to date a letter the same way the Constitution is dated, then we have got a real problem here. He did not realize the Constitution is dated in that manner, ``in the year of our Lord, 1787.'' 
   But anyway, there are groups there are schools where they still learn that kind of history, the very thing my friend Mr. King has been talking about. 
   I just wanted to pay tribute to the speaker of this group. I know the rules are that we are not to recognize people in the gallery. So I will not violate the rules, but it is a wonderful group that understands the values, the very values the gentleman from Iowa has been discussing, and it just makes me proud to be an American to hear you talk about the values I grew up on, the values that I know are being instilled in the young people still today. 
   I thank the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), my good friend, and I would encourage you to keep up the good job.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (THE MILITARY FREEDOM ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to follow my friend, a former judge also, from Texas, Mr. Poe; and he nailed it on the head. And I tell you, following up on that is another travesty going on this week, and that's why I just filed a bill in the last 15 minutes called the Military Freedom Act. 
   We are endowed by our creator with liberty. But like any inheritance, we only get to keep it if we are willing to fight for it. That is precisely why so many of our uniformed military members have laid down their lives. And the plain fact is that there is no more important purpose for the Federal Government than to provide for the common defense. 
   In order to do that, there's got to be a military. But we have all of the rights of freedom of speech. Even those rights have limits, such as when you can't yell ``fire'' in a crowded theater. There is, however, no right to trespass, there is no right to obstruct lawful ingress and egress into a military recruiter's office. The City of Berkeley, California, chose not to protect the Marines' lawful right to ingress and egress. They instead chose to aid and abet lawbreakers by encouraging them and passing an ordinance to make it easier to violate the Marines' rights. 
   The restricting of funding that is proposed and put forward in the bill I have just filed has been done previously in matters such as the speed limits of States or to encourage States to limit drinking and driving. So it's nothing new. 
   It has been deemed appropriate to encourage political entities in areas in which the Federal Government has a vested interest, and it has no more vested interest than what we have in providing for the common defense. 
   But Berkeley and any other city has the right to rule over its own city as they wish, and they're welcome to do that. But the Federal Government should not reward a city that chooses to obstruct and prevent the obtaining of military members who provide the very freedoms and the umbrella of freedom under which that city acts. They have a right to use freedom of speech, but they have no right to take United States taxpayers' dollars to aid and abet hurting our military readiness. 
   We took an oath in this body, in this room, to defend this Nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and those who prevent the United States from attaining military members are not the Nation's friends. Though such a city may deserve punishment, all we are trying to do with this bill is just not reward them for hurting our national defense. 
   Other city leaders, such as those in San Francisco, Toledo, Ohio, like the mayor there, have snubbed or restricted our military. They need to be aware that when they begin to prevent the military from having enough troops to protect us and being militarily ready, they should not expect Federal subsidies to assist them. 
   It is true that the actions addressed in the Military Freedom Act are mainly actions or omissions by community leaders and not all of their citizens. We understand that. There are good citizens in each of those towns. But the choice of the citizens is either to replace the hurtful leaders or bear the consequences or move. The old adage is democracy ensures the people are governed no better than they deserve. Therefore, those cities either deserve to have better leaders who don't hurt our national defense, or they deserve not to have funds to award their harmful conduct. 
   Cities like Berkeley should take stock of how many of their very own first responders in the business in their cities of saving lives were trained in the military. 
   I would remind you also, and I remember vividly because I was about to go on active duty about the time Vietnam was ended, our heroes came back from Vietnam and were spit on. Some of the hippies that did the spitting cut their hair, got into positions in cities and have found, figuratively, new, effective ways of spitting on our military. 
   But everyone should understand, Mr. Speaker, this is not taking away money for expressing free speech. It's simply not rewarding the obstruction of providing for the common defense. Since it will cost additional money to overcome the obstruction to our military readiness, the Military Freedom Act takes money from the appropriate place to do that. 
   This is the ultimate PAYGO bill for military readiness and national security. 
   In any event, I hope and I encourage the leaders, the majority leaders, the Democratic majority leaders of this body to bring this bill to a vote and let the cities know that we don't reward those who prevent our providing for the common defense.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. 
   We are told this is a new direction. This isn't a new direction. This isn't new thinking. We saw it 30 years which brought gas shrines. We saw it 30 years ago, and it brought us gas lines. We had a chance in this bill to fix a lot of problems. 
   We lost in my district, down in Lufkin, Texas, home of Charlie Wilson, we lost nearly 1,000 hardworking union jobs because natural gas was too expensive. We have lost a whole bunch more, and are in danger of losing more in Longview because natural gas is too high. We could have addressed that and fixed that. 
   But I guess the good thing that came out 30 years ago was that the gas lines and the problems that arose and the high gas prices brought us Ronald Reagan, and people's memories have waned some. 
   But this is Saturday, and there are not many people watching, but please note that when the policies in this bill end up helping gas run up to $5 a gallon--yes, it will help alternative fuels, but we would have gotten there eventually anyway. But please note that when it gets to $5 a gallon and more people, including union people, are losing their jobs, they will ultimately note and voters will long remember. 
   So long live gas lines and Jimmy Carter's legacy.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate this bill coming to the floor. I do not think it is a travesty against our civil rights. 
   Some people have some confusion, I think, over civil rights versus rights in a time of war. Believe it or not, and I think most of you should understand, we are in a war. We didn't know it in  1979 when war was declared against us, but we are at war. There are those in the world who believe that freedom and liberty necessarily leads to debauchery and degradation. Therefore, we must have a dictatorial, brutal leader, religious leader that tells us what we can and can't do. If you don't, then they have the right to cut off your head and destroy our way of life. 
   Now we happen to believe when you declare war against us and you want to cut off our heads and destroy our way of life, then we have a right to protect ourselves. In criminal law, it is called self-defense, and that is an exception to some of the rights others may have. What some have confused, I think, is civil rights versus rights of those declare war against your way of life. 
   This is not a bill that will allow surveilling American citizens on American soils. But the message is this: If you declare war on this country and you are a foreigner, we may just listen in on your conversations and you can be prepared for that. I have every confidence because of the oversight that will be coming with Chairman Conyers and the reports that are required in this bill, if they are not forthcoming, I expect to see to people held accountable, and I know Chairman Conyers will make sure that happens. And hopefully some day, Chairman Smith will be doing the same thing. 
   But the message, Mr. Speaker, is clear. You declare war on this Nation and you are in a foreign country, we may come after you and listen to what you have to say.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, FISA is a major issue. Great nations in history have failed and been defeated by becoming soft from within. I see dangers of doing that here. 
   I know that my colleagues across the aisle, the 170 or so who did not support FISA being passed into law last August, are very compassionate people. I've seen the hurt in your eyes. I've seen how it troubles your soul when you see people hurting and killed and maimed. What we're asking here is to do the intelligence and allow the intelligence community to protect us so we don't have to experience the horror of seeing Americans killed and maimed. 
   We're losing valuable intelligence every day that we do not pass this important, valuable bill. The proposal was made, let's just keep extending it a week at a time. You cannot do extensive intelligence on a week-to-week basis. We cannot put our country at risk. This House has other things planned today other than this critical issue that could be a nation-saving measure.

   We have funded tremendous amounts of stem cell research. Frankly, some of us don't need lectures on what it is to watch someone you love suffer and die and diminish and want to help them. Most all of us know that. 
   This is about prying money from taxpayers' hands who believe it is illegal and immoral and unethical to kill living embryos, and some of us have seen our little embryo mature into a beautiful person. This is about taking taxpayer dollars away from them and funding this research. 
   We are in a free market society. Pharmaceuticals have been demonized. Gee, they are making a profit. They are out to make a profit. If the money were there, they would be doing this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this is such a critical issue. You know, there are so many important things facing this country, whether it's the war on terror, the importance of FISA. But when you talk to people at home, it's getting desperate. It is getting very desperate, and they need help on the price of gasoline. They need help on the price of diesel fuel. 
   What are we doing? We are hearing people say, oh, we couldn't possibly drill ANWR. I am from Texas. Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, we have got States where we are doing everything we can to pump up all the energy we can to help the rest of the country. 
   We need some help. We have got all of these other resources, and they are being put off-limits. They are being kept off-limits, and we have heard from some on the other side, well, drilling doesn't really bring down the price of fuel. 
   You know what? We are told from some of the experts, 20, 30 percent is speculation. These speculators are smart. They see that every bill that's come out of this House for the last 16 months does not provide any answers to getting us more energy any time soon. 
   Talk about ANWR. Now, it was pointed out yesterday in our Resources Committee that really this area that is proposed for drilling is not part of ANWR. It was a section set aside by Jimmy Carter to make sure that we had an area that we could develop. 
   Now we are told that perhaps once a year caribou may come through this area of ANWR, and, oh, my goodness, if we put a drilling rig out there, it may destroy our caribou. We heard the same thing back some years back, that if we put a pipeline through some of this area up north it was going to kill off the last 27 head of caribou. 
   You know what happened? The pipeline went in, that oil is warm going through that pipeline, and what happened is it makes the caribou amorous. Now when caribou want to go on a date, they invite each other to go over to the pipeline. We are up to 30,000 head of caribou now because of what the warm pipe has done for the good of the caribou community, so it's going well. 
   We are told we can't drill the Outer Continental Shelf. About 97 of our coastlines are unavailable. We heard the same thing in Texas years back. Oh, please, don't put a drilling rig, not a platform out in the water. Oh, my goodness, you get beyond 30 miles, nobody can see it from the beach. 
   But what we found in the Texas coast is, despite all the naysayers saying it was going to kill off the fish, what's happened, if you want to go fishing and really go where the fish are, they go around the platforms because they have become wonderful artificial reefs. Man and environment can work together to help each other. The Outer Continental Shelf, we may have the highest second supply of natural gas in the world, some think we might even have the most, but we have put it off-limits and won't go after it. 
   We have lost so many wonderful union jobs because of the price of natural gas. I lost several hundred jobs out of my district when a paper mill closed  because it ran on natural gas, and we were paying the highest price in the world because we wouldn't utilize what we have. 
   My friend has pointed out coal. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal, according to a lot of experts, and yet we put it off-limits. President Carter put a huge amount of our coal off-limits. We are the only advanced nation that takes our greatest resources of energy and puts them off-limits. 
   Nuclear. Now I am not one to advocate mimicking France over anything, but they have about got it down on nuclear. We could follow their example and provide so much energy. Refineries, the bills we keep passing out of this Congress, out of this committee I am on, it makes it harder to open refineries. That makes the price go up. Speculators see that. 
   If we had an announcement today, tomorrow, from Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid that, by golly, next week we're going to drill ANWR, we're going to drill Outer Continental Shelf, we're going to start supplying more of our energy needs until we can bring all these alternatives on line, that 20 to 30 percent would go down. 
   I would be willing to bet you that we would lose a dollar off the price of gasoline within a week's time because the speculators would say, whoa, they are really serious about providing their own energy needs. 
   We had a report last week, that it turns out a lot of the experts believe that we may be able to get three to five times the amount of oil left in the entire Middle East from our shale in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming, three to five times. They are saying there are maybe 900 billion barrels of oil left in the Middle East, maybe a trillion, and we may get 3 to 5 trillion barrels recoverable from shale in areas so much of which is off-limits.     
   In some cases they say, well, we'll give you an 8-year lease, but it will take over 7 years to get the permits. Folks, we have to help our people. They are crying out, and we need to do something now.

   The Fairness Doctrine is such a misnomer. It may be an oxymoron, if you would. But one of the great things about this country throughout our history since we became a country has been that rather than have another revolution, people can express their views. They can say what they want. The Fairness Doctrine suppressed that a great deal and it fomented a lot of agitation. 
   As long as people can get out there and express their views, we're going to be okay. We can disagree. We can fix things. We can complain about things. But when you run in and start saying you're talking too much about this issue, you're saying too much on this side, then we are looking for another revolution. I do not want to see that. 
   We don't need the Fairness Doctrine, this misnomer. It is time to set it aside for good and move forward with free speech.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we have just heard reference to the Senate bill; and my friend, for whom I have great respect, our chairman of Judiciary, Chairman Conyers, mentioned that we are coequal branches. I would submit to you, we are an even more important branch because we are more accountable to the people than the Senate is. 
   The difference, though, in the Senate bill and this bill is, the Senate Democrats got input and allowed input into the bill from their Republican colleagues, and we are not allowed to make amendments on this bill. All we can do is come up and point out problems with it. 
   My friend, Mr. Nadler, whom I have come to believe has a brilliant legal intellect, has come on the floor this morning and said that there is false information from our side, that we are falsely misleading. He said that we have been less than honest. That bothers me to no end, because he knows some of the talking points that are being talked on this floor are just not right. 
   Now, I have read the bill. It's a better bill than the manager's amendment we dealt with last time; it is. But we are still not there, and we still haven't been allowed enough input to make it better. 
   But we also heard from one of our colleagues across the aisle that said he fought in Afghanistan, and he was a soldier. Thank God we have him and others that would do that. But the telecoms in the week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks right after 9/11, when we did not know if we were going to have thousands of Americans lost any day, they were put in a terrible situation. 
   You know the law. The law is very restricted on who in the telecom company can see the request or the demand from the administration, from the NSA or whoever makes it. You know that. I pushed to make sure in the law that they are at least allowed to talk to a lawyer, but they are restricted there. 
   Put yourself in their place. They get a request in any hypothetical case after Americans are killed in an act of war on our soil.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (ENERGY SOLUTIONS -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from Iowa for yielding. Of course, we have had a good bit of discussion on energy. One of the things that has gotten a lot of attention is this moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   It was interesting to talk to RALPH REGULA, a Congressman here, who said he was here in 1981 when the first moratorium got put in place. If you go back to President Jimmy Carter, he signed a declaration stating that the Outer Continental Shelf was such an asset for this Nation that it should be  developed expeditiously. Those were the two words: Developed expeditiously. 
   So what happened to that? Jimmy Carter saying, Wow, we have got this fantastic resource for oil and natural gas that would help the American people and solve so much of our energy problems. What happened? Well, RALPH explained he was on the committee when there was some wealthy beach front owners, landowners in California, and of course there had been an oil spill around Santa Barbara in California, a bad spill. Amazingly, people complained about the drilling platforms when actually it's the tankers that spilled the stuff bringing it from other places. 
   But, anyway, wealthy, just the rich, who had beach front property, said they didn't want to look out there and have to see a rig, no matter that it might bring cheaper gasoline or cheaper natural gas prices, which could mean cheaper fertilizer, cheaper foreign products, cheaper plastics, cheaper all kind of things. Never mind about that. The wealthy didn't see that as a problem. 
   They didn't want to see the rigs out there so they begged and pleaded Congress to give a moratorium so there would be no drilling off the California coast. Well, they were apparently persuasive. They had plenty of resources with which to persuade the Congress. As I understood, it was back in 1981. They persuaded Congress to give them a moratorium. 
   Well, the recitation was such that then Florida said, Wait a minute. Those of us that are wealthy in Florida that have beach front property, we don't want drilling that might put a rig out there where we could see it off our coast. So never mind that it might provide cheaper gasoline, cheaper products, cheaper heating oil, cheaper things like that. Never mind that. We just don't want to look out from our expensive piece of property and even risk seeing a rig out there. So let's get a moratorium too. California got one. RALPH had warned that if you give California this moratorium, you will rue the day you did it. 
   Well, the wealthy there were able to persuade no drilling off the Florida coast. They got a moratorium. Before you know it, State after State was able to use and parlay California's and Florida's moratorium into not having drilling off their coast, until we get to the present day, where there's still these moratoriums off most of our coastline that could help our Nation become completely energy independent and say adios to this tremendous transfer of wealth that has been going over to some people that just flat don't like us and some of whom have supported terrorism. So it's important to know your history. In order to know where you're going, know your history. 
   So when we talk about this moratorium, that is what we are talking about, wealthy folks in the country that didn't want to have to risk seeing a rig, never mind that the rigs could have been required to be far enough off the coast that they could not be seen from the coastline. 
   In Texas, we didn't have the moratorium. Louisiana didn't. So you can go down, and we did hear the stories that if you put a platform off the coast, then it's going to destroy all the fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. How terrible that would be. Well, they put the platforms out there and, lo and behold, the fish look at it as artificial reefs. Now, if you want to go fishing, a great place to go out is to the artificial reefs, which the fish look at them as, and they are actually just the platform that are producing. 
   So Carter wanted it developed expeditiously. I had tremendous problems with some of the things he did, like creating the problem in Iran when he cut the legs out from under the Shah and hailed the Ayatollah as a man of peace coming in, and we have been paying the price ever since then. 
   But here we have a majority that talks about being concerned about what they say is the little guy in America, what I would say are the hardest working people here. I have had union jobs lost in the last few years because natural gas prices were too high. It isn't helpful to keep putting our natural gas off limits. We are losing jobs that good, hardworking union workers should not have to lose to some country where they have got cheaper natural gas. 
   Also, ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It is ridiculous not to drill that small area, compared to the millions of acres that would not be touched, that area where there's no wildlife, the area where there is nothing that would be disturbed, and produce that to bring a million, million and a half barrels on line. And it would not take 10 to 15 years. We have got a pipeline 74 miles away. That oil could be in the pipeline and coming this way in 2 or 3 years. 
   All of that said, we can then use the revenue, the royalties. People talk about subsidies and this kind of this. Make them pay royalties. The bills that we were pushing in the last Congress for 2 years had significant royalties that would go and be split between the States and the Federal Government. Tremendous revenue enhancers. You have could used that for the renewable energy, you could use that to shore up the hurting infrastructure of this country without raising taxes, and it would be producing new jobs. 
   One estimate says that if we allow the drilling in ANWR, it would immediately start producing 250,000 jobs, and we'd have 750,000 jobs by the time it was actually completed and the oil started flowing this way. I think solar, I know Boone Pickens is visionary on the idea of wind. That can help us out. But I think ultimately if we get the capacitors to ever store electricity, solar could provide all our power, and this would provide the revenue to get on the way to do that, and we could say goodbye forever to this tremendous gross transfer of wealth to countries, so many of whom don't care for us. 
   So I appreciate my friend from Iowa yielding. I felt like as a follow-up on this discussion about energy it was very important for people to know the moratorium that will go out of existence come the end of this month, unless something is passed. And I know there are many wealthy people in the Senate, I know that there are millionaires here in the House who are really not bothered by the high gasoline prices. I hope that the Senators that are wealthy will feel and understand the pain of the hardworking Americans and not cut the legs out from under this program that could strengthen America for the next 200 years. 
   I hope they won't cave in because the hardworking Americans in this country need the help. This is one place we can provide the help. 
   May God bless this country. One way it can be is if we are allowed to utilize the resources with which we have already been blessed. But thank you to my friend from Iowa for yielding, and I yield back to him.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Madam Speaker. 
   Dr. David O. Dykes has been pastor of Green Acres Baptist Church for about 17 years while being a true leader, spiritual guide, and dear friend. 
   In Tyler, Texas, Green Acres has over 14,000 members and is the most mission-minded church anywhere. Recognized this year with the highest award of the Southern Baptist Convention, Brother David, as his church knows him, has taken seriously the admonitions of Jesus to feed His sheep, minister to their needs, and take the Gospel into all the world. 
   As I heard here from a Florida pastor yesterday, Brother David is truly an inspiration and a blessing because of his evident burden for reaching out to help others. He faithfully serves our church, the local community, our country and world. He dearly loves his amazing wife, Cindy, their daughters Jenni and Laura Grace, and their husbands Jason and Jim.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (A LETTER TO CONGRESS FROM JENIFER ALLBAUGH -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I received a letter from a mother of a Marine who was killed on July 5 of this year. She asked that I make this letter known to the Members of the House, and that is what I will do at this time. I will read directly from her letter. 
   ``Let me first tell you about myself. My name is Jenifer Allbaugh, my husband is Jon Allbaugh and we have three children together. My son, 2nd Lt. Army Jason Allbaugh (24), my daughter Alicia Allbaugh, college sophomore (19) and Cpl. Jeremy Allbaugh, USMC (21). Jeremy was killed in Iraq on July 5, 2007 while on a mission in a Humvee that was hit by an IED. 
   ``Jeremy enlisted in the Marine Corps before he graduated from high school in 2004. We were at war but he very much wanted to serve his country. He believed very much in what he was doing and what his country was trying to accomplish in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   ``While we as a family are struggling greatly with the loss of our hero, I feel a great need to express my concerns in regards to our military. 
   ``I do not understand why our government has to be pushed to equip our  military with the best equipment technology has to offer. We are one of the greatest Nations on this earth, but yet it took parents and other individuals to get our military up-armored Humvees and better body armor. Now we need Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles and the debate is on again. 
   ``First of all, these vehicles were available for years before this war began, but yet we are just now realizing the need for them. This is shameful, and there is no excuse for it. I would like one person to look me and other mothers in the eye and explain why our sons were not in the these vehicles. According to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, approximately 700 American heroes would be alive today if they had been in an MRAP, my son included. 
   ``I'm not smartest or most educated woman in the world, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out that there should be no debate over supplying our military with these vehicles. 
   ``IEDs seem to be one of the most effective weapons terrorists have against our troops. Money should not be an issue. This country has been selfish long enough. It shouldn't matter how much it costs. If you are going to ask our military to put their lives on the line for our freedoms, then again, money should not matter. We as a country can go without perfectly paved roads and other such luxuries we seem to think we need for awhile. We gripe about the cost of gas, milk and cup of coffee. If Americans would quit being selfish, maybe funding this war wouldn't be so hard. 
   ``Our Congress and Senate need to stop the finger pointing, back biting, back stabbing and name calling and do their jobs. Work together. As hard as that sounds, the rest of us in the `real world' have to do it every day. 
   ``It is also time for what I believe is a silent majority to stand up and be heard. 
   Since the death of our son, we have heard from people all over the country who appreciate what he did for his country. They also appreciate what our military is doing in Iraq and Afghanistan. But we as a country only hear from the ones who complain the most. The rich and famous, who don't know what they're talking about, get to tell their opinions, but not those of us who support our sons and daughters who have volunteered to serve this country. 
   ``I had long conversations with my son while he was in Iraq. I was one of the lucky Moms who got to talk to her son quite frequently. He told me of the good things they were doing, for example opening schools, hospitals, clinics and helping recruit men into the Iraqi Army. The vast majority of the Iraqi people in the area Jeremy was in, loved and appreciated the Marines. They understood why we are there. He told me how the locals were voluntarily giving info on the terrorists and their activities and that neighborhood watch programs had been started. 
   ``Do we hear of this? No. Because it isn't sensational enough and it doesn't get votes. 
   ``This war has had a lot of mistakes made, but to me it's neither here or there. We are there and there are good things being done. I want no more excuses and explanations. Write the check with no attachments and give our men what they need. MRAP's should have been there from the beginning and should be there now. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is asking for more money for MRAP's. This is a no brainer and there should no excuse for thousands to be built. I as a Mother do not care what the obstacles are. We built ships faster than this during World War II. It can be done if we want to. Don't attach pork and other stupid stuff to it either. Just do it. Until we finish our job in Iraq and Afghanistan these vehicles shouldn't be under debate and should be top priority in the manufacturing industry. If you had done this in the first place, my son and many others would be alive today. He was in a Humvee every day he was in Iraq as are thousands of others. 
   ``Jeremy was a bigger man at 21 than any of the men and women that are running this country. He went to war without hesitation or reservation. He did his job well and was sorely overworked and underpaid. I ask that you all start earning your paycheck and do what is right. As my son said, `We are doing good things here and we need to finish.'' 
   Please honor our military and give them the equipment and time in Iraq and Afghanistan that they need. Please save another Soldier or Marine in a Humvee by putting them in MRAP's. 
   ``The Iraqi people where my son was appreciated him and his fellow Marines. Too bad our own politicians don't. Quit using words of support and do it with deeds.'' 
   I realize my time is expired, and I thank the Speaker.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this is a critical piece of legislation, not from the good that it will do, but from the chilling and even killing effect it will have down the road on free speech. 
   Now, I know that there are people that have said that this is an overreaction, much like people said in 1935 and 1936 that those nuts here on the floor that were concerned Social Security numbers, once created, might be used as identification numbers, and they were promised and assured that it would not happen. But some folks here could see down the road where it was going. 
   Now, the rule on this is so grossly unfair. If you really want to deal with hate crimes, what about the hate crimes for the elderly? We've seen that recently. They're not part of this. No, that wasn't part of the agenda. You can have a 100-year-old woman beat up by some mean thug, but that doesn't count; we're not going to prosecute. She doesn't deserve protected status. 
   Frankly, I had a hard time believing we were taking up this law immediately after the tragedy at Virginia Tech. We even had a Holocaust survivor that was randomly shot. I had an amendment proposed that was struck in committee, and the rule being proposed is a closed rule, no amendments, but that would address random violence. Because what we see is a Federal offense where a defense will be, you  know what, I didn't hate these people, I just randomly chose someone. It's a senseless act of violence. That will be a defense to an important element of this new created Federal offense. 
   Another thing we keep hearing people say is, and I had an amendment to address this, is being shut out. We should have had a right to vote on this. People say, well, no, you are specifically protected under the rule of evidence provision in this law. We even had Mr. Davis' amendment that further said religious speech is protected. But what they don't point to is what I'm pointing to, under that it says, ``It may not be introduced as substantive evidence at trial, unless the evidence specifically relates to the offense.'' 
   Well, when you tie that with current existing Federal law, 18 U.S.C. 2(a), the law of principals, which is a good law, most States have it, the Federal Code has it, it says, Whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures a crime's commission is punishable, just as the principal. And for those of us who have been judges or prosecutors and have prosecuted or seen prosecuted people as a principal who didn't commit the offense, but they induced it, then you know every statement, things that you said to induce, could be introduced. That's where they go after ministers. 
   I think a large part of this is the fact that many people do not understand a Christian heart because they just don't like people that disagree with them. Whereas the Christian, the true Christian heart can disagree with people and love them, love them deeply and be willing to give their lives for them. 
   This is an unfair law, the way the rule is being put to it. We are not going to protect religious speech because you can go after a minister, and this came up in committee, you can go after a minister who says, gee, relations outside of a marriage with a man and a woman is wrong. Someone goes out after hearing that, shoots somebody, and then he says, well, the preacher told me it was wrong, that's what induced me to do that, the sermons, the Bible teachings, whatnot, that the preacher used that this person may have heard are all relevant on whether or not he was a principal and can go to prison for the actual shooting. And it also provides that nothing changes the rule of impeachment. 
   So if he says, well, no, I never advocate violence, well, here comes everything he has ever said, his hard drives, his files, and we had an amendment to deal with that, and we were not allowed to use it. 
   This is not a good law. These things are already protected. We ought to have an open rule to fix it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this bill starts off with a preamble that makes it faulty to begin with. 
   There are all kinds of recitations in the beginning, factual, so-called findings that were not supported and are not supported by any evidence. That is a major problem here. 
   First of all, people want to talk about how desperately this is needed to stop hate-based crimes. However, there are laws that protect every man, woman, and child from violent acts. In fact, I have heard my colleague across the aisle reference that the Matthew Shepard case shows how desperately we need hate crime legislation. Those perpetrators that did that horrible act both got life sentences under regular murder laws. This was not necessary. 
   People in committee threw up the Byrd case, a horrible tragedy where a man was dragged to his death simply because he was African American. Those two main perpetrators got the death penalty, and no hate crime that has been passed would address that. 
   Now, these statistics, if you really want to look at the facts before we pass bad legislation that is not justified by the facts, and I do take issue with the preamble's fact findings. There is no evidence to support them. But let's look. 
   Since 1995, the FBI statistics show that we have gone from 9,500 to 12,400 agencies reporting, more of the country is being covered, and yet a steady decline has gone from right at 8,000 to 7,100 incidents.     
   Offenses have gone down near well a thousand, to 8,300. Victims have gone down 1,600. Offenders have gone down 1,600. The laws are working. What this is trying to do is protect a class from any ill speech, anything that's derogatory. 
   Now, friends across the aisle say no, no, no. We put that in the bill. We've got an amendment that protects that. But if you go to the law in this bill, it says that, yeah, religious or protected speech would not be used at trial, unless it pertains or is relevant to the offense. And as anybody that's prosecuted someone as a principal, not a conspiracy, but a principal, a principal under Federal law, it says whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures a crime's commission is punishable as if he committed the crime. 
   And this is where this is going; ministers reading from the Bible, rabbis reading from the Torah, imams reading from the Koran who say sexual activity outside of marriage of a man and a woman is wrong, if they have somebody from their flock, some nut go out and commit a crime of violence and, by the way, this is not a restricted crime of violence. It could be violence against property. It can be a touching to be bodily injury. We've lowered the standard in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this body will take up legislation that is referred to as hate crime legislation. On its face that sounds pretty innocuous, something we should all agree on. We are against hate. 
   Those of us who believe in the Bible would say that is not something that anyone should engage in. Hate. But the fact is there are laws across America that deal with crimes. What hate crime legislation does is carve out essential exemptions, special punishments for people who commit offenses. 
   In the past, hate crimes have been limited to felonies that involve serious bodily injury, that kind of thing, in most areas. But here for the first time, we are not going to enhance punishment, we are not going to just only spend money of Federal dollars to help other jurisdictions enforce their hate crime legislation. Now we created a special Federal crime that will allow the full weight of the Federal Government to go after those who, according to the law we will vote on tomorrow, in any circumstance, basically, willfully causes bodily injury to any person. 
   Now, most hate crime laws refer to serious bodily injury, but not in this legislation. We refer to bodily injury. We have lowered the bar dramatically. There are some jurisdictions that would say bodily injury can be temporary, no matter how temporary. It can be a touching, a pushing. 
   So, in other words, if someone opposed to your position that, perhaps, was having gender identity issues, like a transvestite, got between you and your office, and there were numbers of them, and you tried to get through to your office, then, as has happened in other places, he may be inclined now to go to the Federal Government, file a criminal complaint for which you could be arrested, and that would be bodily injury sufficient to rise to that level. 
   Now, some have said, in our committee, that this does not affect any speech, this is only actions. But the trouble is existing Federal law, under 18 U.S. Code 2(a) of the Federal Criminal Code, and I have taken an excerpt from it, says: ``Whoever aids ..... abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures'' a crime's commission is punishable as if they had committed the crime itself. 
   That's referred to in most jurisdictions as the law of principals. It's not a conspiracy law, it's a law of principals. 
   Therefore, as I ask about a hypothetical in committee, if a minister were to preach from the Bible or simply read from the Bible, or a rabbi were to read from the Torah or teach from it, or an imam was to read from the Koran, indicating that it is wrong to have sexual relations outside of the marriage of a man and a woman; if someone heard that and went out and committed an offense causing bodily injury, shooting someone, and then when they were questioned, they said, well, my minister, rabbi or imam said this was wrong, and this is what induced me to do this, well, under existing Federal law, when coupled with the law the majority wants to pass tomorrow, that minister could be charged under the law as a principal, as having shot the victim. That would mean that any sermons, any Bible teachings, any Koran or any Torah teachings that were perhaps on file at the home, in the office, on the hard drive, would then be admissible, because that is evidence that this individual taught and preached how wrong this was, which induced the individual to commit the crime. 
   Now, others say that's ridiculous, and it reminds me a great deal of the debate in this House in 1935, 1936, on Social Security, when some stood here and said, we don't want Social Security numbers because those will one day be utilized as identification numbers. That was roundly guffawed, this is ridiculous. This is simply a number on a Social Security account. It could never be identification. That's ridiculous. Others say, look, we have a provision in here that says first amendment speech.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am sure glad my friend, the chairman of Judiciary, sought time for people to revise and extend their remarks, because they are going to need it. This thing keeps changing. I mean, I reviewed this bill last week. I spent a long time going line by line, only to find yesterday there's still a new version, and today I was provided a 98-page bill. I can't tell you the pages of the issues that I am most concerned about because the version keeps changing.     
   Now, this bill includes $330 million in authorizations. Normally, suspensions  are noncontroversial, but the fact that this bill keeps changing is absolute evidence that this is not noncontroversial. It keeps changing because people can't figure out what is the best thing to do. 
   I would submit there is a good reason for that. The bill that this seeks to renew and programs that are sought to be renewed are ones we don't have information on how successful they were, and that was the original purpose of this bill. Back when it expired in 2005, we still did not have the information on what worked and what didn't. 
   I can tell you from my days as a judge, there was some anecdotal evidence that it looked like faith-based programs did a better job of dramatically reducing recidivism. In one case I was shown results from a prison in Texas where it dropped down to about 8 percent from over 80 percent because of faith-based programs and mentoring. 
   This new version, I haven't even been through it. I haven't had time to go through it. But the one that I saw and reviewed on Friday, it included reentry programs allowing payment for housing and health care. I know our military members who are leaving after less than 20 years in the service with honorable discharges would love to have that kind of help reentering. 
   There are some provisions that allow for too much administration, in my opinion; 11 percent at one point, 15 percent at another. That is not going to help people. That is going to build a bigger bureaucracy. 
   Dismissing all charges if someone completes drug rehab under another provision I think is outrageous. You are going to remove the hammer that would allow you to keep people in line? It is one thing to say we are going to remove you and not have you go to prison and instead send you to drug rehab, and then if you get through there, before you have a chance to go out and do cocaine again, we are going to drop all charges so we have no hammer over your head. I don't know if this is in the final bill. It was in there last I saw on Friday. 
   There is a provision that allows payments through the Department of Labor for support. There are military members, and I went to another funeral Saturday, a gentleman who was not killed in Iraq, he was killed during surgery, but I know his family would love to have the kind of support being provided in here for felons. 
   We also have a provision in here, we are going to pay people through these grants to teach inmates how they can go about getting the most welfare before they leave prison and go out on their own. There is also a provision that moves inmates to home detention without approval of the judge who sentenced the individual. 
   In this bill, the elderly, for purposes of moving to home detention, is defined as 65. I guess apparently under this bill, without any underlying evidence or research to support it, we have arbitrarily picked 65 as deciding that is when people are harmless. But I know from my own experience around this Chamber, there are people in Congress that are 65 or older that are certainly not harmless. In any event, I think that is a little bit too young to classify people as harmless. 
   There is a provision that assistance will be provided by the United States probation system and it ``shall'' be done. I don't know, I can't find from the bill what kind of assistance that will be. But I think we have all got the same goal. I think one of the worst atrocities in the justice system has been our lack of rehabilitating and educating and preparing people to go out into the world and become productive citizens and finally reach the God-given potential that every one of them has. I couldn't agree more with the proposition, and I know that is the heart of my colleagues across the aisle. But we don't have the information on which programs are successful and which aren't. 
   I want to work together on a program. I've kind of been cut out of this process. The National Summit on Prisoner Reentry is coming up in Los Angeles on November 27 and 28, but we are going to rush this through on a suspension bill for $330 million without even having a chance to really review the most recent document.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate yielding to the gentlelady to come down and call me outrageous. But what is outrageous is this process, this process of taking something so important and rushing it in here without having the proper input and the proper information. The National Institute of Justice has got their biggest study program in its history ongoing, and we don't have the results, and yet my colleagues want to rush in and throw $330 million at a process that is unproven and untried. 
   I just don't think that is the way to go. We have got honest people involved in the process, but the process itself here has not been honest. 
   With that, I would reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Nothing would please me more than to be involved in the process of constructively working on these issues. When I think about the gentlelady saying that my comments were outrageous, everything that I have said is documented. Everything I have said comes from reading through this bill, as well as my own experience from my days of being a judge. 
   I wholeheartedly agree, we should do a better job of rehabilitating and educating. In fact, I just get concerned when we get so anxious to try to do something good that we end up throwing money at a problem just so we can say we worked on it, something had to be done. 
   But it was the National Institute of Justice Award to RTI International, a nonprofit research organization, to evaluate the programs funded by the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative. This is one of the largest evaluation studies funded by the NIJ, and it is doing this research. The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy research organization in D.C., is the collaborator on the project. I am really looking forward to getting that information. I am wondering why we throw more money at a situation before we get the information that tells me how and tells us how to be most effective? 
   When my good friend the chairman, and I do think the world of him, talks about comity and goodwill, that is what I would love to have. But when we have such trouble getting copies of the latest versions, and then the chairman says, gee, I had the latest version on Friday, I was notified by the committee staff that there was a new version as of yesterday and then the new version was filed today. So, I didn't have everything Friday. That has been one of the problems here. This is too important of an issue to just be throwing good money after bad. 
   I would also point out that in the interests of comity and goodwill, the bills that follow this, H.R. 3845, PROTECT Our Children Act of 2007, I indicated before that sounded like something I would want to be part of and helping with, but we never did get a final version that we could say, yes, I want to cosponsor that. 
   Keeping the Internet Devoid of Sexual Predators Act of 2007 sounds like another good bill, but we haven't seen it. And talking to the Judiciary staff, that and the Effective Child Pornography Prosecution Act, H.R. 4120, that follows that, we are still trying to get updated versions of those things. So that doesn't sound to me like comity and goodwill, when we are struggling over here to even get copies. 
   We don't know what requests had been granted. There were things requested by the Department of Justice, in the interest of justice, please get these provisions put in this bill. We don't know what was put in and what wasn't. That, to me, does not indicate comity and goodwill. It creates all kinds of problems.

   Reclaiming my time, I have been over here in the 20 minutes or so before I came up to speak talking to Judiciary staff who, unless they are changing their story now, have not been able to get the latest information on this bill. Well, they have got it on this bill. We have the final copy. I haven't had a chance to review it since it has been filed today. Most of us were out doing what we should have been doing yesterday, paying tribute to veterans all over our districts. But these subsequent bills, these are still a problem that I have been having with the Second Chance Act, getting the latest information on this.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   We heard moments ago that there are 212 organizations supporting the bill. I have talked to many of them over the course of our discussions on the Second Chance Act, great, noble, wonderful organizations. I couldn't find but one out of numerous ones that I talked to that actually read the bill. They all have the same goals. They all want to see adequate education and rehabilitation, cutting down on recidivism. We all want to see that. I want to see that. I think we have got to do that as a civilized society. There are many that support this goal. But, again, many haven't seen the bill. 
   And I have checked with the staff in the interim. For example, H.R. 719 is file-stamped November 13 at 1:11 today, and the Judiciary got it for the first time just before 3 p.m. so that you know. 
   But if we really want to help the situation, doesn't it make sense to get the information on one of the biggest-funded programs NIJ has ever had so we put the money where it works and take it away from where it doesn't work? 
   Mr. Speaker, in responding to the chairman's comment, I would have to say I noticed in reviewing the bill on Friday, it is a better bill than it was, in my opinion; but we still have a little ways to go. That is why I just think this is a bill in its present form, as it continues to morph, that should not be on the Suspension Calendar, but should come up under a regular rule where we have a chance to work on these other issues. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time so the gentleman from Michigan has the time to respond.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate Mrs. Tubbs Jones' comments. And I guess calling me or my comments outrageous was somewhat offensive, but as an old judge I was used to that. In fact, I have been called all kinds of names. 
   And, yes, even 2 days ago when I was buying some potting soil back home, I had a guy come up to me with his father and said if it were not for me, he would never have straightened his life up. 
   Those are not uncommon comments. And what it came from was being fair, but also having tough love. Because, as those who have been involved in dealing with people who have been addicted to drugs or alcohol, it does take tough love. And you do want to help them get out of the cycle rather than becoming an enabler. And that is my number one concern, is that we do not want to be enablers. 
   And when we talk about Scripture, absolutely, there are all kinds of verses that apply to us for those that believe the teachings of Jesus as I do. They are entirely appropriate. Those are directed to individuals. If you get over to Romans 13, that is directed to the government. And where it says if you do evil, you need to be afraid, because God does not give the government the sword in vain, that is part of the role of government; if you do evil, then there are consequences. 
   But it is a worthy goal to want to try to stop the cycle of recidivism. We all, I think, want that. No, I don't think; I know, we all want that same goal. But I am very concerned that we may be enabling by throwing money at a problem. 
   One of the saddest words and lines I ever heard came at a hearing when the wealthiest people in my home county, they had the courtroom packed so that they were hoping that I would put her on probation yet again, and they knew she had had it too many times and it wasn't going to happen under me. And it didn't. And it turns out she had a huge trust fund every month. She never had to work, she never had to study, and she had spent all her money on drugs. And the last thing she said before I sentenced her was, ``I wish somebody had told me `no' before today and meant it.'' 
   She has now gotten out. Her mother, when I was walking neighborhoods, I went up to her door and her mother said, ``Come in and sit down.'' She said, ``You know, my husband and I just hated you at one point, but you saved our daughter's life.'' 
   Sometimes it is the tough love things that turn things around. We want the same goal. I don't want to throw good money after bad in renewed programs that shouldn't be. And I hope that if this fails on suspension, we can get the new data that is going to be forthcoming and work toward the same goal with additional, more helpful information. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (PROVIDING THAT THE GREAT HALL OF THE CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER SHALL BE KNOWN AS EMANCIPATION HALL -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. It is so true that slavery was an abomination and is even today an abomination. It was a blight on this country's collective soul, and we can thank God that it has been eliminated. 
   Emancipation Hall, it does have a great ring to it. It sounds beautiful and it sounds like it's high time that such a hall were so named, and it does sound like an appropriate hall. 
   As I go back, though, and think through the comments and the speeches of those who were able to get rid of this abomination in this country, I think about the reasoning they had. Some have said that if there is no universal standard of right and wrong, if there is no force in the universe beyond ourselves that is unwavering as to right and wrong, then people can treat others the way they wish. If we are each god in our own way, then we can treat each other as we wish. 
   But I believe, as those who fought so hard to eliminate slavery, that there is a universal standard of right and wrong, and that is the God that's referenced ``In God We Trust.'' 
   But as we look throughout the Congressional Visitor Center, we find the Emancipation Hall will be a great addition, but there ought to be a basis, some reference, so people know why the emancipation was so important.     
   Yet, as I understand it, the term ``Creator,'' ``we are endowed by a Creator with certain inalienable rights,'' that's nowhere in the hall; that's been eliminated. There is no reference to the Lord. The Constitution is dated in the year of our Lord in 1787. We find out a couple of weeks ago that ``Laus Deo'' that's on the capstone of the Washington Monument, meaning ``praise be to God'' has been obliterated and changed from the display so that people don't know what's up there. And the capstone itself, the monument replica, is turned where people can't see it. 
   We are categorically removing God and references to Creator, to God, to Lord, from all of these things. And Lincoln, in his addresses, repeatedly said we pray to the same God, it's in his second inaugural address, and yet the efforts these days are to eliminate that. 
   John Quincy Adams' eloquent speeches on the floor of Statuary Hall over and over and over demanding an end to this abomination, that God will judge America harshly if we don't eliminate it, Lincoln said, after he became President, wasn't much happening during those 2 years he was in the House except for those ``great sermons from that dear man Adams.'' 
   So I hope that not only can we move forward with naming the hall more appropriately Emancipation Hall, I think that's wonderful, but I think that we ought to restore to the plans God, who made it all possible.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, as always, it is such an honor to be part of this body when you know the sacrifices that have been made by so many just to allow us to be here at this time in history. 
   There is a defense bill that we will be talking about some in the next 60 minutes, but in leading up to that, I wanted to address a bill that was on the suspension calendar earlier this week and was pulled from the suspension calendar, and I have been told it probably will be coming up very soon. 
   Like so many things that have been done in this body that has unintended consequences, the Second Chance Act is very well intentioned. As a former judge, I know well that we have got to do a better job of rehabilitating, of educating, with drug treatment and alcohol treatment for those that are incarcerated in our prisons. There is just no question that we should do a better job with those things. 
   Unfortunately, this well-meaning bill, the Second Chance Act, goes so far beyond what is helpful. This bill will provide more benefits to felons than are available to those risking their lives in the service of our United States military. 
   For example, this bill apparently will provide over $360 million. I say apparently will provide over that amount, because one provision says ``such sums as may be necessary.'' There is no way to know how much money that may be. But, in any event, this bill, for example, seems to leave medical care potentially unending after confinement. 
   I realize as a Republican I was in the minority in our Judiciary Committee hearing, so I attempted to limit the medical care to 6 months after a criminal was released from prison for the extent of the medical care. That was voted down by the majority, who believed that we should leave it open-ended. 
   I was in the United States Army for 4 years, and I can tell you that unless you retire with over 20 years of active military service or you are disabled as a result of your military service, you have no medical care waiting for you at the end of your service. That means if a military member who serves less than 20 years wants a chance at free medical, he will need to commit a serious enough crime to get him locked up. 
   When a military member is sent to serve on one of the many unaccompanied tours of duty, his family suffers greatly, particularly if this is a Reservist or a National Guard member. However, under this Second Chance Act, which is really more of an ``Infinite Chance Act,'' we will provide taxpayer dollars to help with transportation for an inmate's family to get to and from the prison. Grant dollars are there for that.     
   If you are in the military on an unaccompanied tour and you would like to have your children nearby, you are out of luck. However, if you are a confined felon, under this bill there will be tax dollars in the way of grants to pay for nurseries or preschools at the prison so you can have your children close to you. 
   If you are a U.S. servicemember away from home and long to provide your family or your children the technology to ease the distance between you and to ease the loneliness, you either must reach into your small amount of pay, or you could commit a felony and get locked up because there are millions of dollars in this Second Chance bill for grants for technology or tapes or DVD or players, even cell phones, things that help bridge the distance.  
   A criminal may have broken into your home and stolen or destroyed your property, but under the Second Chance Act, we are going to take some more of your tax dollars to help provide criminals or their families with this type of technology. 
   Law enforcement in this country get paid very little compared to the protection they afford us, and they do not get the government to buy such things for their families, but the criminals they lock up under this Democratic majority bill will have this as a bonus. 
   If you are in the military and you want plastic surgery to make you look better, normally you are out of luck for elective surgery. But when I tried to limit this legislation in the Judiciary Committee to prevent tax dollars from being spent for things like rhinoplasty, a nose job, liposuction, breast augmentation, even that amendment was voted down by the majority. 
   Now, if you are a law-abiding citizen and you do not like your field of employment, you have to scrape together enough money to also go to school or be retrained in order to find another job. Not so under this bill if you commit a heinous crime. If you go to prison, there is grant money in this bill, not merely to train you in prison; but after you get out, there is grant money. We can retrain you every time you want to change jobs. We can pay grant money to agencies to find you new jobs. 
   This is a well-intentioned bill, just as the legislation in the 1960s that decided to do something to help mothers, single mothers, unwed mothers who were having children and having to deal with deadbeat fathers. So back in the 1960s, the decision was made, best intentioned, we want to help these single moms so we are going to start as a Federal Government paying for every child you can have out of wedlock. It was well-intentioned, but 40 years later we have gotten exactly what we have paid for. 
   As a broken-hearted judge, I had to sentence women who said they were encouraged to have a baby in order to start getting a government check. So they dropped out of school, had a baby, and then tried to live off the relatively small income they were paid from the government to have babies out of wedlock. And they told me that started their decline into desperation that ultimately led them to my courtroom, either for welfare fraud when they got so desperate they realized they needed to get a job but they couldn't give up their child support from the government, so they didn't report it and then they came to me for welfare fraud. Or some others would realize in desperation they couldn't live on the small amount that the government paid them to have children out of wedlock, so they got into the terrible drug trade and that brought them to my court. 
   I came to Congress deeply desiring to avoid creating benefits for doing something that hurts you. Yet here we are again taking this same kind of well-meaning perilous road. 
   The bill is well-intended, but when Congress creates more benefits for creating serious crimes than for risking life and limb in the United States military, guess which one you will have more of 40 years from now? 
   There are a number of groups who support the Second Chance Act. They have big hearts. They mean well. They want to help criminals turn their lives around; but they don't realize the full parameters of this bill. 
   So we are going to talk a bit tonight about the military, but I wanted to start off and touch on this since it is a bill that provides more benefits for those who commit serious enough crimes to be locked up than we are currently providing for our United States servicemembers in a number of areas, and so I think it needs a second look. I am hopeful that we will be able to do that. I don't know when it comes up if we will be able to make amendments. I certainly hope that the procedures that have been followed so far this year that make this the most partisan Congress in history, there was a rule that was attempted to be changed today that has not been changed since 1822. That would have made it an even more partisan Congress since 1822. 
   So I am glad after a procedural stand taken by the minority that we were able to get that worked out at least for the next couple of weeks and we will be able to have some limited participation. I hope we will be able to have participation in this bill. 
   I see that my colleague and dear friend, the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) is here, another former judge, a recovering judge as he likes to say, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter) is also here. At this time I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).

   Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate the question, and the answer is that this is such a big-hearted bill from the majority that it will be able to provide grants to people in Federal prisons, after they are released from Federal prison, people in State prisons, people in county jails. 
   We are going to make this program, and this is just a start. This $360 million really is just seed money to see how many we can help with that and then take off after that. This is just the beginning. But the answer is it will be for anyone who commits a serious enough offense or alleged offense to get themselves locked up wherever they get locked up in the United States.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Yes, that is absolutely true. But another dimension that is added to this is the fact that it can go on beyond your incarceration. 
   You and I both agree that when it comes to retraining and education and drug and alcohol treatment, we really do need to do a better job of that in prisons. But this goes even beyond that, and there is no end in sight. Like I said, I tried to end some of these benefits at 6 months after release. One of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle asked me what was so magic about 6 months after release from prison. I said there was nothing magic  about it. I think the training and education should end when you are released, but since I am a Republican and I am in the minority, I knew that they didn't want to end it the day you got out of prison. I was hopeful they would be willing to stop spending tax dollars for criminals who had been incarcerated at least 6 months after they are released. Unfortunately, they voted that down. At this point it is open end. As you are aware, we have never continued to provide benefits to convicted felons after they get out of prison.

   I tried to limit it to no plastic surgery in prison. They didn't do that. So, yes. You can continue to apply for medical care.

   And it takes me back to the arguments in this House, on the floor of this House, back in 1935, 1936, when something called Social Security was being created. And I am informed that debate came up regarding this new creation called a Social Security number, and some were upset and they said they were very concerned that that might end up becoming a national identification number. There were people who promised and assured and said there's no way that will ever happen; the Social Security number will be only used to just number the account, it will never be an identification. We can assure you that will never be, that situation, which is kind of like somebody from the government showing up at the door and saying I'm here to help you. You just get really concerned that that's not the case. 
   But I see our friend from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) at the mike. I would yield to Mrs. Blackburn.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my former judge friend. You brought up about our soldiers going door-to-door in Iraq looking for the three soldiers that are missing, how critical intelligence is. 
   Now, I know the gentleman from Texas, my friend, the gentlelady from Tennessee, you both recall, though none of us were in Congress, I recall, because I was in the Army, and when President Carter started making Draconian cuts in our intelligence, and started cutting out critical areas of intelligence that would help us in the military, it hurt. 
   Now, when you are in the military, you cannot say anything derogatory about your Commander in Chief, that is a court martialable offense. 
   But we took up an intelligence bill, and, of course, as we know, some of the information that we have to go up and review in a classified setting, in a top secret setting, and things we learned cannot be revealed and will not be disclosed and divulged, but something that has been discussed on this floor in that intelligence bill is we cut some vital programs. We cut some vital eyes and years information that would help our military to have what they need to know where the enemy is, where they are coming from, what they are doing, those kinds of things.     
   And to help look for global warning evidence, to look for global warming evidence. I don't know about you all, I was seeing just this week some information about the polar ice caps melting, how devastating that can be, how that can bring about the end of the world, and we have to cut CO  
   2 emissions. But the polar ice caps I am talking about were on Mars. 
   Now, how are our CO  
   2 emissions on Earth, staying in our atmosphere, causing the Mars polar ice caps to melt? Gee, could it have something to do with maybe just more sunspots? In any event, that is a whole different matter. 
   The Constitution says we are to provide for the common defense. And when you cut programs that will help with eyes and ears to our military, I don't see how you can go home feeling too good about what we have done. 
   I yield to my friend from Tennessee.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentlelady. You have made some great points. 
   During the 1990s, though, we were assured; we heard so many times all these lies about weapons of mass destruction. And maybe it is unfortunate that it turns out that all the times President Clinton assured us that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, maybe they were right, maybe President Clinton was lying all those times that he said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Maybe Madeline Albright was lying all those times she said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Maybe George Bush should not have believed all the information they provided to him about Iraq having weapons of mass destruction. 
   But, nonetheless, we are now hearing people even in some of the debates and whatnot blaming this President and saying, if we would just leave the jihadist extremists alone, they will leave us alone. 
   And they want to blame President Bush, the current President Bush for our Americans being killed. If you are going to do that, though, you have to blame President Clinton for 9/11 because all the time, he was President. Of course, they tried the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 that failed, and then they began planning for the next, and that was 9/11. 
   Now, I feel like President Clinton made a lot of mistakes, but to blame him for Muslims plotting during the entire time he was President to blow up and kill thousands of Americans doesn't fit, because during his Presidency this country, nearly every time President Clinton committed troops or military assets it was to protect Muslims around the world. And yet all that time the jihadist extremists were plotting to kill thousands of Americans. So this stuff about blaming President Bush doesn't wash. 
   You go back to 1979. I was at Fort Benning. The first jihadist attack, taking our American embassy, that is an act of war. You are attacking American property, that is an act of war. Taking hostages. We did nothing but wring our hands and beg them to let them go. That was a breakdown and that was a glitch right after we fled from Vietnam. It was not a good chapter. 
   But the fact is, there are people that want to destroy our way of life. And we took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. The President did. I know, having taken that oath as a member of the United States military before, that is all taken very seriously. And there are people that want to destroy our way of life. 
   We owe it to them to provide them the common defense. And we see things being weakened here, and it breaks my heart. 
   The American people, any time you see a program cut, whether it is under President Carter, President Clinton, or now under the Democratic majority cutting some intelligence program, and then you find out that it goes to some pork barrel earmark to somebody in the majority, it just breaks your heart, I can tell you, having been in the military when those things happen. And so it is heartbreaking to see the way it looks like we are going to head down that path with this Democratic majority. 
   I would yield to my friend from Texas for further comment.

And I go back to something I said in, January a few months ago, after the Democratic majority rammed another bill through that was going to cut the incentives for drilling, for refineries, some of the things that we have done in the last couple of years that we were here. 
   And I came to the well and I said then, and I will finish with this: If you are going to do things that make gasoline go up, at least have pride enough when the price goes up to come to the floor and say, ``You bet you we are the Democratic majority, and we drove up the price of gas and we are proud of it.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 767, the REPAIR Act, as it is called, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to also congratulate and thank my dear friend from Guam. She gives hope to this country and encouragement by showing that there is class and there is graciousness in this body, and it exists in the delegate from Guam. She also carries that out as chairman of the subcommittee. 
   Now, the effectiveness of the REPAIR Act will be in direct proportion to the amount of money Congress allocates. We simply cannot afford to let our wildlife refuges be systematically destroyed by invasive species, and that is happening. This legislation is a positive step because it offers hope in the fight against invasives in the future. 
   One such species is the giant silvinia, a plant that has made its way across many lakes as it has entered Texas. It is a small harmless-looking little aquatic plant that finds itself on boat trailers leaving a lake. When the boat trailer is lowered into another lake, the nightmare floating plant finds itself in a new lake, and it can take over. It doubles its size in less than a week, and in no time covers acres, shutting off sunlight, killing off plants underneath, which results in aquatic life dying. It must be fought and eradicated without doing damage to the lake during the fight. Such a battle takes many good minds and hard workers coming together to prevent this creeping menace from being the last thing left in a lake alive. 
   In Louisiana, there are cities like Shreveport whose sources of drinking water are being put in jeopardy by this freak of nature. Just recently I toured Caddo Lake, the largest freshwater natural lake at one time and a true treasure for America with its cypress trees, Spanish moss, and unusual fish. We had a joint task force of biologists and brilliant environmental problem-solvers from Federal, State, private groups, who all had the same goal: eradicate the invasion of this foreign species without doing damage to the lake. 
   I just want to read a list of the types of people that are willing to come together when we deal with something that is such a grave threat to our water supplies. 
   We had Dan Turner, representing Congressman JIM MCCRERY of Louisiana; Ken Shaw, chairman, Cypress Valley Navigation District; Robert Speight, President, Greater Caddo Lake Association; Jack Canson, community response coordinator; Mark Williams, U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Caddo Lake National Wildlife Refuge manager; Al Tasker, USDA/Animal Plant Health Inspection Service; Dustin Grant, USDA/Plant Protection and Quarantine, State operations support officer; Dr. Earl Chilton, Texas Parks & Wildlife, and a member of the Invasive Species Advisory Committee for the National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior; Paul Hoffman, Deputy Assistant Secretary, Department of Interior/NISC; also Dr. Michael Grodowitz, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, biocontrol expert; Dr. Randy Westbrooks, U.S. Geological Survey, invasive plant coordinator; Judge Richard Anderson, Harrison County judge; Jerry Lomax, Harrison County Precinct 1 commissioner; C.E. Bourne, Marion County Precinct 3 commissioner for Judge Parker; Sam Canup, mayor of the City of Uncertain, and that is a real city, Uncertain, Texas; Jay Webb, Caddo Lake Chamber of Commerce; Bill Abney, Red River Compact; Walt Sears, manager, Northeast Texas Municipal Water District; Dwight Shellman, Caddo Lake Institute; Todd Dickenson, manager, Caddo Lake State Park; Alan Grantham, Dallas Caddo Club; Connie Ware, Marshall Chamber of Commerce; Dr. Jim Harris, Marshall Chamber of Commerce, Water Committee Chair; and Sam Moseley of Marshall. 
   It just points up how important what this bill addresses is. These are invasive species that come into lakes and to parks and take over and destroy the native habitat that we are trying to preserve. I have to say, when we had this meeting that went on for a number of hours, I don't recall one time during the entire meeting where anybody ever asked what party anybody ever supported politically. It was all about trying to protect what God had graced this country with, and it is wonderful to see that kind of support. 
   But what is very clear is that we cannot fight off these nonnative invasive species unless we work together in a bipartisan, in a cumulative fashion with all these different scientists, biologists, governmental groups coming together, because it affects so many different areas. It's one of the reasons I am so grateful to my friend from Guam and for all of those that have worked to help make this possible. We have got to preserve what we have got, and this is one of the ways to do it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, once again, some people advocate mechanical removal of an invasive species; others advocate using natural means, whether it's an insect or a fish or something to help control an invasive species. Some offer that there are chemical means for dealing with those. 
   But unless we come together on a bill like this, bringing all the different entities with all the difference weapons  at their command, we are not going to be able to control some of these species. Some of them, like the giant silvinia, are so resistant to so much, and they hide among other plants until they take over and just spread so rapidly, that we must come together. 
   It is gratifying to see such bipartisan effort in trying to hold on to the land we love.

   Mr. Speaker, this legislation, sponsored by our California colleague and former Water and Power Subcommittee Chair GEORGE RADANOVICH, authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in the design and construction of the Madera Water Supply and Enhancement Project. 
   Due to a rapidly growing population and lawsuits filed, once again we hear about those lawsuits filed by San Francisco-based environmental organizations, the San Joaquin Valley of California faces increasing demands on its limited water supply. If excess water in the San Joaquin River exists, this project would store those flows in a nearby aquifer underneath the 13,000-acre Madera Ranch. This stored water bank could prove critical to meeting demands in dry years. 
   This legislation also unilaterally declares the project feasible, which is something the bureaucracy would normally take years and much paperwork to decide. We commend the majority for agreeing to this rarely-used congressional declaration for a water storage project. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my colleague across the aisle again, a Member of Congress with true grace and class. I appreciate her work on these bills, and I urge my colleagues to support this particular legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (PLATTE RIVER RECOVERY IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM AND PATHFINDER MODIFICATION AUTHORIZATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 1462 stems from endangered species conflicts along the Platte River. As a result of lawsuits and the real threat of water and power infrastructure being shut down over endangered species conflicts, the Federal Government, three States, water and power users, and environmental organizations came together on the Platte River Recovery Program, and this legislation implements part of that program. The result is that existing water and power infrastructure is protected while a collaborative and far-reaching program to help save four different species begins. 
   Since this program is contingent upon Federal appropriations and a State can opt out, the governance committee charged with implementing the program has the enormous responsibility of keeping all stakeholders together, conversing with affected parties, communities and landowners on land and water issues and finding real results. Congress will continue to have oversight on this program to see if it is being run effectively and efficiently. This legislation, if implemented properly, can be a win-win for both the people and species of the Platte River basin. 
   Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, let me just emphasize again there were so many interests at work here. I don't know if anybody is totally thrilled with the result, but it seemed to be an appropriate way to bring what could be  done together to come about with a result that will require oversight, will require monitoring. But under the circumstances to keep things from being totally shut down, we would encourage our colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 813. 
   H.R. 813 does enjoy bipartisan support from the Orange County, California delegation. This legislation seeks to reduce Southern California's dependence on imported water by helping localities build needed desalinization infrastructure in the region. 
   Congressman GARY MILLER's bill could not be considered at a better time since millions of water consumers in Southern California may soon feel the brunt of water rationing due to a lawsuit and subsequent judicial decision reducing water deliveries to the region. 
   A number of our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, sent a letter over a month ago requesting that the Democratic majority hold a hearing on the impacts of this decision. This Congress needs to recognize that people are a part of the water equation as well in this endangered species debate. We hope the majority will work with us on this important hearing and ways to avoid future water shut-offs. 
   This legislation may be too late to mitigate harmful lawsuits and judicial decisions, but it will help in the long term; and that is why we support the bill.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I believe the bill has been properly explained. 
   I would like to add a personal touch as a Member of Congress from Texas. We are proud that a Texan like Dwight Eisenhower is being honored. Not many people are aware, since he grew up in Kansas, that he was born in Denison, Texas, but there was so much about this great man to be admired. It is a wonderful tribute, and of course, as chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee has indicated, this is not the beginning of the process. This is continuing the ongoing process to make this a reality. 
   So we are very pleased that it's occurring. Of course, from a personal standpoint, I like the fact that he was a Republican and especially liked his hairline, but especially what he did for this Nation and shoring us up, protecting us in World War II, guiding this Nation as its President. This is a wonderful tribute, and I appreciate the work of the chairman in bringing this about. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I do thank my colleague from the Virgin Islands for outlining H.R. 53. 
   Two-thirds of the island of St. John is comprised of the Virgin Islands National Park. The park's dominant size is negatively impacting the quality of life for the growing population there at St. John. Without utilizing the park land, there is no other suitable property to build a school on St. John. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the bill. We had hoped to consider an amendment to convey the property outright for the school, as was offered, but then withdrawn by Congressman JEFF FLAKE during our committee consideration of this bill. 
   However, Chairman Rahall has given his support for other long-term leases, and this bill does establish an important precedent for the National Park Service. 
   We support the bill. It is for a great purpose. I would urge my colleagues to support this, since we don't have an amendment to give it outright to my colleague, but, in the meantime, we support this bill and wish the project well.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1803 and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This important legislation was introduced by our colleagues from California, President--not President yet--Duncan Hunter and Susan Davis, both colleagues here in Congress. It represents the first step in expanding increasingly scarce water supplies for the citizens of the San Diego area. 
   This bill authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to assess the feasibility of constructing an intertie system between four reservoirs. Several of these reservoirs are significantly below capacity in most years. Once interconnected, water could then be transported to the unused space. 
   Growing populations and reduced water storage opportunities require us to make efficient use of the supplies that we have, and this bill does just that. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bill, which also passed the House in the last Congress. It also follows the adage that an east Texan once told me, ``Use what you got.'' This will allow us to do that. I urge support of this bill.

   Coral reefs are truly a treasure, but they mean the world to the aquatic life in those areas.

It does involve matching grants, and it provides it in areas under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, while H.R. 189 went through both a hearing and a full committee, but not subcommittee, markup, several issues have gone unresolved. The National Park Service conducted a study as requested by this body to determine whether the Great Falls Historic District in Paterson, New Jersey, should become a national park. The study concluded that the area did not meet the criteria for inclusion in the National Park System. 
   Now, if we entrust the National Park Service with the management of our own crown jewels, then why are we ignoring their expert judgment that this should not be a national park? I remind my colleagues that we requested the park service to tell us what should be done here. 
   I recognize also it is our responsibility and our right as the legislative branch to decide what will become a national park regardless of what the park service tells us. There are times when it is necessary to disagree with them. However, in this case, we do not even know what the costs are. We don't know, nor does the park service have any idea, how it would manage the area. That is what we asked them to tell us and they are not in a position to do that at this time. 
   Now, the park service has already got a full plate and a billion dollar maintenance backlog. They are not even keeping up with and taking care of the parks that have been entrusted to them. So is this really the time to add another park that doesn't meet the criteria to add to this burden with this designation?

   We have been hearing for the last week how important it is for poor children to have health care insurance. There are so many priorities; yet there are thousands and thousands of wonderfully historic significant pieces of property. No one, I would hope, would dare say that this area was not significant.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but I understand, and I have not had the privilege of visiting the Great Falls area, it is supposed to be one of the most beautiful areas and I am greatly appreciative of that. As I understand, this area is expected to include a microbrewery, a climbing wall, and an apartment complex is what was brought to my attention. And these of course raise other issues of liability. When we look around the country at all of the parks that are struggling right now to take care of their needs because the park service is a billion dollars in arrears as far as taking care of their current obligations, it should cause us to look carefully and go slowly in absorbing other land until we have the wherewithal to do so and the park service is able to work with Congress to come up with a solid plan to care for the park. 
   There are also other issues when you bring in these other things like a microbrewery, a climbing wall, and an apartment complex regarding liabilities that may arise. There are so many questions still out there yet to be resolved. 
   I have to say with regard to the Resources Committee, I am well pleased there are so many things that are completely bipartisan, and we have a number of them today. But because of the issues involved here, we will be asking our colleagues to vote ``no'' until we have a better plan.

   I thank my friend from California for his work on this bill, and thank the chairman of the committee and also the ranking members of the subcommittee and committee. 
   I am delighted to see us conclude today our consideration of H.R. 3564 which would reauthorize the Administrative Conference of the United States. The bill we consider today was amended slightly by the Senate which required this action by us today. But I strongly urge the House to concur in the Senate's amendment today. I also urge the Appropriations Committee and the House to appropriate funds promptly to ACUS. We need this exemplary agency once again to become a living, breathing entity and reality. 
   So why is that? As the distinguished Member from Utah (Mr. Cannon) remarked when we originally voted out the bill, and quoting from prior adage,  ``The government that governs best, governs least. And when the government does govern, it should govern at its best.'' He is exactly right. That is the role of ACUS, to ensure that when the government acts, it acts at its best. 
   The small appropriations that we historically invested in ACUS yielded us major overall savings in time and in money. ACUS consistently pinpointed ways for the government to reduce the cost it incurs and that it imposes. As we confront the specter of exploding Social Security and Medicare entitlement costs hijacking the Federal budget, we need ACUS all the more. We must do everything we can to avoid waste in our spending and to lighten the government burden on our economy. By reauthorizing and refunding ACUS, we can take important steps in that effort. I again thank the gentleman from California for his work.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (HONORING THURGOOD MARSHALL ON THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS BIRTH -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my friend from California, I thank the chairman of the committee, the ranking member of the committee, and those who have worked on this bill. 
   I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 381 honoring and recognizing the dedication and achievements of Thurgood Marshall on the 100th anniversary of his birth. 
   Thurgood Marshall, born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 2, 1908, was the grandson of a slave. But after graduating first in his class from Howard Law School in 1933, he went on to serve as the legal director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and argued over 30 cases before the Supreme Court of the United States. He won 29 of them, including the landmark decision Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which held that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. 
   Thurgood Marshall, as most people know, was later nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the  Second Circuit by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. He served there as the first African American Solicitor General from 1965 to 1967. And in 1967, he was nominated by President Johnson to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court, its first African American member. 
   I recall the days before I took the oath as a district judge back in Texas. I was told by a retired judge who was dying of cancer that it was a good job and a noble job, but that it would be the loneliest job I had ever held. I can only imagine that would have been true for any Supreme Court Justice, but particularly true for the first African American Justice on the Supreme Court. It had to be a lonely job; yet he honored himself and he honored this country with his brilliant work. 
   Thurgood Marshall will be remembered for the many Supreme Court decisions he had a hand in writing, including the concurring opinion in Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints v. Amos. 
   Justice Marshall made so much in the way of contributions that are so far-reaching and still very timely today. For example, we have had the remaining Presidential candidates of both political parties express support for allowing faith-based organizations to take part in Federal social service programs. So it is worth remembering that in the Amos case Justice Marshall joined with Justice Brennan in stating that section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was constitutional. That section of the Civil Rights Act has, from its inception, exempted nonprofit, private religious organizations engaged in both religious and secular nonprofit activities from title VII's prohibition on discrimination in employment on the basis of religion. If religious organizations are to be allowed to join Federal social service efforts, they must be allowed to remain religious organizations, and they can only do so if they are allowed to be free to compose themselves of individuals who share their religious world view. Justice Marshall recognized that, and so should we. 
   He even had something to say about vouchers for education. In Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind, Justice Marshall upheld a voucher program in which ``vocational assistance is provided under a program that is paid directly to the student, who transmits it to the educational institution of his or her choice.'' Justice Marshall held that such programs are constitutional where the resources ``ultimately flow to religious institutions as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.'' 
   It is also worth noting that he did allow exception to the Civil Rights Act to allow religious institutions to hire people who agreed with their religious beliefs. 
   I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting House Concurrent Resolution 381 in recognizing Justice Marshall's judicial legacy. It was profound, it was far-reaching, and it changed the country for the good. That rich legacy includes his support for the right of religious organizations to maintain their religious identity, for government voucher programs that allow individuals to exercise free and independent choices, even when those best choices or services are provided by religious organizations. It is a real honor for me to get to honor the legacy of Thurgood Marshall. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (HONORING THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION ON ITS 35TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 369. This concurrent resolution does honor the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration on the occasion of its 35th anniversary. 
   The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, was created by President Nixon in July 1973. The DEA was established to create a single unified command to conduct ``an all-out global war on the drug menace.'' 
   The DEA has the core mission to enforce U.S. controlled substances laws that regulate drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy and controlled prescription drugs. Initially, the DEA had 1,470 special agents and a budget of less than $75 million. Its foreign presence consisted of 43 foreign offices in 31 countries. Since that time the DEA has grown substantially and is now 5,235 special agents, a budget of more than $2.3 billion, and 87 foreign offices in 63 countries. 
   I have personally seen them at work, both here and abroad, and know that the DEA agents are on the front lines of our war on drugs. They are courageous individuals, and they are to be honored and commended. 
   DEA special agents work to track and identify the individuals and organized crime syndicates that grow, manufacture and traffic drugs into the U.S. To accomplish that mission, the DEA manages a national drug intelligence program by cooperating with Federal, State, local and foreign officials to collect, analyze and disseminate strategic and operational drug intelligence information. The DEA and its multi-jurisdictional partners form task forces that use this intelligence to plan highly successful operations. 
   In May, a DEA-led task force completed an investigation called ``Operation Sudden Fall'' in San Diego. This investigation resulted in the arrest of 96 individuals, including 75 San Diego State University students who were involved with the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana and Ecstasy on the university's campus. 
   As the plague of drugs has become more pervasive, the DEA has also increased its international efforts to combat drug trafficking abroad. The DEA coordinates with the United Nations, Interpol and foreign governments to develop programs designed to reduce the availability of illicit drugs in the United States such as crop eradication, crop substitution and training of foreign officials.     
   These international efforts bring significant results. Recently, Colombia extradited 14 members of a paramilitary and drug trafficking group to the United States to face charges of drug trafficking, support to a terrorist organization, and money laundering. 
   In June, the DEA worked with partners in Afghanistan to conduct Operation Albatross. This effort resulted in the seizure of 262 tons of hashish, the largest of any known drug seizure in history. 
   As H. Con. Res. 369 notes, in this decade alone, DEA agents have seized over 5,500 kilograms of heroin, 650,000 kilograms of cocaine, 2.3 million kilograms of marijuana, 13,000 kilograms of methamphetamine, almost 80 million dosage units of hallucinogens, and made over 240,000 arrests. This is a tremendous amount of poison that they have prevented from entering our fellow citizens. 
   In supporting this resolution, I join my colleagues in, one, congratulating the DEA on the occasion of its 35th anniversary; two, honoring the heroic sacrifice of the agency's employees who have given their lives or have been wounded or injured in service of our Nation; and three, giving heartfelt thanks to all of the men and women of the DEA for their past and continued efforts to defend the American people from the scourge of illegal drugs and terrorism. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. First I've got to comment on some things we heard previously. We heard the right honorable  chairman indicate that the last motion to recommit was designed to delay. If it was merely designed to delay, then why in the world was the bill pulled from the floor and sat on for 4 weeks? The answer: it was not for delay. We had some serious considerations and questions and points to be made about the risk that this was raising. 
   When I hear my friend from Texas talk about those who love liberty, listen, some of us love liberty enough that we believe the Constitution should not be extended on the battlefield to those who are trying to destroy what our forefathers and foremothers have fought and died to give us. 
   Now, unless the Democrats believe that they have improved this bill, then there was no reason for a month delay. So either you improved it, Mr. Speaker, either the Democrats improved it or there was no reason to sit on it for a month. And if they did improve it, then the motion to recommit was not political, but apparently helpful. 
   The problem is this doesn't fix the problems. And unless one party in this body has 100 percent on God's truth all the time, they ought to allow some input from the other side. We were told that was going to happen. It hasn't happened here. We went to the Rules Committee the last time and were shut out. Before the hearing started we were told, put on your evidence but no amendments will be allowed. This time, once again, no amendments are allowed. There is some expertise in this body outside the Democratic Party. I would think it would be helpful to hear some of that. 
   Anyway, let's look at the bill itself. We are told, well, we can't get into it, we have limited time. Who did that? The Rules Committee did that. The Rules Committee did that. 
   I would say to everyone, Mr. Speaker, that we have some smart people on both sides of the aisle on the Rules Committee, but their talents are being wasted when they keep having Rules Committee meetings that come back over and over, no amendments. They are wasting their time. They ought to ask for different committees because there is too much intelligence and talent on that committee to waste it like that. 
   Now, in this new bill that we've got, we had to make amendments without even seeing the new bill. How outrageous is that? But still, we have the requirement that the Director of National Intelligence, and I realize some people think he is suspect on the Democratic side because he worked for the Clinton administration for 6 years. I think he is a brilliant, sharp fellow. 
   But anyway, he testified before our Judiciary Committee that he cannot swear, nobody can honestly swear that they reasonably believe that a terrorist on foreign soil will never call the United States. Therefore, since he can't testify to that, they can't use this provision. 
   We are told this is protective because in the emergency provision that is allowed, all you have to do is get that emergency relief, and you can get that in 7 days instead of 15. Even under the emergency relief, you have to reasonably believe there will never be a call into the United States, and we had testimony that can never be done. 
   This guts our foreign intelligence capability. I think the easier thing to do is just have everybody tell their U.S. friends that if you are getting calls from foreign terrorists, tell them not to call, use some other means of communication. That's the point.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, to be accused of partisan maneuvering is pretty insulting. Some of us are not concerned about partisan maneuvering; we are concerned about the security of the United States. That is why I am here right now, not because of partisan maneuvering. 
   Do you want to talk partisan maneuvering? How about when I go out to get a copy of the most current bill and we have got a bait and switch. This isn't even the most current bill out there that we can get ahold of to come in and talk about. But I know the provision, and I appreciate my fine chairman talking about we have taken care of emergency situations, and then we had two Members just talk about emergency situations. 
   If you take these provisions, and hopefully the part I am talking about is the latest, that is the way I understand from what you are talking about, it says specifically in here, yeah, there is an emergency provision, but in order to get it, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral McConnell, who was the National Security Advisor for President Clinton, he and the Attorney General have to jointly be able to swear that the targets of their acquisition are not reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States and they are not reasonably believed to be United States persons. 
   You take that with their testimony, the testimony was I cannot ever swear that. The way you do this intelligence is you go after a foreign target, and I can never testify, he said, as to who the person will be that they call. I can never testify that I reasonably believe they will be outside the United States when they call or that they will not be a United States person. 
   So, if he comes in and does this after he has testified ``I cannot say I reasonably believe that they will not call somebody in the U.S., when I don't know who they will call,'' then we got problems. This does not protect the problem. We need to vote ``no.''

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have heard the term ``bipartisan'' with regard to this legislation, and as has been pointed out, there has been bipartisan support; but there has certainly been bipartisan opposition. 
   Bipartisan, to many out there in the United States, means, oh, it must be fair. But the truth is, bipartisan doesn't mean fair, and it doesn't mean good; and this is one of those pieces of legislation that has severe problems that are neither fair nor good. 
   Now in committee, the process involved a manager's amendment being made in the Committee of the Whole of the Judiciary Committee, followed immediately by an amendment to venue before anybody else was recognized so that an effort by me to have an amendment to fix venue problems that were really pronounced was shut out because that automatically made those third-degree amendments. 
   That seemed to me a strange effort to avoid fairness on this important bill. We come in here today with this restrictive rule which will not allow full debate and wonder why is there such haste to avoid fairness in this rule. The rule here even abrogates the House rule that requires half the time be provided to the opposition, by saying it will be controlled by two people who both support the bill. 
   Again, why is there such a push to avoid fairness in consideration and debate on this bill? ``We need a comprehensive bill'' is language we have heard over and over. What struck me was, gee, that's what we heard about the immigration debate: we need a comprehensive bill. Why was that said about immigration? I submit it was said because there were things that people wanted to hide in a comprehensive bill that could never pass on its own. 
   So I begin to look at this bill, and it appears to have the same problem. There are things in here that don't go to fix patent controls. There is such an overreaching effort here to change rules and help the big dogs just devour and destroy the little guys.  
   Now the patent control issue, that's a problem. Boy, how easy to fix that. All you would have to do is say if you are not the original patent holder and inventor, then your rights are restricted. But that keeps being thrown out as a basis to destroy and change and use a wrecking ball to the entire patent law. 
   The damages issues need a further look. My goodness, for so many years now the patent issues have been guided by factors that allow the courts to consider various types of damages. Now we have had one industry zero in on one time of damage that will help them and hurt all others. That's not fair. 
   We were told that in the Judiciary Committee that many of us, by name, were called who would help the language. Since then, I have not heard of any meetings to work on language. My staff has not heard of any. 
   Yet, we are told in here today, trust us, we are going to work together. This isn't the last time. I have heard over and over on that bill, and to come to this point, where there is so much substantial unfairness and abrogation of the fairness doctrine on taking up legislation concerns me all the more. 
   This isn't fair. It's not good. It's not right. It's not timely to take this up without proper discourse. 
   With that, I would ask that trust has not been earned. Therefore, people should vote against this rule on a bipartisan basis.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the ranking member. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are some things that need repair in the U.S. patent system, but something about this bill kept troubling me. When I read the provision regarding the transfer of venue, I began to realize something was very wrong. The provision said the court may transfer an action only to a district where ``the defendant had substantial evidence or witnesses.'' 
   I could not believe it. That provision did not even allow a judge to consider fairness or justice or caseloads or time delays or whether the plaintiff was a small entrepreneur with only a few patents who could be led to bankruptcy by being forced to file in a court where it had a 5-year delay. I would have been absolutely staggered during my years as a judge to see a venue provision like this. Many agreed and realized that was grossly overreaching and proponents of the bill immediately recognized that and were willing to work. 
   But patent cases increased in the Eastern District of Texas when companies like Texas Instruments realized they could get a trial within 18 months in front of some of the best judges in the country and get fairness. Initially, there were more plaintiff victories, but, as I understand, the last year or so it has been 50-50, which there is nowhere in the country comparable to that. 
   I began to realize something was very wrong and one-sided when something like that could get into a bill, and especially the manager's amendment, without being noticed. And who would want something like that? Then you realize, it is big companies who do not want others to have the opportunities that they did. 
   So that made me look again at the damage provision that was being completely changed. I realized to whom that was helping and whom that would destroy, and I realized that the language for that must have come from the same type source who did not want anything but a small cookie cutter or mold to consider damages when, for years now, there have been many more factors that needed to be considered. You have drug cases. You have objects that are patented. You have concepts.  
   The Comprehensive Patent Reform bill being pushed at this time has some good features. 
   There are some things that need repair in the U.S. patent system. But, something about this bill kept troubling me. 
   When I read the provision regarding the transfer of venue, I began to realize something was very wrong. The provision said that the court may transfer an action only to a district where ``the defendant has substantial evidence or witnesses.'' That provision did not even allow the judge to consider fairness, or justice, or case loads and time delays of other courts or whether the plaintiff was a small entrepreneur with only a few patents who will be destroyed if the case is transferred to a court with a 5-year wait to trial. In my days as a trial judge, I would have been absolutely staggered to see a venue rule so incredibly one-sided. It was grossly overreaching and proponents of the bill immediately recognized that when it was pointed out, but they just had not noticed that. They then agreed to changes that prevent the language from being quite so egregious. 
   As our colleague from the high tech area of California pointed out moments ago, there have been patent cases filed in the Eastern District of Texas in my district. That began happening when Texas Instruments, not some small patent troll, along with others who had patents being infringed, could not get a prompt trial elsewhere, realized the Eastern District of Texas had some of the best judicial minds who were rarely ever reversed, and they could receive a trial within 2 years instead of 5. So lawsuits were filed there. As far as the rates of victories by plaintiffs to defendants, she cited old data and the new data shows that the district being excoriated in the past year probably has had more equality of verdicts than anywhere else in the country, which means the issue is a red herring for something else to get passed that is potentially deadly to invention. 
   I agreed we needed to do something about patent trolls who buy patents so they can sue to try to hold up a company for cash. I agreed that's not right. I was willing to help fix it. But after proposing solutions to that which were met by a desire to use that issue only as an excuse to make comprehensive, devastating changes to two centuries of patent law, I realized something inappropriate was at work here. 
   I began to realize something was very wrong for a terribly one-sided provision to make its way into the official bill being considered as a Manager's Amendment at the full Judiciary Committee. I began to think about who must have written or at least pushed to get that type of totally one-sided provision in there. It was not anyone interested in fairness. It was someone interested in really tilting the playing field completely one way. That had to be from huge defendants who wanted to drag small entrepreneurs into dilatory situations so that their invention or component could be usurped without proper compensation, even though it might mean the bankruptcy of the inventor and the destruction of the opportunity for the little guys with the inventive vision and spirit, which actually spurred some of the greatest developments and wealth we know and have in this country. 
   So when I looked again at the damage provision that was being completely changed, I realized whom that was helping and whom that would destroy and I realized that language came from the same type source. It is extremely one-sided and completely abrogates the ability of a court to use factors or standards that are applicable in the vast variety of patent cases which arise. Patents are obtained for so many different types of objects, drugs, and even concepts. To try to force such a huge spectrum of patents into one small specific type of cookie cutter or mold is of great concern to so many. 
   Then, I remembered also something about this ``comprehensive'' type approach--that's what was being said about immigration reform!! In the case of Immigration, ``Comprehensive Reform'' was being used to make some changes most of us could probably agree on in order to mask within those acceptable 
   provisions other problematic provisions unacceptable to most Americans which could probably not pass by themselves. After finding examples of inappropriately oppressive language that was being stuffed or hidden in a large comprehensive bill, I am left wondering why not just fix the limited areas that are agreeable and not shove a brand new comprehensive, revolutionary change--that some say will absolutely set over 200 years of patent law on its head--that may give some of the largest corporations in the country the ability to prevent others from having the same opportunities they had to become large. 
   It is real easy to continue to excoriate these horrid ``patent trolls'', which could easily be addressed by very small changes to a very limited provision. If you want to limit patent trolls, then restrict the abilities of those who purchase the patents or rights to sue as secondary holders of patents. If that is not enough, there are other limited ways to handle it, though one must be careful not to destroy principal patent assets after a company is bought out by another. But I would humbly submit that when an easy fix is rejected to such a problem because some desire the issue to mask an effort that may well denigrate or destroy the adequate ability to preserve such assets--something is amiss in Washington, DC. 
   As objections from many areas have grown, the private interests pushing this bill have realized they may have pushed too far too fast, so have sought to appear less draconian, but we must review what this bill does. The bill before us today completely changes: The damages or compensation that may be obtained from a wrongdoer for stealing or usurping someone else's patent; the law on where such suits for infringement may be filed; the effect of a patent; the law on administrative review of patents and privacy issues of the patent before it is final. Is it any wonder that the worst thieves nationally and internationally of U.S. intellectual property are hoping we pass this bill. 
   It is also important to point out that we have heard here today promises about things that will be fixed between now and when the law were to become law. We've been told that our input is welcome toward such fixes. The trouble is, we were told the same thing at the full committee. I was one who was called by name to help the group work on fixes to major problems. Though I am not questioning motivation at this juncture, I have made myself available to meet and have offered suggestions, but the group that was going to meet and work on the changes before today never met that I was advised. My staff says they were never advised. So much for getting in that valuable input. 
   The question remains: do we need this much of a complete change to a system that has spurred, nurtured and protected the greatest advancements in the history of mankind. I would submit that it is imperative that we back up, vote this down, and come back with non-comprehensive provisions that do not include provisions that will tilt the playing field and so dramatically change our laws to protect intellectual property rights. We should borrow from the old Code in Medicine to first do no harm!

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate so much my friend from California. And, in fact, I like Mr. Issa so much, I want more people like DARRELL ISSA. I want more people to have the opportunity to create patents, to use ingenuity, to do well based on their thought processes. And I'm afraid now this bill will prevent us from having the opportunity to have more DARRELL ISSAS. 
   The amendment works on one of the problems, well, gee, we'll look at the regulations. But, my goodness, this is a comprehensive bill. We keep hearing, you know, we need comprehensive bills. And red flags went up in my mind. And where have I heard that? Oh, yes, on immigration reform. We had to have a comprehensive bill because there were some things that needed to be passed, some people thought, that they knew could not pass if they had the bright enough light of day shown on them, and so we have a comprehensive bill to put some things in there that do more damage than good. 
   We need more time to look at these provisions so that we can ensure that there are more DARRELL ISSAS that get to have the same opportunities to do as well and make us as proud as our good friend from California.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (HONORING THE LIFE OF SCOTT BURNS DURING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK -- (House of Representatives - May 06, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   Mr. Speaker, next week is National Police Week, a time for us to recognize those who boldly serve in municipal, county, State and Federal law enforcement. Furthermore, on May 15, we will observe National Peace Officers Memorial Day to honor those who have been disabled or killed in the line of duty. They have made the ultimate sacrifice for the safety of their fellow citizens. 
   The peace of mind we are afforded thanks to the dedicated service of our law officers is invaluable, but many times we aren't immediately aware at what price that security comes. However, this past weekend, my constituents and I were painfully reminded me of the very real danger that our law enforcement officers and agents battle daily. On Saturday, May 3, hundreds and hundreds of us mourned the loss of Texas State Trooper James Scott Burns at his funeral in Linden. Scott was killed by shotgun blasts from a killer who he chased and pulled over on April 29 while doing his job of service to his fellow citizens. He left a widow and a 6-month-old daughter, of whom he was extremely proud. He also left a huge family that was both related by blood and related by spirit who care deeply about him. 
   The overwhelming support shown by family, friends and fellow law enforcement officers was truly a testament to Trooper Burns' lovable nature, his sense of humor, his honorable character, but most important his sense of service for others. His loving family is now forced to carry on without him and the world is worse off without him unless we perpetuate the good that he did in his life through the things that we do in the future so that he will not have lived in vain. Though Scott's being killed by the possibly drug-crazed killer meant that others were not also killed, Scott's greatest contribution came not in the way that he died but in the way that he lived. 
   The extraordinary choice by Scott Burns and other law officers to protect our communities means that they go to work every day knowing and believing the words that came from Jesus himself when He said, ``Greater love hath no one than this, that a person lay down his life for his friends.'' 
   Our law enforcement officers dedicate themselves to protecting citizens knowing that they may very well lay down their lives to protect others. No words can adequately express the gratitude that's due them. Scott's family will hopefully find solace from so many who showed their support in the past and will do so in the future. The fact that the funeral processional extended for so many, many miles down Highway 59 from Linden to the cemetery will hopefully provide some solace. It also shows that those who are affected by Scott and his life will not forget. Law officers from around east Texas, from the State of Texas at large as well as from all over the country came and were there. 
   As a former prosecutor, a former judge and chief justice and now as a member of the House Judiciary Committee and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, it is both a sobering privilege and a priority to address  issues and legislation regarding the security of our law enforcement community and the American people. There is no greater function of the Federal Government than to provide for the common defense against all enemies, both foreign and domestic. 
   Therefore, it is imperative that we work to support our law enforcement officers and agents and their families by providing them with the training and resources they need to properly carry out their duties. Furthermore, there should be greater incentives in place to encourage harsher sentences for violent offenders who might otherwise be released to the streets and repeat dangerous offenses. 
   While law enforcement officers risk their own safety every day for the well-being of our Nation and local communities, Congress must do as much as possible to ensure the preparedness and security of our noble crime fighters. As we prepare next week to nationally honor the courage of police officers like our own Texas State Trooper Scott Burns, let us consider the well-being of our law enforcement officers and their families with the same persistence and selflessness with which they afford us.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. Con. Res. 62 to correct the enrollment of H.R. 660, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007. I would also like to commend the Speaker, and through the Speaker, our chairman. I assume you are the people responsible for the added heat in the room today. I presume that is to help light a fire under the majority to help get the business done today, and I applaud that. 
   Madam Speaker, today the House will consider H.R. 660, a bill to improve court security and ensure the safety of those who dedicate their lives to America's judicial system, as well as to the safety of millions of Americans who visit our courthouses every day. 
   This concurrent resolution substitutes section 502 of H.R. 660 to make a technical correction to the bill and allow the House to move forward in order to consider the important bipartisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to adopt this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 660, the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007, and I would like to commend the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Conyers. We do disagree on issues often enough, but he is the consummate gentleman, he is the consummate chairman, and I have always found him to be fair, and appreciate his effort and his work in pushing this bill to make it become law.     
   This legislation then is truly bipartisan. It is bicameral. And it is to improve the security of those who administer our justice system, as well as those it serves, such as witnesses, victims and their families. 
   Just this week the Senate approved this legislation, making several improvements to the bill. In recent years we've seen an increase in violence and threats against judges, prosecutors, defense counsel, law enforcement officers, and courthouse employees. It is critical that we address this violence in order to preserve the integrity of and public confidence in our justice system. 
   As I explain to litigants in my courtroom as a judge, it may be that the courtroom ends up being the last bastion of civility in America, but we will have civility in our courtroom. There will be no violence. Everyone will come in regardless of what happened outside the courtroom. We will sit. We will stand when it's your turn, you will speak when it's your turn, and we will abide by the rules as we try to do here in the House. 
   But the murders of family members of U.S. District Judge Joan Lefkow and the brutal slayings of Judge Roland Barton and his court personnel in Atlanta are just a few of the many examples that underscore the need to better protect those who serve our judiciary and their families. 
   According to the Administrative Office of U.S. Courts, almost 700 threats a year are made against Federal judges. In numerous cases it has been necessary to assign Federal judges security details for fear of attack by terrorists, violent gangs, drug organizations, and disgruntled litigants. As a former State district judge, I'm familiar with such threats personally. Threats against me personally didn't actually worry me until they were made against my family. 
   On looking at Federal law and the penalties, there was a disparity in the penalties for a crime against some family members of court personnel and Federal law enforcement which needed to be addressed. That's what caused me to go to work on this area last Congress, and I'm so pleased that this may actually become law in this Congress. 
   The problem with witnesses being intimidated as well as threats toward witnesses has also continued to grow, particularly at the State and local level where few resources are available to protect witnesses, victims and their families. 
   H.R. 660 improves coordination between the U.S. marshals and the Federal judiciary and bolsters security measures for Federal prosecutors handling dangerous trials against terrorists, drug organizations and organized crime figures. 
   The bill also prohibits public disclosure on the Internet or other public sources of personal information about judges, law enforcement officers, victims and witnesses, and protects Federal judges and prosecutors from organized efforts to harass and intimidate them through false filing of liens or other encumbrances against personal property. 
   Additionally, H.R. 660 provides grants to States and local courts to improve their security services. 
   I want to thank the majority for working with us to include other important provisions that were not in the  original legislation earlier in this Congress. Although there are still some provisions I would like to have seen, this bill includes so many excellent provisions. I do applaud the chairman and the others on the committee for the work. It is imperative that we continue to work together in a bipartisan effort to protect the judges, witnesses, courthouse personnel and law enforcement officers, as well as the witnesses and their families who are working to protect the rest of the country from criminal acts. Threats and violence require our action today to help them while they help us. 
   At the State and local level, there is a dire need to provide basic security services in the courtroom and for witnesses. H.R. 660 represents a significant first step in this area. 
   Madam Speaker, I commend again Chairman Conyers and Ranking Member Smith as well as Subcommittee Chairman Scott and former Ranking Member Forbes for their continued leadership on this issue. 
   As a former judge, I hope that we will be successful in getting this legislation across the finish line under your leadership. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this critical bipartisan and bicameral measure. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (CURRENT FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate my friend, Mr. Garrett's, comments. I heard him earlier tonight on Fox Business News. That's the first I had seen that channel, and it was quite good. Perhaps if they had been on the air longer, maybe we wouldn't be in this problem, people would be watching that. 
   But I heard one lady comment that there is an adage that ``Europe was formed by history and the United States was formed by philosophy.'' And there really is something to that. We were founded on the basis of people coming together. And of course at the Constitutional Convention they  couldn't come up with a constitution, the Articles of Confederation had all fallen apart, no common currency, it just didn't work, too loose of a web. And so they came together 4 years later, 1787, in the Constitutional Convention, and for merely 5 weeks couldn't agree on anything. And that's when the very elderly Benjamin Franklin gave his speech, that during the war in the early days, they never let a day go by without prayer, and they saw prayer answered. And so he made the motion that they begin each day with prayer, and that began. And now, all of a sudden we're able to come together with all these different philosophers through the ages and come up with what was the Constitution. Amazing. 
   But they had seen the New Testament practice early in the church, when they had everybody bring everything into a common storehouse and gave out equally. And that eventually results, as it always has to, when people see someone else is not working as hard as they are and they're getting an equal share, then they quit working and everything falls part. That led to the Apostle Paul coming around and saying, If you don't work, you don't eat. At Jamestown, we saw where the pilgrims tried the same thing. And then we saw in the Soviet Union--and you've got to give it to the Soviet Union, they made it 70 years under that premise, that you could bring everything into a common storehouse and give out equally, and they made it 70 years. That's got to be a record for that. 
   But here, they're wanting to take this government in the biggest socialist step in the history of the western hemisphere, $700 billion; and we're supposed to be comforted because our government may be able to make a profit on the taxpayers' money. The trouble is, government never makes the kind of profit that individuals could, and the government is not supposed to be in the business of making a profit. That is free enterprise. That's what we were founded on. 
   And, you know, I heard this quote years ago, I don't remember who said it, if they were quoting someone else, but especially since I've been in Congress I've found it to be true. And it may very well be true in this situation, it sure seems to be, because we've got people on Wall Street who are screaming, you have got to come in with this infusion of $700 billion of taxpayer money to bail out the banks. What is that going to do? As I understand it, it's going to buy mortgage-based securities--at a rate above where they may even be marked down to--and save those people that have stock in that bank, the officers that got them in that trouble, and that will keep their stock from being worthless. And the quote that I was alluding to is this, ``Hell hath no fury like a vested interest masquerading as a moral principle.'' And boy, have we been hearing that. ``You can't let the country fall.'' ``You can't let this panic ensue.'' We were told Friday, a week ago, 8 days ago, if we didn't have a deal by Monday, then the banks were going to start falling and it would be a domino and we would never get it back. It didn't happen. Some of us wanted to be more cautious. 
   But anyway, as I heard the gentleman say earlier, if the majority, if the Speaker wants to pass a bill, she sure doesn't need us. And I heard Madam Speaker say just earlier today on the news that it was very unpatriotic for the Republicans not rushing in sooner to be part of this $700 billion bailout discussion. And that was really striking because they didn't ask for our input when they ran in here and crammed down a non-energy energy bill that didn't allow any amendments. They didn't need our votes. They were going to cram it down the Nation's throat and tell them we gave them energy when there was not a drop of energy ever going to come from it. And then shortly thereafter the majority leader said, oh, one of the first orders of business, we'll put the moratorium back. So they don't need us, really, to pass a bill. 
   And another thing that I haven't heard talked about in these mortgage-based securities is actually who those are. Now, at one end--and people don't want to talk about this--but at one end you've got people who thought if they could run in, get a no-money-down mortgage on a house that was a lot more than they could afford--when it was $1 million or $2 million or half a million--more than they could afford and they could hold it for a year, they could turn it, double their money, they never had to make a payment, and wow, they just doubled the value of the home and then came away with all this cash. When the house didn't double, then they had been in the house for a year and hadn't made a payment, didn't pay anything down--as the saying goes, ``no skin in the game''--and now we're supposed to bail them out? That's at one end. 
   In the middle, we have people who were really legitimately hurt, and not so much of their own accord. They knew what kind of house they wanted to look at. They were talked into, by bankers or realtors that shouldn't have, into buying more than they could afford. They got a mortgage that they really couldn't afford, thinking the house would greatly be enhanced in value and they would come out ahead. And they're truly suffering, and my heart goes out to them. 
   Then the other thing--and I haven't heard anybody talk about it on the floor here--but as it turns out, there are apparently a lot of illegal aliens who got mortgages. Because I know I had seen Bank of America advertising that they wanted to help the aliens, and under certain circumstances, gosh, we can get you a mortgage. So we're going to bail out mortgages for illegal aliens. 
   Let me tell you, back in the eighties, when the FDIC and RTC had taken over so many banks, what we saw was people come in and say, you know, I've been making my payment every month, and I'd like to negotiate a better deal. And they were told, well, heck no, you keep making your payments. I mean, I did outside counsel work for the RTC and FDIC. You would have some people come in later and say, okay, you wouldn't work with me before when I was making my payment every month, now I haven't paid for 6 months and they say, okay, now we'll work with you. We're sending the wrong message. And it is so critical that we not come out of this Chamber with a bill that hurts the America that we know and love so much. 
   There have to be consequences. And it troubles me much that the administration, the Secretary Treasurer has been forecasting this gloom and doom; ``there's going to be widespread panic.'' ``If Washington Mutual goes down it will be a domino and we will not stop the depression.'' Normally, it's the administration saying, nobody panic, we're going to get through this, this will all be okay, just stay with us, let's have faith in each other. And instead, all we're hearing is ``you've got to do something immediately or it's all going to fall apart.'' 
   Well, it seems like, if you allow me to borrow from Kipling's poem and paraphrase a little bit, if you can keep your head while all those about you are losing theirs, you're probably the reason they're losing theirs. And that's what we seem to be seeing around here. 
   I appreciate the time and Mr. Garrett yielding. And I will yield back.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, an 83-year-old woman told me she is paying over $400 a month now for her energy bills, and she may end up finishing her life burning wood, like she started it. 
   The fact is, God has blessed this Nation with an abundance of solutions in the form of natural resources that can support growing domestic energy needs. Within 3 years, we can get a million to a million and a half barrels of oil from ANWR. Some have indicated there are three times the amount of oil left in the entire Middle East, three times that amount in shale in Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, but they can't get to it. 
   The limited areas that are available for lease have an 8-year lease, and they are saying it takes right at 8 years to get all the permits. Yes, there is some property under lease that they can't produce. There is some that doesn't produce. That's the energy business. 
   But we need to help hardworking Americans. I don't understand what the majority leadership has against good union jobs. We are losing them every day in our district because energy prices are too high, and I want to keep those good union jobs.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend from Iowa. And I admire so much, not just him, but also his State. And having had him be a gracious host previously, I appreciate all that Iowa is doing for the country. 
   But Mr. Speaker, my friend from Iowa is right; there's a lot of people that know a lot about energy in east Texas where I'm from. And the fact is--and we brought this up in our Natural Resources Committee--you know, there in east Texas where I live they're drilling, they're exploring, they're producing. We're doing everything we can to provide energy for the rest of the country to use. But we're to the point now, we desperately need some help, and we need it from those States that have energy but have been sitting on it and will not help the rest of the Nation with it. 
   Now, there are too many in this country that have to drive to survive. There's no mass transportation that is going to get them where they've got to go to keep their job. We were in a debate in Judiciary last week, and one of the Members across the aisle said, well, our Democratic Party, we're concerned about the consumers, unlike the other party. And the fact is, I know those of us on the floor, our friends, we've got some good friends across the aisle--not the ones in leadership, but across the aisle--who understand. You want to help consumers, the men and women that are just trying to keep their job so they can pay down their credit card so they can get enough gas to keep their job next month, they're needing help. And yes, we want to help the consumer, we want to help them keep their job. We want jobs to be available. But I'm talking to people that have restaurants, that have small businesses, convenient stores. They're saying their business is down about 30 percent or so. 
   And what some of our friends in leadership across the aisle don't understand is, yes, it's nice if you never had to use fossil fuel, but it's what is used to keep the economy going right now. And I'm hoping we can drive in directions--figuratively speaking--that will allow us to get off fossil fuel someday. But what they don't seem to understand is, when you destroy an economy, when you devastate an economy, which is beginning to happen now as these energy prices are hurting people so badly, you don't help the environment. We see that in India. We see it in China. When people are worried about keeping food on their table for their family, when they're worried about providing a place to live and sleep for their family, then they believe that the environmental issues have to take a back seat because we've got to survive first. 
   Now, the United States--I know with all the beating up that goes on with  the United States, but the United States has done more globally to help clean up the world's environment in the last 30 years than any nation on Earth. You destroy our economy, you hurt this economy the way this is beginning to do and you will lose the help from the best help source in the world, and that's the United States of America. 
   And this isn't the first time I've been proud of America; I've been proud of America my whole life. But I note that on the Natural Resources Committee that I'm on, you look at things that we've been doing in the last several months and compare that to what went on in the last Congress, when the Republican leadership was in charge. Well, I was upset with some of the things that the leadership didn't allow or didn't get done or didn't help us to do, but some of the things that were done were good. 
   For example, we had a bill, an energy bill in the last Congress, came out of our committee, we got it passed. And it provided incentives for people to use biomass to produce electricity. Tried and true, we've got a facility down in Nacogdoches just that's coming online. People relied on the representations that there would be incentives to use biomass, like left over tree limbs, things like that, to produce electricity. In our committee, in the last months, we decided to withdraw those incentives and instead provide a bunch of money for a new study to tell us whether it's feasible. I said, we know it's feasible, just use it. It's another source of energy. 
   We've got wind--and of course our friend, T. Boone Pickens, has been talking a great deal about that--geothermal, hydroelectricity, the solar and biomass, as I've mentioned, those are all out there for use and they need to be pursued. But in the meantime, it's fossil fuel that is driving this country and it's fossil fuel that's driving the planet. And what we end up hearing in so many of these debates, including these late-night discussions, are people that hear things and just assume, well, it's said in committee, it's said on the floor, it must be true. And so we still hear people say, if we were to start drilling in that section 1002 part of ANWR that President Jimmy Carter designated would be used for oil and gas development, you know, nearly 30 years ago, we pursue that, well, it would still be 10 or 15 years before that would be available. What's been heard more recently that people aren't saying across the aisle is--at least not in the leadership, some of our moderate friends know--but that is that actually there is a pipeline, as I understand it, 74 miles from ANWR, this section of it. And despite what you see on the news, there are no pristine mountains, there are no antelope playing or buffalo roaming or anything like, it's just basically a waste land. And what better place to drill. The technology is there to do it. 
   But we could have that in the United States--some of us have been told it can be done within 2 to 3 years; within 3 years it could be in the United States. Do it now. The mere fact that we would go after that would tell the speculators--that some say are contributing a third to the price--it would be nice to drop the price of gasoline by over a dollar just on speculation when they see we're serious about providing our own energy.

   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding. You're talking about the caribou that more than 10 times gained from where they were before. 
   And with regard to the wolves being shot, one of the things I was surprised about when I heard that polar bears were now listed as threatened here recently was the fact, and we discussed this--it came out in debate in our Natural Resources Committee--it's acknowledged that in the last few decades we were down to 10,000 to 12,000 polar bears in the world. Now it's acknowledged universally there are over 25,000 polar bears, and somehow that caused the polar bears to now be threatened now that there are more than twice as many as there were a few decades ago. So it certainly isn't because of a lack of polar bears that the caribou are doing well. The polar bears are doing quite well themselves despite what you may hear from some of the far left folks on that issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (CHANGING OUTCOME OF VOTE -- (House of Representatives - August 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, last night, the Democratic majority leadership was in the process of attempting to violate the House of Representatives' rules by holding a vote open with the sole intent of changing the outcome of the vote. 
   As the vote changed from 214 ``yeas'' to 214 ``nays'' to 215 ``yeas'' to 213 ``nays,'' the Speaker pro tempore brought down the gavel. Because he then realized the vote was in favor of the Republican motion, he didn't know what to do. The lighted scoreboard at either end of the Chamber showed 215 ``yeas'' to 213 ``nays.'' 
   Then the Speaker and Parliamentarian allowed two more Democrats to change their vote. So the vote finally announced was 212 ``yeas'' and 216 ``nays.'' The Parliamentarian said the vote was actually 214-214 when the vote closed. However, of course, he had no explanation for why the vote was officially called. He allowed the vote switching to continue until the vote became what it was announced. That is clearly because there is no proper explanation other than that, on the way to violating one rule, it became necessary to violate another. 
   It is also noteworthy that the vote was to further enable people who are breaking the law in America by being here illegally to not only break the law but receive money from those forced to pay taxes. 
   Then came the astounding news that the record was wiped clean of the computer evidence of what went wrong. When rules and laws don't matter, we change the destiny of history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the ranking member. 
   I appreciate Chairman Reyes' service to this country. I believe people on the other side of the aisle mean well when they say they want to protect the Constitution. The problem is this extends the Constitution beyond America to our enemies on foreign soil who cut off heads of Americans. That's just the way it is. It does that. 
   Now, we keep hearing across the aisle: This has nothing to do with foreign-to-foreign calls; it has nothing to do with foreign terrorists on foreign soil calling foreign terrorists, and it says that in the bill. You don't have to worry about that. You don't need a warrant for that. 
   The trouble is there is no conceivable time that an honest intelligence gatherer overseas can swear that a foreign terrorist that he wants to surveil will never under any circumstances call the United States. Since he can't swear to that and since there is a chance, especially since this law is public and the terrorists will know all they need to do is call America, order flowers, call time and temperature, they have made a call on American soil and they come within the requirement of getting a court order. It is very clear. 
   This doesn't extend the Constitution in a way that it should be on American soil. It protects enemies. I know people on the other side, you just want to protect civil liberties, but what scares me is what will happen when a terrorist attack in the nature of 9/11 comes again. People will rush to take away civil liberties, and people will voluntarily give up civil liberties for protection, liberties that were so hard fought. 
   So for those who are really going to be protected, I don't understand the concern. This is going to protect also Americans who get calls from foreign terrorists on foreign soil. That is what this is really going to do. 
   I don't think it is too much in the interest of America, tell your American friends to tell their terrorist friends on foreign soil, don't call me, use some other means of communication.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, once again we have heard from across the aisle, this is not true that we are saying you will have to get warrants for foreign-to-foreign, because the bill says in section 2(a), gee, you don't have to get a court order if it is between persons not U.S. citizens not located within the United States. 
   The problem is, when you look at 2(b) and 3 and section 4, it says: If you can't be sure and you are risking a felony if you are not, if you can't be sure that they may not call somewhere in the United States, you have got to get a court order. That is the bottom line. That is what Admiral McConnell testified. 
   I realize some people on the other side may think he is suspect because he was the National Security Adviser under the Clinton administration for several years, but I think he is a very credible source. 
   As a former judge and chief justice, I realize we have got lawyers in here, but I am telling you, when the language says if there may be a call to the United States or to an American, you have got to get a court order, then you are going to have to get them in virtually every time. 
   But we keep hearing no, no, all that is covered. Once again, we are told something is covered when again it is nothing but a hospital gown coverage. You are exposed in areas you don't want exposed. And that is what the country is looking at. 
   Now, it also requires the DNI and the AG to jointly petition. Oh, and there is great comfort in this bill. It says the judge, once they finally get the papers filed, will have to rule in 15 days. If we get a soldier kidnapped, we have some sensitive situation, and maybe it is an emergency, maybe it is not, but you can't take a chance of being guilty of a felony, you are going to have to follow through and get a court order. That is what the DNI says and that is what needs to be done. 
   Now, the main protection here is not for American citizens in general, it is for foreign terrorists. The bottom line is, tell your American friends who are getting calls from foreign terrorists in foreign countries not to call them. Use some other way to communicate, and then your friends are covered.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   It is always interesting hearing from my friend from New York. 
   You know, we are about solutions, we try to be about solutions; that is what this body ought to be about. And I would humbly submit that if we were to set up windmills surrounding the Capitol, I believe there is enough hot air that comes out of this place that we could offset all the losses of energy from an extravagant plane that flies from here to California with lots of passengers and a gym or whatever all it has got on there; but I would actually like to talk about the bill that the amendment is addressing and come back to the amendment for a moment.     
   But I come from a district there in east Texas that is blessed with an abundance of natural resources. And not only do we have oil and gas, we have got coal, and we have some something that is so often overlooked called biomass. Some folks don't know what that is, but it can take all kinds of forms, and one of those forms is the pine tree. You cut down the pine tree, you take the center of it, use it for paper, pulp, plywood, all of these other things. And then there is all this waste that can generate energy. 
   But the use of biomass is a source of energy, it is necessary for domestic industry purposes and actually is being used in our timber and paper industries to defray rapidly increasing overhead costs. 
   Presently, the uncertainty of energy supplies and prices make it impossible for domestic industry to efficiently forecast operating costs or make credible plans for future capital expenditures. For example, the forest products industry is partially self-sufficient because they use some of the biomass to provide energy to produce what they do. The biomass fuels can include bark, scrap wood, wood residuals, wood extractives from the pulping process. 
   So necessary to maintain a manufacturing base in this country that will sustain a driving economy is the energy produced by biomass, and I think that can play a vital role. 
   It is not enough simply to have a source of energy. It is also necessary to have a means to deliver it. So we have also got to improve our ability to deliver a wide array of energy resources to consumers by addressing the infrastructures. This bill doesn't really address any of those. It is kind of a feel-good bill. Anything can help a little bit. 
   But in conclusion, I just submit, look, if we all pitch in a little bit, districts like mine that have energy, if you allow us to use CO  
   2, maybe pump it in the ground, get the last bit of oil up, use biomass, convert it into energy, if we keep doing those sorts of things using alternative energy, I think eventually we can pay for all the waste and extravagance that we are already seeing coming from the Speaker's request.

   William is committed to his job and his fellow soldiers. He could have chosen to stay stateside; however, he felt the job, his job, was not finished. I have another son, Sergeant Aaron Barth, who is equally committed to the cause of freedom. Aaron has already served over a year in Iraq and is preparing to return as well. 
   Mr. Gohmert, my family is behind the President 100 percent. We are committed to the cause of freedom. Keep up the good work and do not allow anyone to defund the military. The next time you see the President, let him know that fellow Texans are praying for him, for you and for our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (TAKING CREDIT FOR RISING GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, friends from this side of the aisle have been talking tonight about the tax increase we had last week. 
   One of the things that I have observed in my 2 years that I have been here is sometimes people take credit for things that maybe they had an effect on, and maybe they didn't. But over the last couple of years, one of the things we have been doing is we have tried to provide for drilling for gas. 
   There are trillions of cubic feet of natural gas in the Gulf Coast. It is a fact, we have trillions of cubic feet of gas. You can go along the Outer Continental Shelf along both coasts, and many States do not want any drilling out there. They want all the energy, they want it cheap. They don't want any of it drilled where they may have to look at it, but they want the energy. People fight that. They don't want any drilling out there. 
   Then we have this area that is tundra, as we were taught growing up in public school, tundra, where there is just not much of anything. Yet people don't want to allow drilling in that area, even though it could provide 1 1/2 million barrels of oil a day. 
   The OCS and ANWR, those are not be-all-end-all solutions to our energy needs, but they are a small part of the solution. Alternative fuels, bioethanol. We have biomass in East Texas, where I am from, and we have oil and gas as well. We have coal. We have all these things. There are projects to produce energy with zero emissions from coal. All of these great things are going on that we are trying to push, and so much of it met with opposition. 
   Then we came along last week, and we end up having the incentives to do domestic drilling in the United States or off our coasts to provide additional energy and to do it with domestic people, domestic companies, domestic jobs to help the economy, as well as provide fuel that we don't have go overseas to get, and yet those incentives, it was voted by the majority as pushed by our Democrat friends across the aisle to remove those incentives. 
   The thing that struck me over the last couple of years as we fought against Democrats who didn't want to drill the Outer Continental Shelf, didn't want to drill ANWR, they fought like crazy against having incentives for new refineries. We are realistic enough. We know that the big oil companies are not going to build more refineries here. They do it in other places where it is cheaper. But it was to encourage independent oil companies to drill here in America, and also to refine here in America, because we need the gasoline to keep things going until we get sufficient alternative fuels. 
   But after fighting against us to allow those things to bring down the prices of gasoline, as gasoline skyrocketed, I was amazed. People on the other side of the aisle blamed Republicans for the skyrocketing gas prices. 
   The thing that struck me, and I just wanted to leave my friends in the House with this thought, if you are going to fight against the things that make for cheaper fuel, then when the price of gasoline skyrockets, at least have the decency to take credit for it. ``Yes, we got the high gas prices. America, you ought to love us. We drove up the price of gasoline, and now it is way up and you ought to love us for it.'' Instead, we got blamed because gasoline got high. 
   So I hope as a result of what we saw what happen last week, as it ends up in the next year or so causing a spike in the price of gasoline, that our friends across the aisle that caused this spike that they have put in the pipeline now to generate a skyrocketing gasoline price, that when that occurs, they will go ahead and stand up and say, ``You bet gasoline is high; and we Democrats, we proudly caused it.''

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, the proponents of this bill in 1978 believed that the way to allow the District of Columbia representation was to actually pass and ratify a constitutional amendment. That is what the proponents knew back then. That is what most of us, hopefully, still know today. 
   Article I, section 2 of the Constitution addresses who will comprise the U.S. House of Representatives. As it says here, specifically, ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the People of the several States ..... '' 
   Now, anyone who believes it is fair, like the Founders of the country did, to have taxation with representation should also know that we took an oath to support and defend this document. Words mean things. They had the debate at that time. Should we give the District of Columbia, this independent entity, a Representative? They said ``no.'' Alexander Hamilton lost the debate when they said ``no.'' 
   So if you want to fix it, as the people in 1978 did, as you do know, those in the House here, Mr. Speaker, you do it by making a constitutional amendment. 
   I have previously pointed out that one of the arguments made by our country's founders as to why they did not allow the District of Columbia to have a U.S. Representative was that the Founders noted that Members of Congress and the Senate have an interest in the city's functioning properly. Demonizing, misquoting, belittling the messenger does not change the truth, the facts, or what the Constitution requires.     
   As I said during the previous debate, it is a legitimate position to assert that all people should be able to elect their Representative. That is why on Monday of this week I filed a bill that is the only constitutional manner of getting the District of Columbia a Representative without a constitutional amendment. My new bill cedes land from the District of Columbia on which Federal buildings do not currently exist to the State of Maryland, which follows the pattern that was set in 1846 when land was ceded back to Virginia. That allows the District of Columbia not only a vote for a Representative, but also a vote for two Senators. That is not even contemplated in this bill. 
   In any event, the Constitution is clear. Let's follow it or amend it. The bill we are voting on today does not follow the Constitution, it does not amend the Constitution, and, therefore, it must be defeated here by those who wish to follow the admonition to support and defend the Constitution. Otherwise, it will be struck down by any court that seeks to follow the words of the Constitution.

All I can do is what we can do here, what we can do constitutionally. And I am shocked at the inference that Maryland thinks so little of the people of the District of Columbia that they wouldn't want them, but that is their call. This is something we can do constitutionally. 
   And to my other good friend from Texas, who mentioned there is another provision, it is article I, section 8. And there is nothing in here that gives us the power to change the Constitution to revoke this word ``States.'' And if you give it that broad, sweeping definition that my friends across the aisle are trying to do, then what will end up happening is, you want to help the fighting people that have given their lives for us and others who continue fighting? This says we can give them their own representative. We can give the Pentagon a representative. We can give every fort and post and base in America their own representative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to be here on the floor where so much history has been made since the House moved down here around 1858, 1859. 
   Recently I saw an estimate that our Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Henry Paulson, and the Fed Chair may have committed or are in the process of committing an estimated $7.7 trillion. I couldn't believe it, $7.7 trillion? 
   So I wanted to know how much do people pay each year in income tax? The estimate I got was $1.21 trillion from individual income tax payments is what is estimated for the year 2008. Six and a half times less than what our bureaucrats here in Washington, two people, have committed us to or are trying to commit us to to get the economy going and to make credit more available so people who are lagging behind on their mortgages can catch up? I couldn't believe it. Six and a half times more than individual income tax that's going to be paid in this year? It's outrageous. 
   My first thought was we'd be better off if we had an entire tax holiday for all of 2008, that everybody that paid in money so far this year gets all of their money back. Can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, people around this country starting to think about how much money they would get back that they have already paid into the Federal treasury this year, how much they wouldn't have to pay in for the rest of the year? It's an incredible amount of money. Think about the cars that would be bought, how many automakers would be bailed out as people  bought new cars. Think about all of the mortgages, all the new home sales that would take place, new homes built, new businesses built. An extraordinary amount of money. And yet we've got bureaucrats trying to get the economy going, obligating six and a half times that much money. 
   Now, I understand that some of that $7.7 trillion is an investment. We have heard people say here in Washington, leaders I care a lot about, but they've said only the Federal Government has enough patience to hold private assets for years until they meet full maturity. Now, I am finishing my 4th year here, but just in the 4 years I have been here, I can tell you there is no patience in the Federal Government. We can't even keep the same tax incentives in place from year to year, and here we're supposed to hold these administration to administration? 
   The bailout bill in September was a fiasco. Even those who supported the idea of a bailout bill, when you look closely at the bill, should have known this was not the thing to do. We have never in the history of the country since the Constitution came into play in 1787, as it came into being, we have not given one man this much unrestricted, unfettered authority to just obligate hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars just however he feels it ought to be spent. 
   So you look at the way Secretary Paulson has obligated the first $350 billion. Well, it's been squandered when you look at the effect it was supposed to have. For one thing banks we hear are starting to use the money to buy up competition. What does that do? It monopolizes banking. It kills the community bank for sure. And this is the same Secretary of the Treasury who back in September used his emergency authority to say we're going to stand good dollar for dollar for every dollar you've got in money markets, but we are not going to say the same thing for the good, safe community banks. They're only good for $100,000. He didn't say it. He didn't have to. They knew it. So he knowingly, and it had to be knowingly because I can't believe he's that ignorant otherwise--he's a very intelligent man. He had to know that he was intentionally creating the biggest 1-day run on banks in American history as people went in, pulled their money down to the $100,000 level 
   that had that much, and moved it to money markets. Maybe that was the intent. Since he comes from Wall Street, he wanted to take it out of the community, the safe, commercial banks, and send it to his friends on Wall Street. Maybe that was the point, but he did that. 
   Now, others for whatever reason have gotten money and all of a sudden decided to tighten up credit. I have a friend, a constituent in Nacogdoches, Texas, who has a restaurant there. He went down to Wells Fargo, he tells me this week. He went down, I believe it was last week, to Wells Fargo in Houston and asked for a loan, and they said you're just a little late. Apparently after Wells Fargo, they said, got their money from the Federal taxpayers, they tightened the screws on credit and now they could no longer lend it to him. They could have if he had been there sooner before the Federal Government gave Wells Fargo the money. But now that Wells Fargo got the money, it's time to pull the plug and not lend to good borrowers anymore. 
   That was not the intent. I was against the bailout, voted against it both times. Did not support it. You read it. We should not have given that kind of authority to one person and especially the provision that allowed him to hire whatever advisers and whatever managers, whatever he wanted when he was going to outsource that. And now I hate to be in a position of saying I told you so, but it wasn't a good bill and now we have seen that. 
   Now, because he was doing all this fear mongering for 2 weeks, you know, the financial sky is falling as he ran around, he scared the stock market into paranoid schizophrenia. That's why it's up, it's down, it's up, it's down. The least little thing sets it off because he scared it into that. You cannot have a national leader go on television and say we're about to have a worse depression than the 1930s. We're about to have a stock market crash like 1929. You can't do that. You have to be the one that says ``we have nothing to fear but fear itself.'' Calm down, it's going to be okay. And it turns out all the while I read something that indicated that we had more home sales in September than any month since the year 2003. So things were going pretty good until we got all that fear mongering. 
   The other thing was he said he was going to buy troubled assets, buy the mortgage-backed securities. And if I understood right, before the Senate he testified he was already thinking by the time it passed the House that he was going to have to do something else. Maybe it was the next day. If he were to have been considering doing something else other than what he represented, going back to my days as a judge, if somebody, whether it was the Secretary of the Treasury or anybody else, comes in and gets money based on false premises or false promises that he knows he's not going to follow through on, you get into some interesting doctrines, whether it's a promissory estoppel, fraud, different things like that. The bottom line is it's time to end his authority. 
   Now, I've had people in this Congress tell me, no, what was negotiated with the Treasury was that we will get a strict up-or-down vote before Paulson can spend the other $350 billion. That's not what the bill says. The bill basically says that before he can squander the other $350 billion, and ``squandering'' is my word and I paraphrase based on his prior performance, that before he can get that $350 billion, all he has to do is propose a plan, and if Congress doesn't vote to disapprove the plan within 15 days, he gets the money. They could do that over Christmas. People not get back in time to have a vote, and he's got the money. 
   So it's time to end that. That's why even though my first thought was a whole year tax holiday, and imagine what that would do for the economy, it would be extraordinary, there were not a lot of supporters for that. I love and cherish and appreciate the support of the great congressman from the State of Arizona, John Shadegg. John has been a confidant. He has been a helpful source and resource. He liked the idea and was telling me tonight he may go ahead and file that anyway. But in looking at the $350 billion still unspent of the original $700 billion that this Congress allocated for him to spend, let's cut that off and let's see what we could get instead. Instead of letting Mr. Paulson spend that money, let's let the taxpayers keep their own money for 2 months. What you would do under this bill, and we filed it yesterday, H.R. 7309, it would allow for the months of January and February a complete tax holiday. This isn't by and by in the sky. This is real time. In January if this bill were to be brought to the floor--and I feel sure if it gets to the floor it will pass because otherwise people would be afraid to face the voters if they voted not to let taxpayers spend their money but to allow Paulson to continue to have that authority or some other Secretary of the Treasury. Let there be no Federal withholding for the months of January and February. Not only would there be no withholding, the tax rate, as it says in the bill, for wages received for services performed during the period beginning January 1, 2009, ending February 28, 2009, shall be 0 percent. On down it indicates self-employment income for services performed during the period beginning January 1, 2009, ending February 28, 2009, the percentage shall be 0 percent.     
   So, basically, getting a two-twelfth or 16 2/3 percent tax cut for the year 2009, now, that will help get the economy going. Why not let somebody have that substantial amount of money being pulled out of their check and sent to Washington for Paulson to squander, why not let them have it, let them catch up on their mortgage? 
   Because I know, I have heard a number of people say we fell a little behind back when gasoline was $4 a gallon. I can't get my breath. I can't catch a breather. Let them get the breather by getting their own money, getting their own FICA. Because that means even people who are on the lowest wage-earning scale, who don't make enough to pay income tax, they still have FICA withheld for Social Security and all from their paycheck. 
   This would let them have that back, give them a boost. Since they are not  having to take anything out for FICA, the employer would not have to match that for 2 months. That will allow the employer not to have to fire anybody for a couple of months, give them a little breather to catch up. 
   Then at the end of the year you have 2 months for which you did not have income that's taxable. Now, the reason we had to word it the way we did was because people were saying, man, if that were about to happen, we will just postpone Christmas bonuses and put them in January or February. Well, that's not what this is for. This is for wages earned, for services performed during those months, and that would make it work. 
   Now, I have been joined by my friend here from Georgia, Dr. Paul Broun, who it is an honor to serve with. I would like to yield such time to my friend, Paul Broun, as he may use.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (GIVE AMERICA A TAX HOLIDAY -- (House of Representatives - December 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I sure do thank my friend from Georgia. I appreciate those comments very much. 
   This poster pretty much says it all. This is what boils down H.R. 7309 into a nutshell. You have the Secretary of the Treasury Paulson here on one side, and then they have got you, the taxpayer, all the taxpayers across America on the other. The question is, who do you want to spend your $350 billion, because it hasn't been spent very well. 
   When you hear that there are executives that may get millions in bonuses for running their business into the ground, and, sure, the government has some culpability in that, we sure do. Things haven't been run very well. But, obviously, they haven't run them very well either, and they want bonuses while the taxpayers they are taking it from have none and are cutting back on Christmas presents. Because of the way things are going, it is really tragic. 
   My friend from Georgia mentioned the automakers bailout that we voted on tonight is a mistake, it's not properly done. It is only a temporary fix that's going to lead to more and more and more. It sounds like a placation to the UAW. 
   I am much more concerned about car dealers than the UAW. I am very concerned about the auto workers and all these plants all over the country. 
   Because one of the things I found when we went to China a few years ago, a number of bipartisan groups went, talked to different CEOs from industry. Why did you move your industry to China? 
   Over and over we heard them say, well, our quality control was better in America. I thought perhaps they would say we moved because of the cheaper labor. They said, yes, labor is cheaper, and no unions to deal with. But that's not the reason we kept hearing that they moved. It was that we have a corporate tax that's over twice what China has, and then apparently they are willing to negotiate with some corporations, depending on what they bring to China.     
   So I am not as concerned for organizations as I am for the individuals; the workers in these plants, the workers at the car dealers, all these people that will be hurt if the automobile makers in America go down. But I don't think that will happen, even through a chapter 11. 
   But I am extremely concerned any time any entity has money that belongs to other people and they hold on to it as if for ransom, and that is what we are hearing may be happening with some of the hold-back money, the rebate money that is owed by the auto makers to the dealers. And it is just not right. 
   You come in here to Congress begging for money and you are not even going to live up to your side of the bargain? Regardless of what your religious beliefs are, and I never seek to impose mine on anyone else, but Jesus did refer to such a situation in one of his parables, like as in one person being forgiven their debts, and then they go and lord it over someone under them. 
   We are seeing that kind of thing, and it should not be happening, and there should not be a dime provided to the auto makers until they provide the money that is owed to the people that they have, that should be going to these dealers rather than holding them up for the money they are properly owed. I don't think they ought to get a dime until they are properly reimbursed themselves out in the dealerships. 
   Anyway, we have bureaucrats in Washington picking winners and losers. The former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, wrote an article this past week, and I quote from it: ``The bankruptcy of the current Washington political establishment makes Representative Louie Gohmert's new proposal for a tax holiday proposal intriguing.'' 
   He went on to say, ``What Pelosi and Paulson are proposing to pour into crony capitalism is more than what it would cost to give every American taxpayer a total Federal tax holiday for 2 months.'' It is a great article and I would commend that to you. ``A people stimulus package, a tax holiday instead of a bailout.'' He has a website at Newt.org. 
   Also American Solutions has some wonderful information about the proposed tax holiday. And Jeb Babbin of Human Events, the publisher there, has a tremendous article on this. He has been extraordinary in his support for this idea. At one point he says, ``Most Americans were opposed to the bank bailout last fall, and neither they nor the markets themselves have confidence that any of the bailouts or `stimulus packages' will work. They will have confidence in Gohmert's plan because it is an economic stimulus that has been proven by history. Tax cuts mean more spending, savings and investment. They pave the way to economic recovery. Government bailouts do not.'' 
   He said, ``Gohmert's tax holiday plan is eloquent in its simplicity.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, that is all I know to do, is come back with simplicity. 
   ``Every American taxpayer would pay no Federal income or FICA taxes for the first two months of 2009. For the typical American family earning about $50,000 a year, that would mean they would keep about $2,000 that would otherwise be paid to the government. People making that kind of money could certainly use $2,000 more than someone getting a multi-million dollar bonus.'' 
   ``In any event,'' he says, ``Gohmert's plan doesn't pay for Wall Street bonuses or let banks use bailout money to buy other banks or pay dividends. It doesn't rely on bureaucrats to pay money out to the right people at the right time or try to stimulate the economy with token payments to people who don't pay taxes. Most Americans pay about 25 percent of their income in Federal income tax and another 7.25 percent in FICA, Social Security and Medicare taxes. 
   ``Computing how much money Gohmert's tax holiday would leave in your family's checkbook is very simple. The fact is, you can just look at your paycheck. Look at the stub. It will tell you how much has been held out of your check. You see how much has been held out of your check for a month for Federal withholding and for FICA. That is what you would get back.'' 
   I would like to point out, there was a quote decades ago from John Kenneth Galbraith about economists. Opinions of economists have been bantered about over and over again. But I think about Galbraith's quote when he said there are only two kinds of economists: There are those who don't know, and  those who don't know they don't know, and I think our Treasury Secretary is in the latter category. 
   An interesting article published, ``Less Government is More Better,'' by Ted Nugent. The guy is amazing. He is a rock star, and he is an amazing rock star when it comes to political philosophy as well, and I am quoting from his article. 
   He says, ``That is right, a 2 month, $350 billion tax holiday, and no income tax for January and February 2009. This would be massive wads of your money staying in your pockets where it belongs, surely doing more for the sagging economy than using it to bail out Wall Street or the automotive industry.'' 
   He also says, ``Fedzilla,'' apparently that is his term for the Federal Government here in Washington, ``has just gotten bigger and bigger. Of course, Fedzilla,'' he says, ``bureaucrats such as Speaker Pelosi and others, will fight Congressman Gohmert's proposal because they believe Fedzilla knows how to better spend your money than you do. But this arrogant attitude by Fedzilla-addicted zombies is always the problem, never the solution.'' 
   He said, ``Fedzilla rarely gets anything right. Need proof? Quick, name three specific things Fedzilla has spent your money on which you believe was a wise use of your tax dollars.'' 
   He says, ``Taxpayers are partially to blame for the financial mess created by Fedzilla. We have sat idly by and drank the bureaucratic Kool-Aid brewed by Fedzilla and slowly surrendered our financial independence to big government bureaucrats. Shame on us,'' Ted Nugent says. He says, ``We should have been snarling watchdogs of the bureaucrats with our tax dollars stuffed in their bloated wallets, instead of solace, disconnected, apathetic accomplice lapdogs.'' 
   You have got a quote here from Thomas Jefferson. Ted Nugent quotes Jefferson saying, ``I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people under the pretense of taking care of them.'' 
   Boy, if that doesn't apply. Of course, Ted Nugent says, ``You think?'' Sounds like my sister's response. ``You think?'' 
   In any event, this is a simple bill. And I know some people have said, won't that hurt Social Security? Section 3 deals with that, and requires the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner of Social Security as appropriate, to determine what impact the nonpayment of FICA for 2 months would have on the Social Security trust fund and the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund, Federal Disability Insurance trust fund, Federal Hospital Insurance trust fund, and they have to make sure the difference is made up. 
   We have already allocated $350 billion, so shutting them down from using that and saying the taxpayers get it instead sounds like a pretty good deal. I hope it would. 
   We have got to get back to the roots of what America was founded on. It broke my heart back in September when we had this bailout proposed. On that first Monday we took the vote, some of us knew it was going to be tough in the stock market. Why? Because the Treasury Secretary had forecast a self-fulfilling prophesy that the stock market would drop unless he got his $700 billion slush fund. 
   Well, that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you promise the market is going to drop unless something happens, it usually happens the way you say it, because the market is fragile. It relies so much on confidence. So it dropped 777 points. Something Biblical about that, 777. Or I guess if you are into I guess slot machines, something intriguing about that as well, 777. 
   But it also broke my heart to see so many people, they knew the principles of this country, they knew what it was founded on. They knew what started the Revolution. They had their history. They knew that the people in the colonies, in what back then were the colonies of America, did not want the king's government, any government, owning all that they held dear in this country. 
   When the king, the government, started exhorting too much power and control and ownership over things in the colony, it started a revolution. When the signers of the Declaration of Independence signed that document, they knew that King George would see it. It was posted. It was made available. It was read out. People knew who had signed it, and so would King George III. They knew if the Revolution failed, their lives were over. 
   You look at the end of the Declaration of Independence. They said ``we pledge our lives, our fortunes,'' and many of them lost both. Some lost their lives, some lost their fortunes, some lost their families, but they believed it was worth it to have a country in which people could be free to decide what to do with their own property. 
   You know, the pilgrims tried this idea of basically socialism. They had a beautiful compact when they came to this land here, the ``New World'' they called it. The compact was they would all share the land, they would all produce from it, they would bring into the common storehouse and then they would share equally. 
   After the first winter, when so many died of starvation, they realized we got to go do something different here. First of all, if you don't work, you don't eat. Sound familiar? That is what the Apostle Paul had to order after the New Testament church tried the idea of everybody bringing into the common storehouse and then sharing it equally. 
   The other thing they did was provide private plots of land to each individual so they could eat what they produced and then share what was left. That is the way America got started. Those were lessons that the founders knew. And they knew that if individuals had the ability to succeed and flourish as private individuals without government control and government constant intervention, that this could become the greatest country in the world. 
   If you read one of John Adams's letters to Abigail after the signing of the Declaration, you can just virtually feel the excitement. He said, ``This is a great day.'' My paraphrase is, this is a great day. We have within our grasp in this country something that the philosophers and the dreamers have only dreamed about, and that is within our grasp. This day ought to be celebrated throughout this Nation's history with picnics and parades, and he mentioned firing of guns. We substitute fireworks. He knew how important it was, because of the ideal that people could have a government, this experiment in government, where they would control the government and govern themselves. 
   And somehow we have wandered so far from that that in September of this year, we could have a bill that so many would vote for that would allow one man, a king of a treasurer, to buy private assets, let the government take them and make money. 
   Let me just say, when you hear somebody in the government say we are going to take taxpayer money and make money with it, then the response should be, it is none of your business. Taxpayers always make more money with taxpayer money than the government could ever do. That is not their job. It is called socialism when the government buys into banks, buys stock in the banks, buys stock in insurance companies, and stock has been offered in the car companies. 
   We have a bill that will make a Car Czar. Can you imagine? I mean, Ted Nugent called the government ``Fedzilla.'' Can you imagine the kind of creation Fedzilla would come up with if it starts being the Car Czar, designing cars and telling Detroit what they have to produce? I wouldn't want to buy one of those. We saw those kind of cars. Not that many people bought the Yugos or the other Russian cars produced over there designed by a government-controlled car company.     
   People didn't want them. They wanted American cars if they could get them. 
   But, in any event, we've come to this time when, in American history, people would willingly vote to socialize a segment of the economy. I was told, well, this couldn't be socialism, this was before the final vote, because I only know three socialists in America and they're all against the bailout bill. 
   Well, it turns out they didn't like the idea of giving Wall Street all this money. They just wanted the government to take over the financial sector. But hearing one of them on television  after the bailout, he said, you know, this actually ends up being a great day because we've federalized, socialized whatever you want--he didn't say that, but it's basically socialized a segment of the financial economy, the financial sector. And now we just need, according to him, to take over the rest of it and then we spread it across the country. 
   That sounds good. And I heard somebody call into a talk show and say, what's really wrong with socialism? 
   Well, let me explain it to you this way. When I was an exchange student in the Soviet Union back in 1973, I spent the summer over there; went out to a collective farm, and there were some farmers who were sitting in the shade, you know, mid-morning. 
   Well, I've worked on farms, ranches, growing up in East Texas, and I know, during the summer, like this was, you start your work as quick as you can after daylight, and you want to be finished before the sun gets too hot. I've worked in 104, 105-degree heat with lots of humidity and it isn't fun, so you try and finish before it gets that hot. 
   These guys were all sitting in the shade. And I spoke a little Russian back then and I asked them, trying to be nice, when do you work out in the field? And they laughed at me, at the question. And one of them spoke and said, I make the same number of rubles if I'm out there or if I'm here, so I'm here. That's why socialism never works, because when people find out that they can get just as much as the person that works from sun up to sun down, then it falls apart. 
   Now, the Soviets set a record of having socialism for 70 years. And the only way they could make it work was to have a tyrannical central government that could kill you or imprison you if you didn't play along. But it was doomed to failure. 
   Socialism is always doomed to failure. And this country, if it were to continue going down this road, would not make 70 years unless it went to a tyrannical government as well; and God help us if that were to happen. 
   In any event, I would rather the prayers be that God continue to bless America; that we get back to our founding principles; that we embrace the principles that made America great, and not the principles that brought about the Revolution. 
   My bill, H.R. 7309, helps get us back a little bit on track. And you know what a great healthy by-product would be? When people start realizing how much money they're sending to Washington, they might demand a little better accountability, the kind of accountability we have not gotten from the first $350 billion that have been squandered for who knows what. It hasn't helped. 
   But with that, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the patience. I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, people all across America to call your Representative, call your Senators, let them know that the taxpayers should be the one to spend the $350 billion, not the Treasury Secretary.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this reminds me that this begging for money for a bailout is a fix. I saw it a lot in drug dealers and in drug addicts who would come before my court for sentencing. It was the same story. They would come in. They would have that first little rush from that first fix, and then they would have to have more and more and more. If you really love them and you care about them deeply and want them to reach their God-given potential, you cut them off and say, ``I love you too much to start you down this road.'' 
   In this case, bankruptcy is the place to go. That's why it's designed by Congress. Let's get this fixed so that it will be good for all Americans.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there's a phrase that's used in the Bible a number of times: ``It came to pass.'' That really struck me this weekend. 
   You know, the Republican majority, it came and it passed. The Democratic majority, it came and it will pass. So that needs to be thought about in these unprecedented procedural rules that shut out so much of America from having representation. 
   You have a Rules Committee that says, we'll not allow any amendments. Now put on your evidence about your amendments. 
   We have a majority leader that came to the floor and said, we reached out to the other side. I had a meeting this morning about SCHIP. 
   The bill was put on display at 7:30; we didn't even get a copy. You have to come and look at the copy. 
   It came to pass. I don't know how long the majority of the Democrats  will last, but it came and it will pass. And people need to remember they're setting very, very dangerous precedents.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, my mother taught for most of her adult life, and she used to say, One of the things I like about you, Louie, is that you are teachable. And I am learning, Mr. Speaker. 
   I have learned that you can make a promise for years and years: We are going to have the most open government; we know that legislation is better if there is opportunity to amend it and debate it, because 100 percent right doesn't lie in one person, so we are going to do that. 
   Whoops, we have a shot in being in the majority. What can we do? Oh, I know, we can make a different promise. Well, we are people of our word, so we promise we are not going to do any of that stuff for the first 100 hours. 
   Well, that is 4 days and 4 hours. Whoops, we want to keep violating our first promise, so, well, we are promising that 100 hours means the clock only runs when we have the ball. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am learning.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (``COLUMBIA'' SPACE SHUTTLE MEMORIAL STUDY ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona for his kindness and sensitivity in this issue, as well as the gentleman from Utah. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to properly commemorate and memorialize one of this Nation's most heroic, yet heartbreaking, tragedies. The disintegration of the Space Shuttle Columbia as it re-entered Earth's atmosphere in the spring of 2003 deserves such a memorialization. 
   This legislation will serve to begin the process of appropriately honoring the gallantry and sacrifice, not only of the seven brave souls of their crew and their families, but also the vast number of citizens who worked tirelessly in the recovery effort following the catastrophe. This bill will start that process that will ultimately result in appropriate memorialization of all the selfless and heroic efforts. 
   Tragically, parts of the shuttle were strewn over hundreds of miles of east Texas in my district, and the commitment of east Texans in the effort to recover as much of the wreckage as possible was pivotal in determining the cause of the incident in order to save future lives. 
   The ultimate sacrifice was made by Commander Rick Husband, Pilot William McCool, Payload Commander Michael Anderson, Mission Specialist David Brown, Mission Specialist Kalpana Chalwa, Payload Commander Ilan Ramon, and Mission Specialist and Medical Doctor Laurel Blair Salton Clark who was the wife of my Texas A&M classmate John Clark, who himself is also a patriot as a captain in the United States Navy. John and Laura also have a wonderful son. All of these American heroes deserve a memorial befitting their devotion to their fellow man, their spirit of exploration and discovery, as well as their courage. 
   In the days and weeks following the tragedy, countless east Texans volunteered to help and support the tireless Federal workers who were charged with locating the shuttle debris. 
   Volunteers gave selflessly of their time and their resources by participating in searches, opening their homes, preparing food and serving the many people taking part in the recovery effort in towns such as San Augustine, Nacogdoches, Lufkin, Hemphill, as well as most of east Texas itself. San Augustine City Manager Duke Lyons said at the time the volunteers provided 3,000 to 4,000 meals per day in his area alone and did all that they could to provide shelter and anything else that was needed. 
   The legendary hospitality of east Texas was on display as business owners donated supplies, building space and other assets to support the Forest Service, FEMA, National Guard, and other governmental entities taking part in the recovery. All told, east Texans spent countless weeks supporting the 10,000 people searching for the shuttle remains. 
   The efforts of these constituents are best summed up by three fellow east Texans. 
   Texas Ranger Pete Maskunas said, ``We got to see a small portion of east Texas pull together in a big way. The people here don't have much, but we gave everything that we had. We showed the Nation that, here in east Texas, we have got a big heart, and we are here to make things a lot better for people we don't even know.'' 
   San Augustine County Judge Wayne Holt said, ``From the smallest child to the oldest man, if you needed somebody, they were there.'' 
   Nacogdoches County Judge Sue Kennedy said, ``The generosity and unselfish, tireless efforts by the wonderful people of east Texas were so compelling and moving that even in 2007 we are being asked to teach seminars on how to mobilize an entire area in a sudden emergency.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 807, the Columbia Space Shuttle Memorial Study Act, because those involved deserve it. Thank you again to the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona, and the ranking member.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Indiana. I appreciate the opportunity to engage in this debate. 
   Mr. Speaker, like many others here, previously I typed up different potential remarks for this debate. But as I have listened to the debate over the last couple of days, I kept hearing some things being said over and over  again, and I started making notes of some of the things I just really need to address. 
   As the old saying goes, we are all entitled to our own opinion, but we are not entitled to our own set of facts. Facts are facts.     
   One of the things I have heard over and over the last couple of days, well, it goes without saying. Normally in reference to we support our troops, it goes without saying. If there is anything I have noticed since I left the bench and came to Congress is that nothing goes without saying in this House . Everything gets said and seems like gets said over and over again. Nothing goes without being said. 
   But let us talk about that. It goes without saying we support our troops. That has stirred up a great deal of debate and animosity at one point, and led usually into things about the lies the President told before this war, lies the President told before this war. Well, look, some of us believe in forgiveness. 
   I think there is still potential disagreement. Obviously we know that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. He killed thousands of Kurds, gassed thousands of people. Certainly he was killing with mass destruction, but if you happen to believe really, honestly, truthfully that the President lied, then it is time to forgive President Clinton for all those lies. Forgive Madeleine Albright for all those lies. All the time, Madeleine Albright and Bill Clinton told us over and over again that there were weapons of mass destruction, and if President Bush happened to have believed President Clinton and Madeleine Albright and those people that were saying there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, well, I guess they just should not have believed the Clinton administration. 
   But there were things that the Clinton administration could base that on, but we have got to get past that. It just seems to engender so much hatred. 
   I have heard people say over and over this is a historic debate because the Republicans never allowed this debate when they were in the majority. I remember having discussions like this twice in the last Congress. We voted on a couple of resolutions, and people would say one thing and then end up voting another on the resolution. 
   Now, I did hear one of my friends across the aisle say something I do agree with. He said he did not believe it was appropriate to tell troops they were coming home on a certain date and then change that. I agree, and a number of us have been pointing that out to those in the military and to the White House. That needs to stop. When you tell somebody who is in harm's way you are coming home on a certain date, they need to come home. We can agree on that. 
   But then I heard another say, we need to avoid a constitutional crisis by shocking this President into a new course of action. You shocked him into a new course of action. He said we are going to send 21,000 troops over there, 21,500. In fact, people like Harry Reid down in the Senate have been calling for that last fall, maybe even as recently as December, but oh, wait, as soon as the President calls for it, then it is a terrible thing; we cannot believe that he is doing this. 
   So the President has proposed something new. His commanders in the field have said we need this, and so it is being done. We have got troops already arriving and more arriving all the time. 
   I heard another one make reference to Vietnam, and one in indignation said, have we not learned anything from Vietnam? I would submit, I believe, Mr. Speaker, apparently not, because some people want to rewrite history; but the fact is, if you go back, the people were saying get out of Vietnam, get out of Vietnam are the same people saying this now in Iraq, and so President Nixon tried to get folks out. For all his faults, and he did have plenty, and you will not hear me say I think he was a great President because he lied, but one of the things he did try to do, he saw the polls and started trying to get people out of Vietnam. 
   When we started the Paris peace talks, things broke down. It was not going well. He decided to bomb North Vietnam. He went on the attack. He was carpet-bombing Hanoi, and as Sam Johnson and those who were in the Hanoi Hilton said, they were worried they might be hit by the bombs, but they were so glad, finally the United States was reacting and responding, and as Sam says, when he left, to get the chronology correct, the bombing went on. They came back to the peace talks, and we reached terms, and the POWs, most of them were coming home. Sam said one of the leaders at the prison said, you know, if you guys had just kept bombing a little longer, we would have had to surrender completely. 
   That was a winnable war, but people were not doing what it took to win so that we could have a good reputation. If you go look at our enemies and al Qaeda's, the rhetoric now in Iraq, Afghanistan, around the Middle East, they are saying look at what they did in Vietnam. They promised their allies they were going to stick with them. 
   Gerald Ford has been quoted recently. What a fine man. I hear people on both sides of the aisle at his funeral and after his death. He begged this Congress and this House please do not cut off the funding; we promised them funding even after we pulled our troops out. But this Congress said, no, we are cutting the funding, and we have been harmed ever since. 
   So in 1979, in Iran, they were bold enough to attack. An act of war, that is what attacking an embassy is, and I was at Fort Benning at that time. Nobody was dying to go to Iran, but everybody I knew was willing to go and die because we had been attacked, and that was the first act of war in this war involving terror, and we did not respond. 
   We did not respond in 1983 when our barracks were attacked and our marines were killed. We withdrew 1991, on through the 1990s. We have not responded, but I want to touch on one other thing. 
   I saw the majority leader come down. I saw it replayed in the wee hours this morning. I did not realize it went on, and he came down and challenged what Heather Wilson, who had left the floor, said, and ultimately said basically, that anybody that would come and say, as she did, that there might be a problem with Democrats being willing to support and fund the troops as needed, and he said to come and say anything of that nature was just not honest. I think it comes close to violating the rules if it does not, but the fact is Heather Wilson had stood right here and she had asked her Democratic friends across the aisle, look, if you are really willing to say that, if you are saying that this resolution means we will always provide everything that is needed to our troops in harm's way, let us put it in the resolution. We will have a unanimous-consent amendment, we will both agree, and it was not agreed. The Democratic majority would not agree. The Rules Committee did not agree. The Democratic leadership did not want that in there. 
   So, to say it goes without saying ain't the way it should be. It ought to be in print. It ought to be here said in black and white because Heather Wilson was right: if you really believe that, put it in black and white where our troops can see, and I would just in conclusion leave you with this: this resolution for what it does and does not do, it is a stay the course, stiffen the enemy, start our collapse, and you look at our friend Mr. Murtha's comments to say, that is what this starts the process for doing.

   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, when people on the other side of the aisle wonder how we can ask, Do you really support the troops? How about this quote that was contributed to Mr. Murtha? ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment. They don't have the training. They won't be able to do the work.'' There is no question in my mind. 
   On his Web site that has now been taken down, it says, ``Chairman Murtha will describe his strategy for not only limiting the deployment of troops to Iraq, but undermining other aspects of the President's foreign and national security policy.'' 
   He is the Commander in Chief. That is undermining the President.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (JOHN EDWARD DEAN -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of John Edward Dean's 90th birthday. John Edward Dean was born June 18 , 1917 in Upshur County, Texas. He grew up in my district, in the town of Gilmer, where he attended Gilmer public schools and graduated from Gilmer High School in 1937. Mr. Dean would often ride horseback to school, and by the age of 15, he was hauling cattle to the Fort Worth stockyards to help provide for his younger siblings. 
   In 1945 he purchased Snider's sawmill in Gilmer, where the company will turn 70 next year. 
   John Dean is an American patriot, a servant who so many of us in east Texas have c ome to respect. He never missed a day of work or church due to an illness, and was never even hospitalized until age 70. 
   John and the love of his life, the late Jane Holmes, have 3 children, 7 grandchildren, 8 great grandchildren, and has given generously to the Gilmer community. His lumber company is one of Gilmer's largest employers, and was a pioneer in diversity. 
   He serves as a deacon at First Baptist Church of Gilmer, is a 20-year member of the East Texas Baptist University Board of Trustees in Marshall. 
   I stand here today to wish John Edward Dean a happy birthday, Mr. Speaker, and to pray that God may continue to bless him and his family for being such a blessing to so many others.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND OUR TAX DOLLARS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Well, I thank my friend very much. 
   And as you've been pointing out, we deal with these issues within our own families. My wife and I have been married 29 years this summer, and we have three fantastic daughters. But over the years, including this weekend, I've had to tell my girls, you know, gee, I'd like to help, but money doesn't grow on trees. We're not going to be able to do it right now; perhaps in the next month  or two we can go to that and we will have the money to go forward and do that. But they've also learned that, and we don't get the arguments we did when they were younger because now they have begun to understand the value of money and the value of a dollar and how, if you don't have it, you can't spend it. That's never seemed to have stopped the Federal Government. And it appears that some Members of Congress are having a harder time these days grasping that concept than I might have imagined. 
   And maybe I'm a little naive. Maybe, Mr. Speaker, since this is only my second term in Congress, I have been a little naive. But in the last Congress, when our friends, Democrats across the aisle, stand up and say, you know, we've got to get this spending under control, we've got to stop this wasteful spending, we've got to quit spending more than we've got coming in, I commented to some of my Republican colleagues, you know, they're really right, we have got to do that. And some of us, including my friend, Mr. Garrett, had come together and demanded reform in certain areas, demanded that we get some of this spending under control. And, you know, when the Republicans lost the majority in November, I thought, 
   well, you know, one of the silver linings may be that these folks, the Democratic majority that's about to take over in January, they wouldn't have gone out on a limb over and over and over the way they did unless they really intended to control spending. Maybe that was naive. But anyway, as we've seen with every spending bill that's come before the House, it's draining American pockets with excessive tax hikes, with more spending than is necessary. 
   You know, I was shocked, also, that the usually bipartisan farm bill ended up being shoved over into a partisan issue, that was so extremely unusual, with a $4 billion partisan gimmick at the expense of many taxpayers. I didn't realize until we actually took this farm bill up since I've been in Congress, apparently it comes up every 5 years and it had not come up since I'd been here, but brought the bill up, and I didn't realize 66, 67 percent of the farm bill had nothing to do with agriculture, that it had to do with entitlements, and that those were running away. Some of us began to raise the issue, wait a minute, this is going to be providing food stamps to illegal aliens, and yet we were told, well, it doesn't actually do that. It doesn't provide food stamps to illegal aliens. And that sounded good, except when you don't require documentation to prove legal status, then there is no way to determine whether someone is legally getting food stamps or not getting legal food stamps. So that seemed to fall on deaf ears as well. 
   When the majority was going to promise and did promise energy reform, we got an energy package that will raise taxes by potentially $16 billion over the next 10 years. Now, also, as the House bill on SCHIP, and we've heard a good deal of discussion before we got in here to start with this hour, but the SCHIP bill, you know, helping kids have health care, we're all for that. That's a good thing. But then when you started looking at this House version, the Democrat's version on this, to brutalize seniors on Medicare and saying we're going to take from the seniors and give to the young people, and then it turns out the bill expanded the age so it wasn't just young people, it was also adults were included. I think in the final bill, maybe that will be taken out, but even there we're not sure what is going to end up being in there; we haven't gotten to see that. But then, again, adding subsidies, and basically food stamps is what they amount to, to people in foreign countries instead of taking care of folks here? The way it takes care of folks here is folks here get to pay a whole lot more in taxes than they would otherwise if we weren't trying to take on people that illegally were getting food stamps or weren't sending such money to other countries.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (THE FEDERAL BUDGET AND OUR TAX DOLLARS -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding back. I remember very well. The amendment to prevent illegal aliens from getting such incredible amounts of Federal taxpayer dollars passed by 215-213. We've seen the video of the replay, so it's not just my recollection; it's there in the video. We passed the amendment with the Republican leadership, and as Mr. Garrett will recall, he was a big part of that, and it was 215-213. It sat on the board for a good while, the vote was closed, the gavel came down. And then as we saw on the video, there were two people that came forward. They weren't in the well. They came forward later and changed their vote after the vote was all declared, after everything was done. The vote was final. And somehow, when the smoke cleared, it was 212-216, I believe. So a vote that would have eliminated illegal aliens from receiving benefits under this provision, it passed, and then the rules were violated and it was taken away all so that people illegally here could get the hard-earned tax dollars from legal folks that are here. 
   And if I could remind my gentleman friend from New Jersey, you know, we talked a great deal. And some of us put our conservative rears on the line last year by demanding earmark reform within our own Republican Party. And, in fact, there were probably 30 or so of us that told our leadership we're not voting for another major bill unless we get some type of earmark reform. So we were thrilled, I know Mr. Garrett recalls, we were thrilled, Mr. Speaker, when we got an agreement from the Speaker and we passed the amended rule here in the House that there could not be any air-dropped earmarks, which were the biggest problem, no air-dropped earmarks into conference reports without us having the ability to make a point of order objection and get a vote on those bills. That was a big deal. 
   And I just saw the current Speaker out in the Capitol in Statuary Hall. She was incredibly gracious. She met some young people that are here in the District of Columbia, was very gracious to them. She didn't have to stop, she was very kind. But I recall in September of last year the current Speaker said, quote, ``if you're going to have earmarks and you're going to have transparency, you have to do it in the appropriations bill and in the tax bill and in the authorization bill.''     
   She said, ``I would put it in writing.'' Democratic Chairman DAVID OBEY admitted that ``the public wants us to pass significant House reform.'' He also said, ``To deal with the problem of earmarks by only going after appropriations earmarks constituted basically  consumer fraud masquerading as lobbying reform.'' He said, ``To not do something about authorizing committee earmarks in the process is a joke.'' That was his quote. So that sounds good. But that is not what is being done this year. Americans are kind of fed up with having empty pockets while the government has spending sprees behind closed doors. 
   Now, I am not for eliminating all earmarks. I think some of them are good. Where we, as the most accountable elected officials in the country, in some cases, can tell bureaucrats that are locked up in a cubicle somewhere that this is how this money should be spent, but the important thing is sunshine. It brings about great disinfecting. That is where we are having the problem. That is why so many of our colleagues have signed a discharge petition that is designed to force the House majority leadership to allow a vote on House Resolution 479 that would ensure all taxpayer-funded earmarks are publicly disclosed and subject to challenge and open debate on the House floor. 
   I appreciate my friend from New Jersey yielding, as he has, and I would just offer a couple more observations. Then I will yield back the time. In January, frankly, when the Democratic majority said, ``We are going to have even better earmark reform than what the Republican conservatives got done last year,'' I was pretty happy about that. I thought, that is a good thing. How could we object to that? That is great. But under the new rules, we were told that they did not allow any earmarks. Like I say, there are some earmarks where you have full disclosure. Let them see light of day so people know at whose request and what it is for. That can work out and still be a good thing. But no earmarks is better than having too many secret earmarks. So many of us were pleased. 
   Then, when the bill came out that was chockfull of earmarks, we objected, which is allowed for in the new rules, only to be told that there was a provision in the rules that said you could either have no earmarks whatsoever, or in the bill in question you could have a statement that there were no earmarks in the bill. And the bill in question before the floor, even though it had lots of earmarks, there was the statement in there that there were no earmarks; therefore, it didn't violate the rule. Now, that was quite a shock. You know, Mr. Speaker, the country wanted spending reform, not regression, not reneging, not redoubling or retripling. They want true spending reform. So we need to clean up the wasteful pork in legislation so that American households can continue to bring home their own bacon and not send it somewhere else. 
   I appreciate the time that has been yielded to me by my friend from New Jersey. I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, our friend from New Jersey's battling and agreeing to take this time and concentrate on these issues.

<DOCNO>Mr. GOHMERT. (SAN FRANCISCO VS. TEENMANIA -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I have come to the floor today to praise the more than 20,000 teens that will reunite in San Francisco this weekend to worship. Their movement called Battlecry has a home base in my district just outside Lindale, Texas. 
   Their message is a hopeful one: they reject the negative messages often portrayed in pop culture and, instead, they embrace a godly path. They strive to live a life of Christian values and reject premarital sex, drugs, alcohol, and destructive behavior. 
   One thing is very clear: there is nothing in Battlecry's message that is hateful. It is a message of love. However, last year, when these teens gathered in San Francisco, they were met by protests, and the board of supervisors passed a resolution condemning these young people of Battlecry and their message. 
   As we know, there are some in the San Francisco government who are not happy with these voices carrying a Christian message. These teens are congregating at AT&T Park where the Giants play, and they are going to worship and promote a positive path for young people. The entertainment commission in San Francisco issued a restrictive loud speaker permit to them to prevent their use before 10 a.m., and yet these delightful youth are taking the lemon-sour treatment and are going to turn it into lemonade by using the time in a positive, peaceful manner to reach out in prayer and grace to those in San Francisco and the surrounding area. These Christian young people uniting in Teenmania and Battlecry are filled with love and the teachings of Jesus and are fueled by their faith in God, along with hope for their generation. 
   They offer an alternative to the mysogynistic world. They offer alternatives to drugs, alcohol, sexually transmitted diseases. 
   Mr. Speaker, San Francisco apparently has some who are such religious bigots that they loathe and want to thwart these loving young people because of the grace and kindness these people bring in the name of the Lord. Time magazine has called Battlecry's event the ``Lollapalooza for the Lord,'' and I humbly submit this kind of event is a good thing to have. 
   Of course, we know the discrimination against wholesome, nurturing groups like the Boy Scouts of America in San Francisco by some intolerant fanatics. But this is an alternative to the kind of head-banging music that sometimes promotes drugs, alcohol, careless sexual activity, and at times even anarchy. 
   On the other hand, the young Christians believe that embracing God's love and grace can make the drugs, alcohol, and any hallucinogen completely unnecessary. 
   So I salute these wonderful young people from Battlecry and Teenmania and encourage them to continue promoting positive Christian-type values and the love of the Lord to any and all, including the bigots against them. And for the religiously intolerant who get angry just thinking about Christian young people spreading the love and teachings of Christ, the message needs to go out, far and wide, very clear: Jesus loves you, too.
