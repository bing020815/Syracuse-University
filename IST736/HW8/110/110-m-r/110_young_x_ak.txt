<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, first let me thank the ranking member of the subcommittee for his excellent presentation on this legislation, and, yes, the chairman, too. There is just a matter of a difference of opinion. 
   Again, the majority on that side is more interested in creating recreation and amusement opportunities than creating jobs and affordable energy. It is ironic to me that one of the States, in fact both of the States, named in this bill, none of their Representatives or their Senators have ever voted for any energy development, not one time. And consequently, they are paying, their constituents, a tremendous price for energy they are consuming. 
   Just last week, the Boston Globe published a story that said: ``Massachusetts manufacturers pay the highest electricity prices in the Continental United States,'' thus discouraging industry coming into the State. In fact, it is leaving. 
   A 200-year-old paper mill in Lee, Massachusetts, was shut down because of high energy costs, a loss of 160 jobs. Now, some of these workers may get an opportunity to be retrained to cut brush on the trail we are trying to set aside today. Of course, that pays the minimum wage. 
   It is ironic to me that this was all caused by a lack of action in this Congress. New England needs energy; and if I can remind this body, and good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, that is our number one problem in this country today, is energy. That side of the aisle, not only the side of the aisle in the House but also in that other body, now because of you, we are importing--

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I will point to you next time. 
   We are importing 12 million barrels a day from our enemies, thanks to you; 12 million barrels a day, at $100 a barrel. Mr. and Mrs. America, remember, $1.2 billion a day we are sending overseas because of the majority not supporting energy development. That is $438 billion a year that we are sending overseas, to not our friends, but to our enemies, the Chavezes, and to the Iraqis, the Kuwaitis, Saudi Arabia, and, yes, a little bit to Russia, because we don't have the courage to develop our oil and our fossil fuels in this country, thanks to the majority. 
   And we just voted on a stimulus bill today. Big deal. If you are taking that up, $438 billion a year, we are imposing a $1,460 tax on every man, woman, and child in America every year because the majority will not support energy legislation. Oh, you are going to support a trail today, taking taxpayer dollars again for recreation, but you will not support energy in this country. And this Congress, especially the majority side, has never, ever supported energy production in this country of any type, nuclear, even wind power, and certainly not fossil fuels. 
   That is what is wrong with this Nation today. We are bleeding the economy from our bodies to support overseas countries for fossil fuels which we have on our shores, on our shores and off our shores. We are disallowed from developing the Rocky Mountains. We are disallowed from drilling off the coast of California. We are disallowed from even drilling off the coast of Alaska. And, of course, the majority will never support opening ANWR, which has 39 billion barrels available for America. 
   And for those out there, my colleagues, every time you fill your gas tanks, it doesn't hurt you too bad. But Mr. and Mrs. America as they go to work are being taxed by you. The stimulus package, everybody might get $1,000. But remember, everybody is going to be taxed this year $1,460, every man, woman, and child in America, because this Congress on the majority side doesn't have the courage, the courage nor the wisdom, to develop necessary energy in this country which we have. 
   I ask you, when are you going to wake up? When is this body, and even the Presidential election that is going forth today, I don't hear anybody talking about developing energy sources. I hear about conservation and light bulbs made in China and filled with mercury. Wait until you try to dispose of those, Mr. and Mrs. America, and see what happens. I say shame on us. 
   This bill today is a trail that people say they need and they want. But I suggest, respectfully, if you don't address the energy bill, you will never be able to have anybody walk on it. You might as well make your highways into trails, because you won't be able to run your trains, your planes, your automobiles, or your ships. 
   And that is the economy of this country. That is the economy of this country. If you can't move product to and from, if you don't have the energy within your factories to produce those products and hire the people, you don't have an economy. You don't have an economy. You don't have an America. You don't have freedom. You don't have the Nation of the United States of America. 
   We were made great because we had a source of energy. We were made great because we had hydro and we had fossil fuels, the coal that drove our steel mills and produced the greatest war machine to stop World War II in history. We used our coal because we needed it. We had it and we did it. Not today. You can't do it. 
   So, as I say, Mr. Chairman, this Congress has a tremendous responsibility and you are not living up to it. You passed an energy bill that produced nothing but hot air. Nothing. Conservation, yes, we are all for that. But it had no production in that bill of any source of energy. And yet we say we passed an energy bill. 
   It will come back. It will haunt you. And some day down the line your grandchildren and all those around you and their grandchildren will say, what was Congress thinking about? The greatest Nation in the world, the greatest Nation in the world became a third-class country. The greatest Nation in the world, because we didn't produce our energy. We didn't provide for the future generations. 
   And for those that don't agree with me, thank God these words are going down. And some day along those lines they will say, you know, the gentleman from Alaska had a point that they should have listened to, but they did not. It is too bad they didn't, because we are where we are today, not the democracy that they were then and not the greatest Nation in the world, in fact a third-class country.

<TEXT>
    Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I'm amazed that the Democrats took so long to write such a bad bill. I would laugh if this was any laughing matter, but designing the Nation's energy policy is among the most serious responsibilities of the Congress. H.R. 6 has recklessly been designed by radical environmentalists to achieve many of their long-term goals, including significantly raising the price of energy used by Americans, vastly reducing American manufacturing and mining jobs, increasing federal control over rural Western communities, and reducing and further locking-up the use of our vast God-given coal, oil and gas, oil shale, and timber resources. 
   This bill reaches into every American's bank account and steals vast amounts of hard earned dollars. As a result of this bill, gasoline will be much more expensive, electricity in all areas of the country will go up with many areas with huge increases, home heating oil will continue to surge to record levels, and natural gas prices will literally go through the roof. This bill, a work of exceeding incompetence, is the greatest holiday gift to the OPEC oil cartel ever given by a sovereign nation. 
   Although there are a few provisions in this bill that are appropriate, the vast expanse of this bill is an abomination. If it becomes law, the Democrats who supported it will have to answer to the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (DRILL RESPONSIBLY IN LEASED LANDS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, today is yet another sad day for the American people--real people who are suffering from $4-plus pain at the pump and the Democrat Majority's refusal to do anything about it. 
   This bill is nothing more than a feeble attempt to fool the American people into believing that the Democratic leadership in Congress actually supports more drilling. They don't. The Democrats in Congress have a well documented, 30 year history of opposing more drilling. In fact, just last year, the very same Democrat leaders in this body who now say they support more drilling were arguing that oil companies were drilling too much and too quickly. 
   And let me remind Members that in the first 100 hours of the Democrat's Majority's ``new direction'' for American energy, they attempted to limit and slow down energy production in the National Petroleum Reserve--Alaska (NPR-A) by undoing the provisions Republicans enacted into law in 2005 that would have expedited more drilling in NPR-A. 
   This bill is a sham. It will not produce one drop of American-made oil or natural gas. In fact, there is more drilling in my dentist's office than in this bill. 
   For the record, here are the facts about drilling in NPR-A: 
   All lands in NPRA that are available to be leased under current Bureau of Land Management planning documents have been offered for lease in the past, are currently leased, or are available to be leased now. 
   If the Democrats want to open all of NRP-A for production, they'll have to exempt the 24 million-acre area from the National Environmental Policy Act and dozen other environmental laws. And if they wanted to produce more oil, they'd do something to address the multiple environmental lawsuits that have slowed/stopped production in NPRA. 
   Both industry and the Department of the Interior say the Bureau of Land Management has enough authority to do lease sales and the agency can do them every year if they want--the Democrats' bill won't do anything new. 
   Both industry and Interior say the only impediment to more production is environmental lawsuits, and this bill doesn't touch that. In fact, the ``use it or lose it'' parts of the bill create new litigation that will hold up leasing in NPRA. 
   This legislation is yet another unfortunate example of the Democrat leadership's negligence on producing energy. For the last 30 years they have thrown every obstacle they could in the way of producing more oil and gas for consumers. 
   It's interesting, however, that the Democrat Leadership is arguing that oil companies must ravage the 24 million-acre NPR-A--an area 20 percent larger than ANWR--for its 10.6 billion barrels of oil. 
   Are we to ``extrapolate'' that the Speaker and the Majority Leader now support allowing Americans to tap the same amount of oil from just 2000 acres of the 19 million-acre Coastal Plain of ANWR? 
   The Coastal Plain of ANWR, a flat, frozen desert just 74 miles east of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, is just 1.5 million acres--1/16th the size of NPRA. It contains the same amount of oil. And with today's technology we can produce all of that oil while disturbing no more than 2000 acres, or 0.01 of ANWR's 19 million acres. 
   If the Majority leadership sincerely wants more oil, surely they would support drilling in ANWR, the environmpntally friendly alternative to NPR-A. But no, they don't. And this fact should serve as a reminder of the Majority's real energy policy: No more drilling. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this do-nothing legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank my chairman of the subcommittee and Mr. Shays and the chairman of the full committee. 
   It is indeed an honor that I will speak on Charlton Heston today. We have already heard some of the roles that he played in ``Planet of the Apes,'' ``Julius Caesar,'' ``Antony and Cleopatra,'' ``Omega Man,'' and I can go on down the line. His famous roles, of course, were Moses, Michelangelo, Andrew Jackson, John the Baptist, Mark Antony, El Cid, and Ben Hur. 
   Some people may not remember his role in politics. He became very active as president of the Screen Actors Guild. Before every actor in the world got involved politically, he was involved in the Screen Actors Guild. He was also very active and involved, as mentioned by the chairman, in civil rights. He marched with Martin Luther King. And one of my interests was that he enlisted in the Army Air Force in World War II and served 2 years as a B-25 gunner in the Aleutian chain, a God-awful place it was, but part of my great State of Alaska, and defended against the enemy at that time with great honor. 
   He had two children. He married the love of his life, Lydia Clarke, in 1944, and was married to her for the rest of his life. 
   He was the president of the NRA from June 1998 until April 2003, and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bush. 
   I have to say I knew him personally. I never called him Chuck or Charles, it was always Mr. Heston or Mr. President because he was president of an organization which I am very proud of, and that is the NRA, the National Rifle Association. He probably did more to protect the freedoms of America in his actions as president of that organization than any other individual. And that may not be proper with certain people in this body, but he did guarantee us, through the second amendment, the right to protect ourselves, the right to protect the castle which we live in, the right to be able to protect those that we love against those who would do us harm. He believed in it, as I believe in it. It is very, very important. 
   If America were to recognize one individual who probably contributed most to our individual freedoms, it would be Charlton Heston.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise to comment on the last speaker from New York about States rights and private property rights. 
   The taking of land is dear to me. And this Congress took 147 million acres of land in 1980 and made it into wilderness, parks and refuges. I bring that up because, of that 147, 27 of them were picked by the State. But we did it. That was private property. 
   But I am, Mr. Chairman, dismayed by this Congress, including Members of my own party, who voted today to eliminate funding for the Denali Commission and cripple the economic life to hundreds of small and impoverished communities throughout rural Alaska. 
   I am standing here today in the well defending the funding for the Denali Commission because the Federal Government has, time and time again, as I mentioned, limited the ability of Alaskans to provide for themselves. We have trillions of dollars' worth of resources in our State; we haven't been able to produce them. This Congress has said no to ANWR. Many of the speakers who just spoke voted no on ANWR, no to any new mining, no to more Alaskan oil and natural gas. Not letting Alaskans provide for themselves is economic terrorism by this body. 
   We sent over 15.5 billion barrels of oil through the pipeline. At today's prices, that's equivalent to $1.1 trillion. We have trillions of dollars' worth more of energy. If the State were allowed to manage its own resources, we wouldn't need the commission. And we wouldn't be sending trillions of American dollars overseas, to countries that hate us, for the energy Americans could be producing at home. 
   Unfortunately, energy ignorance in this body is increasing almost as fast as our dependence on foreign oil. Until Alaska is permitted to produce its own resources for themselves and for America, Alaskans will need the Denali Commission. 
   In 1998, Congress passed the Denali Commission Act. It provides job training and other economic development services for rural communities, chiefly in troubled communities, where unemployment exceeds 50 percent. It promotes rural development by providing power generation and transmission facilities, modern communication systems, water and sewer systems, and other infrastructure needs. 
   To give you an idea, my State of Alaska is 656,425 square miles, more than twice the size of Texas. Individual Alaskans own less than 1 percent of their land. The Federal Government owns over 60 percent. Flush toilets are just a luxury, and the Denali Commission tries to provide good sanitation to all Alaskans that do not have the ability to have potable water or remove the sewage they create. The fact is, I doubt if any of you have ever heard of a honey bucket. 
   How many of my colleagues have communities in their districts with no water and sewer? Well, Mr. Chairman, I have several. The Denali Commission has brought these systems to many of my rural communities, but there are still over 150 areas that suffer from poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. 
   There are rural communities that are completely isolated, and my Alaskans can only get to and from their homes by boat or by small plane. There are no roads connecting these communities outside of Anchorage and Fairbanks. 
   The Commission also works carefully to ensure these communities have telephones, a reliable supply of electricity, and in some cases, Internet access. 
   Mr. Chairman, these are all things we in the Lower 48 take for granted, but for thousands of Alaskans they are luxuries.  
   In 2006, the Denali Commission leveraged its funding to develop basic infrastructure in over 100 Alaska communities. It invested money towards replacing aging fuel tanks and upgrading rural power plants, while at the same time pushing for wind generation, hydro, geothermal and biomass energy projects. 
   In addition to constructing several essential village primary care clinics, the Denali Commission funded major design initiatives for needed replacement hospitals in Nome and Barrow. It has now completed clinics in over 65 of these remote communities. 
   The Commission also provided funding to construct housing for teachers in nine frontier communities, which is essential for recruiting and retaining teachers to the remote areas of my State. The Commission worked tirelessly each year to make sure that my Alaskans are not treated like second-class citizens. The amendment will cripple the Denali Commission's ability to provide these basic resources and cripple many rural communities that are already on crutches. 
   Mr. Chairman, I can say this respectfully for one thing. We talk a lot about the economics of this Nation and energy. This Congress has lacked in a positive way. I am deeply disturbed that this amendment was adopted by my own party and by the opposite party. I hope you reconsider this when we go to conference.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (LUMBEE RECOGNITION ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I compliment the chairman of the committee, Mr. Rahall. As many of my colleagues know, I have long supported the efforts of the Lumbee Tribe to be federally recognized. 
   I have had discussions with the sponsor of the bill who represents them, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McIntyre). I have studied their case for many years when I served as ranking member and chairman of the Committee on Resources. 
   The Lumbee's quest for recognition has been going for more than 100 years, which seems to be longer than almost any other tribe currently in the recognition process. During this time, the Lumbees have been put under a microscope and subjected to intensive debate by the State of North Carolina, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Congress, historians, and other Indian tribes. 
   In my judgment and that of the committee, this is clearly a distinct community of Indian people who meet the definition of ``tribe'' under article I, section 8 of Constitution; and the fact that more than 200 Members of this body have cosponsored H.R. 65 attests to the tribe's legitimacy.     
   Here are some of the facts about the Lumbee tribe. It is a State-recognized tribe. It has submitted huge amounts of documentation to prove that it is an autonomous Indian community that can trace links to a historic tribe. Even the Act of 1956, which terminated the tribe, helps to prove their case. 
   The reason for this is that, in order to be terminated by Congress, you first must be recognized. The fact that Congress had to identify the Lumbees before terminating them is a clear indication that Congress considered them to be a distinct Indian community within the meaning of the Constitution. Why else would Congress feel a need to prohibit benefits for this community if, as the opposition alleges, they were not eligible for the benefits in the first place? 
   Ask anyone who has traveled to Robeson County, and they will report that the county is largely governed by the Lumbee people already. In one sense, this bill merely puts a Federal endorsement on the fact that an independent, self-governing tribe exists in North Carolina. 
   But this is a tribe that still lacks the status of all the other federally recognized tribes. And in lacking the benefits, immunities and the responsibilities accorded to other tribes, the Lumbees are second-class citizens within the Indian world. This is not right. 
   H.R. 65 corrects this historic injustice, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill as soon as possible. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I'd like to compliment Mr. McIntyre. He was very concise in his presentation about why we should act on this legislation. 
   And ENI, I'm glad you brought up the fact that it has passed the House twice, died in the Senate. Congressman Rose came to me, and that's when I got interested in this legislation. And it's long overdue. 
   Now, I know there will be a motion to recommit which I will not offer and will not support. But I want to remind people that motion is a motion to actually have them go through, the Lumbee, the process. And I heard much about the process. 
   Now, I've been involved in this business now 34 years, and the process of recognition is at the will and the whim of a bureau that, in fact, supported, and the Solicitor General said, no, you have to go back to Congress, and, in fact, we will not recognize you. If you go through the process, just forget it. 
   We've already gone through the process, in reality. In fact, we had a hearing a while back, including the assistant secretary of the BIA, and I asked him, when was the last time the process worked? When was the last tribe recognized through the process? And he stuttered and stammered, and I think he had one in the last 10 years. That's the process? 
   And we've been waiting 51 years for this recognition, 51 years. The Congress did act, twice. The Congress set up the original act, and now we're being asked, through a motion to recommit, to use the process? And I'm saying, nonsense. 
   Let's do what is right today. Let's recognize this tribe as they should. Let's make sure that, in fact, they can go forth. 
   And those that oppose this, let's not kid yourself. It's not about policy. It's really about cutting the pie up. We have been told by a study, this is going to cost $400 million more. And then the other side says, no, it's to come out of the pot. This is not about the money because the money is in the formula. If we don't appropriate any more dollars, then it doesn't cost any more money. But if they're recognized, they do have a right to participate in those programs as they should, as a recognized tribe. 
   And so I'm suggesting that this is long overdue. Again, congratulations to the chairman and to the Congressman who represents that district. And I hope he remembers that, when I have an issue on Alaska, that Members that represent the districts ought to be listened to. And I do respect that representation.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Just a little history, Mr. Speaker. There are 561 total recognized tribes. We have recognized 16 of those through action of Congress, and 31 were recognized by the Department of the Interior. 
   And about the motion to recommit saying go back and follow the process, in the last 10 years, and the fact is longer than 10 years, I think 15 years or longer than that, 1978 was the last one, the so-called system worked and with a Bureau that, in fact, has suggested that they are not recognized. Well, what chance would the Lumbees ever have of being recognized? It wouldn't happen. So what this motion to recommit does is say, all right, we are just not recognizing them. It is really not a motion that says they have to follow the process. 
   And we do have the authority. The Congress has the ultimate authority. Like I said, we have already done 16 these, and it says right here that the Supreme Court ruled in the United States v. Sandoval that the Congress cannot arbitrarily recognize a group of Indians as a tribe, but its powers are very broad. All Congress has to do is determine that, one, the group has ancestors who lived in what is now the USA by the time of European discovery and, two, the group be a ``people distinct from others.'' And that is what the Lumbees are. 
   So this is a motion to really stop the recognition, let's not kid ourselves, because they will never be recognized through the process. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, here we go again; another nail in the coffin of energy independence. Another nail, in fact, adding to the unemployment rate.     
   If this bill was to become law, mines will be shut down. They will be shut down. And what bothers me the most is we had a bipartisan bill, actually it was passed in 2006, I believe, or 2007, that improved the 1977 Mine Safety Health Act. It was supported by everybody, that side and this side, the administration. And we have not given the time, that's less than a year and a half, given the time for the operators of these mines to even reach that requirement that we said was the right thing to do. 
   Now, it always amazes me. I don't think there's much coal mining in Vallejo or in the Bay Area or in Point Reyes. And I do respect the gentleman from West Virginia because he does have mining. And I've heard from his operators in that area that there's a very difficult thought process going forth with this bill. Can they operate? Because in this bill, they stop the ability for belt air, which, in fact, was put in for safety purposes, supported by the people who understand this, for diluting methane and dust levels, and this bill prohibits that. How is that improving the life of our miners? It is not. 
   And more than that, I want to remind people. As bad as it may appear, as very much, you know, heart wrenching when there is a death in a mine, we still have the safest mining industry in the world. China lost 6,000 people, that we know of last year in their coal mines; building one new coal fired plant a week. 
   And here we are, with this bill, if it was to become law, again, adding another nail in our coffin for energy independence. Coal is a solution to this terrible dependence that we have on foreign oil. 
   I was a little disappointed today when I saw the President ask the OPEC countries to produce more oil so we can lower the price. 
   Our fault in this country is we're not producing oil on our lands, which we have, and we're not producing the coal, which we have an abundance of. And I believe, when saying this under the guise of helping the miner out, we are jeopardizing their jobs, jeopardizing  the economy in this country, and driving us further into the depression which may occur. 
   If that does happen, I want to compliment that side of the aisle, because you haven't addressed the issue of energy. And I'm a little bit disappointed. I watched all the Presidential debates. Not even on my side, let alone that side, has anybody talked about solving the energy problem in this country. We must address that issue because our economy is based on energy that can move product. Every ship is fossilly driven. Every train is fossilly driven. Every truck is fossilly driven. Every car, everything you eat and everything you consume is delivered to you by fossil fuels. 
   Now, we can improve nuclear power to give us fixed power, and we can burn coal, and we can use solar, and we can use hydro. We can do all these things. But there's fixed power. And we, as a Nation, and this Congress have not got to the point where we understand if we don't do something, we keep sending the dollars abroad, there's a great possibility that this whole economy we have will implode. 
   I'm saying, wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America. Start asking your Members of Congress, let's do something about energy. You can't conserve yourself into a prosperity position. You've got to have new energy, new production. Yes, drilling. Offshore in California, shame on you. Offshore in Florida, shame on Florida. Offshore in Alaska, shame on Alaska. We must start developing our fossil fuels in the Rocky Mountains. We must start at the Roan Plateau, which you took off the table. The Roan Plateau, have that developed. We have to start doing what is necessary to make sure we're no longer dependent on those foreign countries that are not our friends. 
   So I urge a ``no'' on this bill because it's another nail in the coffin that creates in this country more weaknesses and not the ability to provide for the future generations.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (VIRGINIA RIDGE AND VALLEY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I come from a State which has more of its land locked up in wilderness than any other State, 58 million acres. This is larger than the entire State of New York and accounts for 56 percent of all the wilderness in the United States, so I think I know wilderness. I know that a lot of wilderness in Alaska is designated for reasons that have little to do with the stated goals of the Wilderness Act. 
   The designations have blocked vital uses of these lands and blocked access to State and private resources that we Alaskans were promised when we entered statehood. There have been and still are major consequences for what Congress did in 1980. In the East, where most of you come from, that is not always the case. 
   All I can say is that if this is what Mr. Boucher and his constituents want in Virginia, then good luck. I can guess that one day, I think that one day they will regret this action. Given Virginia's population growth, the severe risk of forest fires, such as they are in California today, caused by sustained drought, I believe all but two counties have been declared disaster areas by the Governor last week, problems with gypsy moths and other agricultural threats to this area and the dampening effect that wilderness restrictions can have on the development of adjacent areas, you may wonder why you have brought this upon yourself. We should be looking to give the Forest Service more tools to manage our lands, not taking them away, which is exactly what wilderness does. 
   Once this bill becomes law, our constituents, your constituents, may find that they may not be able to burn wood in their fireplaces that keep them warm in the winter because their quality of wilderness must be protected, or that a new school or hospital can't be built because the view shed for the wilderness could be affected. People are even talking about ``smellscapes'' when it comes to wilderness areas, so enjoy your Weber grill right now while you can. 
   The committee should also know that H.R. 1011 designates nearly 27,000 acres of wilderness above what was recommended by the Forest Service. This is contrary to the recently revised Jefferson National Forest Plan, which took 11 years, millions of dollars, and extensive public involvement to create. We asked for this study. They followed the rules, but now we are ignoring the professional land managers. 
   In addition, H.R. 1011 will endanger citizens living near this proposed wilderness area by tying the hands of the Forest Service, who need to perform proactive treatments that could reduce the risk of wildfires. Wildfires, I keep stressing that because we are seeing what is happening in California. If they cleared off those forests around those homes, they would not be burning today, but that was prohibited. 
   Nonqualifying areas are now being actively managed for endangered threatened species protection, and this could come to an end. 
   The amendment filed by Mr. Goodlatte helps mitigate some of these issues, and I will strongly support the amendment. Most notably, the amendment will remove 26 acres which contain a power line and remove 1,263 acres from the proposed designation to allow continued use of the Barton Gap Motorized trail and Wildlife Habitat Management in key areas. 
   I could go on and on about this. I just want to warn people, it is not the area we are talking about; it is the Wilderness Act itself, and it should be upgraded. I encourage my chairman to do so so that we can address those problems that can occur from the designation of wilderness, taking care of gypsy moths, taking care of the fires, taking care of the ability to access and to have the availability of the area for public use. If we do not do that, then I think we are doing ourselves a great mistake. 
   I do not live in this area. I am not affected by it. That's why, very frankly, I am not raising some of the objections that I should have raised to it. 
   I think you will learn, though, in the long run, you are not doing yourselves a favor. The Forest Service themselves can manage this land in a manner that will take and provide for the people. It  does not have to be designated as a wilderness area. 
   Again, it has already been done. We have moved it out of committee, and I will say, again, may I not be on this floor when you come back to say we have to revise it. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman that just spoke and his presentation. I just, again, wish that people would understand it's not the wilderness itself; it's how the act has been written. And if you think you're going to make a living off of coffee shops and tourism, these are low-grade paying jobs. I've seen it happen. I've seen my town of Ketchikan. We created a forest that we can't harvest and we took $80,000 jobs now down to the minimum wage. That will happen too. So I just, and it's too late, it's your district. You believe in what you say, and I commend you for it. But this is not the economy which I see, serving those that come from the larger urban areas, the elitists, as I call it. 
   And this area, by the way, was farmed at one time, as you know, and timbered and mined. People had jobs that provided and produced. We are rapidly becoming a Nation of consumption and of no production, of pleasure and no sweat. 
   Having said that, I have no other speakers, and yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, speaking to my point of order, this amendment constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of clause 2(c) of rule XXI because it will impose substantial new duties on the Secretary of Agriculture. Under Deschler's Precedents, volume 8, chapter 26, section 50, where an amendment seeks to impose on a Federal official substantial duties that are different from or in addition to those already contemplated in law, then it is considered legislative in nature and violates clause 2(c) of rule XXI. 
   Moreover, under Deschler's Precedents, volume 8, chapter 26, section 52, even though a limitation or exception therefrom might refrain from explicitly assigning new duties to officers of the government, if it implicitly requires them to make investigations, compile evidence or make judgments or determinations not otherwise required of them by law, then it assumes the character of legislation and is subject to a point of order under clause 2(c) of rule XXI. 
   This amendment will require the Secretary of Agriculture to make investigations and compile evidence not otherwise required under existing law, as well as make a substantive determination not required by any law applicable to his authority. See 8 Deschler's Precedents, chapter 26, section 52.38. 
   The amendment bars planning and studying of certain roads, those used for timber harvesting by individuals or private entities in the Tongass National Forest. Roads used for other purposes and by other entities are not affected. In addition, the amendment bars the use of funds to ``construct'' such a road. Under volume 23 of the U.S. Code, section 101(a)(c), ``construction'' is defined to include reconstruction of roads. This definition is reflected in the Forest Service budget, which differentiates between construction/reconstruction of roads and maintenance of roads. This is also reflected in the road provisions affecting all roads, including those in the Tongass National Forest. I cite pages 7-36, 7-33 and 4-115, ``Road and Bridge Construction/Reconstruction,'' of the draft proposed Tongass Forest Plan relating to roads to reflect this understanding. Therefore, this amendment will apply to not only proposed roads but also to the 3,653 miles of permanent roads already in the Tongass National Forest. Some of these roads are not currently used for timber harvesting but could be in the future. 
   Under the National Forests Roads and Trails Act (16 U.S.C. 532-538), the U.S. Forest Service constructs forest development roads ``within and near'' national forests that ``will permit maximum economy in harvesting timber from such lands tributary to such roads and at the same time meet the requirements for protection, development and management thereof, and for the utilization of the other resources thereof.'' 
   Under the current Forest Service Transportation Planning Handbook and the Tongass Forest Plan, the Secretary does not identify or track roads by the character of their use nor is such a determination required for reconstruction of existing roads. A road in a national forest may have multiple purposes, including recreation access, subsistence hunting access, vehicle use for emergencies, travel routes, utility maintenance or egress to Forest Service ranger stations or other structures. 
   Moreover, a road could be used for timbering operations by multiple participants, including the Forest Service itself, the State of Alaska, local governments, mining corporations with mining permits, private contractors or Native Alaskan tribal entities. According to the Forest Service, these landowners take between 80 million and 100 million board feet of timber from their lands in a year.     
   Some of these users would not be barred by the Chabot amendment. No current law requires the Secretary to differentiate between users of Forest Service roads. In support of this assertion, I quote from a recent letter from Under Secretary of Agriculture for Natural Resources and the Environment: ``Because the Forest Service does not distinguish roads on the basis of who uses them, implementation of the proposed Chabot amendment on the Tongass National Forest would require new processes, policies and additional work to ensure that, if the Forest Service is spending funding on roads, such roads are not utilized by individuals or private entities in support of harvesting timber on Federal or nonFederal lands.'' 
   Under the terms of the amendment, the Forest Service would have to make an initial determination that the road proposed for construction or reconstruction would not be used for impermissible uses by impermissible people. For existing roads proposed for reconstruction, this would mean first monitoring the road to see how it is used and by whom over some period of time. 
   In addition, the Secretary would also have to monitor and enforce compliance with the limitation after the road is built or reconstructed. Enforcing this restriction would be burdensome. The Tongass National Forest, and the Nation's largest public forest, is 16.7 million acres, approximately the size of the State of West Virginia. It is comprised of scattered lands located along the mountains of Alaska's southeastern coast, and portions are remote and difficult to get to. 
   Within the forest are approximately 128,000 acres of State, Alaska Native Corporation and private land are accessed only through the Tongass National Forest roads. According to the Forest Service, 3,653 miles of permanent miles of roads have been constructed in the Forest, and these roads are used for travel, forest management, recreation, subsistence access, remote community connections, as well as the timber harvest. 
   Only 570 Forest Service personnel are assigned to the forest, one employee for every 45,000 acres. The majority of these employees do office work and are not out in the field, so the Secretary would have to make substantial hires and reassign these personnel to patrol roads. I cite eight Deschler's Precedents, Chapter 26, section 52.22 regarding the imposition of duty to monitor actions of recipients as transforming a limitation amendment into legislation. 
   For those reasons, I ask you to sustain my point of order. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order?

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I first want to compliment the gentleman from New Jersey, and the gentleman, Mr. Chabot, of Ohio. This was sprung on me 2 years ago, and I was quite upset, and I'm still upset, but you are being gentlemen about it. 
   I will return that favor. Last time, it was very unhappy and very ugly. 
   But, again, I urge my colleagues to vote against this. Let's be clear about this amendment. This amendment is not about fiscal responsibility, in all due respects. It's a giveaway to the radical and environmental groups that want to treat the Tongass and all southeast Alaska as their taxpayer subsidized playground. 
   The problem with the timber harvest program is that environmental groups have purposely driven up the costs of managing it by filing multiple, multiple frivolous lawsuits and appeals. Now that they have successfully created the problem, they're offering a solution: target a Member of Congress unfamiliar with Alaska and the Tongass, and express concern that the Tongass timber program has become uneconomical and should not be funded by the taxpayer, request that they offer an amendment, threaten Members with negative score on their annual report cards for failing to support the amendment. 
   This is like a personal injury lawyer who sues lawyers over living, and then complains to Congress about the high cost of medical care. As long as you are talking about taxpayer dollars and fiscal conservatism, it should be noted that the lawsuits and appeals responsible for the high cost of doing business in the Tongass are all funded by the American taxpayer under the Equal Access to Justice Act, which says if you are an environmental fundraising group in the ninth circuit, you file lawsuits by piece work and get your money back for every one you file. 
   This is the ``taxpayer waste'' we should be discussing here today, taxpayers waste. If not for the never-ending onslaught of frivolous, taxpayer-funded lawsuits and appeals, the U.S. Forest Service could be managing a timber program at a net profit. 
   In addition to putting a Federal stamp of approval on these groups' antics, a ``yes'' vote on this amendment will cripple what's left, what's left of the several hundred Alaskan jobs. At one time, I had 15,000 jobs in my State that's been taken away. You have outsourced them. 
   The timber industry supports the best-paying year-found jobs in southeast Alaska, or they did. Even though environmentalists have already succeeded locking up over 96 percent of the Tongass, and eliminating most of these jobs, they are now after the remaining 4 percent, the last few hundred jobs, 15,000 versus 400, and this is America? This is nothing economic. This is economic terrorism. What's worse, the American taxpayer has been paying for it. 
   If supporters of this amendment would like to join me in restricting the frivolous timber appeals and lawsuits filed by the environmental trial lawyers against every timber sale and every road in the Tongass, we could lower the cost of timber harvest and return the profit to the taxpayer. 
   Very frankly, I believe this amendment is a job-killing bill, supposedly protecting taxpayers, but it's about fooling them. It's about forcing my constituents out of work and removing people from the Tongass so the environmentalists have a 17 million acre taxpayer subsidized playground for themselves. 
   I want to remind people, I have been through this in 1980. This Congress took away 16.5 million acres of Tongass. They took it all away but 10 percent. We were told there would be peace in the valley, yet same groups, same trial lawyers, same environmental groups are trying to take that last 4 percent away, 400 jobs, out the drain. 
   Each one of you were talking about how bad the economy is in the United States, how you outsourced your jobs, you and your industrial States, and yet you are doing this to the State of Alaska, the jobs that Alaskans have. It's a disservice to this body to continue to pander to a group that knows nothing about it other than the fact they want their playground. It's the wrong thing to do to us. 
   I know the why the two gentlemen are introducing this amendment. I understand it. But think of what you are doing to your Americans. The workers are left. Let us manage the timber. We would have had a profitable area, but asked by your supporters of this amendment have stopped our ability to manage the forest in a profitable way and driven those jobs overseas, into Canada, into South America, where they defoliated the forests. 
   We have done a disservice to a renewable resource, a terrible disservice to a renewable resource. This Congress has not managed its force, because they want to supposedly protect the trees, and those trees are dead trees, my good friends, they are dead. They should be harvested. 
   All I am asking is not to impose this on them so we can get that little, final 4 percent available for the Alaskan workers and for this Nation. That's not asking much. I am urging my colleagues to vote, very strongly, a no on this amendment. It's the wrong thing to do. It's the wrong thing to do for this Nation, wrong thing to do for the State of Alaska, but it's the wrong thing to do for the Americans of this great Nation.

   I would ask the authors of this amendment if they would respond to the question. 
   Will you respond, Mr. Chabot and Mr. Andrews? 
   I am going to introduce legislation to allow the forest to be sold to the State of Alaska. If you are fiscally conservative, we will raise about $4.5 billion, we will pay you for it. 
   Then we can manage it as we should manage it, because right now it's not being managed. When I introduce that bill, are you willing to get on my bill to sell that forest to the State of Alaska so we could manage it as it should be managed. 
   Would you be willing to sponsor that bill?

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Again, I just hope you understand, this is a national forest. It only has 4 percent available. A national forest that has 4 percent. And the gentleman, the ranking member, has mentioned the fact that there's no $40 million being spent. 
   And by the way, this is on national land because the comment was made about the roads could be built by the persons that's doing the logging. That's true. But if it's built by that person, those roads are no longer available to the general public. And what has happened, we've built a network of roads on Prince Wales Island primarily that provide, for all the local communities, communications capability that tie in with the ferries. Those roads still belong to the United States, just not the State of Alaska. They're part of the United States road system. 
   And so I'm just suggesting that these roads, if it was done by just a contractor, then that right wouldn't be there. Those roads would have to be pulled up, put to rest back to the original contour. 
   So, again, I know who's asking you to do this. I understand it. But it's really being a little disingenuous. In fact, the roads themselves are in a different area that was on private land. This is on Federal land, not private land. 
   And so I respectfully again ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment because it's the wrong thing to do for the State of Alaska and for the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would say to my dear colleagues, just about 100 hours ago you stood in this House and raised your hand and you followed this quote with an ``I do'': ``Do you solemnly swear you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.'' 
   This bill, and I am wearing this red shirt today, is the color of the bill that we are debating, communist red. It is a taking. And regardless of what one says, it will go to court, and it should be decided in court. It should be decided there. 
   My biggest concern, it is often said the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and this is a great example. The good intentions of this bill are a pursuit of new forms of energy to replace our dependency. We all support that. 
   But even The Washington Post, which is not my favorite newspaper, says this is a low-wattage bill and it fits the realm of Russia and Putin, and it fits Bolivia and Venezuela. And if there is anything this bill will do, in fact it will increase the competitive edge of foreign oil imported to this country. That is what this bill does.     
   I ask my colleagues, if the problem is foreign oil, and it is, why increase taxes and make it harder to produce American oil and gas? That makes no sense to me. 
   I had a motion to recommit and I cannot offer it, but I wanted to take and strike everything after the enacting clause and insert taxes on all foreign oil imported. That would raise your money for renewable resources. 
   But what we are doing here today is taxing our domestic oil. We are raising dollars supposedly for renewable resources, yet we are still burning fossil fuels. 
   This is really a San Francisco energy policy, and America is not San Francisco. 
   My State gets 85 percent of its budget from oil production. I am proud of it and I hope we get more. The pipeline we want to build for gas to deliver the oil to the lower 48 will cost $20 billion, and this, by increasing taxes and taking away the incentives, which this bill does, raises the question of whether we can finance this pipeline, which we all need. 
   We talk about Joe Blow and all the rest of these people in the smaller income brackets and get the big old oil companies. The reality is if this bill was to become law gas would go to $5 a gallon. 
   Everybody talks about Big Oil and how much profit they made. These international companies are making that profit overseas shipping the oil to the United States. 
   If you want to do this right, then let us tax the foreign oil. Let us not tax the American oil. Let us not hurt our little companies, which this bill does. Let us not discourage what I call the frontier areas. Let us help American oil to deliver oil to the American people and quit paying the money to the foreign oil companies, and that is what you are doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (THOMASINA E. JORDAN INDIAN TRIBES OF VIRGINIA FEDERAL RECOGNITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from West Virginia said, I do support H.R. 1294. This bill and prior versions have been in the works over the last several Congresses. This bill is long overdue. 
   We have heard arguments saying that we should let the tribes undergo the Federal acknowledgment process at the Department of the Interior. This would be a reasonable argument except for the fact that the Department's process is not specifically authorized by Congress. The intentions behind the creation of the process in 1978 were honorable enough, and perhaps compelling tribes to use this process is appropriate in certain cases. 
   But it is a fact that the Department has not always abided by its own process in extending the recognition, or failing to extend recognition, to some legitimate tribes. It is a fact that the administrative process is bogged down  with hundreds of petitions, many of which are not filed by tribes that can demonstrate the history of the six Virginia tribes. 
   In the hearings held on this bill, the committee has heard convincing testimony describing the rich but sometimes sad history of the six Virginia tribes. I do not need to repeat the detailed history starting with Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. We have heard a lot of that recently. 
   What matters is whether or not the evidence presented to the Congress demonstrates a continuous existence of a distinct Indian community from the time of European contact to the present. And in this, the six group petitioners in H.R. 1294 pass the test with flying colors. 
   This legislation enjoys broad support throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia. I would specifically point to the efforts of the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Jo Ann Davis) who has been an untiring advocate for recognizing the Rappahannock tribe, which is in her district. She is the sponsor of H.R. 106, a bill to recognize this tribe. She is also cosponsoring the bill before us today. 
   Her support, as well as the support of the elected officials of Virginia, is critical. Local knowledge and interaction with the tribes is a key consideration. We are obligated to weigh this very heavily in our deliberations over this bill. We have an obligation to defer to the judgment of the Members when bills affecting their constituents are at stake. 
   One of the few points of opposition to H.R. 1294 concerns the issue of gaming. The bill contains a strict prohibition on any gaming in Virginia. I do not think it is fair to limit tribal sovereignty in this way. It is unfair to view recognition through the prism of Indian gaming. 
   However, the committee made its decision to defer to some Members of the Virginia delegation on this issue, and I reluctantly supported an amendment to add the gaming measure. 
   Therefore, I trust that H.R. 1294 will pass the House with a strong majority today, and I urge my colleagues to give their Virginia tribes their due. 
   I would like to also recognize Mr. Moran who has done an outstanding job on this issue and has been a great promoter. I always admire those, although not in his district, that have stepped forth and carried this torch on that side of the aisle, and I do compliment him on that effort. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. My friends, it's not very hard to understand why our country is facing an energy crisis; in fact, it's very simple. America needs more oil, gas, coal, nuclear and hydropower. We need more wind power. But Congress has refused to unlock these resources. This bill does nothing to release those resources allowed to provide us with the energy. It concentrates on corn, switchgrass, and a few hybrid cars. 
   My friends, oil, gas, coal, nuclear and hydropower are the backbone of this country. They supply more than 90 percent of our energy needs to fuel the world's number one economy. I would add that developing them does not raise the price of food, such as corn. There's no shortage of these energy resources in America. There is a shortage of the will to develop them. In fact, the majority leadership of this body, the last two Democrat Presidents and their allies in the environmental movement have created a false energy shortage through their constant attempts to lock up homegrown energy. 
   Let me give you a few examples. They want to ban all offshore oil and gas development. They oppose U.S. oil production of North America's largest onshore prospect. They stopped oil and shale development in the omnibus spending bill. They opposed coal, and even applauded when President Clinton locked up millions of tons of clean fuel in Utah. They want the tens of trillions of cubic feet of clean-burning natural gas in the Rocky Mountains locked up forever. They oppose nuclear power plants; they, being the majority party. They oppose hydroelectric power. They even want to tear down nonpolluting hydroelectric dams in the Northwest. 
   They want to impose high taxes on the use of energy, driving energy prices paid by your constituents to even higher than they are today. They even oppose using biomass of overgrown, unhealthy forests as a renewable fuel supply. In particular, the biofuel mandate in this bill is a direction to burn down forests and close more mills in the West. 
   More than half of Alaska's Federal land, and we have enormous potential for a biofuels industry; this bill stops all of that. This bill will hold Alaska to the highest standards. Alaskans would be forced to purchase the most efficient, read the most expensive, appliances. The residents of the wealthy district in San Francisco have money to buy the most efficient, expensive furnaces and air conditioners, and I would bet most of them are inclined to spend their money on them. Many Alaskans, however, cannot afford to spend the extra $200, $300, $400 for the most efficient furnaces. Under this bill, they will have to. In a survey of 100 Alaskan communities, the average price of gas is $5 a gallon. 
   The majority leader is playing Russian roulette with the economy. This year, every bill we've passed concerning energy is another bullet in the chamber of a gun staring point-blank at America's head, and by my count, it's already fully loaded. 
   This is a bad bill. It's a charade. It's a disgrace for this body to vote ``yes'' for this bill. I am urging us to vote ``no.''

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I just witnessed one of the greatest displays of inaccuracies I have ever heard in my life. 
   It's too bad that the public doesn't understand that this whole bill is a charade, and I am disappointed in my chairman because there were no hearings on this. In fact, the testimony that I have heard from the majority is the reality is not real. The report is not real. And where he gets the figures about 68 million acres set aside and not utilized, I don't know. And where do they get the idea of getting 4 billion barrels? 
   I've just listened to the gentleman from Massachusetts' tirade. I have heard that same tirade for as long as he's been in Congress. He has never supported any energy at all, any development of energy, including nuclear. Now his people in Massachusetts are paying that price. 
   When I first came to Congress, we were in the minority, and the price of oil for a barrel was $8 a barrel, 39 cents at the pump. Yes, it's high today because the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was the last big development we ever had because this Congress would not allow us to develop any other oil fields. Now, we have a big oil field in Alaska called ANWR, which is 74 miles away from the existing pipeline that delivers 17 billion barrels to the American people, and we're not allowed to drill it because this Congress won't act. 
   And we have a tirade on this floor about blaming Big Oil. There's only one group that's to blame, and it's this Congress, both sides of the aisle, because it's easier to buy it from OPEC countries. And we stopped trying to figure out how we can get off the dependency. We have not done that. 
   Now, if we don't drill, we are going to be in trouble. I predict the price of oil, if we don't drill and start supply to this demand in the United States, the price of oil will probably go to $150 a barrel. And that's going to be under your watch. 
   Are you proud of what you've done? I say no. This bill is a charade. It should be voted down, and we should vote ``no, no, no, drill, drill, drill.''

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This is an issue. And the frustration on this side--and it should be on that side--is on the lack of an energy policy that only Congress can solve. 
   I know there's a lot of talk. The Speaker just sent a letter to the President to use the SPR, as if that's going to solve the problem. That's not going to solve the problem. In fact, it will make the problem worse. We have to address the supply side of this issue, and we're not doing it. 
   The last time we produced any new energy on this floor was 1973 when we had an embargo and we had no fuel, so we passed the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline. In 1976, we produced the first barrel of oil to America from Alaska. In 3 years, we built an 800-mile-long pipeline 48 inches around. We built the terminus point in Valdez, and I wear that today on my tie. We drilled the wells and we built the collection lines to deliver that oil. And we got as high as 2.2 million barrels a day to the United States of America because we were under the threat at that time, the same threat we are today, of control by overseas forces, not forces of military fact, but in fact those that control our supply. At that time, we were importing 39 percent of our oil from overseas. Today, it's 70 percent. And we have done nothing in this Congress to relieve that problem. 
   Your constituents are paying for it today. There is no shortage of fuel. There is a high cost of fuel because we don't have the domestic capability of providing it. We need to have this debate on the floor. Let us stand up and be counted on both sides of the aisle who is for domestic production. 
   There is no shortage of fossil fuel in the United States of America. We have an abundance of it. We've had the lack of will to produce it. It was easier to buy it abroad. We just had a sale in Alaska, other than ANWR, in Chukchi Sea about $2.6 billion from an oil company to try to develop it because there is a lot of argument on that side, well, they're not drilling the acreage they have now. You know why they're not drilling? Because your friends and your allies are filing suits not allowing them to drill, suits that say, oh, there's going to be polar bears affected or there's going to be some little other type of animal affected. In the meantime, your constituents are paying that $4.62 a gallon. Yes, the oil did drop yesterday, but it will go up tomorrow and the next day because we are not supplying the oil to our people through the domestic source. 
   We have the shale that was mentioned in Utah and Wyoming and all the other areas, Colorado; huge amounts of oil. We have more coal in the United States than there is all around the world and we're not developing it. We have not had the will to develop it because this Congress sits by and talks about saving records of the past administration. Your bill may not do that, but this is what this is all about. And I'm saying that doesn't produce any gas. That doesn't help the truck driver. It costs $2,000 to fill up one Peterbilt truck that delivers your food to your grocery store. Wait until that price starts hitting the prices in the grocery store, and it already has. The harvester who harvests the grain today now is paying sometimes as high as $4 and $5 for diesel fuel to run it. That's going to affect you, too. 
   We have not acted on this floor. And the responsible way of addressing the issue--now, some people will say we'll have the other forms of energy, wind and hippy-hoppies and that type of thing to solve the problem. But the reality is fossil fuels drive objects. It's the trucks, the planes, the trains, and the automobiles that deliver to your homes and your hospitals and your schools, and we must have that. 
   Yes, we can go into nuclear. Yes, we can go into wind. Yes, we can go into solar. And we can go to geothermal and hydro. We can do all those things and we should. My bill, H.R. 6107, to open ANWR--this, by the way, 12 times it passed this House floor. We won't have a vote on it this year, but we should have a vote. The one time we got it out of the Senate and Bill Clinton vetoed it.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Bill Clinton vetoed it because he said it will take 10 years to produce it; ANWR, 10 years. That was 13 years ago. If we had built it then, we would have it pumping today over 1 million barrels a day, but no, he didn't do that. 
   Let me stress again, ANWR is, in fact, 74 miles away from the existing pipeline, 800 miles long, a terminus point and all the infrastructure in place, and we built that in 3 years. And if you don't think we can build a pipeline 74 miles away and drill the oil and  get it to that pipeline in 3 years, you're not studying this fact. It can be done for the American people. 
   I'm asking you on both sides, let's drill, let's develop our domestic sources for the good of America, the good of the Nation, and make sure we can go forth.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding because we're talking about innovating small business and helping small business in this country. And that's well and good, and I congratulate the chairman and, of course, the ranking members on this legislation. 
   But, Madam Chairman, it's all for naught, it's all for naught, unless we address this issue of energy. Small business can't run on hot air. Small business can't even survive in this Nation or progress unless we solve this energy problem of fossil fuels. 
   And you may have heard me last week saying it's not your fault other than the fact you're in the wheelhouse now. You're in the wheelhouse. We were there for 12 years, and we didn't solve it either. But you said you would do that. You would lower the cost of energy for small business and the consumers of this Nation. That has not happened. 
   Realistically, this Congress cannot do it unless we address the issue of production. Not pie in the sky but production. 
   There's no shortage of fossil fuels in the United States of America. There's a shortage of the will to develop it. We just had a sale in Alaska in the Chukchi Sea, $2.6 billion. And they tell me, the geologists, there's more oil there than there is in the Gulf of Mexico. But we can't, in fact, develop it because of a lawsuit by certain interest groups in this Nation who do not want that developed. We have the Beaufort Sea. We have the Aleutian chain. That's just Alaska. 
   And for those of you in California, you have more oil off your shores than we do in Alaska if you'll develop it. But you have not done so. We have not done so. 
   We have the Gulf of Florida. We can't do it. We have the Rocky Mountains, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and we have not done so. We have not passed one piece of energy legislation in this body that produces any energy that runs these small businesses. 
   So I ask you, my colleagues, how can you stand here on the floor and sit on this floor and talk about innovation for small business without addressing the energy problem? 
   Each man, woman, and child this year will pay a $2,000 tax to foreign countries, each man, woman and child in the United States of America, for buying fossil fuels overseas and not developing those fossil fuels within our borders. That's $2,000 a year, the largest tax of any one family, a family of five, a $10,000 tax, to the Saudi Arabians or Venezuela or Kuwait or Iran or Iraq.     
   Seventy percent of our fossil fuels today are being imported because this body has not solved this problem, and should do so. Some of you on that side, some on this side voted to open the Arctic Wildlife Range in Alaska 12 times in this House. We did get it out of the Senate once, and Bill Clinton vetoed it. He vetoed it. We passed it 12 times here, 11 times; couldn't get the votes in the Senate. If we had it developed today, we would be producing enough energy so they couldn't raise the prices they are doing now. 
   By the way, everybody says, Get the oil companies. They say, Get those dirty oil companies. We are not the only buyer on the market any more. China is now burning more barrels of fuel today than we are, and it's going to go up. Look at their automobile consumption. India is right behind them. 
   Now some people say, Well, we don't need fossil fuels. We will use wind power and solar power, et cetera. I agree with all those things. But our economy is run on power that moves objects. Your product that comes and goes, comes on a vessel that is driven by fossil fuels. The plane, the train, the ship, and the automobile that delivers to the consumer is driven by fossil fuels. There is no quick solution with hydrogen, et cetera. 
   If you want the economy to go forth and you want these small businesses to succeed, this Congress, and I ask the Congress on both sides to address this issue. Madam Chairman, let's solve the problem. Let's not have any more pie in the sky. Let's open these areas that have been put on restriction, because the oil is there, Mr. and Mrs. America. It's just that you have not asked us to open it. You preferred us not doing so as long as we can buy it cheap from a foreign country. And those days are over. 
   Now this is my prediction. Oil now is at $120 a barrel. That means gasoline for this summer is going to be around $5 a gallon. But more than that, that means the power to run small businesses will not be available because we  have not kept up the power in other areas. We don't develop the nuclear, which we should. We haven't had any hydro, which we should. Yes, we have a little bit of wind and solar. But more than that, we have not addressed the fossil fuel issue. 
   So as we talk about small businesses, how we are going to encourage them, we are going to give them incentives, and have new imagination, that is well and good, but you can't do it without reasonable price power. 
   So I charge this body, the leadership on that side, and I charge this side in the minority, to truly come to grips and address each area that has fossil fuels that we know where they are, lift the restrictions, and develop it for the future of this Nation, the youth of this Nation, and the businesses of this Nation. If we don't do that, we are neglectful of our duty.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (COMMENDING THE ALASKA ARMY NATIONAL GUARD -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   First let me thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Mrs. Davis, for her fine work in bringing this legislation, and of course, Mr. Wittman, for your fine work. As a freshman, I deeply appreciate it. Congratulations on doing an effort for our National Guardsmen for Alaska. 
   Much has been said today, and I will not repeat that, about the Alaska National Guard, the 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry, that went to Kuwait and Iraq and what they were able to do. 
   I would just like to mention one thing. The majority of these young people came from many areas of the State of Alaska, about 80 communities in the State of Alaska. If you think about it a moment, going to Iraq, more so even Kuwait, and the change in temperature, that was a marvelous thing to witness when some of those people came back and told me it was not only hot, but also it was cold, which they're somewhat used to. But they went over without any complaints and returned, by the way, in body, all 586 members, back to Alaska. I have to say, this is what we call the ``citizens' army,'' the families they left behind, the families that welcomed them home. 
   We have to recognize the importance of the Alaska National Guard and the National Guard of the Nation and the role they play, a role much larger than ever expected to play by being deployed time and time again. I hope we do address that issue in the near future. 
   I also like to suggest that they did the work over in Iraq and Kuwait by receiving three Bronze Stars, 12 Meritorious Service Medals, 142 Army commendations, and 200 Army Achievement Medals. So they did their job as they were over there. 
   I had the privilege of going to Camp Shelby in Mississippi when they got off the ship and came back to the United States soil and to speak to them there. As I told them then, I not only support the troops, I respect the troops and the jobs they did. They were charged as civilian soldiers to go overseas. They were charged to do a duty and they did it with great valor, and that I deeply respect them for. 
   I think this body must recognize the importance of the National Guard, not only in Alaska, but across this Nation, and continue to support the families and individuals themselves as they serve this great Nation. 
   This is a good piece of legislation in recognition of a great unit. I again thank the chairman and the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member. I do thank all of you, my colleagues, for supporting this resolution and supporting not only the Alaska National Guard, but the National Guard in total.  
   I rise today to honor the Alaska Army National Guard and the 586 members of the Alaska Army National Guard's 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry who returned in October from their year long deployment to southern Iraq and Kuwait, in the largest deployment of the Alaska National Guard since World War II. 
   The 3rd Battalion, 297th Infantry was deployed from October 2006 to October 2007 and spent the year as security forces in northern Kuwait and southern Iraq since October 2006, successfully guarding camps and convoys heading into Iraq. 
   The guardsmen came from all over my State, with members of the unit hailing from 80 different communities across Alaska, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Kodiak, Soldotna, Kenai, Nome and many Native villages. Thankfully, all 586 who deployed overseas were able to return safely to those communities. 
   Many of these Alaskans had never ventured Outside prior to mobilizing, and the climate in the Middle East could not be more different from that of Alaska, but not one hesitated to serve their country, even if it meant facing temperatures of 130 degrees.  
   They served with distinction as well, inspecting and searching over 30,000 semi-trucks and designing all of the force protection plans for northern Kuwait. They were recognized for their service, earning 3 Bronze Stars, 12 Meritorious Service Medals, 142 Army commendations and more than 200 Army Achievement Medals over the course of their deployment. 
   I was honored to be invited to their welcome home celebration at Camp Shelby in Mississippi this past October. I was humbled to spend time with them and, as I told the National Guardsmen at Camp Shelby, ``You can't support the troops unless you respect them. I humbly respect you because you have done your job as you were charged to do so, and as volunteers. You left your families and you went forth and accomplished what you were taught to do.'' 
   I truly believe that the importance of the National Guard to our country cannot be overstated, which is why it is important that we honor these citizen-soldiers. We must not, however, forget the families of these citizen-soldiers, who make their own sacrifice for our country and earn nothing but the thanks of the Republic. 
   And so I respectfully urge the House to pass this resolution, to thank those citizen-soldiers from Alaska and to thank their families. It is the greatness of these citizens from which America derives its own and we would all do well to remember that. 
   Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that cosponsored this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (HIGHWAY TRUST FUND RESTORATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, first, let me say I'm very supportive of this legislation. And I understand the fiscal responsibility. I understand that those that say we're taking $8 billion and we're not having an offset. Remember we, this body, borrowed the money. And I want to compliment Mr. Oberstar on the history of what occurred in 1998 and where we are today. So we're really paying back what we borrowed. And that's part of the principle about, I call it an obligation, a man's word, or a woman's word, to someone else. 
   We borrowed that money from the taxpayers that paid at the pump, and very frankly, we spent it for other purposes, be it put the debt down, et cetera, that's not why we paid that 18.2 cents per gallon. We paid it for an infrastructure system. 
   Having said that, we have another problem. Our infrastructure is falling apart. When I was chairman of the Transportation Committee, I asked for a five-cent increased tax on gasoline. And very frankly, my side of the aisle and my President said, no, and we're further behind today than we were when I first suggested that. We ended up with $286 billion instead of $216 billion, but not nearly enough. 
   There's no one in this Nation today that can tell me that our transportation is keeping up. It is falling further behind each day, each day; and when we do that, we add to the debt of this Nation because our economy is based upon the ability to move product and people. If we can't do that, we have no economy. 
   The thing that hurts me the most, my good friends, in this energy crisis we have today and the high cost of energy, we're spending more money and more gallons of fuel sitting still than moving because we have congestion. That is not the economy this country needs. 
   I will say this to my new chairman, Mr. Oberstar. He has a huge responsibility, and I hope this Congress will listen. And whoever the next President is, we must address this issue of raising the dollars to improve the transportation system within this Nation. 
   Mr. Blumenauer said to the effect that no one's talking about transportation in this Presidential election. And I'm not being partisan here. Neither party's talking about transportation. If we do not do that, with the increase of the population we cannot have an economic base. 
   Lastly, let me suggest one thing. One of the reasons the money is not there and why we should pass this bill today is because we are spending less on gasoline because of the high price. And for those who do not want to drill, those who do not want to reduce domestic prices, think of what you're doing to the transportation system in this country. My chairman is going to have to come up with a way of funding. Maybe it's other than the gas tax. I don't know. 
   But we do have the automobiles. I don't care whether they're hybrids. I don't care what they are in saving fuels. We do have a transportation necessity in this country, and this body has not had the courage to go forth and have the vision of improving the transportation of the Nation for the future generations. We must do that. 
   This bill is a short step. It's needed. It's important, and it is returning what we borrowed; we, being the body of Congress, from the taxpayers at the pump. I have come from the old school that if you borrow it you pay it back, and that's what we're doing today to keep the largest driving force in this country going, the construction of our infrastructure, the improvement upon and then the repair. If we don't do that today, I'm sure we will, we'll make a great mistake. 
   But let's go to the future, the next highway bill. And those that are talking about we shouldn't spend it here, we shouldn't spend it there, there's no better way to spend the dollars of the American taxpayer than in an infrastructure for the future generations. It creates employment today, it creates employment in the future, and it takes and makes our economy strong forever.

   If you remember, every highway bill we have ever passed has gone through a series of technical correction adjustments because when we write a bill, sometimes it is misinterpreted by highway departments and municipalities. This is purely a technical corrections bill. It adds nothing; it takes nothing away. 
   Again, we passed a good piece of legislation 2 years ago. It has been implemented, but it will be implemented in a better way with these corrections. 
   I have talked with the gentleman from Oregon and all he has to say is ``yes'' or ``no.'' Regarding Providence Hospital of Anchorage, we are looking for a solution to a problem. I agree that we shouldn't be paying for something that is already done, but I would like to have those moneys available to improve the transportation to the center hub of health care in the city of Anchorage. It is my understanding that the gentleman has agreed to work with me in conference to try to solve that problem.

We are right in the process of not only finishing up SAFETEA-LU, but now we are in the process of beginning to write another bill which has to address the issue of transportation in this country. 
   As you know how strong I supported the funding and the methods of funding previously was not successful, I think this Congress has a responsibility to provide the transportation for the Nation as a whole that can do the job.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support H.R. 505, and I do so in recognition  of the long-standing ties between Native Hawaiians and Alaska Natives, who themselves underwent a struggle to be recognized for the purpose of settling their aboriginal land claims. H.R. 505 concerns a struggle involving Native Hawaiians, who are seeking to formalize a kind of relationship among the Federal government, the State of Hawaii, and Hawaii's aboriginal peoples based on the powers of the Congress to regulate Indian affairs. I have been proud to work with my good friend, the Gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie), to work on passing this bill for all the years we have served together. I want to recognize and congratulate the Gentleman for his iron commitment to this legislation and to the well-being of Hawaii and the nation. 
   This Congress has passed several laws of unique application to Native Hawaiians, invoking the authority of the so-called Indian Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. An important example of these laws is when Congress conveyed lands in Hawaii for the purpose of benefiting the Natives. This has been supplemented with additional benefits and services exclusively for Natives based on their status as Natives. 
   But there is a shortcoming in these laws: Congress has not yet authorized the Natives to organize a governing entity. At some point, we the Congress have to provide a means for the Native Hawaiians to administer these benefits in accordance with our current policy of promoting self-determination among Native American people in general. Native Hawaiians have largely stayed intact as a distinct community and we would be doing a great disservice to them if we did not set up a process for their recognition as a governing entity. The governing entity will be the vehicle they use to advance their economies, and preserve and pass on their special heritage and language to future generations. 
   I understand that some Members have a problem with this bill. It has been said many times already but it's worth emphasizing again: H.R. 505 has the endorsement of the Governor, the Congressional Delegation and the State Legislature of Hawaii. It does not cut into programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives. Enrollment to the governing entity is elective. 
   We can trace the genesis of this bill, embodying the hope of an indigenous people to control their own fate, all the way back to the overthrow of 1893. It has been a long road. I believe how we treat our native indigenous people reflects our values and who we are. Clearly, there is much in the history of our interactions with the native people of what is now the United States that makes us less than proud. But one of the great attributes of America has always been the ability to look objectively at our history, learn from it, and where possible make amends. 
   Native Hawaiians, like American Indians and Alaska Natives, have an inherent sovereignty based on their status as indigenous, native people. They desire the right to exercise management over their own affairs and land. By law, a portion of income from the former crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawai`i (also called ceded lands) is allocated to benefit the native Hawaiian people. At present, that income is managed by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a state agency. Management of this income and Hawaiian lands should be done by a Native Hawaiian governing entity now that the trustees of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs are elected by all the residents of the State of Hawai'i and not just Native Hawaiians. 
   As has already been mentioned today, this legislation is supported by the great majority of Hawai`i's people, by its Republican governor, by our State Legislature, and by dozens of organizations, including the Congress of American Indians and the Alaska Federation of Natives. 
   This legislation primarily affects the State of Hawai`i. Our state motto, which is the same as that of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, is ``Ua man ke ea o ka aina i ka pono,'' which means ``the life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.'' This is a historic vote and one that helps to perpetuate righteousness by righting a historic wrong. I ask that you stand with the people of Hawai`i and oppose the Flake amendment, oppose the motion to recommit, and support passage of the bill. 
   Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much). 
   For these reasons, we owe a great deal of deference to the judgment of the elected representatives of the State of Hawaii. They are the ones who are accountable for this legislation on their islands. The Delegation of Hawaii understands best that Native Hawaiians have struggled for decades to achieve a status that adequately promotes their self-determination. 
   Let's keep in mind that Congress has recognized Native Americans for various purposes over the years. We are not limited by a strict set of criteria such as those set forth in the Interior Department's Federal acknowledgment regulations. While these criteria are sensible to apply in some cases, a quick look at some of the Indian statutes passed in the early days of our republic make it clear that Congress viewed its powers to deal with Indians in a very broad sense. 
   Opponents often say that Native Hawaiians are not a tribe and that Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution limits Congress to recognize only tribes in the contiguous 48 States. 
   The meaning of ``tribes'' in Article I, Section 8--commonly called the Indian Commerce Clause--is broad in scope. There is nothing that limits Congress to recognizing only the aboriginal people of the Lower 48 States. In fact, Congress was recognizing Indians for special reasons when they were in lands that were not part of the United States. And Congress has authorized the reorganization of reservations that were broken up and tribes that were terminated. Again, Congress has broad, plenary authority to recognize Native peoples. 
   H.R. 505 is a good bill and it is a first, critical step for Native Hawaiians to deal with Hawaii and the Federal government in a fashion befitting their special status as a distinct Native community. In their wisdom, the Representatives from Hawaii have left issues regarding benefits, services, and lands to future negotiations with the newly organized governing entity. We can deal with these issues in a deliberative, careful fashion with the Native governing entity when it is organized. 
   I'm pleased to support H.R. 505 and to advance a process for recognizing a Native Hawaiian entity.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I have several concerns with H.R. 1483. While I may support several subtitles within this bill, changes have been made that harm the positive intent of the legislation. 
   An unexpected and unrequested increase, from $10 million to $15 million, in the authorization for new Heritage Areas was inserted by the Majority. No hearings have been held to discuss this change and we do not understand why it is warranted. The cost of this bill has ballooned to over $135 million. 
   I have further reservations because the closed rule does not provide two Members of the House the opportunity to adequately represent their districts. Mr. BARTLETT and Mr. GOODE have expressed concerns that they do not want to be included in these Heritage Areas and would prefer to be removed. I believe a Member has the right to represent his district and decide which Federal designations will be created over his constituents. 
   The committee has heard concerns that this bill would exacerbate the problem of Heritage Areas and their inability to operate without Federal funds. Heritage Areas are supposed to become self-sufficient: they were designed with that goal and that intent. This simply delivers more money to those heritage areas that have run through their authorization. The National Park Service testified that no National Heritage Area has succeeded in becoming self-sufficient. 
   We have seen evidence that the National Park Service and some Heritage Areas are violating public law by using Federal funds for lobbying. They go so far as to instruct other groups on how to start new Heritage Areas and further this problem. 
   In committee we sought to strengthen the private property rights protections. My Democrat colleagues believe this is the cure to a problem that does not exist. I urge them to reconsider and adopt real property protections that allow owners to withdraw from Heritage Area boundaries. This protection has been given to the last twelve Heritage Areas and should not be denied any new Heritage Areas. 
   Finally, the committee has learned that Heritage Area boundaries may be used to impede the placement of critical energy transmission lines. At a time when the national grid is already heavily taxed and the threat of blackouts loom, we should not build obstacles to providing Americans with reliable energy.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues, I rise in the strongest possible opposition to this ill-conceived, if it was conceived at all, legislation. 
   I don't know how many of you ever saw the Peter Pan story, the movie, or even read it. This is a Peter Pan story. You know, they have the imaginary bowls, the bowls that were not imaginary but they were empty, and they convinced Peter Pan, Robin Williams, to use his imagination and the bowls will be full of food. 
   And this is what you're doing today, Mr. Chairman, and the people that wrote this bill, who we do not know who did write it. Use your imagination. We're going to have the oil for everything because this bill produces oil. 
   It produces nothing. This is a Peter Pan story. It's a figment of the imagination. It is a political gimmick. It is a sham on the American people. 
   Shame on this House, that the courage wasn't there for the leadership to go on both sides of the aisle, listen to those that have some expertise in this problem we are facing today, the high cost of energy, and work together and pass an energy solution to a problem that produces not only fossil fuels but other forms of fuel, that solves the problems for the commuter who has to go to work. And Mr. and Mrs. Commuter, if you think this bill today that came out of this leadership on that side produces one bit of relief to you as you drive to work, don't believe it. Go see Peter Pan. That's all this bill is. 
   It has nothing in there to produce energy. In fact, it probably will drive down the ability to produce energy. It will help foreign countries. 
   I just heard my chairman talk about Big Oil, how bad Big Oil is, and put the blame on Big Oil. Where do you think you're getting your oil today as you put it in your tank? From Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Chavez, foreign countries that have control of us right now. We ought to be talking about that. Forget talking about Big Oil, because this body, and I've said it before on this floor of the House, both sides of the aisle have not seized the ability to solve the energy problem by developing fossil fuels. 
   Coal. There's nothing in this bill about coal to liquification or gasification. There's nothing in this bill about nuclear power. There's nothing in this bill that produces any energy. In fact, this bill takes land that's open now and closes it, and take lands that was closed and opens it, but it happens to be 50 miles offshore. Any oil in between there can't be developed. 
   And by the way, my good friends, if any State contiguous to decides not to have it drill 50 miles and out they can say no, and they will say no because there's no revenue sharing in this bill. None. 
   It is probably the best way to call this bill the Venezuela, Russian, Middle East Oil Production Act, because you're protecting the foreign countries under this legislation. 
   I don't know why I'm getting worked up about it because we all know this is a political gimmick. It's never going to go anywhere. It's not going to become law. But it will give some people cover to say, I voted for more drilling and more production. This bill does not do that. 
   It will increase energy costs. And I'm a little concerned on both sides of the aisle again because oil has dropped down to $93 a barrel today. You know, if that would have happened last year we would have said, my God, the world's coming to an end. Oil went to $93. But it was $145, and we are being lulled into this type of legislation saying we're going to solve the problem and nothing is occurring to solve the problems of the American consumer. We're right where we were last year and the year before that, and that's wrong. 
   It does leave out ANWR. I wasn't going to bring up that, but the closest, quickest way to produce a million barrels a day to the United States was to open ANWR. No, we left that out. Can't happen. A million barrels a day for the next maybe hundred years, for the American consumer. Every barrel would have gone to the United States of America. A little provision says you can't export any of this oil to overseas. We're not exporting oil, we're consuming it. But we're consuming most of our oil from overseas, paying the foreign countries the oil prices today because you have not come to this floor, not one hearing in our committee on this issue. 
   This bill was written in the midnight. I shouldn't say the midnight, the midnight sun. I would say it was written in the darkness of night. And introduced last night, had the rule last night, 500 pages. I have read it, and it produces nothing. 
   You can get more energy out of this bill, ladies and gentlemen, if you take all the copies of the bill and put it in a bonfire. And that is not good for this House of this Nation. You had the opportunity. 
   Now, I don't understand, really, why anybody would support this legislation at all because we're committing something wrong to the American people. We had a chance. 
   I see people from oil-producing States over on that side. Why did you buy into the concept we wanted to bring a bill to the floor that does nothing but say I helped develop more oil when it doesn't do it? 
   If you believe that, you would have let us have this bill, 2 weeks, 3, 4 weeks ago, but you didn't because you know when it finally gets out to the public and they start understanding what's occurring, that the public will understand, yes, it was a sham. 
   And I'm tired of politics on oil in this body. We have a Speaker that believes that we have to save the planet because we can't burn any more fossil fuel. If that's the case, then let's admit it. I believe this is what she believes, and I think that's sad. 
   I believe we ought to say, okay, we do have to have fossil fuels and we can develop the other forms of energy but it takes time. We need that bridge. This bill doesn't do that. 
   So we're going to come back here next year, the public will be hoodwinked. The public will have high prices again, nothing will be done. 
   If we're really wise, we'd take this bill today, totally defeat it, send it back and work across the aisle for the American people, work across the aisle for solutions that would no longer have the yoke not of Big Oil around our necks, the yoke of the foreign countries that took those billions of dollars. The largest transfer of American wealth in history occurred because this body didn't act correctly and did not develop the resources so we wouldn't have to transfer that wealth overseas, and we did it. 
   So we have a responsibility to defeat this legislation. It was conceived in the dark. Who the father is, I do not know. But we do know it's not legitimate. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

And my candidate has sort of changed his mind with his new Vice Presidential candidate, who is going to be the next Vice President of the United States, who strongly supports drilling in ANWR.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. My friends, this is a sad day in this body. Apparently the students of New Jersey are trying to take money from Alaskan students, pitting State against State instead of talking about education. 
   I am a little bit chagrined with the gentleman from New Jersey. This is supposed to be a House of honor. You didn't tell me you were going to offer this amendment. You didn't talk to the gentleman from Hawaii on the amendment. You are attacking two States that are not contiguous to the United States. This is a harmful thing to do. We are a new State. I have poverty that you don't even think of, and yet you say you want my money, my money for my students that need to be educated to go to New Jersey. 
   That is a sad day for this House. 
   I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee for putting this in the bill. And if we continue this, we will be called biting one another, very much like the mink in my State that kill their own. There is always another day when those who bite will be killed, too, and I am very good at that. 
   I just think it is a disgrace to have one State, the education of one State, being pitted against another State. This is education. These are needy students, a minority that has been neglected, has not been helped to the degree they should have been over the centuries. I can truthfully say and pridefully say we have been good in the last years, over the last 35 years. I have provided education and supported education. My people have risen and become leaders because this Congress saw the wisdom of us providing us money. 
   And now we have an individual from a State that doesn't have the greatest reputation in the world trying to take money from one State to give to another State. If that is the case, then let's just all have a big donnybrook right here. I'm ready. I'm really ready because what we are doing is dead wrong.  
   I told the gentleman here about 2 years ago, shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on each one of you. And the guys that are trying to not spend money and the guys that are trying to balance the budget, to take and attack education in States, Hawaii and Alaska, that have the least representation as far as numbers go. And if there is guilt here, it is because I have been able to represent my State better than New Jersey. I would suggest New Jersey ought to elect some new Congressmen, I suggest respectfully, that can do the job. I believe that is really true. If they can't do the job, elect somebody new. I have done it. I am going to continue to do it. I am going to fight for my State, and I am going to fight for my State every time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I don't know what the gentleman is talking about. I just said they were not well represented. Respectfully, if I can say that. I don't name anybody's name. I don't mention anybody. I don't specifically mention any names. And that is not why. 
   For the rest of you that continue this constant harping on this floor about cutting monies from other areas under the guise of balancing the budget, I say shame on you, too. I say shame on you because we are not doing the legislative process any good. 
   Regardless of who is in power in this House, Democrat or Republican, we should be leading this Nation and we are at a standstill now. That is one reason our ratings are very low, totally, and that is a shame. Because we do have the work of this Nation that we should be doing and we should be addressing and we should take care of it. 
   I don't agree with everything that side does. We should not always agree on everything, but we should have the ability to get together and solve problems and to legislate, and we have not done that. So I am a little frustrated. And like I say, those that bite me will be bitten back.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Thank God for George Bush. He's created the hurricanes, the earthquakes and the high price of gas. 
   There is only one group responsible for the high price of gas for the consumers of America and that's the United States Congress. They have done nothing, nothing since 1973 to increase the productivity of fossil fuels in the United States, and they still are doing nothing, Mr. and Mrs. America. They talk about it. They blame Mr. Bush. That's it. The best thing you can do is blame the other guy. The truth of the matter is that until we start drilling and until we start liquefying coal, until we use the offshore oil we have available, until we use the ANWR in Alaska, we're going to pay a lot more. 
   The prediction we have now, by the first of next year a barrel of oil will be, get this, $180 a barrel, because the consumers abroad in other countries are consuming oil at a greater rate than we are. But we sit here and say we're going to solve it by putting $800,000 on the dome of the Capitol to save, in 200 years, 10 bucks. 
   What's wrong with this Congress? And remember, I said ``this Congress.'' You haven't done the job. You're not doing the job. Until we wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America, and start drilling as we should drill, you're going to pay a lot more at that tank. You think about it, $200 a barrel 2 years from now, you'd better get a bicycle.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (SAFETEA-LU TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. First, let me thank the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the ranking member, Mr. Mica, for bringing this technical corrections bill to the floor. I will be supporting this bill today because it is a good bill. 
   I want to again thank my minority member, Mr. Oberstar. When I was chairman, we had worked very hard on TEA-LU. It was the only positive piece of legislation this Congress passed in 6 years. When I say positive, it left a part of infrastructure, not all of it, for the good of this Nation. I take great pride in that because it probably created about 185,000 new jobs, $286 billion to be spent for the infrastructure and for the economy of this great Nation. 
   I bring that up because I hear some people talking about, well, we will repeal the 18.2 percent tax on fuel to help our consumers out. Then goodbye to the roads, the repairs, the new needs for the additional automobiles on our highways. I say beware. It will be a terrible disaster for this great Nation of ours. We have other ideas about solving the high gas prices, but that is probably the worst I have heard of all. 
   Having said that, I am going to go through a chronological order of what has occurred about the issue of Coconut Road. In 2001, I became chairman of the House Committee on Transportation, a position I held for 6 years. This committee is the largest committee in the House of Representatives, with oversight over all modes of transportation; aviation, highways, railroads, all public buildings, waterways, and emergency management. 
   As the only Congressman from Alaska, I worked very hard for the State of Alaska. I worked with the Governor, State legislature, and local officials. I can say with great pride we did very well for the State of Alaska because we need transportation in that State, as every other State needs it. 
   I want to remind people, the responsibility of a chairman is to address the transportation needs in all of the country. As chairman, I worked with officials throughout the country, Governors, mayors, transportation officials, and, of course, all 434 Members and delegates of this body. 
   As we prepared for the writing of the national transportation bill, members of our committee and I traveled extensively throughout the country at the request of House Members and State and local officials. For the thousands and thousands of transportation projects requested of us, I visited as many communities as possible to meet with the Members, local officials, and public to discuss these requests. 
   In 2004, Florida Gulf Coast University President William Merwin commissioned a study of a road improvement that would increase the university's ability to cope with hurricanes and other disasters. One of the recommendations in the report was for the construction of an on-ramp from Coconut Road to I-75. 
   In 2005, the City of Bonita Springs hired a consultant to determine if the interchange at Coconut Road and I-75 would improve traffic congestion on Bonita Beach Road, Corkscrew Road, Old 41, I-75 and Coconut Road. The study determined that the Coconut interchange would take 9,000 cars off of Bonita Road and Corkscrew Road each day, but add about 6,000 cars per day to Coconut Road. 
   In February 2005, I was invited by a congressional colleague, who was a member of the Transportation Committee, to his district in Florida to hear the needs and concerns of local constituents. On February 19, a town hall meeting was held at Florida Gulf Coast University, whose arena also serves as a hurricane shelter. 
   This town hall meeting was attended by more than 200 local constituents, transportation officials, and elected officials. One of the issues discussed at the town hall meeting was the need for a hurricane evacuation route to ensure that people could get to safety more quickly during a national disaster. This project was to be an interchange from the heavily traveled I-75 highway to Coconut Road, which leads to the Florida Gulf Coast University in Bonita Springs. 
   At the town hall meeting, University President William Merwin spoke of the need for a research center at the university that would focus on transportation improvements using new technologies. He also presented a study showing the need for the interchange at Coconut Road to help hurricane evacuees reach the two main shelters in south Lee County. The goal was to provide $10 million for a study, not to build, but study this interchange. 
   I also would like to note, to the credit of the Florida delegation, this area received $81 million for the widening of I-75. This funding was totally justified and important to the area. The $10 million for the Coconut Road study did not take any money away or divert any funds of the $81 million allocated for I-75 widening. The $10 million for the Coconut Road was funded 
   separately under the national highway bill. Otherwise, it was money above the line. 
   This interchange study had the support of the Florida Gulf Coast University, the Technical Advisory Committee, which consisted of city and county transportation experts, and the local citizens' advisory committee. The Bonita Springs City Council and the Regional Planning Council Staff have also supported the interchange study. The Technical Advisory Committee and local citizens' advisory committee voted unanimously to include the study in the long range Lee Metropolitan Planning Organization Transportation plan. Unanimously voted for. However, the Metropolitan Planning Organization voted not to include the interchange study in their long range plan. They instead wanted to transfer the $10 million to another project, including I-75. 
   While I don't agree with this organization's decision, I respect it. It's important to stress that this study funding did not go to any one person, it did not go to any one group of people. The funding was to go to the State of Florida, were they to choose to proceed with the study. 
   This has always been a good project. The residents of this community deserve to have a safe and effective evacuation route for themselves in case of a national disaster. With Hurricanes Katrina and Rita we saw firsthand what happens when Americans are unable to get to safety. But for now, I support these residents in their wanting to put this money towards another project. I have always supported the community's right to do what they think is best for them. The change is in this technical corrections bill, and I support it. 
   So why I am talking about this, other than to give the chronological order of event that occurred? Well, it's very easy. I have been the subject of much innuendo concerning my intent and motivation of this project. These accusations have little, if any, connection with what actually occurred. 
   I outlined my intent and motivations on this, and it is quite different from what I have been hearing lately about this study. Some of the media have made this study into being about one land owner in the area. Not one word has been mentioned about the hundreds of people who attended the town hall meeting in support of this study or about the numerous local organizations and officials who supported it. 
   This study was included in the largest national highway bill in history.  There were more than 6,200 high priority projects, some call them earmarks, in that bill. About half of these were sponsored by the Democrats and Republicans of this body. About half were sponsored evenly by Republicans and Democrats in the other body. These 6,200 high priority project earmarks from the House and Senate totaled 5 percent of the total highway bill. Five percent. 
   Two committees handled this bill, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee. Four committees worked on this bill in the Senate. I did not write this bill by myself. There were six committee chairmen, six ranking members, and dozens of subcommittee chairmen and subcommittee ranking members, members of both party's leadership, and countless others who played major roles in the legislation. 
   The 6,200 high priority projects, earmarks, were requested by virtually every Member in this House, other than 14 Members of the House, including Mr. Flake. This body had nothing to do with the projects requested by the other body, and they had nothing to do with those requested by this body. 
   This was a massive bill that was not completed until several months after the previous highway authorization had already expired. Members and staff were literally working around the clock until we were able to pass the bill in July, 2005. 
   As to the debate concerning the process of the enrollment of this and any other legislation, that is not a process I own or control. There are officers of the House and the Senate whose job it is to oversee this process. A committee chairman does not control the enrollment process. I have never been in an enrollment office, and I do not believe any chairman has that right. 
   After all the accusations and rumors about this bill, I hope this sets the record straight. This project was asked for by the community, it was supported by the Congressman from that district, and there are letters to back that up. But, the Senate is meddling in House affairs. I am supporting this bill. I welcome, if you want to welcome, an investigation into the House. I will support that. But, remember, that is a slippery, slippery road which we are about to be involved in. 
   We have an opportunity in this bill to stimulate the economy, keep our people working. I am going to support this legislation. But keep in mind that Coconut Road was not my idea. It was created and fostered by the local people of that community. 
   It's not the first time in the enrollment process. Even in this bill, Jacksonville was mentioned in the bill. What we didn't know, when the Senate and the House voted on it, was that there were six Jacksonvilles in this Nation. It had to be changed, and it was changed prior going to the President's desk, and the House never voted on it. I can go on to other cases where legislation has been changed by the enrollment process when it is considered not the intent of the House. 
   I thank the gentleman.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in the strongest opposition to this bill. This bill, as brought forth by the majority, will increase the energy costs to all Americans. It increases the imports more than we are now, where we are now at 67 percent, of foreign oil, sending dollars overseas to compete against us and actually raise the war of terror. 
   I am shocked that any union would ever support this bill. It will lead to the loss of jobs in all sectors of our economy. It is clearly the work of those, including the leadership on the other side, who do not appreciate the blessings of America's place in the world. 
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said, ``Nothing is more obstinate than a fashionable consensus.'' This bill appears to be based on the consensus opinion that America is too wealthy, too strong and too influential in the world. The way we got there was to build the world's strongest economy by using the energy that God gave us. 
   The popular consensus of representatives of this bill is if we use less energy and make it more expensive then we can unilaterally reduce our impact on the world. I have news for those who believe this: Nature abhors a vacuum.

   This is a good bill. I want to thank Mr. Oberstar and Ms. Johnson for the work that you've done on this bill. 
   This bill has been passed out of this House approximately three times, two times while I was chairman, and now Mr. Mica and Mr. Oberstar have got the bill to the President's desk. All the previous speakers are not here to beat up the President. I am here to say this bill should be passed; we should override the President's veto because it's right for America. 
   It is an investment, and we are way behind in this investment. Some have said, well, we started out with a certain amount of money on the House side, the Senate had a certain amount, and we came out with more. Frankly, I think it should be about $40 billion. And I say this from a little bit of experience. We did the same thing in the Highway bill, it should have been $375 billion, not $285 billion, because it is an investment in the future and the infrastructure to provide the economy for this country that creates the jobs and makes us competitive worldwide. 
   Without this bill, we will lose. Without this bill, we will not be able to achieve those goals. We will not save people's lives. But more than that, the next crisis we will face in this country is our water, the use of our water, the water to be used correctly, for transportation, for recreation and for the good of man. 
   This bill is right. Let's override the President. Let's do something for America.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALASKA AS THE 49TH STATE -- (House of Representatives - June 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I do thank the ranking member, and I do thank my chairman for cosponsoring this legislation and being supportive of it. 
   On July 7, that marks the 50th anniversary of the enactment of the Alaska Statehood Act, as approved by the United States Congress and signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.     
   Alaska would officially be admitted as a State January 3, 1959. 
   I introduce H.R. 127 which commemorates this occasion to recognize all of the people of Alaska who represent the pioneering spirit which built this great Nation and contributes to our culture and ethnic diversity. 
   Alaska is the most northern, most western, and most eastern State in the Union and composing an area one-fifth the size of the United States. And for all those trivia buffs out there, Alaska is roughly 2 1/2 times the size of Texas. 
   Purchased from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million, or 2 cents an acre, after Congress had concluded its resources would be vitally important to the Nation's future growth. At the time, the purchase was nicknamed ``Seward's folly'' because it was believed foolhardy to spend so much money on a remote region. Secretary of State William Seward would have the last laugh, though. 
   Alaska is the source of 16 percent of the daily crude oil in the United States, has 44 percent of the country's undiscovered resources. Alaska's 34,000 miles of shoreline form a gateway to one of the greatest fisheries in the world, providing for 60 percent of the country's commercial seafood harvest. 
   Alaska has 230 million acres set aside in national parks, wildlife refuges, and national forests which are visited each year by more than a million tourists. To give you some idea, Mr. Speaker, the State of California has 103 million acres. We put aside 230 million acres for parks and national wildlife refuges. Forests add to Alaska's beauty and provide a renewable economic resource with 28 million acres of commercial forests. 
   Alaska contains half of the Nation's coal reserves and its largest silver and zinc mines. Glittering gold in Alaska's streams and mountains still lures miners to work private claims. About 50 million acres of soil in Alaska are suitable for farming. About 1 million acres currently are in production. 
   I know that the people of Alaska will continue their commitment to the preservation and protection of this great State, but they also want to develop the resources. Alaskans are proud, strong, and independent Americans who are not afraid to stand up for what they believe in, and I'm honored and humbled to stand here today on their behalf as we again recognize this great important date in U.S. history. 
   Mr. Speaker, may I suggest, right above you there is a plaque, placed there in 1949; it says, Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers and build up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy of being remembered. Daniel Webster. Let us develop our resources. 
   Alaska has the key to the solution of many problems of this great Nation, especially the energy crisis, and I ask this body as you recognize the 50th anniversary of the great State of Alaska, recognize what we can and what we have contributed to the Nation as a whole. As the 50th State, we are proud and we are extremely excited with the possibility to contribute more in the future. And I do urge my colleagues to pass this resolution 
   I thank the gentleman, the chairman, and the ranking member.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to stress the importance of understanding the supply side of energy. And we may not be able to lower the price, ladies and gentleman, at the gas pump, but we can at least stabilize it because if you think this is going to go down if we don't have a supply side, you're badly mistaken. 
   We just saw something last week which shocked many people. We had a jump of $11 a barrel in one night because of some action in the Middle East. And that could affect us down the road where it's $137 a barrel, $137 a barrel today. We predict it's going to go $200 a barrel if we don't get the supply side moving. 
   I will tell you if we have one action on the floor of the House to take and address the supply side, the price of a barrel of oil will drop automatically $10 to $15 a barrel. It might go back up later on. But it eliminates the speculation. It would show those that say we're not doing anything as we have not done for 35 years after the pipeline itself was built. 
   The Saudis, the Middle East, the OPEC countries will not increase production when they can get $137 a barrel. Why would they? Ask yourselves if you own something, why would you produce more to lower the price? 
   The only way we can do this is to increase our domestic supply, not only just oil, but all forms of fossil fuel and alternate forms of energy. And as the gentleman from Indiana mentioned, if we do not do that, we are not serving our constituents as we should. 
   It is the future of this Nation to allow the productions. Remember the quote I had right above the seat of the Speaker: Let's develop our resources. 
   As we celebrate this day, the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Statehood by an action of Congress, that's all we ask. Let us develop our resources. That's all I ask you now. Let us develop our resources for the good of this Nation. That is our responsibility. This is not politics. This is reality. 
   Again, for Mr. and Mrs. American, the price of oil and gasoline may not drop dramatically, but it will drop and it will stabilize if we address the supply side. If we do not, it will rise more, more, and more. Not good for the nation. Not good for the future generations.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, Chairman Rahall has summarized the settlement history of the Bay Mills land claim as well as the related and  commingled claim of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe. Therefore, I will limit my remarks to why I believe this amended bill, which is championed by my good friends from Michigan, Chairman John Dingell, Chairman Bart Stupak, and Candice Miller, deserves the support of the Members of this House. 
   Before the House today are two bills combined to resolve a problem affecting two tribes in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a number of non-Indian landowners in an area of Michigan known as Charlotte Beach. 
   Let me point out the support for this bill in the districts that are affected by them. The Members representing Bay Mills and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribes support the bill. The two Members representing districts where lands will be placed in trust support the bill. 
   Finally--and this is very important--this settlement deal was negotiated by former Governor John Engler and is supported by Governor Granholm. 
   It has been my practice--and I hope most of you understand--to defer to the Members whose districts are affected by legislation because that Member best represents the views of his constituents and knows his district best. Of course, I can only wish that others would respect this practice when it comes to Alaska. If so, we would be enjoying 42 million gallons of oil a day from ANWR. Instead, we have Members whose districts are thousands of miles away and who are encasing this key to American oil independence and lower gas prices in crystal by declaring it a wilderness. That is something that even President Jimmy Carter, in his cardigan sweaters, refused to do during the height of our gas crisis. 
   Getting back to H.R. 2176, this bill settles two Indian land claims without costing any Federal or State dollars and without imposing taxes or fees on anyone. In fact, under the settlement deals, the tribes are going to share revenues with the State of Michigan and with local communities. 
   The bills are consistent with the compact agreed to by the tribes and by the Governors pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
   In this Congress, we have passed bills that recognize some tribes on the condition that such tribes forego gaming. We made this condition a part of their recognition of the bills. This breaks with long-standing precedent and with treating Indian tribes on an equal footing with one another. But we did it out of deference to the Members who represent the tribes, out of deference to the Governors of the States affected, and out of deference to the wishes of local communities. 
   If we want to remain consistent in this policy, then we should agree to the request of the Members and of the Governors and of the local communities of Port Huron and Romulus. 
   I understand there is opposition to this bill. By the way, Mr. Speaker, I probably shouldn't say, but this bill should never have gone to Judiciary. Mr. Speaker, it should never have gone to Judiciary. This is not your jurisdiction. This is the jurisdiction of Natural Resources only, and for some reason, somebody tried to placate somebody and send it over to Judiciary. Judiciary has no jurisdiction over this bill. IGRA is under the jurisdiction of the Resources Committee. 
   I understand the opposition. On the one hand, we must defer to Governors and to Members who don't want gaming, but on the other hand, we are hearing we must not defer to Governors and to Members when they want to permit and to regulate gaming. This is confusing. 
   Most of the opponents of these bills don't live in the area affected by the legislation. I note that none of the amendments filed to this bill were from the Michigan delegation. 
   So why are they opposed? I believe it is fear of competition. The tribes whose lands are settled by H.R. 2176, as amended, have every right under the law to provide economically to their members. That they choose to do so by operating casinos is their choice, as well as that of the Governor of Michigan. These enterprises will supply jobs to the area, will provide funds for health care, and will provide better education for Native Americans, and they will do so by engaging the oldest American economic policies--good old-fashioned, competitive capitalism.     
   This is not the first time that Congress has taken lands into trust for tribes outside traditional reservation boundaries and has allowed the tribes the full economic benefit of these lands. As one example, I point to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act from the 106th Congress. That law directed the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for two tribes--the Lytton Rancheria and the Graton Rancheria--which may not have been part of the tribes' historical ranges. In each case, just like the bill being considered today, gaming was not barred. Certainly, this is a common result whenever Congress or the administration recognizes a landless tribe or restores land to a tribe. 
   In the meantime, the property owners in Charlotte Beach have watched the value of their property plummet, something like 90 percent in some cases. The cloud on the title to their land, resulting from the land claims, has made it nearly impossible for them to sell or to secure a mortgage. This isn't right, and it isn't right to leave them hanging when the Governors of Michigan, the legislature, the affected communities, and their Representatives want to move these settlements forward. 
   This bill will end this ordeal that they're all facing. 
   Once again, I do urge support of H.R. 2176, as amended, and urge passage. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I have listened very intently to this debate. The thing that bothers me the most is that this is about competition. That's all it is. Let's face it. It's competition.     
   I'm a little disturbed that the casinos in Detroit that are owned by Indian tribes now are objecting to their brethren, because it's about competition. 
   We have been over this time and time again. This is not a new bill. This is an attempt to settle a land claim by those who own land and who no longer have title of it because of a court ruling. This is not just about casinos. 
   And by the way, to the chairman of the Judiciary, I did mention ``casinos'' in my statement. It's there, I want you people to understand, and I did mention ``gaming,'' but I did say ``casinos,'' too. I'm not trying to hide anything. This is their prerogative under IGRA to have the title to this land. 
   This land was not voluntarily given away. This land was taken. The State of Michigan said it was taken. The courts have said it was taken. These tribes have a legal title to this land. And, until they get that land, the people who now have homes, who have stores that have been inherited from their parents, that title is not theirs. 
   But we have those in Detroit and those interests from outside of Michigan that don't want any more competition. Competition, apparently, is bad for the American way. I think it's good. 
   Again, let's go back to those people who represent the area. And the Governor and the community all support this bill. 
   I reserve my time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, with my remaining time, I hope everybody recognizes again that what this is about is competition. That's all it is. In the meantime, there are two Native tribes, American Indians, that have a right under IGRA to, in fact, have these lands that they negotiated with the Governors, the State legislature, the communities, and reached a deal; yet this is the last body that has the ability and the responsibility of settling disputes on lands owned by or not owned by American Natives. Not the courts, no one else. And that's why we are here today. 
   It does disturb me, when I see other tribes that actually have the backing of other institutions outside the State of Michigan, the city of Detroit, that oppose their brethren from achieving the same goals they did. I'm also disturbed because we have those that are non-Native that have their title in question that will never, in fact, unless we act, have that title cleared up. And that's our responsibility in this body. 
   There is justice, there should be justice, for American Indians. And, by the way, I believe I am the last one on that committee that voted for the original gaming legislation for American Natives. Chairman Udall and I passed that legislation. I believe Mr. Dingell probably voted for it, and maybe Mr. Conyers voted for it at that time because we thought there was an opportunity there to improve the economic base of the American Indian, and we approved correctly. 
   Now, those that oppose gaming, I understand that. I don't gamble. That's not my thing. But I also will tell you I don't disrespect those who do gamble. And as the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) said, I could even hit a golf ball across that river to that gaming place in Canada, and I want some of that Canadian money to come down to America instead of its going from America to Canada. 
   In the fairness of this bill, we should vote ``yes.'' In fairness to the American Indians, we should vote ``yes.'' This legislation should become a reality. The State of Michigan Senators support it. The Governors support it. The legislature supports it. The communities support it. The police officers support it. And only those that oppose it have another interest. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (ENCOURAGING ELIMINATION OF HARMFUL FISHING SUBSIDIES -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 94. I want to thank Chairwoman Bordallo and Chairman Rahall for their efforts on this resolution. 
   I know the issue of harmful foreign fishing subsidies is one of the key concerns of the West Virginia fishing fleet and I congratulate Mr. Rahall on his interest in this resolution. 
   All kidding aside, this issue is a global concern. Harmful foreign fishing subsidies that threaten the sustainability of legitimate fisheries and threaten the economic viability and international competitiveness of the U.S. fishing industry must be identified and eliminated. 
   Some foreign fishing fleets have been heavily subsidized by their governments and this has led to over exploitation of some important fish species. 
   Harmful subsidies not only put legitimately prosecuted fisheries in jeopardy of overfishing, but also put U.S. fishermen at an economic disadvantage in the global fish market. 
   However, we need to be careful when discussing subsidies because some subsidies are actually beneficial. Government programs which help fishermen reduce unnecessary bycatch, which aid efforts to develop ``clean'' fishing gear, which aid governments in monitoring or enforcing the fisheries, or which  make the fishery safer for fishermen are all legitimate and beneficial governmental programs. 
   Harmful subsidies that increase the size and harvesting capabilities of fishing fleets beyond the capacity needed to sustainably harvest the quotas in a fishery can be harmful environmentally and economically. 
   While I support the main concept of this resolution--to place the House of Representatives on the record opposing harmful fishing subsidies by foreign governments--one statistic used in this resolution is misleading even though it is often quoted. The resolution uses the statistic that ``75 percent of the world's fish populations are currently fully exploited, over exploited, significantly depleted or recovering from overexploitation.'' Full exploitation of fisheries is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the full utilization of our Nation's fisheries is a key purpose of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Admitedly, fully exploited fisheries need to be carefully managed, monitored, and enforced to keep them from becoming over exploited. 
   If you remove ``fully exploited'' from this statistic, the figure drops to approximately 25 percent. This figure, while much less dramatic, is still a concern that we need to address. Foreign subsidies that contribute to this figure need to be addressed. 
   The United States has already taken a leading role in addressing IUU fisheries and in addressing harmful foreign subsidies. I support these efforts and urge support of efforts to continue to reduce harmful foreign fishing subsidies.

   I want to thank Congressman Lamborn for initiating this National Park Service study of Camp Hale so Americans can appreciate the events that occurred during World War II and the Cold War because people forget about the Cold War. A lot of activity went on. 
   The Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale served as the training site for the 10th Mountain Division, a specialized skiing unit whose heroism during World War II inspired our Nation. Later the site was used for covert training operations furthering the cause of freedom during the Cold War. 
   Colorado today benefits from the ski area and the educational opportunities presented by this unique landmark. Listing Tennessee Pass and Camp Hale as a unit of the National Park Service will allow us to learn about and experience this unique piece of history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the resolution authored by Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Doc Hastings, and the entire State of Washington delegation. 
   The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest concrete structure ever built in the United States, with enough concrete to build a sidewalk around the Earth twice. The dam helped us win World War II by providing much needed electricity to build fighter planes and naval ships. The dam was also constructed to provide flood control, recreation and irrigation.     
   Today, it serves over 600,000 acres of irrigated cropland which feeds consumers nationwide and around the world. 
   As you know, we have major energy problems in this Nation. The Grand Coulee Dam is an example of what our country has done right. It's a shining beacon of clean, renewable, domestic energy. In 2006, the dam provided22,000 gigawatts of emission-free hydroelectricity. This translates into the reduction of 18 million tons of carbon dioxide, into 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and into 44,000 tons of nitrogen oxide. 
   Without this clean form of energy, 36.4 barrels of fuel oil, 10.7 million tons of coal or 223 billion cubic feet of natural gas will have to be used to keep the lights on. In fact, Grand Coulee is so environmentally friendly that the NBC Today Show focused solely on the dam as part of the Earth Day broadcast. 
   Despite the consensus that hydropower is clean, renewable and emissions-free, the Democrat leadership continues to exclude long-term hydropower resources, such as the Grand Coulee Dam, as part of its proposed renewable portfolio standard. This is logic-free given the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that I just mentioned. We hope the Democrats come to their senses and see the reality that large hydropower sources should be counted as a renewable resource in future bills. 
   Madam Speaker, this resolution couldn't be brought up at a better time. I strongly support the 75th anniversary of the Grand Coulee Dam. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. During hearings on this bill, the committee heard testimony from historian David Hackett Fischer, whose writings on the Revolutionary War point out George Washington's support for property rights and strong actions that he took to ensure that his soldiers respect the property of civilians, even when the property belonged to a Tory sympathizer. 
   Washington personally gave strict orders to forbid looting, even though plunder was the norm at the time, and even though many of his men were hungry, dressed in rags and marched barefoot in the snow. It is remarkable that in so desperate a situation with so noble a cause, he imposed on the Patriot side such a high standard on private property. 
   Washington's honorable policy stood in stark contrast to the routine seizure of booty by the British and Hessian troops. It is no accident over the course of the early years of the war, 1776 and 1777, in the battleground of New Jersey, a population that was once evenly divided in its loyal threw its support to the American cause. There are lessons we can learn from Washington's example. 
   In earlier battlefield protection efforts, the National Park Service uses its eminent domain powers to seize land from unwilling sellers. The justified resentment of this caused hurt and subsequent efforts. 
   Our enthusiasm for battlefield protection notwithstanding, I hope as we set out to preserve historic sites that we copy George Washington, not George III.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. The American Civil War captures the imagination of people like no other event in our history. In bookstores, most shelves in the history section are devoted to events of the 1860s. On weekends, battles are reenacted by serious hobbyists who strive for authenticity in costume, weaponry and skirmish details. Pictures of Lincoln are found in countless homes and classrooms, Confederate flags adorn pickup trucks, and the words of the Gettysburg Address are as familiar as the 23rd Psalm. 
   As a nation, we clearly recognize the continuing importance of the War Between the States. So it is natural that we should try to find appropriate ways to keep safe the places where our great-grandfathers witnessed events so noble and so horrific. 
   But since our country is about liberty rather than glorification of the state, we have to safeguard not just the hills and the mud on which they fought but also the freedoms for which they fought. Therefore, it would be tragic if we allow our well-meaning enthusiasm for protecting historic sites to result in programs that diminish the property rights of our fellow citizens. This bill has two important safeguards: First, a ``willing seller'' provision--and we need to make sure the seller's willingness is uncoerced. Second, a sunset provision on the program's funding authorization. The bill's sponsors are to be commended for including these safeguards.

Unfortunately, the provision could be read to mean that the project goes in a westerly direction from Minnesota Drive to Old Seward Highway, which would create a result that would be completely incompatible with the project since it would put the road in the middle of a lake and a bog. The word ``west'' as used in section 105(a)(99) is part of the name of the project, and is not intended to indicate the direction in which the project should be built.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee for allowing this legislation to come to the floor of the House. 
   As a sponsor of H.R. 830 and of the Alaska Railroad Transfer Act of 1982, I am pleased we are considering this legislation today. Although it is small, the land exchange provided by H.R. 830 will improve the ability of the Alaska Railroad Corporation to serve its customers who wish to visit Denali National Park. The construction of a turnaround track will increase scheduling frequency and flexibility. This not only reduces overcrowding of Denali at any one time, it makes the Park Service's job of managing visitation much smoother. 
   This is a noncontroversial bill and enjoys the support of the National Park Service, the State of Alaska which owns the railroad, and the National Parks Conservation Association. 
   For anyone who has not traveled on the Alaska Railroad, it is a journey you should not miss. For those who have had an opportunity to enjoy the splendor of Alaska's scenery aboard the train, I am sure you will agree it is a first-class experience. 
   You may not know, but Alaska Railroad was once owned by the Federal Government; but Congress in its wisdom passed bipartisan legislation in 1982 to transfer the railroad to the State of Alaska. As Congress faces immense backlogs in caring for Federal assets, perhaps there is a lesson to be learned here. We might consider transferring more of these assets to the States. Alaska has proven it can take a Federal asset like the Alaska Railroad and manage it for the benefit of everyone who uses it. I believe this is a fine piece of legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to what could have been responsible bipartisan legislation. I have a great deal of respect for the chairman of the committee; he is a good friend of mine. But this is a bad bill. 
   As the gentleman on our side, the ranking member, Mr. Pearce, has done an outstanding job, he mentioned in his statement to listen to the chairman of the committee and those who are promoting this bill that the mining industry has no regulations, no laws, they just run rampant, which is pure nonsense. We are not really addressing an 1872 mining law here. It is not about the royalty. They offered the chairman if he would strike title III, we might be able to work a bill, and he turned it down. 
   This is about driving our industry, our mining industry overseas and away from our shores. This bill will do it. Just as I have heard in the past about legislation from that side of the aisle when you were in power that we are not trying to stop the logging industry in Alaska, we are just trying to make sure that we get our fair share. We went from 15,000 jobs down to less than 300 jobs. That was from the previous chairman. 
   I also heard all the time about how when they were in power, how we were going to be energy independent. And now we are paying $93 a barrel for oil, $93 a barrel, because you have not acted and we didn't do also. But we didn't try to stop the mining industry in this country as this bill will do. 
   This is not just about mining; this is about national security. Where do you think the metals come from to build our airplanes? Right now we are probably importing most of it. And I guarantee you, we will import all of it under this bill. We know, Mr. Rahall, this doesn't affect West Virginia. It doesn't affect his coal mines or any of the east coast States. But it does affect public lands in the West where our minerals are derived from. 
   I say wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America and my colleagues. Wake up. China has gone into Chile now, and they control the copper that we must have for our hybrid cars. 
   Yes, all of you, as I watch my good friend there working his BlackBerry, where do you think the metals and minerals came from for this? As we vote electronically today, the metals and minerals make that electronic system work. 
   We are not talking about the royalty, here; although, I do think it is unconstitutional as the bill came out of committee because you rewrote the contract under the bill. It will be taken to court and that part of the bill will be struck. It will be struck. I tried to say that. But no, again this is not a bipartisan bill. This is a bill that was written primarily by the leadership of this House that in reality takes away the ability for the western States to produce the minerals that are needed. That is what this bill does. 
   It does affect my State probably more than any other bill that has come out other than the Alaskan National Lands Act that put 147 million acres of land off limits. What remaining BLM land we have where we are trying to develop a mining industry will be precluded, taking away the benefit of the mining industry in the State of Alaska as it does in the western States. But it affects my State more, probably. 
   Yes, we probably could have written a bill that would have recovered the dollars necessary to straighten out hardrock mining. But no, we have a bill that stops the ability of this Nation to be self-sufficient in minerals. Later on you will see a display about just how dependent we have become. 
   I am hoping that this bill will be killed in the Senate, as most bills will be killed from the House side because no one wants to work with the Republicans at all. That is why you have an 11 percent rating of favorability. No ability to work across the aisle and say what will work and what are we trying to achieve. What are we trying to achieve? 
   If you were looking for money from royalties, we could have talked about that; prospective, not retroactive, because that will go to court. But that didn't happen, and you left title III in, which requires so much impossibility of achieving a mining claim that they will go abroad. They will go abroad, and that's not right for this country. 
   I have said all along, and I am going to be around here a lot longer than most people expect, and most of you probably don't like that, but I will be here just to say ``I told you so'' like I have done with the logging, what you did in my State and the logging industry and the west coast and on public lands. There is no timber industry. We are now importing our timber with no regulations. We have private timber in the eastern States, but not in the western States. 
   I listen to you. We just voted on a bill yesterday to help out people who are going to be displaced because of losing jobs overseas, and you voted for that. And that is what this bill does. It will drive the industry out of the United States of America and we will be dependent upon China and Russia and all of the other countries for the metals and minerals we must have in our Nation to make sure we are economically strong, and then we cannot become strong. 
   So as much as I love you, Mr. Chairman, this is a bad piece of legislation. I have been told don't worry about it, we will take care of it later on down the line. Well, I have been down that road before, too. 
   So I am asking my colleagues on my side of the aisle and anybody that is thinking on that side of the aisle to vote against this legislation if you believe in this Nation. If you believe in this Nation being strong, if you believe in jobs in our country and not abroad, then you will vote ``no'' for this bill. 
   If you don't believe that, then vote ``yes'' for the bill. And then go home and say, ``I repealed the 1872 mining law. Look what I did for you, Mr. Backpacker.'' But think of our country and our Nation. Think of our future. Vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (COFFMAN COVE ADMINISTRATIVE SITE CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman RAHALL for scheduling this noncontroversial bill for floor consideration today. 
   H.R. 831 will provide for the conveyance of approximately 12 acres of surplus Forest Service land to the city of Coffman Cove, Alaska. The 12-acre parcel sits in the middle of town adjacent to the site of a new Inter-Island Ferry Terminal that the city hopes to use to help spur economic growth. In addition to being an obstacle to the ferry terminal and any new economic development in the city's downtown, the location of the parcel makes it difficult and inefficient for the Forest Service to manage. As such, the conveyance provided for in this bill would benefit both the city and the Forest Service, and according to the Congressional Budget Office, it will do so at little or no cost to the taxpayer. 
   To give you some background, Mr. Speaker, Coffman Cove is a small, isolated community with about 200 residents that developed around a Tongass National Forest logging camp and work site. While the timber industry and the jobs it once provided in the region have largely disappeared, the community remains, and opportunities for economic growth and expansion are limited by the fact that it is surrounded on all sides by the 17-million-acre Tongass National Forest. I don't expect to change that anytime soon, but I think it is more than reasonable to convey 12 acres of surplus Federal land located within the community's economic center. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill provides a fair and commonsense solution to a problem. The tiny parcel of land is of no use to the Forest Service and it is an impediment to the growth and economic well-being of an isolated community surrounded by a National Forest larger than the State of West Virginia. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 831.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker and my fellow colleagues, today is the day with General Petraeus to recognize that with all the rhetoric on this floor, that we should listen to the troops. They are the ones that are sacrificing. They are the ones that I believe have firsthand knowledge of what is occurring in Iraq. 
   I have a letter that I am going to read: 
   Dear Congressman Young: 
   I am an Alaska Army National Guard soldier serving in Iraq voluntarily on one of the 10 `surge' Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams, based at Camp Taji. My team works in the Taji and Abu Ghraib districts, and soon, Tarmiya. Our surge military forces, along with the greatly improved Iraq Army, Police and local Critical Infrastructure Security Forces have won the battles. Al Qaeda is gone from our districts. Now we need the time to win the war. The security situations are set and 180 degrees turned around from pre-surge. I've seen it happen and am living it daily. Do not let the United States lose this part of the Global War against Terrorists. This campaign in Iraq needs to play out and be a visible win for our country. Me and my fellow Servicemembers and the Civilians of DOD and State are here to make it true. We need your support. Thank you for your time and attention. WE ARE WINNING. 
   Most Sincerely, 
   Mike Bridges, Colonel,

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Speaker, I rise to thank my distinguished colleague from Maryland, the majority leader, for introducing this resolution, but I am forced to oppose it. 
   The voting rights we are considering today are so limited in scope that they are merely symbolic, which has been said. Under the gentleman's resolution, the Delegates and Resident Commissioner will never be able to cast a vote to determine the final outcome of a vote, because if it were to be decisive, there would be an automatic revote on which they could not participate. As odd as it may seem, when it doesn't count, it counts. And when it counts, it doesn't count, as my good friend from California said. 
   Madam Speaker, this proposal falls far short from what we should be doing to address the way our Nation currently deals with its insular areas, and that is why I am unable to support this legislation. As chairman of the Resources Committee in the mid- to late 1990s, we led an effort, we, this side, not that side, led an effort that would have specifically addressed the question of political status of the 4 million American citizens that reside in Puerto Rico. That bill did pass this House by one vote, but the Senate failed to act on it. 
   In the last Congress, my good friend and colleague from Puerto Rico, the ranking member of the Insular Affairs Subcommittee, Resident Commissioner Luis Fortu&#241;o, revived this effort after 5 years of inaction. He introduced a bipartisan legislation that was followed with the recommendations set forth by the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status Report to Congress. 
   Puerto Rico has been a U.S. territory with an unresolved political status since our Nation acquired the island in 1898. Puerto Ricans have been citizens and have honorably served in our Nation's Armed Forces since 1917. Close to 60 of them have already paid the ultimate sacrifice in our Nation's war against terror in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   These 4 million U.S. citizens deserve more than just symbolism. They deserve a permanent resolution to the question of their political status. 
   Madam Speaker, I say respectfully, it is time we act honorably and give them the right to vote as a State.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   My colleagues and Mr. and Mrs. America, this is primarily a political  gesture without a great deal of result, and that is unfortunate. The hearings are necessary, especially in cargo screening. It has been shown to us that the cargo screening port security cannot occur within our ports themselves without total cooperation from the overseas shippers to the United States. 
   What we are asking in this bill is expenditure of huge dollars for really window dressing and not results. As the gentleman from Florida said, we are not really in this legislation as being proposed giving us any more security. We are expending dollars in the billions in the airports, and it will be in the billions in the ports and the waterways of our Nation. And the direct result will be, and keep this in mind, Mr. and Mrs. America, a direct cost to you without any security. Every product, everything you pick up that is imported to the United States will add an additional cost, and it may make us noncompetitive. There are other ports within our hemisphere that will be accepting without the security that is being offered in this bill within our ports the cargo that should be coming through our ports employing our people. 
   If you want true security, it will be done at the origin of shipping to the United States, and that is where we should be putting our efforts, not a charade of saying we are going to have our ports secure because we are going to put millions of dollars, billions, into the screening of everyone who works in the ports and setting up an artificial barricade of security. 
   There is an old saying: If you want a secure area, don't let anybody know how you secured it. What this proposal says is: national standards shall be set, and thus you shall be secure. But if I am the bad guy, I will figure around it to do good damage, bad damage to you, good damage to me. I ask you to reconsider and let's go back to the hearing process and do this job right.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 2764, which provides, among other things, $500 million for the Commanders Emergency Response Program (CERP). Our continued support for this program is vital for winning the war on terror and ensuring stability in Iraq and Afghanistan. General Petraeus himself recently described it as ``a critical tool with which to prosecute the counterinsurgency campaign.'' 
   Our continued support for CERP will be especially important for achieving long term success in Iraq. The Iraqi people must be convinced that their lives are getting better and that their future is one of peace and prosperity, rather than violence and sectarian strife. As David Ignatius pointed out this morning in the Washington Post, ``the success of the U.S. troop surge seems to be bolstering, ever so slightly, the advocates of conciliation and weakening the partisans of sectarian war.'' However, ``[t]he recent progress in Iraq has resulted from bottom-up efforts to build trust, neighborhood by neighborhood.'' CERP has proven to be one of the key tools in this effort. 
   CERP allows our military commanders and civil affairs officers on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan to respond to urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction requirements within their areas of responsibility by carrying out programs that will immediately assist the indigenous population. The funding is allocated to brigade commanders to support a wide variety of small-scale relief and reconstruction projects, including reconstruction of water and sanitation facilities, school repair, restoring power stations, lines and generators, providing humanitarian relief, renovating cultural centers, museums and libraries, and repairing telecommunications infrastructure. 
   Most importantly, CERP grants can be dispensed quickly and applied directly to local needs, rather than slowed down by the bureaucratic process in Washington and watered down by foreign contractors and subcontractors. As Secretary Gates recently explained in his testimony before Congress, ``.....by building trust and confidence in Coalition forces, these CERP projects increase the flow of intelligence to commanders in the field and help turn local Iraqis and Afghans against insurgents and terrorists.'' 
   CERP could also serve to be a key component in helping to normalize the more than 2 million internally displaced Iraqis and provide a stable environment for the more than 2 million externally displaced in neighboring countries to return home. 
   The Iraqi Red Crescent Organization (IRCO), for example, has recently proposed a one-year plan to normalize up to 600,000 internally displaced residents of Baghdad into 120 self sustaining neighborhood units. The IRCO Neighborhood Reconstruction Program (NRP) could help provide unemployed IDPs with the opportunity to construct and service approximately 100,000 homes, 440 schools, 132 mobile health clinics, 60 water treatment plants, and 44 electrical generators. With the financial support of CERP and the Government of Iraq, this program would be coordinated through IRCO's existing 44 offices in Baghdad and, within a year, these formerly displaced people would have the opportunity live in homes with electricity and water, within neighborhoods that have access to nearby healthcare, schools, and jobs. 
   We have an obligation to continue funding CERP so that the Iraqi and Afghan people can build peaceful and prosperous societies for themselves. The sooner this occurs, the quicker our troops can come home.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I am thankful for the comments of the previous speaker, and of course the ranking member. I'm disappointed in those that are offering this amendment. 
   The supporters of this amendment and the proposer of this amendment like to believe that Chicken Little threats have been thrown about. Instead of the sky falling, it's the Earth warming, and bears are in extreme danger of extinction and we must act now. I just heard that speaker from Washington say that. 
   Let's take care. Polar bears are not threatened; they're not endangered. The worldwide population of polar bears is around 30,000. While there may be polar bear populations feeling the effects of a warming climate, and I say ``may,'' we need to remember these species have survived past warming cycles.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. This species is not at the end of its rope, contrary to those who proposed this amendment. Thirteen of the 19 polar bear populations are under the jurisdiction of Canada. Canada has one of the best management programs, using state-of-art scientific practices to manage these populations. While that should be enough, it's not the end of the oversight or management of polar bears in Canada. 
   The United States Marine Mammal Protection Act requires the Fish and Wildlife Service to review the status of polar bear populations in Canada. After conducting their review of the service-approved, stable and healthy populations, hunters can only import trophies from those approved populations. 
   Supporters of the amendment like to refer to the 1994 amendments of the Marine Protection Act that allowed an importation of polar bear trophies as a loophole. It was the law. These statements are far from the truth. In fact, we worked on it with a Democrat-controlled Congress. We worked on it together to improve the species in Canada because Canada asked us to do so.  
   In 1970, many marine mammal populations faced numerous threats. The Marine Protection Act was very effective in restoring many marine mammal populations to healthy or historic levels. Unfortunately, the act does not discriminate between healthy marine mammal populations and those still in need of rebuilding. Robust populations of marine mammals are treated like they are on the verge of extinction. 
   While the 1994 amendments did not address this issue, the Democrat-controlled Congress, specifically those enlightened members of the Merchant Marines Fisheries Committee, had the foresight to understand that the sustainable use of resources and conservation activities are not mutually exclusive. The committee developed strict requirements to ensure the protection of polar bear populations in Canada, while allowing for the importation of sport-hunted polar bear trophies. 
   The idea of incentives to give value to natural resources was very new at the time. A similar program was developed for African communities to protect big game resources in Africa using the same incentive structure. These programs have proven their worth and are very successful. 
   There will always be a sector of the population that believes we should not kill anything or eat anything and, in fact, we should eat grass. However, we need to keep in mind there are still areas in the world that rely on the natural resources around them and still subsist on these resources. 
   The argument is not that polar bears need to be protected due to the effects of a warming climate. The argument is that certain groups do not like hunting, regardless of what those are saying promoted, and want it stopped. 
   The Canadian polar bear populations are healthy and well managed. Sport-hunting activities provide important incentives and support remote Native villages and important conservation programs in Canada, the U.S., and Russia. 
   Mr. Chairman, I suggest, respectfully, go back to the history. This saves the polar bear as is in place. This amendment will extinguish the polar bear. 
   For those who don't know anything about the polar bear, and I suggest, respectfully, those two gentlemen that introduced this have never seen a polar bear in the wild, don't know anything about it, read it in a book.     
   I suggest respectfully that before this was in place, in 1994, what was happening was that the Canadian natives, bless their hearts, would hunt polar bears. They would kill the sows and the cubs but not the boars. The boars would kill the cubs so they can breed the sows. Our polar bear population was going down. Because of our actions, in fact, the polar bear population increased. That is what we were trying to do. It was a true conservation method, a method of science, a method that works. 
   Mr. Speaker, if this amendment is adopted, you can forget your polar bears in the wild. They will be extinguished. This is a bad amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   This is about energy and about the budget, and this is about the Arctic wildlife range in Alaska. 
   We have voted 12 times on this floor; in fact, I think Mr. Spratt voted for it, Mr. Dingell voted for it, or will vote for it, to try to open the last great known elephant in oil fields in the continental United States. If we were to do so today, we would deliver to the American public 1 million barrels of oil for 30 continuing years--a day. Thirty years, 1 million barrels a day. That's the very minor estimate. 
   But more than that, it would provide, this year, if we were just to lease it, $191 billion in revenue for the budget, $191 billion for the lease and the development of ANWR. And in 3 years I can deliver to the American public 1 million barrels a day or more. That's more than Venezuela. That keeps Venezuela from jacking the prices around. 
   If we were to do it, my good friends, it would drop the price of oil about $10 a barrel immediately; not because we're delivering it, but it would be the first time this Congress has worked on the supply side, and the speculators would stop speculating if they saw that Congress was serious about developing our national and our Federal lands in fossil fuels. Why we don't do that I cannot understand. 
   Yes, we do have to change our modes of transportation in a period of time. But there's no way you can bridge the ability of not using fossil fuels in the short-term. 
   Now, you think about the consumer today in Alaska, and you think about the consumer in the rest of the Nation and what they have to do at $4 a gallon, maybe $5. And I have estimates it may go as far as $10 by the end of the year, and that's going to be on your watch.  
   We're here talking about the budget. But if we want to solve the budget problems, let's create some dollars. But more than that, let's create less dependency on foreign oil. 
   How we can sit here as a body and send dollars overseas, and the billions of dollars; to give you some idea, the average tax for every man, woman and child, everybody listening to this station tonight is paying $2,085 per every man, woman and child in tax to the foreign countries, burning their oil. Seventy percent of their oil. 
   And some people say, well, it's the oil companies. Nonsense. This is about demand globally and supply. We're not the only buyers anymore. America's not the only ones that have automobiles. America's not the only one using fossil fuels. China is burning more barrels of fuel today than we are, and that drives the price up. We're no longer the only buyer, and the seller can ask for the price they're going to get. 
   The only way you can relieve that is start developing our national, on Federal lands, our oil for the good of the American people. Why we're not doing this, I don't know. 
   And remember, you heard me before on this, well it's not your fault, it's not our fault, it's this fault, the body of this Congress. We've got to stop pandering for those who say no to developing our fossil fuels. We have to stop pandering for those saying it's going to be a total climate change because it is going to happen in this world. They will be burning oil, and we'll be unable to take and support our people until we develop our fields as we should develop them. 
   I'm hoping America's listening. I hope America will wake up to the fact. We have the ability to do it here today. We have the ability to solve the budget problem, but we have a better ability to solve the energy problem in America. 
   I'm asking my fellow colleagues, let's do it. Let's do it today. Let's do it in the future. Let's solve the problems of energy in this Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD END COMMERCIAL WHALING -- (House of Representatives - June 18, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution and deeply respect the previous speakers. 
   I understand why they are trying to do this. It's unfortunate that some people don't remember the whaling industry started in Massachusetts, and maybe they're trying to forgive their sins. 
   Having said that, this resolution is being brought up under a procedure that does not allow amendments, and frankly this resolution does nothing to save the whales. More than 37,000 whales have been taken since the International Whaling Commission, IWC, implemented a moratorium on commercial whaling. 
   Under the existing International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, member nations of the IWC could continue to take whales under a number of procedures. While I do not necessarily support commercial whaling, the current convention allows it for those nations that took a reservation against a commercial whaling moratorium. 
   This resolution naively suggests the United States can somehow end commercial whaling by itself at the next meeting of the International Whaling Commission, which starts next week. Very frankly, this resolution is nothing more than a fund-raising gimmick for those environmental groups that oppose whaling. 
   This resolution does nothing to save the whales. In fact, it might do the opposite. If the IWC cannot come to some agreement on how to move forward, Norway, Iceland and Japan have all signaled in recent years that they want to take either more whales or more species of whales. Under the current rules they can do so. This resolution may do nothing more than encourage those countries that dig in their heels to increase their take of whales. 
   In addition, the resolution says nothing about the need for the United States delegation to the IWC to protect the Native rights to harvest whales. To the Native people on the North Slope of Alaska, whales mean food. Alaska Natives have harvested whales for centuries, and they continue to do so today. 
   Although they have taken whales for centuries and depend on the bowhead whale to survive, they must constantly defend their need and their cultural heritage. I want to compliment my Alaskan Natives on our North Slope. They were told there were only 500 whales left when they were put on the endangered species list. 
   They did not believe that. They hired the best professors, the best scientists in the world, and, in fact, found out there are over 15,000 bowhead whales, just to prove the point that the science was wrong. 
   To the Native people on the North Slope of Alaska, whales mean food. This is not an issue of politics to them. 
   They have done everything the IWC has ever asked them, and they still get their quota taken away from them because people think using the whaling issue is good for fund-raising. The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission has done more scientific research on bowhead whales than any government has ever done on any whale species. Every time the quota is up for renewal in the IWC, someone comes up with a new theory on why Alaskans should not be allowed to take the number of whales they need. And again I will say ``need.'' 
   Their quota is based on their need for whales as food. I can't say that enough, for food. To them, the whale is a necessary part of their culture and a necessary part of their dietary needs. Every time their quota is up, someone comes along and puts another hurdle in front of them that they must meet to get their quota.  
   The International Whaling Commission is broken. There are two groups of countries that show up each meeting and fight about which one of them has the moral high ground. There are those countries that are anti-whaling and those countries that are pro-whaling. 
   The two sides have been in an arms race for years to see which side can get more countries to join the IWC so they can have a simple majority and pass a meaningless resolution before the other side gets a majority and passes meaningless resolutions to support their point of view. Neither side is ever likely to get enough countries on their side to make any change in the convention because it takes a three-fourths vote. While they are having this fight about which side has the moral high ground, they use the Native people, who rely on whales for food, as political hostages. 
   At the 2002 meeting in Japan, the Alaskan Eskimo Whaling Commission's quota was denied because of those policies. It took a special meeting of the IWC to restore the quota to my constituents. This is not a matter to be taken lightly and cannot continue. Alaska's quota cannot be held hostage every 5 years for other countries' political whims. It cannot be held to a higher standard and required to do more and more to satisfy someone's new theory about the bowhead whale that might mean a change for the Alaskan quota. 
   Members need to be very careful about how they talk about whaling, because the United States is a whaling Nation. Alaska Natives have harvested whales for centuries, and they continue to do so today. This resolution does nothing to highlight the importance of Native peoples' need to harvest whales and may only further inflame the hostilities at the IWC and quite possibly result in an increase in the number of whales killed in the future.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and we do have a great deal of admiration for one another, but you have to understand, in 2002 our quota for my Alaska Native people, their heritage and their culture was held up by one of the IWC members, Japan. And we had to have a special session to get the quota reinstated, and they should not be used as a political ping-pong ball. I want to stress that. 
   If I thought for a moment, and I am not for commercial whaling, but I am saying that if I thought for a moment this would stop it, I would be supportive of the resolution. But until we recognize the fact, because I do have Alaskan Natives, heritage-wise and cultural-wise, that do take whales today for needed food, they are being held hostage because we belong to the IWC. 
   I will tell you, my friends, what's going to happen, there is nothing that says Iceland, Japan or Greenland, wherever it may be, has to belong to the IWC. They can pull out and kill all of the whales they want to kill, and you and I can't stop that, whether it is on our endangered list or not. 
   I do think there ought to be a cease-fire between these groups. Quit using my people as hostages, and see if there isn't a solution of some type that will appease both sides. In the meantime, they kill 37,000 whales under the loophole, and IWC doesn't have the arbitrary right to close that loophole unless there is some agreement. 
   Now this resolution makes everybody feel good and look good and they can go back and say I saved the whales, but it doesn't do anything. I just think that is the wrong thing to do when, very frankly, you are hurting other people, and this is their right. And they have established the fact that there aren't 500 bullhead whales, there are 15,000 bullhead whales, and they take 19 a year of 15,000. I want you to think about that a moment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chairman, I am dismayed that this Congress, including Members of my own party, has again decided to eliminate funding for the Denali Commission and cripple the economic lifeline to hundreds of small communities throughout rural Alaska. 
   When health crises arise, options are often extremely limited in rural Alaska. Health issues or emergencies that require hospital care often involve costly air transportation that can take as much time and money as a flight from New York to Los Angeles, if weather permits. For local health care, the typical rural community health facility is aging, small and inadequate to provide necessary services. In one of its earliest decisions, the Denali Commission designated rural health care as a top priority for Commission support and is continuing its work to provide safe and appropriate infrastructure which will improve health care delivery for rural Alaskans. 
   Through its health care program, and in partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Alaska health providers, the Commission is working to address the infrastructure needs of communities statewide to ensure all Alaskans receive safe and reliable health care. 
   In 1999, the Commission was granted authority by Congress to address rural Alaska health care issues. This authority authorized the Denali Commission to plan, construct and equip health, nutrition and child care projects across the state. Potential projects include hospitals, health care clinics, and mental health facilities including drug and alcohol treatment centers. In 2001, the Commission identified rural primary care facility needs in more than 288 rural communities, and estimated the cost of needed rural primary care facilities to be $253 million. 
   Since then, more than 200 communities have sought assistance from the Denali Commission. And in addition to constructing several essential village primary care clinics, the Denali Commission has funded major design initiatives for needed replacement hospitals in Nome and Barrow. It has now completed clinics in over 65 of these remote communities. 
   Now, in 2007, Congress is telling the Commission that they no longer see a need for the Denali Commission. They are looking to cut $39 million when the real need in my State is several times that amount. Have the health care problems in rural Alaska been miraculously fixed overnight? Have any Members of the House visited Alaska and seen firsthand that rural health care is no longer an issue for Alaskans? The answer to both is a resounding ``No.'' 
   The Commission works tirelessly each year to make sure that my Alaskans are not treated like second class citizens and eliminating these funds will be devastating. It is my hope that the Senate has more sense and will continue funding this essential program. I will work with my colleagues in the other chamber to make sure that this happens--Alaskans deserve better.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate the chairman, Mr. Oberstar, and the Minnesota delegation in expediting this process  with the leadership of Mr. Mica and the leadership of both sides. 
   I don't do this often when I say I told you so. As chairman, with Mr. Oberstar, we tried to put the money in to identify the weaknesses of the bridges and to repair them, and we were unsuccessful. We ended up with a $286 billion bill instead of a $375 billion bill. 
   Mr. and Mrs. America, I believe it is time for us to wake up. We have to repair our outdated infrastructure, especially our bridges. You have heard statistics, 11,000 and on and on, how many are deficient. But there are about 500 in the same shape as the bridge in Minnesota right now that are a potential death trap to constituencies. 
   We have to, as a Congress, grasp this problem and, yes, lo and behold, I would even suggest fund this problem with a tax. May the sky not fall on me, but with a tax. Make it a 3-year tax. Make it a 5-cent tax, and they will say we can't do that. But I would suggest respectfully that the American people will understand the importance if we fund it and if we address the issue of the bridges. We should do this. 
   And maybe this is a wake-up call, and I hope The Post is wrong, that we all don't go back to sleep and watch football this fall and forget this tragic accident, because if we do so, then we are not fulfilling our obligation and our duty. 
   So I stand here before you today saying I told you so. But I am also saying let's act as we should to protect our people in every one of our States.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (ALASKA WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the chairman of the committee, Mrs. Napolitano from California, for bringing this bill up with Mr. Rahall. 
   This bill seeks to expand Alaska's water supply system and reduce flood threats. My State's combined water bodies comprise one-third of all the fresh water in the United States, but communities are struggling to provide drinking water due to the outdated water distribution system and lack of information on groundwater resources. For this reason, this bill will include a survey of potential water supplies in the City of Anchorage, the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the City of Fairbanks and Fairbanks Northstar Borough. 
   The bill also improves streamflow information to improve flood forecasting, resource extraction and fire management. Streamflow information in the form of USGS streamgaging stations is insufficient in Alaska compared to other States. In fact, Alaska has only 100 streamgage stations, which is less than 10 percent of the information available in many other States. This bill will help alleviate that situation. 
   Again, I want to thank Mr. Rahall and Mrs. Napolitano of California for bringing this bill, and I urge passage of this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, may I say that I am so happy today we are talking about water, water in California, water in Alaska, water in Nebraska. Water is going to be our next big crisis that we are going to be faced with in this Nation, it is energy now, and we must do something. We have to learn how to use water better, how to impound water, and how to deliver water so we have that which supports our life, and that is water.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (PEAK OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I want to congratulate the gentleman for bringing this to the floor of the House many times and trying to explain to the public what peak oil mean. I have to say I was a doubter, and over the period of time that you have explained this to me I became a believer. 
   It looks, as you have said before, as the population growth, the consumption factor and what we have available. It's sad that we haven't addressed this issue. 
   Now I am one of the ones that believes in drilling as you mentioned but I also agree with you that now we should step forward and solve the problem for the future today. 
   We can do this with all the efforts--because if we don't, like you say, your grandchildren and your great grandchildren and possibly your greater grandchildren are going to face a great dilemma. 
   I am confident, as this Congress goes forth, or the people demanded that we will find solutions to this. But right now it has been too easy to buy oil from overseas, not realizing we were running out. We got accustomed to it, like you say, going to the cookie jar and not looking down the road. 
   Again, I want to thank the gentleman. 
   I mean, you are doing a great favor for this Nation to try to awaken the people that, yes, we can drill and we can solve the problem, and we may lower the prices temporarily. 
   But what we ought to be doing is utilizing some of our oil now and taking the revenues that are generated and put it into that--and I reluctantly say this--from Alaska, but into the bridge to the future, so that we will have those alternative forms of energy. 
   We can move products with other than fossil fuels. We can manufacture with other than natural gas. 
   There are a lot of things that we just must do. Again, I want to thank the gentleman for doing this, and I am pleased to be part of your effort and hopefully, as time goes by, this Congress will wake up. Right now, they are not. But you keep doing it and maybe the public will wake them up.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. If the gentleman will yield just one more time, you are absolutely right. There is nothing that we do that doesn't have an environmental impact. The only thing we can do to stop having an environmental impact is stop living. 
   We can face up to that, what can be done, and we have done that, is to do it as safe as possible, and that can be done. But the trade-offs, if we don't drill, and take those dollars and put them in renewable sources of energy, the trade-off is a disaster environmentally. 
   I have said this, if you want to see a disaster where they haven't been able to develop, as they should, their fossil fuels, et cetera, go to the countries that cut every tree down, because it's the only source of power they have. 
   You go to Ethiopia, you go to other countries of Africa. There is no living thing that can be burning because there is no other forms of energy. That's what I don't want to see this Nation--let's look for, as you mention, let's recognize it as an invite. Material oil will run out, let's use the revenues now and plan for the future and have availability of energy. 
   If we do it now, then we are going to be in good shape in the future. Not you and I, but you and your grandkids.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (PUBLIC LAND COMMUNITIES TRANSITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, when this bill came out of the committee, I thought we had an agreement where there would be an offset and a payment of the bill. Unfortunately, that did not occur, so consequently I will be voting against this legislation because it doesn't do what it says it is going to do. Very frankly, this is funny money, and the schools won't be, as we want them to be, funded, and that is unfortunate. 
   But I am also going to talk about a lot of the statements on the floor, and my good friend from Oregon has to understand that I do watch the debate. There were some statements made that I think were incorrect, in fact I know, not think, about ANWR and about PET4 and about independence. 
   There has been no oil shipped overseas from Alaska. It all goes to the West Coast, at one time through the Panama Canal, through a pipeline, for American consumption, all 17 billion barrels of oil. And if we were to open ANWR or the Chukchi Sea it would go to the United States. It wouldn't go overseas to China or Japan. We could make sure of that as we vote for it on this House floor, as we did when we had the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
   I think it is important that the American public recognize that we do have a supply problem. And anybody who denies that, I have heard these arguments for 25 years, well, we only do have one month or 6 months or whatever it is oil supply, so we shouldn't do it. If we have that 1 million barrels a day, Chavez would not have the ability to blackmail us, or if Nigeria had an upheaval, there wouldn't be the spike in oil prices. 
   A lot of people are pointing their fingers at all the problems, the big oil, the speculators, and I do think there is some merit in the speculators because they know we haven't acted on the supply side ever since the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Not one time.

   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Let's follow this train a little bit further. If we don't increase our supply, Mr. and Mrs. America, instead of $4 a gallon, it is going to be $10 a gallon by January 1. 
   We must act in this Congress, and if you do not, may the wrath come down on you and may you be punished for what you have not done. We must address this issue in this Congress. I urge my colleagues to consider the supply side. Consider it. And this legislation itself has its weak points, too.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I thank the ranking member, and I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for introducing this legislation. I am the cosponsor of the amendment, and I thank the chairman of the full committee. 
   The proportion of married U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan is higher today than in any other previous war, including the Civil War. Consequently, when these brave men and women are killed in the line of duty, they often leave behind husbands, wives and children. 
   Since 2001, more than 4,400 U.S. servicemembers have died during their deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan, and more than 2,100 children have lost a parent as result of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   Nine months after Fort Wainwright's Stryker Brigade Combat Team returned from their deployment in Iraq, Bassett Army Community Hospital in Fairbanks delivered a record number of babies. Those babies will be a year old when their parents redeploy this fall. This amendment, which I have offered with the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas, will ensure that they deploy with the knowledge that, if necessary, their children's education will be taken care of.  
   Our amendment will provide financial assistance and access to higher education for children who lost a parent or guardian as a result of our ongoing military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. It allows the children who have been left behind to have access to a maximum Pell Grant award by waiving the income eligibility requirement for them. 
   It will apply to children of U.S. soldiers who have died while performing military service in Iraq or Afghanistan after September 11, 2001. Children who are 18 years or younger or those enrolled part time or full time at college at the time of the parent or guardian's death will be eligible for a Pell Grant application starting in 2009. 
   The death of a parent is not only emotionally devastating for a child, but often creates a financial hardship for the family. Through this Pell Grant award we can offer a chance for a bright future for the children of those who gave their lives in the name of service for their country. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and help those children who have been left behind. I would like to thank the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas for offering this amendment with me and reaching across the aisle in a bipartisan way to solve some of the problems caused by this war.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate on both sides of the aisle for the last 2 days, the third day in fact, and probably will listen to it tomorrow. 
   I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 63, and I would like to make a quote: ``Congressmen who willfully take actions during wartime that damage morale and undermine the military are saboteurs and should be arrested, exiled or hanged,'' Abraham Lincoln, who had the same problem this President had with a very unpopular war. The same problem with people trying to redirect the Commander in Chief; the same problem, if they had been successful, we would not have had the freedom of the people in this country. 
   What I say today is for my daughters, my Joanie, my Dawn; my grandkids, Wyatt, Guy, James Duffy, Katie, Jessie, Don, Niky, Dougy and Don, Eric and all the rest of them I missed and I apologize, because what we are about to do tomorrow in voting for this resolution is beginning a slippery slope down the slide of not being able to provide the freedom and the position in this world this country has done for the last 90 years, beginning in 1916, 1917, in World War I, which my father fought in; in World War II, where five of my cousins were shot numerous times for freedom of the people and freedom of this country; and, yes, the Korean War, the time in which I was drafted. 
   Fortunately or unfortunately, I did not serve, but my colleagues did. Each time we went there to make freedom, never once did the Congress in that role undermine the military or the Commander in Chief. 
   Then we came to Vietnam, and we began to fight a war by the media, a war without allowing the troops to do the job they should have done, and in fact, we lost that war. And immediately after withdrawing, we saw what happened. Khymer Rouge killed 2 million people. People forget that. Two million heads were laying around, lolling around Cambodia. And then we had Grenada, which was very short and very sweet, and of the course, the Gulf War was 110 days. And now we come to the Afghanistan war and the Iraq war. 
   I suggest to you this resolution will undermine and cause a morale disruption to our troops. Nowhere can you be in the field and understand the Congress of the United States now is not going to support them when they say they do, when they say they are going to cut their funding in the future. 
   It is a slippery slope down this slide of not being the leaders of this Nation for freedom, and this is what I thought this country is about, freedom for each individual in this world and in our country. And to have this occur tomorrow on the 16th is a disservice to the future generations, the generations of Americans who will not have the opportunity to be in the greatest country in the world because of the action of this Congress. 
   I urge a very, very strong ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 63.

<DOCNO>Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chairman, I deeply appreciate the recognition, and I do appreciate the chairman of the full committee and the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Boozman, for the legislation we are discussing today; but I cannot sit idly by and listen to the people talk about the high cost of energy when there has been little action in this Congress, and I will say ``this Congress,'' the past Congresses and this present Congress about solving the high cost of energy to the American consumer, the $4 a gallon that they're going to have to pay. 
   The last time we passed any energy legislation on this floor was 1973. We passed the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. That's the last time. At that time, we were importing 38 percent of our fossil fuels. Today, we are importing 70 percent of our fossil fuels. Mr. and Mrs. America, keep in mind 50 percent of that fossil fuels is coming from countries that are not friendly to the United States of America. We are sending them over about $500 billion a year because this Congress, this Congress, has not acted to try to relieve the dependency on fossil fuel from abroad. 
   Now some people will say, and I listened to the young lady, we are going to take up alternate forms of energy, and I'll buy that. I'll put the little curlicue lightbulbs in. I'll do that. I'll save and turn down the thermostat. I'll do that. I'll, in fact, drive my automobile slower. Most people do not. But that doesn't solve the problem of the energy we need to move product. 
   The chairman knows full good and well, being the chairman of the Transportation Committee, our economy is based upon the ability to move product to and fro within this Nation. 
   The ship it brings us is driven by fossil fuels. The truck, the plane, the automobile, the train is driven by fossil fuels. And if we continue to become more dependent, which we apparently are going to do under the leadership of this Congress, we'll be in the point where we cannot move our product, ship them abroad which we produce, nor receive them. Seventy percent, again from foreign countries. 
   And yet we have a tremendous amount of fossil fuels, the United States of America, that's not being developed. It should be developed. Offshore. Chukchi Sea, there's more oil in Alaska than there is in the Gulf of Mexico at a relatively shallow depth. The coasts of California, the coast of Florida, the Rocky Mountains, the coasts of Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina has a tremendous amount of oil in the realm of about, I would suggest, 500 billion barrels of oil. 
   That's available to the American public. But we have a leadership now in this Congress that believes that the world is coming to an end, led by Al Gore, that the world is coming to an end if we burn fossil fuels. 
   I suggest respectfully, Mr. and Mrs. America, if we do not lower that price to the small business community and to the person who has to commute to their work site, we are in a dire shape in this Nation as a whole. We have to address this issue. 
   I ask my colleagues, please quit buying this concept that we are going to do it with windmills and with sun power. Yes, we could use those things. Yes, we ought to use nuclear, and yes, we ought to use hydro. The wheel of energy should be developed, and this Congress has not done it. Has not done it. We have this idea we are going to solve the problem. Look at the energy bill we passed this year through this leadership. It produced nothing. Period. Nothing. That's why the consumer today, in America, is going to that gas pump, and by the way, it's a tax to him. Every man, woman, and child is paying $2,000 a year to Saudi Arabia and countries such as because we sit idly on our hands doing nothing. 
   Madam Chairman, I suggest respectfully this Congress has to wake up. I listen to the political rhetoric of all of the presidential candidates, and nobody is addressing the energy issue other than the fact that we can't burn fossil fuels because we are losing the icecap and the polar bears are in danger. 
   Think about this for a moment. Think about the American public and the need for economy-based, fossil fuel driven because it moves an object. We must address this. I'm asking my colleagues to understand that. Quit pandering. Quit pandering to the interest groups that really are trying to socially structure our Nation through fear. 
   We have the fossil fuel. It is here. It should be developed. We should give the opportunity instead of restricting it, and that's what we've done in this Congress. In my state alone we have ANWR. It's passed this House 12 times. It passed the Senate once and Bill Clinton vetoed it. It's got about 36 billion barrels of oil available 74 miles away from an existing pipeline. And this Congress will not step forth and address that issue alone because they say it's going to hurt the environment, 74 miles away from the existing pipeline. 
   Madam Chairman, I suggest respectfully let's get off our duffs, and let's do the job we should for this nation.
