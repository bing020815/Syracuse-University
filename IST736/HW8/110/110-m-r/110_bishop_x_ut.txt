<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to be here. I appreciate Mr. Grijalva as well for joining me here on this particular bill. 
   There are three types of trail bills that the National Park Service has: historic, recreational, and scenic. This happens to be the last of those; a scenic trail. We have not done one of those since 1983. It would seem that after 25 years, one of the things we ought to be able to do is at least do it the right way. 
   In the 107th Congress, a study was mandated on this particular trail and was not to go forward until the study was completed, the environmental review was completed. The study has not yet been completed. It is close to it, but not, which is, once again, one of the reasons we will be talking in a few minutes about an amendment to say this should go into place once regular order has taken place, the study has been completed, and then, appropriate to our rules to move forward at that particular time. 
   This particular trail has been, since 1931, done on a volunteer, local operation. People there have automatically authorized the use of their land, private property, for trails. It has been that way for over 70 years, has functioned well, and it should be one of those things of which we are extremely proud in this country, that people can actually come together and work together on a local area to do something that is good, without the heavy hand of the Federal Government helping them along the way. We have had 70 years of experience with that. 
   Now, one of the things I'd like to talk about, because I am an old history teacher, is simply one of the things we need to do as a Congress and as a people is to learn the lessons of history. We obviously know the hackneyed cliche that if we don't learn those lessons, we will repeat them. Or, as P.J. O'Rourke did a much better corollary, he who did not learn the lessons of history probably didn't do well in English or remedial math as well. 
   This Congress ought to do well in all of those, and one of those is the potential of those lessons of history. It is from those of us in the West who have had a sad experience dealing with Federal issues on Federal land issues. So our good friends in the East have not had that experience yet. 
   The State of Massachusetts has a grand total of 1.8 percent of its State owned by the Federal Government. The State of Connecticut has a whopping .4 percent of its State owned by the Federal Government. Very little interface with the Federal Government, which may be one of the reasons why Mr. Young of Alaska or Mr. Heller of Nevada, who stand up with concerns, should be taken into consideration, because 90 percent of their State is owned by the Federal Government, or Mr. Flake of Arizona, with half of his State, over half controlled by the Federal Government, or 70 percent of my State is controlled by the Federal Government. And we have had, by sad experience, seen where well-meaning and well-intentioned efforts on behalf of the Federal Government have led to some negative and unfortunate situations. 
   I want to tell you one story in an issue that is different than a trail setting. I want to talk about Gene, an old farmer, third-generation farmer, growing sugar beets, which, by definition, is a root crop and cannot grow in wetlands. Gene decided he would rent part of his sugar beet land for alfalfa, and to make sure that the water, which was going from an irrigation pipe from the creek to his land, would get to the high point, he allowed it to pool in the lower point. 
   One day, one of the Federal regulators, given authority under a very vague Federal law, came there and said that land is obviously a wetland. Actually, what he simply said is that the Great Salt Lake is part of our interstate commerce system, Logan Creek is part of it going into the Great Salt Lake. Therefore, the irrigation pipe is part of the navigable waterways of the United States, and the water is a wetland. 
   It didn't matter that Gene was able to get the Soil and Conservation Corps in there to prove the land was not conducive to wetlands; didn't matter that once he stopped the irrigation pipe, the water went away. In fact, that same regulator from the Federal Government threatened to throw him in jail if he actually stopped that water from going into the navigable rivers, i.e., irrigation pipes of the United States. 
   The end result is that this old gentleman, who in his entire experience in working with the Federal Government I never heard him utter one swear word, although I did on many occasions, had his entire heritage regulated and controlled by, not taken, because that means the Federal Government would have had to pay him for it, instead, they regulated and controlled it. They told him what he could or could not do. They took away not only his heritage, but took away his pension. They also took away his pension and legacy for his children, and, yes, I am mad about that. 
   When this Congress passed the Clean Water Act, which has to be a wonderful act; no one would be opposed to the Clean Water Act, we did not intend to take Gene and ruin his life. But because the language was vague, we allowed government entities to interpret it their own way, and, in fact, we harmed that old gentleman. It's not what we intended to do. No one wanted to do it, but, nonetheless, that citizen was harmed. 
   We have already talked in the rule debate over one citizen who wanted out of this trail system, and by the fact she had enough money and time and determination, she was allowed to be exempt from that. Whether that is isolated or indicative of a greater situation is what we must be very careful of; otherwise, our good intentions will actually harm and hurt individuals, which is not what we should be doing. 
   We did have testimony coming in of other people who were in this same situation in this same area. The government should not be in the business of harming people. We should be in the business of protecting the little guy so that his home, his farm, his legacy is neither harmed by anything that we will do. Too many irregularities with government land have happened in the past to say that we can do anything less than making sure that our language in these types of bills is specific and direct as to what we intend to be the net product. If we say we want to save somebody's property, we don't want to take it, it must be specific and direct and say that; otherwise, like we had with the Clean Water Act, people can interpret it in a different way, and American citizens get harmed. 
   Mr. Chairman, under the pronouncement, the point that was made by Mr. Grijalva at the very beginning of his motion, I would like to submit letters into the Record indicative of individuals who have those same problems dealing with the Federal Government. It wasn't intended for them to be harmed, but they have been harmed and they have been harassed in like situations.     
   We have proposed several amendments which in all sincerity if adopted would make us happy with this bill, and we could support it in every sense of the word. 
   One of the issues deals with the concept of hunting and gun rights. Long in the 75-year-plus history of this trail, there has been a cooperative effort to make sure that those rights were not infringed and that local ordinance and local concerns would be the dominant factor. We want to make sure that that is very clear in this bill. It is the intent of the sponsor, but we insist that the verbiage has to be specific to make sure that that is never put into any  question or doubt by some future Congress, some future regulator, some future judge. 
   We will have an amendment also to be presented to do exactly that, to make sure that it is very clear that is our intent, that local law will take precedence. 
   We have said before that we are concerned about a potential eminent domain loophole within this bill. We are concerned about that, and at some time we will want to address that as we go through with this particular debate.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I would like to talk about one other potential problem with this particular bill. It is not really a problem, but it is a concern that needs to be addressed in some particular way. 
   We have talked a great deal over the past year about the concept of PAYGO.  This bill does not have a PAYGO concern; the committee said it did not because it does not specifically appropriate money. However, it does authorize the use of money, and in the bottom line from what people would be saying at the kitchen table, it costs money. 
   This bill will actually cost $2 million. Not a huge sum, kind of a rounding error in our government, but it is still $2 million. The money is not having to be offset under PAYGO earmarking accounting rules. However, it is still money that has to be spent, and it has to come from somewhere else. 
   Where it will come from is the Parks Department budget which will then take it from other projects. It is one of the spinoff effects every time we add a new measure that the Parks Department has to administer, has to pay for and has to run. That is one of the concepts that we have. 
   I mention that simply because we have crying needs in the Parks Department today. I would like to mention specifically this building. It is not in my district; it is Mr. Matheson's district in my State. But it is a brilliant building at Dinosaur National Monument. I went there with my kids. I have been there before several times with other kids. It is a wonderful opportunity for people to see bones exposed in the mountainside itself. It is a great learning experience with one problem: it is condemned. And we don't have the money in the parks system to fund it, to fix it. 
   This is one of those issues here. It is only $2 million for this trail. It is only a little more administrative responsibility and a little bit more land. But the problem we have is it comes from somewhere. It comes from these types of problems, these types of issues and determinations that need to be made. 
   Even though it doesn't have to be offset by PAYGO rules, it has to be funded somewhere and that is going to come out from other needs that are in the Park Service that will continue to be minimized as we expand the assets that this government has and we expand the programs that the Parks Department actually has to run. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I wish to address one last element of this particular bill. As I've said, it is my hope that with some of the amendments that can be passed or added, some modification, this can be a very, very good bipartisan bill. 
   There is one concern I have that I want to specifically address, and it's been talked around the edges by everyone, but it is the concept of eminent domain. I have said before, in the original remarks, that oftentimes as a government we do things not intending to actually harm people, but that's the net result. And unless we are crystal clear on the language that what we intend to do is what will happen, that sometimes, down the road, tends to be the net result, and I want to try to avoid this in this particular trail situation. 
   The National Park Service is unique in that it does have condemnation power. This is an amendment to the National Trails System Act. The condemnation power within that act is not modified in any way. The language is there. It stays. It's not terminated. It's not finished in some particular way. 
   It is the intent, I assume, and I believe of the sponsor of this legislation, that condemnation would not be used on any of the private lands within this trails system. I think he's very sincere and legitimate in that. That is our effort as well. But the text of the bill, the amendment to the total act, is not crystal clear as to that point. 
   What they have tried to do in the text of this bill is say that land, if it's going to be taken over by the park service, would have to come from willing sellers. That is an effort to try and stop the Federal Government from using the condemnation power to take over land. 
   The problem is, though, is the definition of ``willing seller'' sometimes gets murky as time goes on, and what is specifically not allowed in the bill, or not solved, not clearly stated in the bill is what I call the loophole. It's that even though the Federal Government would have to buy from only willing sellers, State and local governments would not. State and local governments could condemn the property, and then they could become the willing seller. And as the act encourages the National Park Service to accept or acquire property, that is a way around the concept of what we're talking about. And I don't think that's what the sponsor intended. I'm not trying to put words in his mouth. Clearly, by the testimony in front of the committee, I don't think that's what he intended. I don't think that's what the committee intended to see happen. I know that is what we fear, and I know we do not want that to be the concept taking place. What we need is very succinct and crystal clear language that said that no land will be accepted by the Federal Government if any of it was taken by the concept of eminent domain. So whether the Federal Government tries to use eminent domain or whether the State and local government uses eminent domain and then the State becomes the willing seller to give it to the Federal Government, that will not be a way our citizens will be treated in this trails system. That language is important to me. I think it's important to our side. That is what I talked about in the protection of the little guy who may not even know this is going to be imposed upon him. In this post-Kelo decision world, those kinds of concepts become important. If this issue was to be solved, it would be one of the things that I think would solve any other kind of acrimonious debate that would go forward. A couple of issues. This is one of the key ones. It's one of the important ones. And I bring that up because I know the language was put in there to prohibit the Federal Government from using eminent domain, but there is still a loophole, so the Federal Government could end up with land that had been condemned by the second party, which would be the State and the local governments. We should be very crystal clear that we do not wish to do that. 
   One of the amendments proposed to the Rules Committee said specifically that no land would be taken that had been acquired through eminent domain. That's one of our concepts. That's one of the principles. That's one, I think, of the elements that I think is significant. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I have every intention of saving the committee some time on this particular amendment. It is, I think, very straightforward. 
   In the 107th Congress a bill was passed that said there would be a study, a feasibility study based on this project. The gentleman from Massachusetts was the author of that piece of legislation. 
   Bottom line is the feasibility study has yet to be completed, period. This is simply a concept of regular order. What this says is that this trail will not be slowed down, but it will be enacted once we have gone through the process outlined before, regular order, and the feasibility study is finalized and presented. Then the trail would actually be enacted. It's an effort to try and maintain the standards and the process that we have established before. 
   With that, actually, Mr. Chairman, I will yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this particular amendment is one of the key concerns that we do have with this bill, that if it were solved would go a long way to satisfying our concerns with this particular bill. 
   It is one of the unique concepts that a power has been given to the National Park Service that is not given to the Bureau of Land Management or to the National Forest Service to regulate gun laws and hunting laws within their jurisdiction, even if it violates something that the local government in that jurisdiction would like to imply, something that happens to be different. 
   This trail, as we said, has been around for over 70 years, very efficiently and very effectively on private and state lands. And the argument that we made is that there is no reason that you should deny Park Service authority to curtail these activities because they're not going to get these activities or they're not going to get control of the land. 
   The problem is that there is a unique history on this trail of voluntary cooperation. That is not necessarily the same thing that takes place once the Federal Government takes ownership or the Federal Government takes administrative control of this particular trail. 
   The Park Service does have the authority to change the rules of local government. This is the language that's given in the bill. It is not modified by this particular act. Even though the intent may not be as we have heard to have the Federal Government take over property in this land, it is the intent of the management plan that is there. 
   If you look at the management plan, it talks about a blueprint for recommendations to utilize restrictive zoning, height restrictions, land acquisition easements, et cetera, et cetera, going through all sorts of other concepts. 
   This simply means this: this legislation authorizes and encourages the Federal Government, the Park Service, to gain land in the future in this trail system. Once the Park Service has gained control of that land, then Park Service rules and regulations which limit and restrict hunting rights and gun rights would take precedence over it. 
   There is also a unique concern that none of us really know the answer to. If the National Park Service is the administrator of these lands, do they actually have the ability of imposing the rules and regulations on these lands, whether they own it or not, which is something that today we may know the answer, but you cannot predict what will happen in the future with some legislator, some judge, some administrator somewhere along the line; and as I said very early in a concept of this particular bill, often times the Federal Government does things, and we don't intend to hurt people but we end up hurting people. 
   What this amendment clearly says is that along this trail we will protect what has historically been done for the last 70 years. But whether the Federal Government, the Park Service, in particular, has administrative control or whether they access and acquire land in the future, that local ordinances will take precedence, that local ordinance on hunting rights, on gun rights, on fishing rights, will be what will take precedence in this particular situation. 
   This to us is important. We want it to be crystal clear. But what I think everyone intends in this trail is in reality what happens both now and in the future. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, as we said at the very beginning of the discussion of this entire bill, there are some amendments that are made in an effort to slow down a bill or stop it from coming to passage. This is not one of those. That is why you will notice very carefully the verbiage here is ``forthwith.'' We want to try and fix the bill so it can go on with its process, not send it back to committee. 
   What I have in front of me here is the poster of the language that you find in the Trail Act itself. What we are debating is not the Trail Act. It's simply an amendment to the Trail Act, and in the act itself it says the appropriate Secretary may utilize condemnation to acquire private property without the consent of the owner. 
   That is the language about which we object. It would be nice if at some time we could actually go in and attack this language and perhaps solve the problem once and for all forever. But as the time is right now, this condemnation power is still in the act. It's still in the bill. It's still in the act. It is still out there as a potential and a possibility. We do not believe that the sponsor ever intended this to be the way of things. 
   But the bottom line is the National Park Service still has the ability of condemning. The Federal Government still has the ability of condemning. As we said before, the committee, the sponsor, tried to solve that problem by saying land will only be taken from a willing seller. That may deal, hopefully, with the Federal Government aspect, but the Federal Government has to take the land from a willing dealer, but it also leaves a loophole for some other entity to do condemnation powers. The State or local government could still condemn property, and then they would become the willing seller who could offer this land to the Federal Government. 
   Please remember, the Federal Government is empowered in this act and bill to acquire property. They are encouraged to acquire property coming from a willing seller. I don't have a problem with that, if the willing seller is truly a willing seller. 
   And so the motion to recommit tries to cover every potential in the future, with once again the concept being that you want to make sure that individuals will always be protected in every circumstance in the future, many of which we cannot predict. It would be nice if everyone was simply wonderful and courteous, but that's not the way the real world is. We have to make predictions and plans for the future to protect individuals. 
   This bill says the Federal Government may not acquire land from anything other than a willing seller, but it also says they cannot accept land that has been condemned, regardless of whether it comes from a willing seller. It prohibits State and local governments from doing an end-run from the purpose of this act and protects private property. 
   We told you before that one person was able to come here and say I don't want my property part of this bill because she had the financial resources and the time to come down here to Washington to lobby. She's exempt. That's right, it's fair. It's the right thing to do. The committee should be commended for that. 
   The question is, are there others in like circumstances? And in the committee testimony there are. What we just put in by unanimous consent, there are, and that is the concern. Our concern has to be for the little guy whose home, whose property, whose heritage, whose farm may be put in danger by an overzealous local government that uses condemnation power to try and expand the scope of this particular trail.     
   It is possible. And the language should be crystal clear that that may not be what we do. That may not be our concept. 
   If only one individual is harmed by this act because we do not close every potential loophole, that is one individual too many. Our goal should be, and must be, to ensure that wherever a possibility of a loophole exists, we will close that loophole, and that we will make sure that every potential to save somebody's property will be there, and that no opportunity to do a laundering of land and make an end run around the purposes and goals of this bill will be there. 
   The language in the motion to commit is crystal clear, that no land may be taken by any level of government for any reason to be used in this trail. In our post-Kelo world, it is important that we make sure that every word in this bill make sense; it is clear, it is precise, it is our goal, it is our purpose. That's what this does. It solves this problem. And it solves it in a way that makes this a very, very good bill. Without it, it's a huge loophole that could be used to harm people in the future. We can never do that. 
   Madam Speaker, whatever time I don't have, I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity in being here and talking on this particular bill. This is a day when we have dealt with some emergency measures in a very bipartisan way. I don't know if this is classified as an emergency measure, but it can be a bipartisan approach, too, depending on how we go from here on out. 
   I am grateful to the Rules Committee for taking my six amendments and approving two for the floor. This is a .333 batting average. It's enough to get me in the Hall of Fame. I'm at least above the Mendoza line, and I appreciate your doing that for me. 
   However, there are some amendments that really are bad amendments aimed at trying to scuttle a bill, aimed at putting shackles on the runner to prohibit him or her from getting to the finish line. The amendments that were proposed by Representative Flake and myself are not aimed to do that. They are aimed to take a bill and to improve a bill so they can be approved in a bipartisan way and take a bill and make it even better. 
   Let me assume that I can just talk for a moment on a couple of amendments that were not made in order. This trail covers the States of Massachusetts and Connecticut, but in reality the trail goes to New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut. Only two of those States are proposed in this particular bill and then a process allowed for New Hampshire to join later on. One of the amendments simply said, why don't you make the same process for all three States? It's not an effort to slow anything down. It's an effort to try to be rational in the approach to take place. I thought it was a significant and simple and straightforward amendment. 
   One of the things we always talk about is how important it is to have informed citizens and an informed citizenry. We had, for this particular bill, one specific property owner who did not wish her property to be included in the bill. At great expense to her, with a great deal of study and effort coming to Washington to lobby us, she was allowed by the committee to be exempt from this trail boundary line. I appreciate the committee's doing it. It was appropriate to do so. It's very positive on the part of the Natural Resources Committee to do so. 
   But the question that should be brought to mind is, was she an isolated situation, or was she indicative of a greater problem? Indeed, if you look at the record of the testimony, there are at least 40 other people that have the same question, the same concerns, the same approach. And so what we wanted to do is to make sure in one of our amendments that citizens were allowed to be notified that they would be now included in what before had been a voluntary trail system now into a federally mandated and regulated trail system. 
   And this is not an onerous task. We were told in committee that both the organizations that are currently managing this, as well as States, had a database of all the property owners in both Massachusetts and Connecticut, and they are already being mailed yearly. What would be the problem in including another paragraph in the yearly mailing saying, this is about to happen to you and if you don't like it, this is the process you can use to exempt yourself, or, even better, if you do want to be part of it, this is the process you could use to include yourself and your property? 
   Once again, that's not to stop the bill. It's simply a matter of making sure that everyone is clearly informed of what is about to take place, because in the history of trails, in the history of land issues in these United States, that has not always been the case, that every individual is informed of what is happening to him before it takes place. 
   I don't think, once again, that was an onerous request. It was unfortunate. I think it simply indicates that we should value the individual in our legislation, that we should say if even one person is going to be adversely affected and does not wish to be adversely affected, his home, his farm, his property should be held inviolate, and we should respect that. And that was the purpose of one amendment that was ruled out of order by the Rules Committee. Once again, I don't think it would have negatively harmed the bill. In fact, I think it would have moved the bill forward in a bipartisan manner. 
   We will talk a great deal about the concept of takings. No one who has talked about this bill wants takings to take place, wants property taken from an individual. We have heard that before. And yet in the attempt on the committee staff's part to protect individuals, there is a loophole. There is a huge loophole that will result in contradictions coming into the future. Those are some of the things we tried to put in order. And simply if you had taken that loophole out of the system and done what everyone says they want to do, we would have had a bill that all of us on this side of the aisle could have stood up and said, yes, this is a bill that we all had our input on and we are all prepared to move forward on the bill. 
   It could have moved forward in the same bipartisan manner, hopefully even a bigger bipartisan manner, than the other two emergency pieces of legislation we handled today, as well as the LSU resolution, which we also did in a bipartisan way, except for the people from Ohio. 
   Let me, at last, very briefly, re-echo what Mr. Dreier said about the Flake amendment, the so-called earmark amendment. By definition this bill does not have earmarks. That's because the committee said it didn't. By definition this bill doesn't have a PAYGO question, because the committee said it didn't. But, indeed, right after we had the State of the Union and the President talked about earmarks and the Speaker talked about earmarks, the minority talked about earmarks, we have the first authorization bill coming before us with two organizations, the Appalachian Mountain Club, the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, specifically mentioned as being eligible for grants given to them by the Federal Government, and then the language goes on and says ``or other groups,'' I think ``groups'' or ``associations.'' Had you simply taken out the specific names of the two organizations and simply allowed it to be the other groups, any group could apply for these 
   grants and the leadership in this particular one, it would have solved all of the problem. And that's what Mr. Flake was trying to say. It wouldn't have prohibited them from being in the management position on this trail, but it would have simply made it a clear and open process without giving an earmark to these two organizations. That's all that needs to be taken. 
   Once again, these amendments that we presented were not in an effort to kill the bill, to slow it down, to make  sure it does not pass. They were in an effort to try to make sure that we took some of the areas which we think are a little rough, smoothed them over, and gave us some protections for the future that we could feel comfortable, as the Republican side, in joining with our Democratic colleagues to move this bill forward and understand that many of the things we are concerned about, protecting the individual, protecting the process that we go through, to ensure that those things are included in the bill before it leaves this body. It would have been a chance to show real bipartisan support for this concept going forward. 
   Hopefully, we will still have some debate on the amendments that were made in order, maybe some other issues that we can once again show the ability of this body to come together and make sure that a bill that everyone can support goes forward as opposed to one that seems to be skewed in one direction or the other. 
   With that, I appreciate the time being yielded to me.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. You are 1 out of 435. But one of the current senior Democrat chairmen 20 years ago wrote that if I let you write substance and you let me write procedure, I will win every time. Actually, he didn't use quite those words, but I don't think the actual verbiage can be used with the rules of our House. But it is the same sentiment that has to be there. 
   Poor procedure has been said creates poor policy. And the ranking member has already said there have been more closed rules, fewer minority Members' rules allowed this year than ever before. 
   I was in the Education Committee when Representative Ehlers made his amendment, accepted by the chairman on a voice vote; and yet, when the bill came out of the Rules Committee, the amendment had magically disappeared, a bill that affected my State in redistricting. 
   Mr. Gohmert from Texas had made an excellent amendment in the Judiciary Committee, but when that bill came out of the Rules Committee, once again that amendment had basically simply disappeared. 
   I realize the Rules Committee is a political type of committee, but it is coming to the point right now when someone says, ``Well, you better go make your case before the Rules Committee,'' you simply abandoned all hope. It is like being on the Titanic and being told that the ship coming to rescue you is the Lusitania.  
   I have been on the Rules Committee, as has been said. I have been chairman of a rules committee in Utah. And I realize that more than just simply moving legislation, the committee should try and find bipartisan solutions; should make sure that we spend time in debate on the floor vetting issues that were not covered in committee, especially when so many bills are being written by the Rules Committee.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON RULES -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. The amendments I have actually brought to the Rules Committee were, in my estimation, trying to produce a bipartisan approach, or in dealing especially with one that impacted my State of Utah, an amendment that we were trying to talk about a bill that had been changed significantly in the Rules Committee from what had been discussed in the committee, but trying to do amendments that would have saved my State millions of dollars and allowed us to have the flexibility of creating the process that we wanted to have. Both Mr. Cannon and I presented those in Rules. All of them were totally shut down. 
   The Rules, there is a little bit more to that. Allow me to quote once again from an issue that happened about 20 years ago when a Speaker of the House was forced to resign in a very partisan atmosphere. He said, all year, partisanship had fed on itself, frustrating each side, driven each side apart. The majority at that time, the Democrats, were looking at the majority. The majority group contemptuous of it, the minority, more determined to govern in spite of it, more arbitrary and faced with increasing arbitrariness of the majority, the minority grew more irresponsible and more destructive of the institution. 
   The Rules Committee has a function more than just establishing the parameters of what amendments will be discussed and the debate. They have a responsibility to establish an atmosphere, indeed, a tone, on the floor. And they can either fan the flames of partisanship or they can build a process that encourages bipartisanship and encourages discussion of issues, issues that have not been vetted before on the floor. That is what the Rules Committee should be doing, and I am sad to say it has not been in evidence so far this year on the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CONGRATULATING MARIA CONTRERAS ON BECOMING A UNITED STATES CITIZEN -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, as we begin our debate here in this country on the issue of immigration, I think it is important that we remind ourselves of the literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of immigrants who obeyed the law and who entered this country the right way. 
   I rise today to speak of one such individual who is illustrative of the many immigrants that we openly welcome into this country. I wish to speak about one of my newest constituents, one of the newest citizens in this country, Maria Contreras. 
   Maria was born in Michoacan, Mexico, and entered this country legally 14 years ago. Three years after that she met and married her husband, also a legal immigrant, and to this union has been blessed two beautiful daughters, one 11, one a year and a half. About 4 years into the marriage, Maria's husband became a citizen of the United States. It was he that insisted and encouraged Maria to go on that same path. 
   A couple of years ago this couple bought a home on a quiet street in a northern Utah city, Brigham City. They went to work on the yard, planting flowers, trimming the trees in the back. They worked on the home doing some painting, repairing the roof. Both of them did this work after putting in a full day at their regular occupation. They even brought back souvenirs for their neighbors from their family trips. I know their neighbors in Brigham City found this family to be a pleasure and a welcomed addition to the neighborhood, and I can say this because the Contreras family is my next door neighbors. We share the same driveway. 
   It was a thrill for me one day while working in the yard to have Maria and her daughter come over and ask me some questions about government as she was now studying for her citizenship test. 
   On January 27 of this year, this test was administered to her in her second language of English. I am proud to say she passed it perfectly, getting 100 percent correct on this particular test. Many of my students I taught in high school, taking that same test in their native language, would be hard-pressed to have that same kind of score. In fact, it is probably wise that Members of Congress are not administered that same particular test as well. 
   On March 21, 2007, a great day for the Contreras family, Maria was sworn in as a new citizen of the United States. Maria did it the legal way, and as we talk about ways of limiting illegal entrance into this country, it is important also to remember that we should be mindful of ways of making it easier for people to legally enter into this country as well. 
   The Contreras people have the kind of entrepreneurial spirit that we want to welcome into this country, that builds this country and makes it better for all of us. As Maria said, It is great to be here. I love it here. It is a better life with more opportunities. 
   So I am very pleased today, Madam Speaker, to welcome a great neighbor, a new American, hopefully I can convince her to be a voter, because I am very proud of the price she paid to do things the right way, to become a new citizen in this new land. I congratulate Maria Contreras and the entire family as they enter into this new situation and for what they have done and the commitments that they have made. I am very proud of them all.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3473 and again yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This, along with Chairman Rahall's bill, are the two brilliant bills of this particular package. I can't say more. On behalf of my constituents who reside in Bountiful, Utah, I express my appreciation for the consideration of this bill today. It has been a long time in coming. My office has been involved in negotiations with the city, as well as the United States Forest Service, for the last 3 years. 
   For nearly 20 years, the City has commenced and called off multiple attempts to exchange this land administratively, primarily due to change in personnel within the local office in Utah. That is why we are doing this legislatively now. 
   We finally have before us, I think, a direct land exchange which does several things. It increases the equal value exchange between Bountiful and the United States Forest Service. Bountiful City will give 1,600-plus acres to the Forest Service. The Forest Service will exchange part of a 220-acre parcel that is in the city limits, balance their contiguous area, and also has the ability of protecting a gun range, which is extremely important in that particular area, a shoreline trail, and the Davis Aqueduct within Davis County.  
   This bill allows for a process to move forward to allow the Forest Service to deal with any lands not consumed by this exchange. My goal in drafting this bill is not to create a long-term management issue, either for Bountiful or the Forest Service. I believe this bill accomplishes both the letter and the spirit of that particular goal. 
   I also wish to express my appreciation for the many staff hours which have gone into this particular bill. I also express appreciation to city officials in Bountiful for their patience, their willingness to work in good faith with our office, as well as the United States Forest Service, and especially the majority staff on our committee. 
   It is a good bill, and it does move the process of dealing with these particular land exchanges forward. It makes it easier to manage for both the Forest Service as well as the City of Bountiful. I urge passage of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   H.R. 816 seeks to protect the citizens of Clark County, Nevada, from floods by releasing 65 acres from Sunrise Mountain Wilderness Study Area. This is a critical need for one of the fastest growing areas of the United States. Title to the land will remain with the Bureau of Land Management. I would strongly encourage BLM to act expeditiously in granting Clark County a right-of-way to this acreage so the flood control operations can start soon.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (COMMENTS ON THE CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, it is this time as we end a week of discussion and debate and we all leave to reconnect with our constituents and find out from the real people of America what we have actually done here that we have a time to sit back and contemplate the significant questions that will be brought to us next week, probably the greatest of which is simply will the Republicans continue to win the congressional baseball game. 
   But at this time in this weekend, I am joined tonight by Congressman Garrett of New Jersey, who is the Chairman of the Constitutional Caucus, who wisely thought that this would be a good time for us to take a  moment and discuss once again the significance and importance of the Constitution as we come to this end of this section of our legislative year. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once said he understood there were those people who believe that there should not be a strict adherence to the words or intent of the words of the Constitution. But, he wrote, you would have to be an idiot to believe that. 
   The Constitution is not a living organism. It is a legal document. It says some things and doesn't say other things. The Constitution is a piece of paper that has words, but each of those words have a meaning. 
   I was once watching an episode of Fawlty Towers, obviously a very old one, and it is one in which John Cleese is trying in vain to talk to his waiter Manuel from Barcelona, who doesn't speak English very well, and in contempt he finally walks away and says, ``Say Goodnight, Gracie.'' 
   Now, my students in school never understood what that line, ``Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' meant. As I was talking to them or other audiences, you would have to be around my age to remember the old George Burns and Gracie Allen routines in which every tagline of one of their routines was simply, ``Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' which had the effect of implying that Gracie Allen was probably the most ditziest, dumbest blonde ever produced. 
   Now, oddly enough, my students understood the phrase ``dumb blond.'' They don't understand the phrase, ``Say Goodnight, Gracie.'' 
   We all have certain cue words which create larger meanings in the mind of the hearer. Those words have meaning based on the usage of time. The Founding Fathers who wrote the Constitution also had cue words that they used to expand the meaning of what they meant. 
   One of the things I am happy about is the academic community seems of late to take a great deal more interest in the words of the Constitution and defining and understanding what they actually meant at the time. 
   I had a college professor who used to say the Founding Fathers had baggage that they took with them, which meant there were common concepts they brought together and they understood. 
   One of them, for example, is they all had read and understood Aristotle. Aristotle loved to divide everything up into categories. He divided up governments into a category of the government of one, a government of the few, a government of the many, and he said that each of those breakdowns could have a government that is good or bad, simply depending on the attitude of the ruling group. And he gave them all names. A government of one, for example, that he said was good, he defined as a monarchy. So in the 1780s, if you claimed someone was a monarch, that was a compliment. 
   The government of one that was bad that had bad intentions, he gave the term of a tyrant or a tyranny. It is not a coincidence that a decade earlier when Thomas Jefferson is writing the Declaration of Independence, that of all the terms he can use to describe King George, he used the word ``tyrant.'' It had a cue meaning to it which ticked up a whole bunch of other ideas in the mind of the reader or the hearer. 
   It is the same way when the Federalists decided to criticize Jefferson, they called him a Jacobite. You cannot understand the significance of that insult unless you have a deeper understanding of the meaning of what happened in the French Revolution. The words have specific meanings and specific attitudes. 
   Akhil Amar wrote a wonderful book exploring the historical context of the words used in the Constitution. Much of what I am going to say is based on many of his works and his research. I would like to take just the preamble of the Constitution to try and illustrate what that is talk about. 
   You see, I thought Gouverneur Morris and the committee who wrote the Preamble to the Constitution at the very end of the Constitutional Convention were merely putting something in there to add some kind of literary flair to the document itself. And even though these words don't have the same status as statute, these majestic words give us a window to see into the minds of those who actually framed our republican form of government. 
   It starts off with the phrase ``We the people of the United States.'' Now, whether intentional or not, it began with the concept of empowering people. And earlier drafts started off with ``We the people of,'' and then it listed each and every individual State. Politically, that would have been unwise if indeed one of those states had eventually not ratified the document, which they thought could easily happen, because, after all, Rhode Island wasn't even there. 
   But by changing it to ``We the people of the United States,'' it is more than just a political maneuver, it is a fundamental mindset of the Convention delegates. This Constitution goes full circle. It starts off by talking about the people and ends with Article 7, which is a new way of ratifying the constitutional document, which is a relatively contemporary concept of having a ratifying convention elected by the people. A new concept of republican democracy. 
   So this document starts and ends with the commitment to the faith in the people. The Constitution doesn't pander to governments, but rather is aimed at empowering the people of this United States who indeed empower this government at the same time. 
   The Founding Fathers never intended to amend the Articles of Confederation. They realized to do so would take unanimous consent, and since Rhode Island wasn't there in fact it would never happen. In fact, 2 years earlier New York had vetoed a new financial management amendment. That act in and of itself had done much to spur the call for a new Convention to try and solve the problem. Because the Articles of Convention truly was a treaty between sovereign states and the national government. 
   This was something that was going to be different. It was going to be different to solve the problem by forming a more perfect union. 
   Now, once again, I always thought that the phrase ``in order to form a more perfect union'' was simply in opposition to the less perfect union under the Articles of Confederation. But it meant something so much more than that. It implied that they were leaving the treaty to join the new supreme law of the land. And ratification specifically denoted leaving the commitment of a flawed treaty to a commitment of a new supreme law of the land. 
   The anti-Federalists got that point. They debated it. They lost the argument. They lost the vote. Confederates did not get that in the Civil War time. 
   Abraham Lincoln actually was wrong about it as well. When he gave the Gettysburg Address, he talked about an indivisible Nation that started four score and seven years ago. That was a reference back to 1776 and the Declaration of Independence. To be accurate, he should have said three score and 15 years ago was when we became an individual nation, because that was the ratification of the Constitution of the United States. 
   There is more to that phrase that Gouverneur Morris meant than simply glossing over once again. This phrase, ``a more perfect union,'' is a specific reference to the 1707 Act of Unification between England and Scotland. The words say ``the union of two kingdoms more active and complete.'' In fact Queen Anne referred to it all the time as her ``more perfect union.'' 
   You see, the attitude of the mindset at the time was they believed the progeny of landed borders was always armies. So they looked at the time when England, Scotland and even Wales were individual countries with land borders and each had an army to offset the other, which meant eventually they would use that army one against the other, and if they were not using it to disturb the peace of the island, than a tyrannical king was probably using it to destroy the liberties of his individual people. 
   Once they formed the more perfect union of England, Scotland and Wales together, the relative quiet of the United Kingdom was in contrast as they looked across the English Channel to Europe, which still had individual borders and was still engaged in border wars and subjection of the individual liberties of their individual citizens. 
   So what we consider to be incomprehensible, the idea that Massachusetts might raise an army for some of their indigenous people, and that New York  would respond by raising an Army just in case Massachusetts doesn't stay with their own indigenous people, and Virginia might raise an army then because all three of them claim the same lands in the West. What we thought of as incomprehensible was an actual fear at the time. 
   And they had an option, they will had an option of either eliminating that, or becoming like Europe. They could either be like Europe, with multiple boundaries and all the problems associated with it, or become like the United Kingdom in a more perfect union, eliminating that threat for evermore. And, more significantly, not just bringing peace to the continent, but also providing the protection and preservation of the individual liberties. 
   It is significant the Founding Fathers had a fear of armies. They limited the army to two years. It had to be dissolved. They didn't do the same thing to navies, because a navy boat could not chase you down the street and beat you up--Armies could. The idea of a citizen army is something that comes about in the French Revolution. That hasn't happened for a decade yet. 
   So armies at this time were mercenaries who were not necessarily sympathetic to the people they were supposed to be defending. In fact, the British army that came over here to defeat us and defend the British was actually hired Germans. 
   So the idea in here was an Army was not necessarily nice to people. The militia were the citizens, and those were the ones who were going to be important. Armies were foreigners. Militias were your neighbors. Giving primarily defense of the country to a militia made sense. Allowing a militia, in reality the people, to be armed made sense. An armed citizenry as a check to a potential political abuse made sense. Thinking of the modern National Guard as the same as a 1788 militia when we talk about the Second Amendment makes no sense because we don't understand the meaning of the words. 
   Lincoln also understood this concept of more perfect union when he talked about the Civil War. If the South was successful, even though this was a horrible war, at a high cost and greatly criticized by the intelligentsia at the time, he predicted that if the Civil War was successful for the South, it would not be the Civil War that created the South, but the beginning in a series of wars between the North and the South over regional boundaries and regional issues. 
   This Constitution also establishes justice. The Founding Fathers considered justice lacking on both the national and the State level, and they invented the checks and balances system of Federalism to counteract that. 
   If we truly understand what it means to establish justice, we have to understand the Framers hope to curb the excesses of the State governments, just the way patriots today have to curb the excesses of our national government. So Federalism means we forget the concept of establishing justice. 
   ``To ensure domestic tranquility'' was not only a reference to Shay's Rebellion, but was also the concept that Revolutionary War veterans marched on Philadelphia to get their money from the Articles of Confederation Congress and both Philadelphia and Pennsylvania refused to provide protection, one is of the reasons they insisted on having this place, a Federal District, so they could ensure the domestic tranquility. 
   And the next phrase is ``to promote the general welfare.'' Mr. Speaker, at this time we sometimes have a combination, I think, or conception, conception today, that promoting the general welfare is a door to open up to national involvement in all sorts of areas. 
   I think if you look at the actual words, it was quite the opposite. ``General welfare'' was a term of limiting qualifications, not expanding them. 
   With that in mind at this stage of the preamble, I would like to yield to the Chairman of the Constitutional Caucus, the good gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett, to talk about the concept of promoting general welfare.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (COMMENTS ON THE CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - June 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate being able to put the phrase, ``promoting the general welfare,'' into a constitutional perspective, as well as a historical perspective. It is true that Madison and Monroe, both as Presidents, vetoed road construction projects because they only benefited the vicinity of the road, not the general welfare. 
   It's true that the City of Savannah suffered a horrendous fire; and even though people wanted to give money for it, the rebuilding of Savannah, Congress refused because it wasn't the general welfare. 
   Obviously, as Mr. Garrett has said, starting with the New Deal era, we changed our view of what these words mean, so that most times, most politicians today just assume Federal involvement is exactly what was intended. 
   It also says that when these guys wrote the elastic clause of article I, section 8, they must have had a vastly different and a much more limited view on what was the power entailed than modern policymakers or scholars do. 
   The last phrase of the preamble is that we do ordain and establish. It's an appropriate benediction to the preamble. It's a phrase that brought to the 1780 mind the creation found in the Book of Genesis, for religious vocabulary at the time spoke of God ordaining and creating the Earth, as comparison to the Founding Fathers who ordained and established this new government. These men in a very real and reverent sense created a new country. 
   We pass laws almost every week that we either make incorrect assumptions about the meaning of the Founders' words, or we simply ignore them as no longer relevant to our time. 
   Justice Scalia also once again said about the Constitution: ``What it meant when it was adopted it means today, and its meaning doesn't change just because we think that meaning is no longer adequate to our times.'' 
   My students not understanding ``Say goodnight, Gracie'' was simply an annoyance, excusable because they're young, and their view is a tennis player trying to decide whether to date a 20-year-old or a 40-year-old is great television. But for Congress not to understand the meaning of the words of the Constitution is irresponsible, it's inexcusable, and it's dangerous. 
   Let me yield to one last comment to the chairman of the Constitution Caucus.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here and I am grateful to the gentleman from New Jersey for allowing me to have some time here. 
   You know, when we come into this Chamber and we look around, there are cameos of the great lawgivers of the world all around us. There is Moses to Hammurabi, even Napoleon over there in the corner. It is interesting, there are only two Americans in this pantheon of great lawgivers, Thomas Jefferson and George Mason, ironically neither of whom signed the Constitution. 
   Of those two, Mason is, as the gentleman from New Jersey said, clearly the most interesting. He is one of three people who was at the entire Constitutional Convention, and then at the end refused to give his assent to the actual document because it did not contain a Bill of Rights. 
   I would like to talk for just a second about the other members of that convention who did not agree to add this Bill of Rights, because one must ask why were great patriots like Washington, Franklin, Madison, Hamilton, Dickinson, Wilson, why did they refuse to join with a Bill of Rights? Were they opposed to civil liberties? It is pretty obvious they were not. 
   But what they said is a fear that the Bill of Rights, that actually if you start listing what those rights are, it may be a ceiling of what rights are allowed as opposed to a floor of what rights are going to be guaranteed. Actually, the Bill of Rights is misnamed. It should be called the ``Bill of Wrongs.'' It is a list of things that it is wrong for the Federal Government to do, no matter how many people actually want to do it. 
   In their concern though, they were still concerned about civil liberties. They had an additional plan to do that, which was a structural guarantee of the rights of citizens. We call it today federalism. It was a means to defend the individual liberties of Americans. 
   They realized that increasing the number of competitors to power was as effective as listing the things that would be prohibited for the government to do. As Madison said, ambition would counteract ambition. 
   They had two ways of looking at it. The horizontal separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, which, unfortunately, is what we only spend our time teaching in schools today. But equally important to them was a vertical separation of powers between a national government and a State government. 
   The fear, obviously, was that the Federal Government would not check itself, so the 50 States would be the perfect counterbalance to a national government. 
   Justice Scalia in Mack v. The United States once said the Constitution protects us from our own best intentions. It divides power among sovereigns and among branches of government precisely so we may resist the temptation to concentrate power in one location as an expedient solution to the crisis of the day. 
   Power with no check historically resulted in tyranny, and no government was out of the potential of doing that; however, balance of power and limitations of governments would result in the support of individual civil liberties. 
   In Federalist 51, Madison said, ``Experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.'' That was the structure he was talking about, separation of powers, federalism. 
   In Federalist 45, Madison again wrote, ``The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.'' That was the plan. 
   In Federalist 32, Hamilton continued to say that ``under the plan of the convention, States retained the authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense, and that attempt on the part of the national government to abridge any State power would be a violent assumption of power unwarranted by any article or clause of the Constitution.'' 
   Unfortunately, today our national government has grown out of the bounds originally established. Often by good intent, often by misguided compassion for people, which eventually actually ends up hurting far more than it ever intended to help. As P.J. O'Rourke once wrote, the history of government is not how Washington works, but how to make it stop. 
   We understood in the Bill of Rights, when they were listed, a couple of unique concepts. The Bill of Rights always talked about how Congress may make no law to inhibit the rights of an individual. Other countries had bills of rights. The USSR Constitution did also have a bill of rights which contained guarantees of free speech. But, as they said, in order to produce a socialist state, citizens of the USSR are guaranteed freedom of speech, et cetera.     
   Now, there is a difference. In the USSR constitution, the freedom of speech was granted by the government and therefore could be taken back by the government, as opposed to the way we are looking at it as rights inherent in individuals. 
   Now, when the Bill of Rights was actually established, there were 10 Bills of Rights. I want you to know that when they did that, they did not forget this concept of a structural balance of power, both horizontally and vertically, as the foundation for ensuring the civil liberties. And that is why  they did the 10th amendment. The 10th amendment clearly says that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by its States are reserved to the States respectively or to the people. 
   Jefferson called this 10th amendment the bedrock of constitutional government. These are the words that are significant and important, and we must remind ourselves. 
   Congress passes laws almost on a weekly basis. Sometimes we make incorrect assumptions about the meaning the Founding Fathers had on the words, or we simply ignore those words as looking as if they were irrelevant to our time. Justice Scalia once again wrote about the Constitution, ``What it meant when it was adopted, it means today. And its meaning doesn't change just because we think that meaning is no longer adequate to our times.'' 
   That also applies to the words in the Bill of Rights: What it meant at its time of adoption, it still means today, and it doesn't change in the period of time and simply because our assumptions may wish to change. 
   I was once in a conversation with another history teacher. She asked, how do we know what they originally thought when they were writing these words? And it was very simple: We study history. 
   It may be that I am an old history teacher and I am kind of biased about this; but when we fail to study the history of this country and, more importantly, when we fail to study the history of our government, the history of this document, we fail to understand what they meant by those words, and then we replace our own definition. We use our own wit to try and come up with what it should be and oftentimes we fail in understanding what made this country great or what we need to do to truly honor the Constitution and the Bill of Rights that are there. 
   One of the things we need to do most definitely in this country is take the time and effort to ensure that we read the documents, that we understand the documents, and we put them in their historical connotation. That is the way we preserve and secure them. 
   I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas who has a unique approach here, one of the things we may do to try to remind us, even those of us who were elected to this body, that maybe it is time to review and know the history of this document and these documents so we understand what the words mean and how the words should be applied in our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentlewoman from North Carolina expressing her comments about the Bill of Rights and the significance of the ninth and 10th amendments. 
   I would now like to concentrate on a couple of other bills that are in the Bill of Rights. Perhaps the second amendment. As we talked earlier, it is very important for us to understand and know the meaning of the words. 
   The preamble of the Constitution talks about a more perfect union, which is a terribly ungrammatical saying. You can be perfect, but you can't be more perfect. What we don't realize is that this is a term of art historically used. ``More perfect union'' was the concept of the union of England, Scotland and Wales, where all of a sudden their defense was based on a navy, not necessarily on armies. 
   It is interesting in our Constitution we prohibit an army from lasting any longer than 2 years, for specific reasons.     
   Armies, at that time, were mercenary units. When one thought of the army, they thought of mercenaries. When the British were fighting us in the Revolutionary War, they didn't send British over here. They sent German Hessians over here for us. 
   The concept was for an army, when it was not attacking foreign countries, a tyrant could use the army to attack his own people and there would be no remorse since they were not necessarily of the same nationality. The idea of a popular army does not come until the French Revolution, and that's still a couple of decades away. 
   So when we talk about the militia, at that particular period of time the militia meant the people. Army was a mercenary; militia was individuals who were, by definition, to be a balance in the power against the government. 
   When Madison wrote that all members, all Americans should be in the militia, and all Americans should be able to have a gun and know how to use a gun, he was making reference to that historical concept. 
   When one looks at the second amendment today, they have to realize that the word militia was a reference to the people. 
   With that, I would like to yield some time now to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Broun) who has a few comments specifically about the second amendment which I think is very apropos as we're talking about the Bill of Rights today.

   This legislation authored by our colleague from Nevada (Mr. Heller) seeks to resolve the water claims associated with the Duck Valley Reservation in Nevada. This bill has undergone many changes. It reflects intense but good faith negotiations between the administration and staff on both sides of the aisle. 
   The Democratic bill manager is correct in stating there is a need for consistency in waiver language, and while this bill's waiver language has been resolved for now, we have received commitments from the Democrats that  they will work together on applying consistent waiver language in all Indian water right settlements in the next Congress.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, again, one of the things that has changed over the past 30 years is we've had the same policies that have brought us to the situation in which we are today. It is the pain that people have faced at the gas pumps. It has been one of those things that has been a shocking realization. The road on which we have been traveling for over 30 years is a road that is simply not working. Sometimes there are people who, unfortunately, are happy with the pain that Americans are going through at the pumps today. 
   There was a former mayor of one of the major cities in Utah who did not like the fact that people were not living in his jurisdiction and were living across the county line. In an effort to punish them, he tried to insist that every effort to try and build more infrastructure and roads be hammered at every venue, at every opportunity. It looked at least from my side of that line as if it were punishment for actually deciding to live where you would want to live. 
   I talked once at length at a television and radio interview about the issue that we have with energy and about the problems that people are facing with the energy crisis that we have right now. One of the callers called in and said, you know, what we need to do is to simply have more commuter rail service. Now, I don't quibble with that caller, because he's right. We need to have more commuter rail. That's one of the solutions that we have, but having more commuter rail lines does not solve the problem of the farmer who has to fill his tractor with diesel. 
   For one of the farmers in my community, every time he fills up that tractor, it's $600 just to fill up one tractor. That is $600 for which he doesn't get reimbursed at the end of the week by putting in a voucher to his employer. It is $600 he has to eat until the end of the growing season when he may or may not receive money back for the sale of the goods that he produces. 
   Commuter lines are great, but they don't help the trucker who still has to bring those products to market. Ninety-five percent of everything we consume comes to a store by way of truck, and commuter rail lines don't stop at grocery stores. Those truckers still have to be able to have the fuel necessary to bring the food to market. We sometimes forget there is a whole segue that is involved in this particular issue of our energy crisis and that everybody isn't part of it. It's in part of the agriculture that we need. It's in part of the trucking industry that we need. It's in part of the pain that people feel at the pump. 
   Those people who are looking at what is coming out of their pockets week after week don't want us simply coming back here and talking about a highfalutin energy policy. It's not an energy policy to them. It is the way they cook their food. It is the way they heat their homes. It's whether they have a job or not. The pain at the pump is what people are feeling right now, but come this winter, there's going to be pain as the prices of heating their homes will increase by 20 to 30 percent. 
   So far, the only solution this Congress seems to want to do to address that situation is to try to increase welfare payments or LIHEAP payments in some way rather than to go to the root cause of that problem, which is 30 years of mismanagement that we have had that brings us to this particular situation. 
   It also means that food prices will be increasing because it is so much more difficult for the farmers to produce that food, for the processors to process that food, for the truck drivers to deliver that food. All of those are going to come as crisis after crisis after crisis if we do not address a comprehensive, all-of-the-above energy policy and do it now. For every week that we delay, we delay and continue on with the pain that real people are facing out there in America, and we are turning this country almost into a second class society. 
   I had a principal once who was in the military before he went to education, and he always used to answer many of my requests with the old military phrase ``rank has its privileges.'' It is true. Rank has privileges. That's why, in class, I was able to drink a Dr. Pepper and my students could not, because rank had privileges. That's why I get to park in the Cannon building parking garage and my staff does not. Rank has privileges. Some people are able to write bills in the secrecy of their offices and to bring them directly to the floor because rank has privileges. Some people are able to establish an agenda here even though 136 Republicans came back here during the recess time and spoke on that floor, asking, begging, demanding that different types of votes be allowed to take place on this floor. It happens because rank has privileges. In addition to privileges, rank also has responsibilities, and part of the responsibility has to be to solve the real problem that real Americans are facing. 
   When the Members met in Philadelphia to do their Constitution, a document we'll be celebrating in a couple of days, they were sent there to make minor adjustments to the Articles of Confederation, but they recognized that some of the States that had sent their instructions had also told them to go beyond that to solve the problem. What they decided was essential, not because it was what literally was put in front of them as their responsibilities, but what was essential to meet the needs of the people was to solve the problem. 
   If we fail in this Congress to bring an all-of-the-above solution to the floor that is a real solution to real problems, we fail in our responsibility to Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I agree with everything that Ms. Bordallo just said in her comments, that we should have an energy policy that comes in a deliberative fashion, which means that the bills should be allowed to have committee process. They should be allowed to have public hearings. They should be allowed to have an open rule so that Members can amend them in committee or here on the floor. That is the deliberative process. Those are the rules that these people try to establish. That's the concept of the rules that these people try to establish so that we can go through this process. 
   Everything she said is exactly accurate, except we're not going to do that. We're going to have a bill written in secret and unveiled on the floor. And if it, by chance, has an open rule, I'll be the very first one to be surprised and will probably apologize.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (ENSURING CONTINUED ACCESS TO STUDENT LOANS ACT EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - September 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6889, a bill to extend the authority of the Secretary of Education to purchase guaranteed student loans for an additional year. And I do want to thank my friends, the senior Republicans, Mr. McKeon and Mr. Keller, as well as the two significant chairmen, Mr. Miller and Mr. Hinojosa, who introduced this extension. 
   We have been reading about the instability that still exists in the credit markets, and, in fact, it has gotten worse. Through this extension, Congress is assuring students and families that they will be able to receive the Federal assistance they need to pay for school. 
   The steps in the underlying bill are modest, but they make a real difference for students and families. I appreciate that this bill carries no cost to taxpayers, proving that we can use a creative approach to respond to economic difficulties without bloated spending that will drive up taxes. 
   Since the implementation of H.R. 5715, we have seen at least 10 lenders take advantage of the program that has been put in place. Without this relief, these lenders could have dropped out of the program altogether. Up until this point, we have seen over 6,000 employees laid off as a result of the cutbacks lenders have had to make. In addition, 106 lenders have suspended their lending service as a result of the credit crunch and the cuts made in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. Without this extension, students could attend college this year without knowing whether the financing would be there to attend college next year. 
   In difficult economic times, many Americans turn to higher education. That's because a college degree continues to be one of the single best investments an individual, and our Nation, can actually make. College graduates have higher lifetime earnings, lower unemployment rates, greater civic involvement, and exhibit numerous other qualities that help enrich our society and keep our Nation competitive. 
   With all the benefits of higher education, it's concerning that amid these economic uncertainties many current and prospective students are worried about whether they will be able to access student loans. And as more and more students look to higher education to help get them through these difficult economic times, we cannot allow market turbulence to limit college access. 
   This extension signals our unwavering support for the Nation's largest source of financial aid, the Federal Family Education Loan Program. It is a crucial step that will help protect students and families and restore market confidence. 
   Mr. Chairman, I know how important it is that higher education be made affordable and accessible. This is particularly important in our turbulent economy. For the same reason, it's important that we come together to pass an all-of-the-above energy reform package that will help bring down prices and free us from our costly dependence on foreign oil. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that stabilizing our loan program will have an economic positive yield, just as solving the real problems of energy will have an economic yield. Our energy prices and energy problems are not just affecting those who stop at the pump, they affect those who will be trying to heat their homes this winter; they affect those who will be trying to buy food; they affect not just commuters, but all of us. Students as well as parents need real solutions to the energy crisis that is confronting us. They need to be able to make the commute. They need to be able to make those heating payments. They need to realize the cost of food will not keep spiraling upwards simply because farmers cannot afford energy to put into their tractors to grow the food and truckers cannot afford the energy to take that produce and send it to the markets where we can then buy it and enjoy it.  
   We have to realize that the solution to this problem has to be an all-of-the-above approach, that we are not doing enough to encourage conservation by small business or by citizens. But even if we did the maximum amount of conservation efforts, that still does not solve the entire problem. It's estimated that if the most stringent efforts of conservation were put in place, only about half of the foreign imports that we bring into this country would be eliminated; the other half would still have to be there. 
   We also have not done enough over the last few years to put in infrastructure so that we can move energy from one part of this country to the other. There are bottlenecks all over this country in which energy cannot take place. There is plenty of pipeline for natural gas going from the Gulf of Mexico up north, but it cannot get to New England because there is a bottleneck that we have yet to solve in that particular problem. That infrastructure problem needs to be addressed. The lack of refinery capacity needs to be addressed. The lack of electrical corridors needs to be addressed. 
   We also have to recognize that we do not have a successful payment plan for alternative energies for the future, not only for our immediate problems, but for the long-term problems of this particular country. We need to recognize that this is a supply and demand issue, and that that supply can only be satisfied if we have an all-of-the-above strategy. 
   There is not a single source of energy that does not have some detractor. I was amazed to read in the local paper the other day about a detractor from a wind farm who said that the noise of the blades kept him up at night, and that they chopped up too many birds, which violates our Migratory Bird Treaty. I was amazed to find out that somebody was opposed to a solar energy plant down in New Mexico because it would consume too much of the desert land. 
   There is not a source of energy that doesn't have someone who will jump up and complain about it and potentially bring a lawsuit about it. That is why if we start to take any of those resource potentials off the table, we might as well take them all off because everything drops one after the other. The only way to be fair and the only way to be equitable and the only way to make sure that we have a real solution is to make sure that every source of energy known to this country, every source of energy in this country is on the table and is part of the real solutions. 
   Our students, for their future, require that. The parents, for the present, require that. The citizens of this country demand an all-of-the-above approach and that it be talked about in committees, in public hearings, and here on the floor. Nothing else solves the problem. And our goal and responsibility should be to come to this Congress to solve the problem, not try to create a political atmosphere so that we can take credit for what may or may not happen, but simply to solve the problem. 
   If we do not fulfill our responsibility, the students who will benefit from these extensions will have a short-lived benefit and will not look at us in kindness for the generosity when we help them get their education, but refuse to allow this economy to sustain them post-education. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to say a few words in support of this particular resolution that congratulates the University of Nebraska at Omaha in its 100th anniversary of its founding, which will be 100 years on September 19 of this year. I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Terry, for introducing this resolution. I also have to clarify that he was not the alumnus. His wife is the alumna of this institution. And I want to recognize the contributions the University of Nebraska at Omaha has made to the education of the citizens of this Nation. 
   It was founded with just 26 students and now serves over 14,000. In the 2006-2007 academic year, the university awarded over 2,400 degrees to its students. The University of Nebraska at Omaha is nationally recognized for a strong academic program. Last year alone, the university was honored as one of the Best Colleges 2007 list, and the Best Midwestern College 2007 list and the Best Graduate Schools 2009 list, as published by ``U.S. News & World Report.'' In addition, the College of Business Administration's masters in business in administration students rank in the top 5 percent nationally, while the undergraduate students ranked in the top 15 percent on the most recent standardized exam on business topics. 
   University of Nebraska at Omaha has graduated such notable alumni as Marlin Briscoe, Peter Fonda, and a couple of Senators. Despite that fact, it is still a good school. I would like to congratulate all of the students, the alumni, and past and present employees on all they have accomplished over the last 100 years at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. 
   While I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, our efforts to help these college students will still be incomplete if we don't recognize the factors that all colleges are facing. Our higher education system is being squeezed by the high energy costs, just as the rest of society is. Schools are being forced to limit their operations, to reduce the number of school days just to save on utility costs and save their students the price of a day's commute. I know in both regular education as well as secondary education that the budgets for those particular institutions are written very narrowly and that whenever there is an unusual spike in something like the cost of electricity and the cost of fuel, that it is taken out primarily either in the short term or the long-term from the funds that are available for the faculty and for teachers for their salaries. It is simply a fact of life that if we do not get control of this energy crisis that is burgeoning, every school district in this Nation, whether it be a secondary, elementary, public or private or university level, every one of those schools is going to have the costs that will be borne by the teachers either in suppressed salaries at the current time or suppressed salaries into the future. That is the price we are paying for our failure to try to grasp this particular concept. 
   The majority has been meeting behind closed doors to craft a bill to offer what seems to be, at least from leaks  coming out, more political cover than actual reform. I am reminded of the U.S. Senate. The U.S. House has always had galleries so that people could watch what is taking place. But at the very beginning of the United States, the Senate convened in a closed room and no one could see what was taking place in that particular Chamber. The first employee of the United States Senate was actually the Senate secretary, a protege of John Adams who held the job for 25 years. The second employee of the Senate was the doorkeeper whose responsibility was to make sure that the public and House Members did not enter into the Chamber of the United States Senate. In fact, the Senate went on at that time to establish a funding schedule that would pay all Members of Congress $6 a day and Members of the Senate $7 a day. They also established a rule that a secretary could take any communication to the House, but at least two House Members had to be responsible for taking any communication to the Senate. 
   Well, the doorkeeper turned into the Sergeant of Arms as time went on. And eventually the Senate broke down and decided to actually allow people to watch the proceedings on the floor. Yet once again we find ourselves in an amazingly similar situation where the most important issue of our time is what we do with this energy crisis, and yet the bill that is supposed to be debated this day, this week on the floor, supposed to be being heard in Rules Committee as we speak, has yet to be heard in any public forum, has not had any kind of public hearing, and has not had any kind of committee work. And my bets are still that there won't be a heck of a lot of amendments that will be allowed to that particular procedure, all of it done in secret and private and then unveiled on the floor. 
   That is not the way of good regular order. Regular order should allow public process and open vetting so that all ideas are explored and the best ideas are those that surface to the top. We are not doing that this week. And we vitally and desperately need to do that, or just go back to the days where we keep a couple of doorkeepers around so the wrong people are not allowed to participate in the process of the policy of the United States. 
   We need to do that. We need a real energy policy that looks good not on paper, but keeps vital American resources viable and usable, not under lock and key. The students of this college need that for their future. All students need that for their future. Teachers need that if their retirement and their salaries are going to be kept impact. All of us need that if this economy is going to be vibrant and move forward. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not have other speakers at this time, and I would yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I want it to be very clear that I respect extremely Mr. Nunes and Mr. Costa who have introduced the bill that is before us. I also respect Mr. Salazar on the bill about which he was just speaking, because all those bills are very well written bills. They have gone through what we call regular order in this body so that the details have been worked out in a fair and equitable process. They are good, decent bills. 
   But we meet together on this day of suspensions in a unique concept. As we enter into this Hall, there are symbols placed throughout this building. And those symbols are there to remind us of certain concepts that we should be emulating. Around the top of this room, you see the faces, the side views of the icons of law, the great lawgivers of the history of this world, with Moses, obviously, who is the greatest of all, being the only one with a full face view looking directly at the Speaker. They are here because it reminds us that law, even though it sounds sometimes counterintuitive, is that factor which allows us to be free. Law sets the standard, the example, so that we know where we are going and what we are trying to do, which is why we are so offended when activist judges are creating law based on their whimsy, not on the record of the verbiage itself, why sometimes we also are offended in this body when we create wilderness or we create trail systems without maps, or we create wild river systems that violate the definition of those particular laws and we decide to do so on the whimsy of a simple majority vote. 
   The gentleman on the right side of the Speaker, when he was Vice President of the United States and thus also the President of the Senate, designed a set of rules by which the Senate would operate. This House has taken those rules, modified them slightly, but uses that as the basis of the rules of order for the way we conduct business here. And we often refer to that as regular order. But bills have concepts that they are supposed to take. If we indeed have a bill coming up later this week which has gone through no public input, has had no hearings, has had no committee reviews, will possibly not have the ability of being amended on the floor or in committee, being written in secret and then presented to us at the last minute, a pattern that has been pervasive during this session, it violates the message of their presence. It violates the concept of what we are trying to do. It says to us it is the wrong way to conduct business, because the basis when we conduct business out of regular order, when we do things behind closed doors and then bring a finished product to a take-it-or-leave-it vote here on the floor, is to basically produce a wrong-headed policy. 
   That was what these people feared, even though most of them had no concept of what a democratic republic was supposed to be, nor did they care. They always established what the process should be. We are looking at the most significant issue to be faced by this Congress this year and have begun in secret, with no hearings, no input, no public. It suddenly appears on the floor out of regular order. To do so dishonors the memory of each of these individuals who have fought so hard to allow us to have a structured way of coming to common solutions to real problems. And it is one of those things we should not allow ourselves to sink into during this coming week or even the next week.

We have one of our Members, Representative Drake, who is on her way up here, from her district which is on the coast of Virginia, driving up in a very crowded parkway trying to get here as well, illustrating several of the problems that we face in this country, one of which is what do you do with that land off the coast of Virginia, as well as the entire coast of the United States, to try and help solve the problem of our parkways and driveways and highways, our freeways, as people are trying to go from one destination to another, especially with the overwhelmingly destructive high cost of gasoline that we have now. 
   A lot of people talk about these things as if what the Republicans have been saying is we simply want to drill now and drill everywhere, as if that were the only solution that we present to the situation. It is not the only solution. In fact, there are many who have said that you can't drill your way out of the problem. 
   We have found already by past efforts that you can't tax your way out of this problem of energy.     
   We can't regulate our way out. We can't ignore our way out. Drilling is not the only solution, but it has to be part of the real solution if we, indeed, are going to find something that helps the people of the United States. 
   We have lived, after 30 years now, and have seen the results of this much time of government regulation of our sources of energy. It is government rationing of our resources that has caused us to be in a situation where we are today, to the point that some people even seriously talk about having gas stamps again, which once again illustrates how the government truly is the cause of the problem, because it is the government that is doing the rationing and the regulation. 
   Drilling is an essential part. Drilling off the coast of Virginia, drilling off the entire Outer Continental Shelf is an important part, but it is not the only solution to our problem. We must have revenues that can be available to build alternative forms of energy. The royalties that could come from those offshore drillings, as well as onshore drillings, could be that solution if they were tied together into one comprehensive approach to it. 
   We failed to realize that the infrastructure we have in this country does not meet the needs of energy for its citizens. We do not have the capacity for moving energy from one part of this country to another. 
   We have forgotten for too long our refinery needs, our electrical grid needs, our corridor needs, to the point that we now are in a significant problem. That has to be solved if, indeed, we are going to meet the needs of American citizens. 
   We need to start reemphasizing conservations and rewarding Americans, not forcing Americans and mandating Americans, but rewarding Americans for their effort to help meet this problem by means of conservation. But none of the issues I have just mentioned, ticked off by itself, is a solution. 
   All of them have to be there at the same time, which is why, if we really are going to meet the needs of Americans in this problem of excessive cost of energy, it has to be an all-of-the-above solution. 
   We must drill in all of the Outer Continental Shelf, as we must drill in Alaska, as we must explore the trillions of barrels of oil found in oil shale in the States of Wyoming, Colorado and my home State of Utah. We must look at clean, coal technology, nuclear technology, oil shale, natural gas. We must ensure that States are a partner with us. 
   The idea that the United States can actually do any of this without sharing the royalties is an insult to the States of this Nation. Already, we have insulted them in this particular Congress when we took the existing split of royalties, which is 50/50, and decided unilaterally, without their consent, to change that to a 52/48 so that we got to keep 52 percent, and we allowed the States to have 48 percent, taking away millions of dollars that they had been counting on, that they had been using, to meet the needs of their citizens. 
   All of those issues have been there. If we now decide to come up to this floor with a solution that is not all of the above, that only looks at drilling in one part of this country and not all, that does not look at the infrastructure needs, does not look at the alternative needs, does not look at the other kinds of fossil fuel needs. It does not come up with conservation requirements that we have to have. It is going to be the same heavy hand of government, which has already brought us to the situation we have right now, where it is the government that is causing, by our actions over the past 30 years, nothing short of rationing of the resources that we have. 
   There are three great bills that have been presented, one we have asked a vote for on this floor, the American Energy Act. I have to admit there is another one the western States representatives got together, the Americans for American Energy Act. There is a bipartisan act sometimes called the Peterson-Abercrombie bill, 20 Members of this Congress, a bipartisan group, have all asked to be discussed on the floor. 
   All three of those are a comprehensive all-of-the-above approach. None of those have been allowed to have a hearing, to have a markup, to have discussions, or to have a vote on this floor. Yet today we are told that sometime this week the bill written in secret will be brought to this floor, like Moses coming down from Mount Sinai, and will be given to us as the law. 
   That process is a fraud. That resulting bill will be a fraud. Anything that takes anything off the table will be a fraud. Anything that does not allow an all-of-the-above approach will be a fraud. We will not do what we are supposed to do when we come here to this body, which is, in addition to passing good bills like the one in front of us, but also solving the problem of American citizens. 
   We are not doing that. We are derelict in our responsibilities, and we need to change that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate, once again, our opportunity to talk about the many needs we have dealing with the environment and dealing with the energy situation that is so critical to Americans at this particular time. 
   I appreciate the gentlelady from Guam bringing up a problem that is, indeed, a problem, that we have known about since 2006. I am glad that the majority party has finally decided to hold hearings, after 2 long years, on that particular issue. I would hope that this week we can actually get to the bottom of that and make sure it never happens again. 
   But the issue of that has nothing to do with the fact that we are still rationing, through our actions, the opportunity of dealing with the resources that we do have. 
   Why, in Chukchi Sea, in February of 2008, were 487 leases allowed and immediately there were 487 lawsuits that took place? Why, in New Mexico in the spring of this year, were onshore drilling leases allowed, and immediately they were stopped because of lawsuits that are going forward? 
   Why, in my State, where we are ready to move forward with oil-shale production on private lands, was it stopped because of actions by this House that denied any funding going forward to move that process to its completion? 
   It is our actions that have actually been the regulatory stranglehold on moving this Nation forward, and those are the things that need to be completed. Hopefully, in the bill being written in secret that will be presented at some time, these actions will be addressed, these problems will be addressed. 
   These roadblocks will be addressed, but so far in the talking points that have leaked out, none of that seems to be even a topic of conversation. Yet if we indeed are going to solve all of the problems with an all-of-the-above solution, it has to be part of our discussion.     
   I have no additional speakers on this bill and would yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 839. The Bureau of Reclamation's Weber Basin Project, which is located in northern Utah only a short distance from the historic Brigham City, stores and delivers water from the Weber River into its tributaries. 
   The Arthur V. Watkins Dam, which is part of the Weber Basin Project, is part of an off-stream reservoir on the northeastern edge of the Great Salt Lake. It is formed by a roughly rectangular perimeter dam that is about 14.5 miles long. Water from the Weber River near its outlet to the Great Salt Lake is diverted into the reservoir by the Willard Canal and pumped from the reservoir by that same canal for multiple purposes. In addition to providing water supply, the reservoir is a popular recreation facility. 
   Recent drought and a growing population of Utah have highlighted the need for additional water storage. As a result, the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District, a water user which manages the Arthur V. Watkins Dam and Reservoir, desires the Bureau of Reclamation's assistance in determining the feasibility of adding water storage capacity to the reservoir. 
   H.R. 839 authorizes such assistance. This bill passed in the 109th Congress by voice vote. I again ask for your support.

   I rise in support of H.R. 759, which has been well explained by the subcommittee chairman. We support the designation of the Bob Hope Memorial Library. We urge the adoption of this particular bill. 
   In 1940, Bob Hope starred, with Paulette Goddard and Richard Carlson, in a remake of the movie ``The Ghost Breakers.'' In that picture, as they are talking about zombies that would be attacking the house that is owned by Paulette Goddard, she said, ``Zombies! That's horrible.'' Richard Carlson said, ``It's worse than horrible because a zombie has no will of his own. You see them sometimes walking around blindly with dead eyes, following orders, not knowing what they do, not caring.'' At which time Bob Hope said, ``Oh, you mean like Democrats.'' 
   I am very grateful that the other side of the aisle has taken this opportunity to recognize and reward both the wit and the wisdom of Bob Hope with this piece of legislation. I firmly support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1006, the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act amendments. 
   This legislation, introduced by the distinguished Ranking Republican on the Natural Resources Committee, Don Young, and the ranking Republican on the Fisheries, Wildlife and Oceans Subcommittee, Henry Brown, will extend the John H. Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grant Program. 
   The Prescott Grant program was first authorized in 2000 to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service with recovery and rehabilitation of stranded marine mammals. The Prescott Grant program has been very successful in supporting facilities around the Nation which volunteer space and staff time to rehabilitate these sea creatures and return many of them to the wild. 
   The National Marine Fisheries Service has received $4 million in appropriations each year for the Prescott Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Grants. In 2006, the Service issued 42 grants to facilities in coastal States. While the Prescott Grant program has been successful in these areas, there are still areas of the country that do not have appropriate coverage; the Alaska region and the Southeast region are two examples. 
   This legislation will increase funding for the Department of Commerce to address this lack of coverage and will also increase the number of grants that can be issued each year. The legislation will also cap administrative costs and roll over any unused funds into the grant program. The administration will have the authority to enter into cooperative agreements with trained personnel to allow for removal of floating debris from marine mammals to prevent the stranding and/or the death of those animals. 
   This legislation also authorizes emergency assistance funding. In addition, it will reauthorize funding for the Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality Event Fund, which allows the agency to respond to mass stranding events and reimburse facilities that have assisted in the response activity. 
   This is an important conservation bill. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1006.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 658, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 658 was introduced by the very effective Congressman from Nevada, JON PORTER, and would authorize the National Park Service to enter into a cooperative agreement with willing partners to protect park natural resources through collaborative efforts on land inside and outside of units of the National Park System. This was recommended by the Government Accountability Office, as the Park Service is still the only land management agency without this particular authority. So we expect this will help control the spread of invasive species and increase the protection of parks and wildlife. 
   At this point, Madam Speaker, I would like to engage the majority bill manager, Mr. Grijalva, in a colloquy to clarify an issue related to this bill, if he would. 
   I understand that the International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies has brought to the committee's attention their concern that H.R. 658 not be interpreted to give the National Park Service authority to manage fish and wildlife outside park boundaries. 
   Management authority for fish and wildlife resources within State boundaries has customarily been held in trust by the respective States. Congress has repeatedly affirmed this. This trust responsibility has been implemented primarily through State fish and wildlife agencies. In general, these principles are expressed in relevant fish and wildlife policies of the Department of the Interior found in volume 43 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 24. 
   Can the chairman of the subcommittee please clarify that the States' existing authority to manage fish and wildlife is not affected by H.R. 658?

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 838 and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 838 conveys to Park City about 110 acres of Bureau of Land Management land that was previously marked for disposal. This land would be used by Park City as recreational open space. The residents of Park City have placed a premium on preserving this space for the character of their resort town; and as the chairman accurately said, they have approved a $20 million bond to purchase this environmentally sensitive land. The conveyance of this is consistent with Park City's long-range plan to protect its sensitive landscape. 
   Park City hosted many of the events of the 2002 Olympics, and visitors from around the world visit there to ski and  partake of the scenic vistas, which will be enhanced by this bill. As was stated, this bill, as passed by the 109th session of Congress and as considered today, enjoys the support of both Republicans and Democrats and does have a companion bill that has been introduced in the United States Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, to paraphrase the misquote of one of my heroes, Yogi Berra, this is ``deja vu all over again,'' this actually was the substance of an amendment that was offered earlier this morning. It was repealed because the numbers did not actually meet the necessities of some of our requirement. This now comes back to you with new numbers in there that I think will meet the necessity of the requirements for our accounting system that happens to be there. 
   We did, obviously this morning, talk about the extreme necessity of dealing with border security with our public land system. We talked a lot about immigration, but we don't also indicate how this plays a part with our public lands. 
   We talked about the 1,900 acres that was burned. We suspect it was coming from a campfire by illegals. The gentleman from Iowa has used some of my pictures to show the amount of trash that was left behind in this critical habitat area, once again by illegal immigrants. We have talked about areas in which it is unsafe. One-third of the national monument has been closed down because it is unsafe to go in there by the Park Service personnel without armed guards accompanying them. 
   In testimony given to the Appropriations Committee, I know last year and perhaps it was replicated again this year, there was a discussion about the national forest area along the 60 miles contiguous with the Mexican border known as the Coronado National Forest. Once again, it has 12 different mountain systems, 203 threatened and endangered and sensitive species, eight wilderness areas that are in this particular area, and they were literally begging for the resources sufficient to address the adverse impact due to illegal border traffic. That is what this amendment tries to do. 
   I appreciate earlier this morning the many comments, especially from the ranking member, of how significant this issue actually is. It is true we are moving money from a program, in this case, the National Endowment For the Arts, to border security. I would point out that we are not taking, as some amendments have and I am certainly not proposing that, all of the money from NEA to move into helping with border security. We are still leaving a $4 million increase above and beyond what was last year in the appropriated budget for the NEA. So we are trying to do that. Even though this program hasn't been reauthorized since 1992, we are still allowing that type of an increase. 
   But what our comment is basically saying is whenever we have these budgets, we have to make some kind of prioritization. And my contention is that the committee misprioritized when they put some money opposite others and that this has a higher and more significant need at this particular time. 
   Perhaps if we were starting over again, both these programs could be funded adequately. But at this stage of the game, there are only certain pots from which the money can be taken,  and I still think that this is the effective way of making sure there is still an increase, once again to a program that hasn't been reauthorized since 1992, and at the same time putting a significant amount of resources to our land managers who desperately need those resources to do their job in protecting our southern borders and protecting the land that we have set aside for its sensitive nature and its specific qualities. That has to be there. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, that is the specific element of this particular amendment, to try to reprioritize to meet the needs of our southern border, which at this time, when we are talking about immigration, is such a significant issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word. 
   One of the issues that we are dealing with this in this particular budget deals with the question that we have that deals with both immigration as well as the processes of that immigration. We are talking this time about immigration, and the devastating impact that it has. 
   One of the things we missed is the impact on land of immigration. Our land managers have documented, pleaded their efforts before and in the past on some of the problems that we seem to be facing with immigration. We have illegal trails that are going across the desert that are leading to erosion. Literally our resources are being washed away. 
   Where that is not happening, trash is being left behind by illegal border crossers. We are talking about plastic bottles, shoes, cars, even vehicles at some times. That is not necessarily the habitat of endangered species. We seem to be having devastating fires taking place started by abandoned camps. 
   Even last week, 1,900 acres in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge was burned, and it is believed that its was started by illegal immigration cooking fire. The Coronado National Forest, in testimony last year before the Appropriations Committee, has 60 miles of contiguous border with the Mexican border. In this national forest, there are 12 separate rangers, eight wilderness areas, 203 threatened and endangered sensitive species, and the staff said that the resources are suffering significant adverse impacts due to illegal border traffic. Even livestock and closure fences, meant to try to separate livestock from endangered species, are being torn down. 
   Probably the most specific and egregious of all those examples is given by the National Park Service. The Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, one-third of that monument is closed to visitors because of the threats of assault by AK-47-packing drug runners is too great. Land managers and biologists responsible for the park must be escorted by armed personnel to do their work in the park. 
   If we had machine-gun toting bandits or terrorists walking through Yellowstone or Yosemite, we would not tolerate that. But that is the reality that we have today, and the land managers are asking for tools to do their job. 
   That, indeed, is an issue of significance that needed to be addressed in this particular bill. Perhaps at some point in the future we can actually address that particular issue and that difficult problem and see if we can move forward to a resolution of that and establish priorities that we want to have border security and the impact, the negative impact it's having on public lands, we need to make sure that we move forward as a government to stop that and suppress that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chair, we just mentioned a few things that are significant to this particular issue and tried to mention some of the important points that we are making. We need greater control on the Park Service and BLM land on our border areas that is being devastated by illegal border crossing. 
   The amendment that I am proposing goes directly to that goal and that purpose by committing $30 million towards law enforcement activities. Actually, it's $31.5 million toward law enforcement activities by agencies who are on our southern border. 
   We, as a government, have a responsibility to prevent illegal border crossings. We also have a responsibility for land managers to be managing the land in that particular area. 
   Now, this amendment that I have does move money around. I feel sorry for that. The particular area in which I am transferring the money is something that bothers me personally. 
   I met my wife during a community theater. When I was in the legislature in Utah, I was the one that instituted a percent for the art programs so that 1 percent of all our construction monies went for arts to be considered. I have been a supporter of the Utah Arts Council. 
   I also think it's appropriate that local dollars fund art programs so that local control can be there on the process level. 
   With this particular amendment, it still leaves a $4 million, $4.5 million, roughly $4 million increase in the National Endowment for the Arts over last year's funding base, so there still is an increase. But in addition to that increase, there is $30 million that will go to enforcement of our borders, enforcement of our borders that is necessary to protect the land that is there. It is a matter of priority. 
   Now, CBO has scored this one. I'm convinced there is probably no PAYGO efforts, but that may be one of the issues we want to talk about. But the bottom line is still this: We need to prioritize what we're doing with this budget. And this is a tremendous area that has been de-emphasized and needs to be re-emphasized. And I contend that this is the appropriate way to put that emphasis there.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. One of the issues with which we struggle in this legislature deals with simply the concept of prioritization. And what I'm talking about in this particular issue is money put into the budget above and beyond what the President recommended, but money put into this budget for new acquisitions, not taking care of what we already have, but new acquisitions. 
   Now, I'm going to contend here that what we need to do is prioritize so that what we do is put our money in what we already have and make sure that we are doing the best we have with our parks and public lands. 
   I have a picture right here of a facility that's not in my district, but it is in my State. Dinosaur National Monument is actually in the Second District of Utah. This particular facility is a beautiful facility. I was there before it was condemned. I was there. So you could go in there with all my kids and look at the dinosaur bones that are still in place in the mountainside as it has been scraped away so you can see the prehistoric history of this country. It's a wonderful place. It is a wonderful exhibit. It's a great learning experience, all of which has been closed because this building has been condemned and we don't have enough money to fix the facility. 
   This facility should be fixed before we put 17 million new dollars into new programs somewhere else. This facility should be fixed before we expand what we are trying to do. We need to take care of what we have already identified as important and significant and make sure it takes place. 
   And that, my fellow Members of this House, is the reason I'm proposing this amendment, that we simply reprioritize to do what's most important, and we fix what we have first and make  sure that is functioning before we put any new additional money into acquisition of new land, new properties and new proposals.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Madam Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity of just saying a word on this particular amendment. I am also very grateful to both the ranking member as well as the chairman of the subcommittee for understanding the significance of this important amendment. 
   Let me say that this is another map that is similar to the one that was already done, except this time I chose the blue color. Everything that is in blue is the amount of land owned and controlled by the Federal Government in each State. You will notice that there is a proclivity of this kind of blue color in the West. 
   Some of those that don't live in the West don't really understand what the significance or the problem is in dealing with the Federal Government on so much particular land. 
   I also want you to know that this was not necessarily the way it was supposed to be. When every one of these Western States entered the Union, their enabling act said the land would go to the Federal Government until such time as it shall be disposed and each State was supposed to get a cut of the amount of money gotten by the Federal Government. So this is not the way it was supposed to be. 
   But it was changed in the 1970s when the Federal Land Management Policy Act was produced. The trade-off in that was for Payment in Lieu of Taxes. So this land would be compensated, in exchange for the Federal Government keeping those lands, without having to go back through the States to deal with it. 
   Now, we would actually be more happy if we had all the lands. If indeed these Western States that have their lands controlled by the Federal Government could tax them at even the cheapest open value space, this is the amount of money that we would be able to accommodate for ourselves and solve our own problems. 
   This bill has $232 million for PILT, Payment in Lieu of Taxes right now. So you look at it. If Idaho was simply able to put a tax on the Federal land in their State, they would create more than that money by themselves. Utah could get $116 million every year by ourselves, Nevada $118 million every year by themselves; and that is only for public education. It would be even more for general taxes. So the States could actually handle it themselves. 
   What I am trying to say is I appreciate everyone finally realizing that PILT money is not free, it is not loans, it is simply not welfare for the West. It is money that was really owed to these particular States and that our goal should not be simply the $22 million more in this particular amendment, but to fully fund PILT, which should be $375 million in the first place, or allow the States to have the flexibility to actually go after the true value of these types of lands that happen to be there. 
   So I appreciate everyone recognizing the significance of this, and I appreciate everyone realizing that this is money that is owed to the States so they can control and they can actually pay for the services they have to provide, even though they don't have the land resources to deal with it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, in my short time as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands, I have already heard a number of stories from property owners who have been threatened or bullied with the hammer of eminent domain. Thousands of acres each year are taken from private citizens and against their will in order to expand our national parks and our national forests. This is done in spite of the fact that the Federal Government has so much land it cannot possibly manage what it already has. 
   Landowners, when faced with the possibility of a long, protracted war against bureaucrats, land managers and legions of Federal lawyers, often choose simply to walk away. What is most outrageous then is the fact that these people are then labeled by us as willing sellers. 
   This has happened to landowners across our Nation. We've had examples from people living near the Everglades in Florida, to the Cape Cod National Seashore in Massachusetts, to Voyageurs National Park in Minnesota, just a few places where there has been, in my estimation, egregious abuse by the Federal Government. 
   I have letters from a family in Maine who endured 20 years in a battle with the Federal Government. They wrote that the negotiations between my family and the Park Service over what could have been a simple land donation exceeded 20 years and had a serious, long-term detrimental effect on my family, the ski area they owned, the surrounding community. Eventually, after millions of dollars were lost and countless hours of time from high-ranking State and Federal officials were consumed, strained professional careers of an entire at-risk community and the negative health and financial repercussions of my family members, this issue was finally resolved. For now. 
   Here is another example of a Franciscan friar who talked about the threats of eminent domain that hanged over his ministry for years and years and years. In his words, again, simply over 118 acres of the friar's property: We offered the National Park Service the opportunity to switch back the trail to the original setting, so that not only the trail could be maintained, but there would be a natural environment for it. But the National Park Service refused this option and threatened to proceed with eminent domain. There is no reason that that friar and his ministry should have had that hanging over his head for years and years and years. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Secretary of Interior has the power in statute for using this hammer of eminent domain. Even today, when we do authorization bills, we don't even have the sense to try and limit that kind of authority or power. Even in those situations where it is clearly said in the testimony and in the hearings that they do not want to use eminent domain, we do nothing to try and stop that potential authority. If we really say that we don't want to use eminent domain to acquire these lands, we ought as well use the logical step of saying so. 
   In light of the Kelo decision, so many people are now aware of the potential abuse by government entities on private property through the use of eminent domain, now is the time for us clearly to say that private property is important, and it should be respected by the Federal Government. That's exactly what this amendment tries to do, is to clarify that we do respect private property; we respect it, and we will not use eminent domain to take land away from private citizens. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, there is something that is happening in the Department of Interior that is disturbing. So-called nonprofits, many of them financed by wealthy individuals, are lining up with their hands extended, requesting and accepting government handouts in the form of grants. 
   Then what do these nonprofits do with the taxpayers' money? They come back and they sue the same agents that wrote them a check. 
   At the same time, these 501(c)(3)s complain that the agencies are then underfunded. Now it's difficult to see how land management agencies are ever going to have enough money to take care of their responsibilities and appease the nonprofits when a good chunk of their budget is siphoned off yearly by defending themselves against endless lawsuits. 
   501(c)(3)s have a great system. It's a very efficient business model for them. It does defy logic except in what we call the bureaucracy of the Federal Government. These nonprofits bite the hand that feeds them, and the hand simply can't stop itself from feeding them even more. After biting the hand, they then go out and find more money to continue the assault, line their pockets, all along touting their advocacies on behalf of the hand they had just bitten. 
   My amendment provides a potential remedy to this disturbing and increasing trend. It would prohibit funds in this bill from being dispersed to 501(c)(3)s that are party to litigation against the dispensing agency. In other words, if you are suing the Department of the Interior, you are not eligible to receive money from the Department of the Interior. 
   I believe, as everyone does, in the right to sue, but it defies logic that we would ask taxpayers to finance litigation against themselves. The taxpayer ends up paying twice, first in the form of the handouts to the nonprofit, and then when the government's attorney needs to be paid for defending it. 
   Keep in mind, this also diverts money from critical needs on our public land. The maintenance backlog on our lands is well documented, reaches into billions of dollars, and we can't even say the taxpayers are even hit a third time when they try to access these multiple-use public lands only to find out that the particular activity is currently off limits due to ongoing litigation brought on by so-called nonprofit advocacy groups generously financed by the taxpayers. 
   Now some may say that there are legitimate reasons to take the government to court. I would agree with that statement. But I would not agree that it's the government's responsibility to fund that complaint, especially the same government entity you are at the same time suing. 
   This amendment is very simple. If a nonprofit organization can afford to finance elaborate fundraising campaigns to enrich themselves, certainly they can afford to sue the government on their own dime. Don't let these organizations sell you underchronic underfunding of agency X, Y and Z when they, themselves, are draining that agency from resources by the millions. This two-faced scheme must be stopped. It's time for us to show the taxpayers some respect and stop playing this type of a game with their money. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman from Washington yielding me the time. It is always a pleasure for me to be on the floor with the two Representative Hastings who represent different parts of the country here. It's a pleasure. 
   Mr. Speaker, when I was a young State legislator in my second term, actually I was still in my twenties, so you know that was a long, long time ago, someone once came to me with an idea of doing some PR by doing what everyone wants to do, and that is to eliminate useless legislation. I thought this is great. This is going to be a great stunt that I can use to eliminate some useless legislation. 
   I picked a statute still in the Utah code still on the books which required the State of Utah to fund a summer encampment for every veteran of the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and, since when this was written, it also said the Great War. Since there were no veterans alive, I thought this was an ideal situation to try to pass, and I introduced the bill. 
   The unfortunate thing is, even though this bill was supposed to do nothing, when it went to the committees of jurisdiction, there was this impending desire on the part of legislators to make the bill actually do something. By the time it went actually through the process, this bill allowed for any veterans group, including Boy Scouts, to be able to use all the National Guard armories in the State of Utah free of charge. 
   It got to the point where I killed my own bill, because all of a sudden something that wasn't supposed to do anything was now doing something. What it was doing was really, really wrong and not intended. 
   Now the proponents of this particular bill say the greatest benefit from this bill is simply that it basically does nothing. It doesn't change anything. 
   However, one of the proponents, when asked by his local newspaper if this would increase the cost and the regulations on these lands said, well, you establish the system first and then we go to step two. 
   It is what that step two may or may not be that has the greatest amount of concern with this particular bill, which direction will we be going? This bill talks about establishing values for the management of this land, but nowhere does it ever talk about what these values actually are. 
   We will hear amendments on the floor that we are talking about grazing and hunting and fishing and energy rights, as those are part of the values that should have been described and should have been defined in the very basis of this bill. 
   But what is significant is what will not be allowed to be discussed on this floor with this particular bill. Specifically, how do you treat individuals with this bill? We had an amendment that deals with the concept of recreation, boating and shooting rights. There would be no net loss of territory. On these types of recreation activities, this is a perfect example to talk about is this part of the value of these lands? It's traditional, and yet it was denied the ability to even present that on the floor. 
   We talked about the border security. There will be an amendment which will codify the status quo on border security, which is not what we wanted to bring up, because what we were talking about is not the status quo, which is bad, but changing the status quo. Those efforts to try and expand that opportunity on border security were denied discussion on this floor on the rule. 
   Now, this particular entity, this national land conservation system, came from the fertile mind of Secretary Babbitt. It also did not have a specific definition of what the values were. 
   There are two types of parks and monuments. Not all parks and monuments are created equal. Parks and monuments, run by the Park Service, talk about values and they are specified as to what those values are. What this bill is now trying to do is codify a new entity that will be talking about values of BLM, parks and national monuments. 
   Now, when you talk to the Department of the Interior, one of the reasons they say they are somewhat supportive of the concept of this bill was because it would allow them to maintain the multiple use values that make a difference between park service land and BLM land. 
   Yet when we tried to add an amendment to this bill, both in committee and again in the Rules Committee, to specifically say that one of the values must be multiple use, it was defeated on a straight party-line vote. 
   Once again, the very essence of the difference between national park monuments and national parks and BLM national parks and national monuments is this concept of multiple use. Yet we are not allowed to even talk about that, which goes to the question, if people eventually take legislation and want it to do something, in what direction will this take us? What will they start wanting to do? 
   If the core difference between national park land and BLM land is not specified in this legislation, where, actually, will we end up? This bill may, indeed, do something that we do not want to see happening, and this entity, which is nothing more than a $15 million a year boondoggle right now, a redundancy at best, could indeed end up to do something that creates real harm and real destructive elements.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Now there is one other part that should have been part of this discussion and was not allowed by my friends on the Rules Committee. 
   It was briefly addressed by the gentleman from Florida, but he missed the point, I think, that the gentleman from Alaska was trying to make dealing with personal property. 
   Supposedly this issue does not deal with personal property because we are only dealing with BLM property. The difference, though, is with all of those entities within the Bureau of Land Management proposal, there are private inholdings. They have been a constant source of problem and contentions. 
   Unless you specify the significant value of how you are going to treat these inholdings, you make the situation of those private property holders much more difficult. You raise the specter of trying to change access restrictions because, indeed, if you are now going to run this land like the park service land, that will be a problem. 
   Not only do you create another level of bureaucracy to make those trying to solve their problems much more difficult to get equity, you also create all sorts of different solutions to be there that should have been specified in the legislation. 
   Protecting the private property holders' inholdings in those properties right now is one of the values that BLM lands should be doing, and it should be specified. It is not in this bill. The fact that we cannot add that to this bill, because of a ruling on a partisan vote by Rules Committee, is devastatingly wrong.     
   It will take us down a path where who knows what will be the end result. But, it is an end result that will have the high likelihood of harming individual people, individual people who use this land right now, either for recreation purposes, for sporting purposes, for hunting purposes, or for their own land value purposes, will be harmed unless those issues are clearly specified in this language, and the amendments to do that were not made in order. 
   Several good amendments were made in order, not nearly enough because this bill, as written, is flawed; and this bill, as amended, would still be flawed because it doesn't address those particular issues.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Put all of my amendments on the floor, and then, then you've got a good argument that is there. 
   Indeed, one of these amendments, specifically the amendment on multiple use, was discussed in committee and was defeated on a partisan voice vote. That issue still is one that is relevant and needs to be part of this bill. If it is not, you have taken the core values between BLM and National Parks and blurred the lines into nonexistence. You can't do that. That has to be one of the values that is here. 
   The second issue I am talking about is private property rights. As I recall, I did not present that in the committee so but it is still very relevant and should be here, and is one of the problems that we are developing if we continue to go on with this. 
   I do have to say to the gentleman from Florida, no, I did not have the privilege of going before your committee and testifying last night. Gosh, I wish I could have done that, and I know you guys really wanted me to be there to continue the testimony and elongate the meeting last night.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   You know, there was a time when Pete Rose was trying out to make a baseball team, and the scouting report said that ``Rose can't make a double play, he can't throw, he can't hit left-handed and he can't run.'' The first time Fred Astaire tried to make a movie preview, the report coming back on Fred Astaire was, ``he can't act, he's slightly bald, and he can dance a little bit.'' The Boston Red Sox were reviewing a new outfielder, and the scouting report came back saying, ``he's not the Red Sox type.'' The guy they were actually scouting was Willie Mays. Which simply means, in life, sometimes what we see and sometimes what we're told is not necessarily the reality of situations. As groups and individual Members of Congress are starting to see this bill for what the details are is one of the reasons why we see some of those groups peeling off on their support. 
   Why, some of the issues we raised in committee, it was said they're not really issues, now there are amendments that have been proposed by the majority party to deal with those so-called ``nonissues.'' 
   It is said all we're trying to do here is codify and make permanent an institution that's already in existence, but it is much, much more than that. My freshman year, the goal of the freshman class was to try to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government. Sometimes I wish we were still doing this because today we have reached the mother lode of waste, fraud and abuse. 
   This is an entity, the National Landscape Conservation System, which spends money, but it does not hire anyone, it does not fire anyone, it does not write regulations, it does not repeal regulations, it doesn't administer any land, it doesn't manage any land. For the life of me, we have been trying to figure out what this thing does other than spend $50 million a year to encourage and to bring attention to certain particular areas. 
   We are told that this bill would not change any of that. This bill apparently does nothing to an entity that does nothing. But I'm going to portend to you that the reason this entity has been so successful so far is simply because it's been under the auspices of the Secretary of the Interior. But if, indeed, we codify this and put this into statute, an entity right now which sticks out on a flowchart like a sore thumb that doesn't really do anything will change, it will change significantly, and all of a sudden it will start to do something. And that's where the danger arises. Because when we wrote down the values of this supposed new system, they are extremely vague, which means, first of all, it opens us up to lawsuits right and left. If the amendment that will be offered later does not pass to try and limit the impact of those lawsuits, we are offering this Nation a great deal of harm and potential peril. 
   We have spent $50 million every year on what can best be called a redundant organization, but it actually should be changed. And the question obviously is, will we be spending more in this society? Now, once again, the proponents say nothing will change, it's not going to cost more, CBO says it's not going to cost more, there will be no regulations. The chairman of the subcommittee that sponsored this bill was asked once again at one point in time, will this create more cost, more regulation, and the answer was simply this: Well, you go in to establish the system, and then you go to step two. What that step two is is the fear that happens to be here. The values that have never been identified in this legislation dealing these parts of land deal with such issues as recreation. Amendments to actually define that were not allowed to be discussed. It deals with border security. Amendments to define that were not allowed to be discussed. We will have another border security amendment which, in my estimation, does anything more than establish the status quo as our policy when the status quo is not sufficient. 
   We will have discussions over grazing issues and energy issues. We should have had discussions over private end holding issues. All of those should be defined as part of the values that we are talking about here. 
   The Department of Interior has been very positive about this. They said they support this concept because it allows them to do what has always been done that is the difference between BLM monuments and parks versus national park monuments and parks, and that is, the value of multiple use. But in committee, when we tried to amend the language so that multiple use was a value to be maintained, it was defeated on a party line vote. And when we went to the Rules Committee and tried to make sure that we had a chance to discuss this, to put in multiple use as the value that is significant, it was again denied the ability even to discuss that on the floor. And that is the sum and substance that is different. 
   Now, we are dealing with a system that impacts people and their lives. It was said by Sir Henry Maine, ``Nobody is at liberty to attack civil property and say at the same time they value civilization because the history of two can never be disentangled.'' And that is where we're at. 
   Unless this bill is significantly modified, this bill will do harm to people. Unless this bill is changed and this system is moved back, it will do significant harm to people. 
   We have problems within this entity right now. Rather than solve any of these problems, it provides vague and fluffy language that will make the situation worse. It does not solve the problems, but it does create a permanent statutory entity without any solutions and, indeed, goes the other direction and makes permanent solutions to our problems more difficult actually to accomplish. 
   This simply is a bill whose time is not now. This is a bill that does not tell us exactly what to expect. It opens up the Federal Government to all sorts of potential lawsuits, and doesn't actually come up with a value that makes BLM land different than Park Service land, which is multiple use. That phrase has to be in that bill if this bill has any chance of having any some rationality of purpose. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, we have heard several things about this particular piece of legislation. This new entity, the National Land Conservation System, not to be confused with the National League Championship Series, which is a much better concept, this entity was not created by congressional action. It was created as the dream child of a former Secretary of Interior less than 10 years ago. 
   When asked in a hearing of the Bureau of Land Management if they were incompetent to manage these lands before this new entity was established, the simple answer was no. One would then ask the question, why was there a need 10 years ago for this new entity, because this new entity still does not administer anything, they don't manage anything, they don't regulate anything, nor will they, as has been carefully delineated by the sponsor of this legislation. 
   The first question still should be asked, what do they really do, other than to provide some vague philosophy of recognition and enhancement and anything else? If we really simply wanted to just create this system statutorily, a one-sentence piece of legislation would do: ``There is established a National Land Conservation System.'' 
   Is there a threat to any lands that are currently under the auspices of the Bureau of Land Management, as has been indicated by certain speakers? The answer is no. The sponsor just admitted there is no threat to that. All we are talking about is some vague new entity, and the issue of concern with this vague new entity is the language now says this new entity has certain values that it is supposed to uphold. These values are vague. Nowhere does it specifically say what these values are. 
   Is this a threat to private property? No more than the present system. But that is where the issue comes in. We already have threats to the private property within this system, and this piece of legislation, rather than solving that issue, exacerbates that issue altogether. 
   Is there a border security issue? Yes, presently, and this piece of legislation does not help that issue. It exacerbates the issue, if anything else. 
   It is the vagueness of the language in this bill that puts into statutory language an entity that really doesn't do anything right now. That is a problem for the future, if at some stage or some point in time Congress wants or even the entity itself wants to make it do something proactively. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, in closing, the gentleman from Florida just gave a wonderful speech, and I think he illustrated some of the problems with this particular bill. The territory to which he was speaking is National Park Service land, not BLM land. This bill only deals with BLM land, and that is precisely the problem that we have with this particular bill. 
   It is very simple one. We have parks and national monuments, some administered by the Bureau of Land Management, some administered by the National Park Service. They are different. Each one of them has a different value. 
   In the Park Service, the organic act that created it said what the values for this land would be. It is established in statute and in regulation. The Bureau of Land Management does not have that same value system, because they are different lands for a different purpose, which is why the language in this bill is so troubling, because it is simply a vague statement that simply says they will have values, and it has never, never been defined. 
   When the Department of Interior told me personally that they were in favor of this, it was because they could maintain the Bureau of Land Management parks and monuments with multiple use as the significant value. It would be protected, they said. Which is why I am so chagrined, that when we attempted to clarify in this legislation by amendment in the committee and once again before the Rules Committee that that is specifically the difference between the Park park and the BLM park, it was rejected. 
   Now, multiple use is the difference between national parks in the Park Service system and national parks in the BLM system, and that language, that language has to be maintained, because that is indeed the only value that makes a difference. 
   These lands are not threatened if the BLM has them. They are not threatened if we don't make this system, which is redundant at best and expensive at best, codified. But we do do something dangerous if we pass this legislation and now give a vague term of values on to a system that is defined nowhere. It opens us up to litigation problems, it causes problems in administration, and it does change the system. That is why there is so much danger, unless you are willing to do what our side has been saying all along, which is define what those vague terms actually mean. 
   That, Mr. Chairman, is why we oppose this piece of legislation. It opens up a door that has no definition as to what room we actually enter, and that is wrong. It is simply wrong.  
   The problem with that is it is going to hurt people, people who use this BLM land now to recreate, people who use it to graze, people who use it for their economy, people who have private property in-holdings in this area. They are put at risk because our language is simply too vague to allow them to understand what our intent is. That is why this bill has to be defeated. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate Mr. Grijalva actually taking the lead on this issue. 
   In fact, Republicans had two amendments that were introduced to the Rules Committee that dealt with this same specific issue. Again, in a spirit of bipartisanship, the two Republicans ones were not put in place but the Democrat one was, and at least we are addressing this particular issue. 
   I do happen to have some objection to this one, because to me, what this amendment does, is put into statute or to put into language the status quo. Nothing in this act shall impede what we are already doing. I think this issue should be more forward thinking. We need to change what is happening in the status quo in this area that is simply now known as the trail of amnesty, where so much illegal narcotics work, illegal human trafficking and illegal gang activity has taken place. The article to which I referred actually specifies what that is there. 
   That is why the amendments that were not made in order were superior to the one that is made in order here, and it should be recognized. 
   Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to yield to the gentleman from New Mexico 2 minutes of my time for discussion of this amendment.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, let me make this clear. I have no intention of opposing or voting against the language from the gentleman from Arizona. 
   I am appreciative that the gentleman from Arizona and the majority party has finally taken the initiative of bringing issues up here. 
   My objection is that the language that was proposed to the Rules Committee in other amendments dealing with this issue was far broader and would have been better in the future. When we talk about language right now that nothing of us actually impede, we were talking in other pieces of legislation about not hindering border security, not hindering illegal immigration for Homeland Security or other law enforcement agencies. 
   The amendments we tried to propose would have been far broader, far more inclusive and would have dealt with issues into future as opposed to this. 
   But having said that, this is at least a good step in the right direction.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, again, as I was speaking earlier about the bill, one of the problems is simply the concept of some vague elements of what ``values'' may or may not be, especially as it applies to Park Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. 
   The language in question that I ask to be removed from this bill is language that comes specifically from the Organic Act that created the National Park System as well as the Redwood amendments. Those two concepts caused the National Park Service to administer park lands to the same standard. 
   In the absence of any other definition of what Bureau of Land Management land should be in this system, it is essential that we not have to revert back to what the National Park Service uses as its values standard, and that's the fear that comes in here. 
   Indeed, in the BLM land that has been put into this system, you have a multitude of different land, from Bureau of Land Management monuments to Bureau of Land Management parks, to wilderness areas, to wilderness study areas. If, indeed, the same language that has forced the Park Service to manage in the same administrative pattern is now imposed on the Bureau of Land Management, it would do irreparable harm to different lands that are specifically there so that they can use multiple use. 
   Once again, we come back to that issue. BLM lands are supposed to be administered differently. That's why it's BLM lands in the first place. This language opens up the possibility of using the same kind of litigation techniques that force the Park Service to use all of their lands in the exact same manner onto the National Park Service. 
   If you change it to simply do what we said earlier, establish a National Landscape Conservation System, without the other verbiage, you eliminate that potential problem. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, the language that is put in here is part of the BLM mandate. They are to conserve, protect, restore cultural, ecological and scientific values for the benefit of current and future generations. 
   The issue at hand, though, is that this is not the only part of the BLM's management authority and management purpose. By refusing to expand this to the other areas to which BLM is supposed to do, the work they are supposed to do on this land, we are in danger of actually going the other way and trying to impose that this is the only way, especially when this language has been used in the Park Service to mandate specific management practices and hurt that process. 
   If you go on with this particular section, when you go to (b), it lists the kind of areas designated in this new land system. Each one was established with a certain land management plan. They are there. But the fact that we don't put them in here opens up the possibility of litigation to problems that are there. 
   It is important so we know that the Department of the Interior said they don't mind creating this system by statute, but they were opposed to this language. They said this language is harmful to their mission statement. 
   I wish to actually try and convince every Member on the floor, all three of us here, that this is indeed not what the department needs. It is not what the bureau needs. It is not the kind of language that you want to put in statute if you want to make sure what we are doing is specifically defined. This opens up more problems than we would otherwise have.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I can be painfully brief on this amendment. 
   In two places in this bill you have the same problem we have been talking over and over about, about the vague notion of simply ``values.'' 
   The last amendment took the very superfluous language in the preamble, which has the potential of creating problems, as it has in other sections. But also in section 3(c)(2), we once again find this vague, nefarious language. 
   It says that the Secretary shall manage the system in a manner that protects the values for which the components of this system were designated. 
   Once again, by simply saying ``values'' without any kind of definition, nor is there any regulatory definition, you have simply opened this up to a vague, contentious opportunity. If you are going to establish this system and give them something to do, for heaven's sake, tell them what they are going to do and make it simple and make it succinct. 
   That is why this section should be eliminated. Until we are ready to define these values, you don't put this in statute.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona's comments. His initial sentence was that I am attempting to strike the very purpose of this act. I don't really think that is accurate because there is no purpose. If there was a purpose, it would have been written down as to what the purpose is. This simply says there will be values; and there is no definition of what those values are. 
   I would remind all of my colleagues in this room, this is the language that the department said they do not want.  This is the language BLM says does harm to them. This is the language they said was too vague and should be fixed, and it has not been fixed. That is why it should be eliminated.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with one of the other issues that we are talking about as far as potential development of energy on these lands that are currently under the control of the Bureau of Land Management and may or may not actually change with the formalizing of this new entity. 
   With skyrocketing energy prices, the last thing that Congress should do is lock up more lands that could provide a solution. 
   The NLCS lands include potentially billions of barrels of oil, vast quantities of natural gas and coal, and unlimited potential for renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. 
   The energy development on NLCS lands is vital to the economies of western States, and to the Nation. We should be looking at ways to keep the $400 billion that we spend to buy energy overseas here at home. We are only just beginning to understand what potential there is on NLCS lands for renewable energy sources. This amendment would ensure that those options remain open. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, to be honest, I will be voting in favor of  this particular amendment. I think this is actually a very good amendment. This is the issue we presented in committee that was rejected in committee. I am glad that someone somewhere, between the path of this bill from committee to here on the floor, found religion and is actually looking forward to this particular issue. It's a good one, even though we were told in committee it was just a shadow that we were fighting on the wall. 
   I would recognize also that there were three amendments that were introduced that did the exact same thing that have now been incorporated in this particular amendment. Somebody once told me, well, when you steal you should steal from the best. I think this is stolen from the best simply because the ones that were not recommended were my amendments. 
   Therefore, since we're saying the same thing, in the spirit of bipartisanship, what else can I say, other than this is the right thing to do, and I actually personally support this particular amendment. It is the right thing to do. Regardless of who gets credit for it, it is the right thing to do.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. The amendment offered by Mr. Pearce is critical to protecting ranchers who produce our food from the negative consequences of this bill. Without the Pearce language, ranchers would be left to the whims of future Secretaries of Interior that will diminish ranching opportunities. 
   Already, grazing rights are under assault on multiple fronts. There is a simple element out there that loathes grazing on public land. And our food supply is, indeed, worthy of protection and worthy of the use of our public land. 
   Despite opposition to this amendment in committee, I hope the other side will now recognize that granting these small protections in the legislation is, indeed, our duty. We cannot abandon our responsibility to legislate by leaving to bureaucrats the opportunity to isolate bankrupt ranchers dependent upon grazing. 
   We thank Mr. Pearce for his foresight and determination to protect grazing rights now and in the future, and urge support of his amendment.

   H.R. 3079, as amended, has received much support from the Bush administration, as well as the Northern Marianas elected resident representative, a Republican, Pedro Tenorio. Mr. Tenorio has worked hard to bring forth a bill which has consensus from both sides of the aisle. 
   This bill brings about unified border control and immigration to the Marianas region, which will benefit our national security. In addition, the bill will foster economic development on the islands by providing local businesses and the military with ready access to labor to support the tourist industry and military base construction.

I am also very grateful to be a part of the Natural Resources Committee, which I think has worked in a bipartisan way to present this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (AMERICA CANNOT REPEAT MISTAKE OF 1938 -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, in the year 1938 domestic needs were great in this country. The New Deal programs that FDR had actually failed, and the Depression had deepened during his second term to the point that the P-51 fighter plane was considered so insignificant and so costly it was not funded that year. 
   When World War II started, the bombing runs that we took as a country produced 20 percent casualties for us to the point that we suspended bombing runs until we could build enough P-51 fighters to accompany them. It was not until the winter of 1943 that we were able to have superiority over the sky in Europe. 
   The technology of today has made this world so much smaller and so much faster that we cannot afford to make the same mistake this country did in 1938. We cannot predict the type of future combat we will be called upon to participate in. We must be prepared for that future. 
   Decisions we make today, because basically it takes 8 years from design to construction of a plane, decisions we  make today have the impact of what kind of options we have both in the military and diplomatic sphere 10 and 15 years from now. 
   This country has controlled the skies since the Korean War, and we take it for granted. We have forgotten that we have flown a military sortie every day of every year for the past 16 years, and we have done so with the oldest fleet in the history of this country. Our newest plane, the F-16, is 30 years old. It is older than the pilots who fly it. There are F-16s at this time that are restricted as to the speed and the distance in which they can fly. We have 63 C-130 cargo planes that cannot fly if they actually have any cargo. We have KC-135s that generals in the field will not accept because the age of the plane makes it impossible to protect. 
   Despite our best efforts at our depots to try and fix these planes and patch them up, we cannot ignore the reality and forget we are in a difficult situation with the capacity of our military equipment. It may take, indeed, a catastrophe, the wings falling off, until we recognize the situation we are in, or find ourselves shorthanded in a time of need. 
   The Air Force has asked for the ability of recapitalization, taking 1,000 planes they have determined to be excess and no longer funding those planes and instead putting that money into new technology. This Congress has failed to allow them to do so on many of those planes. 
   If we had sufficient F-22s, we could get rid of all of our F-117s and save this country over a billion dollars a year over a 5-year period of time. 
   While we have been playing around in America, our enemies, our allies, and maybe those who in the future will become our enemies have not been sitting still. The Chinese have added 10 percent to their military budget every year since 1990. That is a 200 percent increase over the past 17 years. Their navy is expanding. Their medium-range missiles are expanding. In January, they conducted a test to shoot down one of their own satellites which is the same type we depend upon for communications in the United States. And more significantly, their Jian-10 is a sleek new fighter aircraft designed to narrow the gap between the Chinese and the American Air Force to give them numerical compatibility and technical equality to the United States Air Force. 
   The Russians have a new Sukov fighter airplane that they have already fielded which is technologically equal to what we have. 
   We have even found a Third World country like the Indian Air Force has put so much money into their technology and training of their pilots that in many respects they are equal to the United States. 
   We cannot afford to wait for the future. This country needs to build the fifth generation of fighters, the F-22. We need all 183. Actually, we need 300, not just the 183 we have authorized. We need to put money directly into the new F-35s. That is the future: 1,500 planes for both the Navy, the Marines and the Air Force to be the next generation to give us technological superiority in the skies and maintain superiority in the skies into the next decade. 
   If we do not do that, we are desperately playing and gambling with our own future. We forget how long it took to ramp up to be producing the F-16s we fly today. This country should be producing 200 planes a year. Instead, in our budget for next year, we have scheduled to produce six, and two in the supplemental that were taken out. We are gambling with the future of this country because we have taken the past for granted. 
   In fact, as one general half jokingly said, if we are not willing to appropriate the money to let our Air Force build the new equipment and planes they need, maybe we should at least give them the opportunity to purchase the Russian planes so they can be flying something that is new. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot gamble with the future of this country. We cannot make the same mistakes we did in 1938. We need to put money into the building of the F-22 and the F-35 for the future of this Air Force.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, there is a song in a Broadway musical that reads ``there's a fine, fine line between reality and pretend.'' That signifies, I think, what this House has been doing this last week. 
   There is a real energy crisis that's harming people. There was a real energy solution, an all-of-the-above, that was not allowed the courtesy of an open debate. Instead, we passed a pretend bill that pretended to open up the offshore when it did not, that pretended that the oil in ANWR does not exist, that pretended that coal and nuclear is not a part of our solution, that pretended that there is enough money to develop alternative sources when there is not, that pretended to be a serious solution, but all it did is allow anybody, whether they voted for or against it, to go home to his or her district and say, ``I did something on energy.'' 
   We were on the cusp of doing something great, but instead, the reality is all we did is legitimize the cynicism people have of this particular body. We could have done so much more. The fact that we did not is a sad indictment of the process of this Congress.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, we have heard before that Big Oil is trying to gouge the consumer, and now Big Oil is down there trying to hide this stuff, in an effort to find another scapegoat or say there is a big conspiracy that is causing our problems,  rather than 30 years of failed policies on behalf of this Congress. And now we are doing this on a suspension where we have half the time to debate, no amendments are possible in an effort to stop discussion. 
   The fact of the matter is 68 percent of all oil leases and 87 percent of all natural gas leases are done by small companies, small companies who need to produce to put food on the table. Is it logical that they are actually part of a conspiracy to hide the oil beneath the ground? This bill is nothing more than another law with a layer of bureaucracy put on it than we already have. 
   But maybe, for the gentlelady of Oklahoma, maybe the Democrats have something here. Maybe we should be looking at this tactic for other areas. Like we all know 18-year-olds and women have the right to vote. Maybe we can pass another law to let them vote; this time, they can use it or lose it. 
   Or I know free speech is in the Constitution. Maybe we can say we all have free speech, unless we use it or lose it. I think there are some Members of this body who would never lose it. Or faith, use it or lose it. Or maybe a brain. You can use it, or you can become a Member of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey for helping to organize this, as well as talk about these topics, and every once in a while to take the process that we probably should be doing more often and simply review our actions and see if they deal with some type of philosophical basis. 
   When the Founding Fathers established this country, they established a Federal system with the understanding that certain powers and responsibilities would be given to the national level and certain powers and responsibilities on the local level. 
   Now, this was not done in some random process. They took the time to try and figure out which would best fit in which category, realizing there are some tasks of government that naturally would be better done if they were done on a unified level, and certain other responsibilities that would be best performed by local government. 
   One of those that they decided would be better performed, and I should say best performed, a superlative, by local government was the manner of elections. And they clearly realized that if elections were the purview and responsibility of States that they had a better opportunity of being effective and  less chance of being corrupt in so doing. 
   Some of our European allies when they restructured their governments after World War II also did the Federal system; and once again they divided powers and responsibilities between national and local levels. 
   And one of the powers and responsibilities given to the local level, for obvious reasons of effectiveness and lack of corruption, was that of the manner of elections. 
   The State of Utah, I'm very proud to say, had wonderful registration rolls when I was in the legislature and in a leadership role there, and actually our voter registration I thought was fairly accurate. That's the reason we do have voter registration anyway is to prevent fraud. 
   In the 1800s, we talked about this wonderful process of everybody voting in America, but we don't really know how many people actually voted, only the number of votes that were tabulated, for we had in history this process or this individual known as a floater who was paid between $5 and $20 per vote. In fact, I have to admit within my own family one of my ancestors was given the day off with pay to vote. He voted in his workplace, took a train and went down to the capitol and voted a second time, and then went home and wrote about how he voted a third time. The reason we have voter registration is to prohibit that today. 
   I was in the leadership in the legislature when the Federal Government in its wisdom came up with the Motor Voter Act which took our wonderful rolls and registration systems and bloated them beyond compare. When we were able to purge voter rolls after 4 years, we now had to do it after 10 years. When everyone was asked whenever they got a service from the government if they'd like to register, and they couldn't remember if they registered or not, they re-registered them. 
   If you look at the number of people in Utah who are registered in a State that has the largest percentage of kids of any State in the Nation, the numbers don't fit of those who are registered and those who are simply eligible to vote. So I don't really know what percentage is voting. We're making guesses there. 
   The greatest thing of all in this entire program is the Federal Government gave us as a State the great privilege and honor of paying for it all ourselves. At that time I was sad the 17th amendment was in place because had it not been there and the State legislature selected senators, I can promise you that bill would have changed or our Senate delegation would have changed. 
   Then the Federal Government assisted States again while I was still back in Utah with the Help America Vote Act. Now, I have to admit that we in Utah did not have the problem of hanging chads as some certain southern States that will not be mentioned did have. We had a definition of what a vote was and was not, and we looked at every ballot of those punch cards to determine if it was a legal ballot before it was ever run through the system. 
   Our system was effective, it was efficient, it was cheap; but we complied to the Federal Government's assistance to make everything better with the Help America Vote Act. Now, the Federal Government did give us some money, but certainly not enough to pay for the entire system. So at great expense, the State of Utah and other States changed their election system at the dictate and mandate of the Federal Government. I have to say we may actually probably have a better system, but it's also a much more expensive system. 
   We now have a proposal given to us by Members of the Democratic side that would force another change in the system that has just established under the Help America Vote Act, another system that requires even my State, which has a paper trail system in place, to change it because we don't have the right kind of paper. 
   The reality is I think, and I think that the Constitution and our Founding Fathers would tell us, if you really want to have a good election system just get out of the way and let the States fulfill their constitutional responsibility of the manner of election, and there would be greater efficiency and less likelihood of corruption. We should not be micromanaging States. One size does not fit all. 
   The State of Utah, in a poll conducted by BYU, has a 95 percent competence in our system of government, which if the opposition bill were to pass would have to be totally changed, and we would once again bear the costs and burden of doing that. 
   Now, I know that our good friend from Iowa (Mr. King) has another bill in that would probably address many of these issues and many of these problems. I think, Mr. Garrett, if it's all right with you as the chairman of this caucus, if we were maybe to hear from the gentleman from Iowa at this time to at least express another way of getting around what appears to be another mandate that would change and add significant difficulty to States what they don't need: the heavy-handed help of the Federal Government.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. If I could just add a couple of those to it. It is true. When George Washington was first elected to the House of Burgess, he bought a round of drinks for all the supporters. And my students would obviously wonder, well, how do you know who his supporters were? The idea of a secret ballot is a pretty modern concept. In the good old days, when you came into the town centers you said, and when the vote was counted and they asked how many were for George Washington, they stood up. He saw who was voting for him; he knew they were there. Everything was an open process at that particular time. And that is why in England you stand for election; you don't run like we do. Because literally you could come up there in the election and you would have to stand for the election. 
   I used to watch these cartoons on Thomas Nast right after the Civil War. I saw one where there was this globe for which one Union soldier was reaching, I had no idea what it was, it was a clear crystal ball, until I realized what he was reaching for was a ballot box which was clear. And the gentleman is right, you would get a ballot from a campaign; you would go in there, and you would deposit your colored ballots so everyone knew. In fact, in New York City at one time, in case they were color-blind, they would perfume their ballots so you could smell it if you couldn't see it. But the idea of a secret ballot is something that is just recently here.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate what you just said, because almost everything you are trying to explain in kind of a system that would work happens to be exactly what we are doing in the State of Utah without having the Federal Government tell us how to do it. So we do have that voting system where you do see the paper ballots there, and you look at the paper trail  that is there as well as the actual touch screen, and you are asked if the paper is what you want. You don't take it with you, but it is there as part of the audit trail. 
   And we actually do require picture IDs when you come into vote. And even I, in my voting district, in fact literally the lady who lived across the street from me was there and I still had to produce a picture ID before I could get my card to go vote. 
   One of the problems, though, that I see and one of the reasons why we need an alternative to what the bill that came out of the committee is, simply, even the State of Utah would have to change its process, even though we are doing exactly what they want, because it doesn't fit the kinds of machines that are mandated, it doesn't fit the kind of paper that was mandated, it doesn't fit the kind of audit process that is mandated. This bill tells you what to do with long lines, it tells you what to do with provisional ballots, it tells you what to do with recounts, and it says you have to do it now. 
   And that is one of the reasons why I am grateful there are some other options out here, because the bill that may be on the floor, the bill that did come out of the committee, the bill is simply flawed in many ways, and it is simply flawed because, once again, it has the mindset that the Federal Government is going to tell you how to do things in the most intricate way of micromanagement. And that is one of the flaws we have. This country is never supposed to be micromanaged from this body.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to join both of my colleagues from Utah, as well as, apparently, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee in expressing our profound sympathies for the Utah families who lost their loved ones at the Crandall Canyon mine. I'm not a miner, but I have been told that unless one has been a miner, it's impossible to understand the profession, the mindset and the courage that is displayed by those who work daily under dangerous conditions so that the rest of us can live in an element of comfort. 
   Today, this body honors six competent, courageous men who labored to  provide a better future for their families and all of us. 
   On August 6, the Crandall Canyon mine experienced a shift in the Earth that registered a 4 on the Richter scale at the nearby University of Utah. This left almost 2,000 feet of debris between the working area of the mine and the last known location of these miners. Kerry Allred, Don Erickson, Luis Hernandez, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Manuel Sanchez were lost in this catastrophe. 
   In addition, three very courageous heroes sacrificed their lives to rescue their fellow miners. Only miners fully understand this commitment to those they consider brothers. Dale Black, Brandon Kimber, Gary Jensen, miners and a mine safety official lost their lives during this rescue effort. We cannot also forget the five other miners and the Mine Safety and Health Administration officials who were injured in this effort. 
   Dozens of miners and officials put their life at risk by entering this mine to try and find and recover their colleagues, and over a period of 4 weeks the rescue efforts tried to reach these men through the working section of the mine, as well as horizontally, with seven bore holes drilled in a vain attempt to find the trapped miners. This self-sacrifice has been demonstrated throughout mining history. 
   I have the firm belief that this life is not finite, and we shall all be reunited again; that these noble men who lost their lives will be reunited with their loved ones in the future. And though the separation may be short, it is extremely difficult for those left behind to bear that separation. 
   I applaud our colleague, Congressman Matheson, for introducing this resolution, one which deals with the sympathy for those who were involved in this particular effort and as an effort to try and comfort them at this particular time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CAPTIVE PRIMATE SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I wish to yield myself such time as I may consume and I would like to raise a few issues that give me pause. 
   As a matter of full disclosure, neither I nor any member of my family own a pet capuchin, a howler or a spider monkey. However, I admit that I'm not particularly fond of those annoying rally monkeys that seem to show up during the American League baseball playoffs. 
   This legislation would amend the Lacey Act to make it a Federal crime to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire or purchase a nonhuman primate pet in either interstate or foreign commerce. This measure contains the distressing trend of federalizing yet another issue that clearly falls under the jurisdiction of State fish and wildlife agencies. In fact, more than 40 States already either prohibit the ownership of monkeys or require a license or permit to own them. 
   It also begs the question of why is there an overriding need for this legislation? According to the proponents, nonhuman primates attack people and spread deadly diseases. Yet there have only been 132 documented incidents over a 10-year period where nonhuman primates have injured a human primate. Of these incidents, 80 involved primate pets, not covered by this bill, or less than eight attacks per year. By contrast, man's best friend sends more than 100,000 people to the hospital each year, not to mention the numerous romps in the yard ruined by the discovery of a substance left by the neighbor's schizophrenic canine friend. 
   Furthermore, we heard testimony before our committee that there is no documentation of pet primates being a threat to public safety. In fact, there have been no instances where a captive nonhuman primate pet has caused a disease transmission or human death. While I am not a betting man, the chances of being bitten by a pet nonhuman primate in this country appears to be about one in 38 million. 
   Since this is hardly a public safety issue, I wish to address this body--or direct this body if there are any Members of the body actually here--to the cost of this legislation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will cost $4 million a year for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who opposed this bill, to hire additional staff to conduct inspections and investigations to enforce this act. On a per incident basis, this represents about a half million dollars in U.S. public taxpayer money per bite. At that rate, I hope I can apply for the job. 
   At a time when our national debt is approaching a staggering $9 trillion, certainly it is legitimate to ask whether this is a wise use of taxpayer money, especially in light of the fact that the States have been and are quite capable of regulating the nonhuman primate pet trade now and in the future. Maybe we should actually spend more of our time with the human primates' energy issues instead of the nonhuman primate pet trade nonissue. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CAPTIVE PRIMATE SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I think I am ready to finish out here. 
   One of the problems that we have had over the past is an effort, as we try to look at energy independence, is to find some kind of scapegoat, someone whom to blame, usually a corporation. The reality is that is not what we should be doing. What we should be doing is finding commonsense solutions to the problem. 
   Oil companies already are putting billions of dollars into research, but for every one of those holes that are drilled, there is always a delaying concept that sometimes will last between 7 and 10 years for environmental engineering studies, permitting, and then even comes the litigation and the regulation on top of that. 
   The bottom line is still, on our offshore coast, 85 percent and onshore 67 percent of all our land is permanently locked away where there is no way of getting to the resource assets that are there. That's the reality of what's taking place. 
   May I also address this bill specifically as well. The gentlelady from Guam has given seven examples of situations and problems with nonhuman primates, monkey bites. Unfortunately, every situation that was given was already covered in existing law, and the bill before us would in no way cover any of those situations. 
   This deals simply with transportation. It doesn't deal with the situations that were brought up. Once again, this bill does not fit the examples that have been brought up as to why the bill should be there. 
   The bottom line is still the Department of the Interior is opposing this bill because they say it is new enforcement mandates. They're enforcement mandates in areas they have not been historically responsible because their area is in the area of wilderness and wildlife conservation. This does not meet it. 
   And indeed, the Interior Department once again said that this bill is coverage that is duplicative of existing laws. And that's one of the reasons why we have a problem with this particular bill, in an area to try to expand what we're doing in an area which ought not be expanded because local governments and States have a better way and can easily, easily solve this particular problem without the extra expense to the national taxpayer. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I will yield back the balance of my time.

   The gentlelady from Guam has, once again, in her role as the bill manager, adequately explained the legislation that has been introduced by our colleague from New Mexico, Tom Udall. And it is also supported by our committee colleague, the ranking member on the Energy and Mineral Resources subcommittee, himself an expert on energy, STEVE PEARCE. Both of them are trying to seek to provide alternative water sources to communities in eastern New Mexico. 
   One thing that is not contemplated in this bill is, of course, how much energy it will take to pump the water over almost 100 miles of pipeline. Water pumping costs for this project will require massive amounts of electricity. It is unclear on how we, as a country, are planning on generating that electricity in the future. But since commitments have been made to work on specific committee report language involving land owner rights and military contributions to this particular water project, we certainly have no objection at this point to this bill and would also urge a favorable vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF AMERICAN EAGLE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise also in support of House Resolution 1247 which endorses the goals and ideals of the American Bald Eagle Day, or American Eagle Day. 
   226 years ago the Second Continental Congress decided to use the image of the American bald eagle on the great American, great seal of the United States. Since that time, the image of this majestic bird has graced our art, our culture, currency, stamps, headbands, and rubber things you put around your wrist. It's been the subject of more than 2,500 published books, making the bald eagle the most extensively studied bird in North America. 
   While we estimate there were nearly 500,000 bald eagles on this continent, this species was particularly devastated by a reproductive failure. In response, Congress did enact the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, and the bird was listed on the Endangered Species Act.     
   From its all-time low of 417 nesting pairs in the continental United States during the Lyndon Johnson administration, extraordinary conservation efforts have saved the bald eagle since that time, and we have witnessed a significant population increase. 
   Today, there are just under 10,000 breeding pairs in the lower 48, not to mention to 30,000 bald eagles living in Alaska. By any objective stand, the recovery of the bald eagle has been remarkable and sadly, one of the few success stories of the Endangered Species Act, an act that obviously needs significant reform. 
   The Secretary of Interior has removed the bald eagle from the Federal list of threatened endangered species, and there is no question that the bald eagle will continue to inspire millions of America, but it symbolizes fundamental values of this country: courage, freedom, patriotic spirit, and of energy development. 
   Under the terms of House Resolution 1247, the people of the United States are encouraged to observe American Eagle Day on June 20, to provide educational information about the bald eagle and our Nation's wildlife resources. And I also urge a ``yes'' vote. 
   And I want to commend and compliment the author of this resolution, Congressman Davis of Tennessee, for his effective leadership in proposing this celebration of American Eagle Day. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Let me yield myself as much time as I will go through here. 
   We're now looking at a whole bunch of issues that deal from an Endangered Species Act that has few examples of success--this one happens to be one of those few--to an energy policy that we have developed over the last 40 years which can only be described as discombobulated. 
   It seems there are a group of people who control this floor whose past policy towards energy development and energy independence was to blame Big Oil, and now that prices of gasoline are at $4 a gallon, $1.75 more than when this Congress started, it seems now we try to have an expanded policy which is to blame Big Oil and allow lawyers to sue OPEC to give us more oil. 
   Simply, it does not come back to the reality of the situation that we have locked resources within this country, both onshore and in this country, that can produce our own energy independence. 
   We have laws that already say if you have a lease, you have 5 to 10 years. The Secretary of the Interior has power already under law that if he thinks that is not being used properly, they have power to abrogate those contractual leases. However, for each one of those, we have 7 to 10 years of regulation, litigation and study, including an Interior appropriations bill that will be coming to the floor either this week or next week, which expands those restrictions and expands the moratorium that we have. 
   The bottom line is 30 years ago this country was producing about 11 million barrels of oil a day, and our need was 17. We had to import. Today, we produce about 8 million barrels of oil a day, and our need is 20, which means we have to import more. 
   We have a 22 percent reduction in production in this United States, and we're the only country in this continent that does that. Mexico has increased. Canada has increased. We have decreased our energy production, even though our needs have come up. 
   The chart you were looking at is somewhat skewed because it deals with only the offshore, and there's a difference to land that's documented and open and not opened to lease. The bottom line is, offshore, there's 1.7 billion acres of area that we could do to produce energy. We are doing 68 million acres. That leaves 1.6 billion acres still undiscoverable, locked away, not usable. That's 85 percent of everything we have. 
   The gentleman from Vermont was correct in which he said speculation is indeed driving the cost of oil, but the speculation is driving the cost of oil because the speculators believe this country will not continue to produce, that we will decline in our production. And until we have a policy that says we are going to increase our production, speculation will continue to increase, and those costs will increase. 
   What this Congress has to have is a comprehensive policy that says we will do more for conservation and we will do more for production of all sources of energy, alternative as well as carbon-based, and we will come up with new and innovative ways of delivering that energy. And until this Congress actually sits down and says we will have a comprehensive energy policy, all the data, all the instructions, everything else we're talking about is nothing more than useless rhetoric. 
   Interesting facts, totally irrelevant to the needs of the time. The needs are people are suffering now, and we need to do something to help those people who are suffering. And we have to have a comprehensive policy which does include increases of production of all sources of energy. 
   The gentlelady from Guam will be happy to know, I'm the last speaker on this bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for the bill that was introduced by our committee colleague, Doug Lamborn of Colorado. The Leadville Mine Tunnel was supposed to be used for a nearby Federal water project but has ended up becoming a public danger. It has been on the verge of bursting and sending what is presumed to be chemical-laden water toward local homes. The Bureau of Reclamation owns the tunnel and must be responsible for resolving the situation. And that is what this bipartisan bill accomplishes. 
   The Leadville Mine, addressed in this bill, was used during World War II and the Korean War to supply critical metals to help our Nation. Years ago, our Nation smartly invested in mining our natural resources. Yet today, the mining industry is under attack by some and by many. And the net effect, of course, has been to outsource U.S. jobs to countries that have commonsense environmental regulations and an increase in consumer prices to those here at home. It would be nice if Congress would promote our own mining industry and not destroy it by 1,000 cuts. America does deserve better. 
   This bill, though, solves a particular problem that is faced in Colorado. It is a bipartisan bill. And I urge its adoption.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution that was introduced by our colleagues from southern California. 
   The Orange County Water District has experienced rapid changes since it was created in 1933. It once relied on pumping ground water for agriculture, now it uses a combination of sources, including imported and recycled water, for its urban needs. Due to environmental litigation, the Orange County Water District will more than likely experience significant imported water cutbacks, leading to higher water costs that will be passed on to the consumers. 
   These same water reductions are forcing family farmers to fallow ground and let their crops die. The situation is so dire the Governor of California, Governor Schwarzenegger, last week declared parts of California under a state of emergency. These same family farmers are experiencing higher costs of living caused by the high cost of water as well as the high cost of gasoline prices. It is almost a perfect storm, and yet we have done nothing to help them to reduce those gas and oil prices. 
   This resolution is a nice reward to Orange County Water District for its hard work over the years, but Congress' time actually should be spent in devising energy solutions because, once again, real people are suffering and real needs are there.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (ENERGY POLICY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate my good friend and colleague from Utah that clearly understands this particular issue. 
   I want to start by introducing you to a character in American history by the name of Elbridge Gerry. Elbridge Gerry is a former Vice President, Governor of Massachusetts, signed the Declaration of Independence. He is also one of three people who spent the entire time at the Constitutional convention and then refused to sign the document. 
   Now, we have had others; the gentleman up to my left who appear on the ceiling, one of the two Americans that we had in this icon of lawgivers in the history of the world. George Mason was one who stayed there and refused to sign the document. He had a specific reason, and that was it didn't have a bill of rights. 
   Elbridge Gerry did not have a specific reason. He had a litany of little ticky issues that he thought were wrong with the document. They are so small and so insignificant that I have yet to find a history book that actually lists the reasons for his refusal to sign this particular document. In fact, I had a teacher that one time told me that he had a personality that was the kind so prickly that if the Savior said that the millennium will start on Tuesday, he would say, I can't do that, I have a haircut; we have to wait until at least Thursday to do it. Now, that is what he did. 
   Despite the fact that he had a litany of problems with the document, the document itself turned out to be a pretty good document. As P.J. O'Rourke would say, the Constitution of the United States is 21 pages that is the operating manual for 300 million people, compared to the operating manual of the Toyota Camry which is four times as long and only seats five. The document worked. 
   Well, one of the problems and the reason I am introducing you to Elbridge Gerry is we have an Elbridge Gerry attitude towards energy policy. We all agree that we need to be energy secure and energy independent, and we agree we have to do that. But we can't have windmills off the coast of Massachusetts. We need to be energy secure, but we can't have a liquid natural gas port on the East Coast. We need to be energy secure, but we can't do any kind of offshore drilling even if it is 100 miles away and no one can see it because it might bother the tourists who can't see the drilling going on. We need to be energy secure, but we won't go up to the arctic in Alaska to an area set aside by the Carter administration for the simple purpose of producing energy, and we won't drill there, as the gentleman from Nebraska just recently explained. 
   We have this idea that we have all these ticky little reasons and details that we won't do this and we won't do that, and the end result is we miss the bigger focus and the bigger issue, and that is we need to be energy secure for our Nation and for the individuals of the Nation. 
   Our policy towards energy has always caused problems. It has caused problems for businesses, has for several years, and it is causing problems in the way people live their life. Because the issue is not our country's energy policy in the abstract; the issue is, how do people cook their food? How do people heat their homes? How do people create and hold on to a job? Because every time the price of energy increases, jobs are lost, incomes vanish, social programs suffer. Every individual in this Nation suffers with higher and increasing energy prices. 
   Rising utility bills are indeed one of the major causes of homelessness in this country. And that means, when energy increases in price and cost, the poor and those on fixed income, and there is about 43 million of them in the United States, are the first ones who are hurt and suffering. And how do our people react to this? 
   There is a couple in Maryland who have decided to take their kids out of weekend activities. So their daughter that was in dance and gymnastics, they no longer drive them to these activities. A Vermont church found itself recently in a $10,000 arrears simply because it didn't budget enough for its energy. In Maine, in Wisconsin, schools simply have lowered the temperatures in their classes. So, in a district in western Wisconsin the kids in the winter are now wearing fleeces and zip sweaters, to the fact that they even had a fashion show to show kids how to dress warmly as they are now coming to schools. Unfortunately, they held it on a day when it was snowed out, but that is still the fashion show they tried to do. In Louisiana, they no longer run their sprinklers on the ball field. In North Dakota, they are talking about a four-day school week. In Iowa, they have cancelled trips for choirs, athletics, and field trips for the junior high kids. 
   And schools simply don't have a way of handling this. You can't just put more money into the heating salary. Schools are on a very tight budget,  with the majority of schools' budgeting coming from the cost of salaries, which simply means if energy prices increase, teacher salaries will decrease. They simply can't afford to do it in any other particular way. 
   We have a Chicago nurse who has cut out her cable television. She can't afford it anymore. Elderly people on fixed incomes especially feel trapped in their apartments because they do not have the flexibility to go anywhere. They can't afford to. We have an example of an elderly gentleman in St. Paul, Minnesota who now travels most of the time on his electric wheelchair because electricity comes with his rent and that is for free, and he can plug it in in the apartment and he doesn't have to buy gas to get around. Now, that is what is happening to real people. 
   It is happening to the country as well. In the military defense of this country, our costs in the last 3 years for energy for our military has risen from $3 billion a year to $7 billion a year. 
   Our increase in prices are putting our Nation at risk, are putting individuals in jeopardy, and we simply cannot afford to talk about it any longer. We cannot afford to have secret plans that we refuse to identify any longer. We simply have to do something. Because for every dollar spent on higher energy costs, it is a dollar you can't spent on luxuries like tuna casseroles; for our energy is the great social equalizer of this country and it is the one that creates economic opportunity in this country. Our energy should not be those who are rich in government or rich in society or rich economically, the elite that can afford this. 
   One of our Presidential candidates went in one day on three different jets, each of which spewed out 25,000 pounds of CO  
   2 per hour. Now, the average American spews out 15,000 pounds of CO 
   2 per year. And the solution to that was simple: Recognizing that they are now adding to the emissions in the atmosphere, they paid $11,000, and urged you to all buy mercury light bulbs made in China by coal-powered plants. 
   Another one of our good friends who makes a great deal of emphasis on the fact of global climate change and global warming lives in a house that consumes 20 times the amount of electricity that an average house does in this country. And his solution to that? Paying offsets that he uses his own company to pay the offsets. 
   We have a concept right here now of the elite who are not cutting back on their energy consumptions; they are simply paying for it with offsets in a similar way as medieval dukes used to pay for indulgences with the 
   church. And yet, while they are still living in comfort in the elite, what we have is a situation that is harming individuals, and especially individuals who are poor, on fixed incomes, and the elderly. 
   That is one of the reasons the Western Caucus will be introducing shortly a comprehensive energy bill, one that realizes that if we are going to solve this problem, not just talk about it but solve it, there are three principles that have to be introduced: 
   We must increase the production of energy in this country. And we are going to have multiple speakers who will be talking on that aspect. That won't work alone. We also have to increase our efforts of conservation. We cannot solve the problem of our energy future without conservation efforts. But, we cannot solve the problem of our energy independence and our energy security needs by conservation alone. It has to work with other principles. Because it is true, every gallon that we save, every watt of electricity that we do not use is a gallon that does not have to be imported, does not become emitted. 
   Yet, even by the strictest standards of conservation alone, we can account for only about one-half of the amount of oil that we import into this country every year. It would be hypocritical to rely on this. In fact, it would be, as the Ron Arnold book title says, our goal would be ``Freezing in the Dark.'' It has to be more than that. 
   In addition to that, though, there is a third element that has to be there that will be an essential part of this bill, which is innovation. If you go back to the turn of the century, Jules Verne could not have imagined what would have happened in the next 100 years. He could not have imagined going from radios to I-pods, and rockets, computers, going from antibiotics to organ transplants. Couldn't even have imagined bottled water. But that has been the reality of the past 100 years. 
   We have technological abilities that sometimes come slow and sometimes come as fast as new cell phone plans that will provide the ability to use these two concepts to reach the needs so that we can become energy secure. We have certain specific problems that need to be addressed in this process of innovation. We have not had a new refinery built since 1976. In 1980, we had 324 in this country; today, there are 148 that are operating. We can produce 17 million barrels of oil per day from our refinery capacity. Unfortunately, this country needs 21 million barrels of oil per day from our refinery capacity. 
   We have outdated processes and regulations that need to be put in place along with tax reform to encourage both conservation and production. 
   We use about 5 million miles of electricity distribution and 1 million miles of natural gas distribution lines. That is not enough. We need to be developing new corridors so that we can more easily transport energy from section to section. 
   One of the other areas we are looking at is also the workforce. There has been a 90 percent drop in the number of petroleum engineers and geoscience graduates since 1982. At that rate, by the year 2010 we will find a 38 percent shortage in this critical profession that we need to try and find our way to use the knowledge that we have to build and move us into the future. We need to come up with smart meters, point of sales generations. We need to use the technological abilities that we have to find solutions. 
   We need to use a system that has financial rewards and prizes to reach our technological goals, because we have found that voluntary innovation and experimentation are always preferable to bureaucratic or international intervention and regulation. Former efforts that failed were not driven by market forces, but they were driven into failure by self-serving governments. We need to combine all these three areas into one. But we cannot overlook the first and most important effort, which is simply production. 
   We in the West perhaps have a different attitude. To be honest, the West produces the energy the East consumes. So I think by all rights we have the ability to be a little bit holier than thou, both realistically as well as spiritually. But the issue is, we have the ability in this country to be energy secure. The stuff is here. There is more energy imprisoned in this country than most nations actually have, and all we have to do is simply be wise enough to realize we need to go at it, we need to develop it, we need to conserve it, and we need to be creative in the way we distribute it. 
   We can talk all day as some people do about profits that the companies are receiving, what we should do with those profits. At the end of that discussion, you have to realize it is a useless discussion, because you can talk all day about what we do with profits. Not one new barrel of oil is provided to anybody by that discussion. The only thing we need to do is start talking about going to where the energy is and developing it, conserving it, and being smarter in the way we do it. That means an attitude change. So our goal is to produce, to conserve, and be smarter in the way we do it. And by that method, that method, we will solve the problem. 
   This Nation needs more than anything else to not talk about the issues any longer, not have secret plans about the issues any longer, but simply to do it. We have the resources, we have the capability, we have the ability to provide for ourselves into the future. And it is almost criminal if we do not do that in a comprehensive and intellectual way. 
   I still have faith that this country can proceed into that future, and I hope America will join us in this effort to meet these criteria. And I applaud my good friend from Utah, who understands this issue instinctively, and his effort to bring this to the attention of the American people with a lot of different people who understand elements of this, and hopefully we can bring together a comprehensive plan for the future of this country so that we can have energy security and energy independence for our future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. The gentleman is perfect, right on with this one. The problem we have is a simple concept of supply and demand. If the demand is great and the supply is not, the price goes up. And how do you simply get the price to come down? You increase the supply, whether by production increases or conservation increases or new technology increases. But, once again, spot on accurate. 
   If we don't do that, it's kids who are freezing in classrooms; it's elderly who are stuck in their homes by the fear of going anywhere because they can't afford to get back; it's poor people who will lose their jobs because we don't have enough energy to expand the market. 
   That's why we do this. We do this for people who are counting on us to have a wise, comprehensive policy. 
   And we've found also, if you ask, prizes are a wonderful way because people are so creative. People are innovative. And if we allow that spark of creativity and innovation to come forth, we can solve every problem that we face. And it doesn't have to be done by experts sitting in a room in Washington. People have the ability to do that, and they have the ability to do it better than probably we can.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (NIGHT LIFE IN SALT LAKE CITY -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, almost a fortnight ago, one of our colleagues, the gentleman from Massachusetts, was waxing eloquent about congressional experts, which he considered to be an oxymoron, as he said, similar to jumbo shrimp or Salt Lake City night life. 
   I have the opportunity of representing the central and western side of Salt Lake City, along with my colleague, who hopefully will be here later, who lives in and represents the east side of Salt Lake City, Mr. Matheson. Now, it's true I don't live in Salt Lake City. I live in a much quieter area 60 miles north of a town appropriately called Brigham City. But in my younger, wilder college days, I did live in areas that I now represent in Central City and Capitol Hill in Salt Lake, an area similar to this except about 4,000 feet closer to the heavens. 
   I want you to know in the night life, every evening when you went out, on almost every corner you could find an ice cream parlor. If I ever wanted to forget my worries and drown my sorrows, I could easily have a second glass of warm milk. There are some nights we put our pajamas on before 8:00, the one without the feet. Even now we will occasionally stay up long enough to watch Letterman go through his top 10. Our night life, and he says there is no night life, when we wanted to go out at night, we would take off the working Wranglers, put on the clean Wranglers and go down to 7-Eleven and find the new Slurpee flavors of the month. 
   For a gourmet night, we could even load up the minivan and supersize number 5 with extra mayo, for everyone except for the driver, because we don't allow drinking and driving. That's why some of our cabbies die of thirst. And you say we have no night life? 
   It's true our happy hours are determined by how much green Jell-O is available, because a party is not a party without green Jell-O and carrot bits. Indeed, if you order a mixed drink, it will definitely involve chocolate syrup and milk, but you still have to stir vigorously with the straw. And he says we have no night life? 
   Our baseball fans, after the seventh inning, can order all the root beer they want. Admittedly, it causes road rage. I remember the last time I came out when my buggy was cut off by a buckboard wagon, and I have to admit, I said some expletives, like, oh my,  heck, move that frigging nag. But to say we have no night life? 
   Now, lest any other myths continue on here, I do want to tell the gentleman from Massachusetts, if he wants to see Tony Award-winning regional drama, he will have to come to Utah, and he will fly into one of the busiest hubs in the Nation, which is Salt Lake International. 
   If he finds himself seated at Pioneer Memorial Theater or Kingsbury Hall or Rose Wagner Theater, Capitol Theater, he will be seeing Broadway-quality plays all done by equity actors, or he will be listening to some of the finest music done by the Utah Opera Company or the premiere ballet of the West, which is Ballet West, which is headquartered in Utah, or watching the award-winning Repertory Dance Theater. 
   If he finds himself in Abravenal Hall, he will be listening to one of the best symphony orchestras in the Nation. If he is at Franklin Covey Field, he will watch the sun shine on the eastern mountains in the Wasatch over the left field berm as he sits in probably what has been considered one of the nicest and most beautiful baseball stadiums, watching the AAA-Division-leading Salt Lake Bees. He can find private clubs and dance clubs and comedy clubs and concerts and even, although I don't recommend it, get drunk in Salt Lake City.     
   He might even be able to listen to a debate between a publicity-seeking mayor and a radio talk show host about Iraq, in which case he would probably want to be drunk. It may just have been under those night lights that he didn't see much going on; that it was one of the nights when the Utah Jazz, even though they have had two rough difficult nights, were still involved in the hunt for the NBA title, something which a team in his State can't say. 
   In short, I would simply recommend and invite the good gentleman from Massachusetts to come and visit our State. I would suggest, perhaps, though, he should bring an interpreter with him, because in Utah we still do not put an R at the end of our vowels.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the headlines in the papers could probably read ``Scramble the Eggs Because We're Bringing Home the Bacon.'' 
   We are going to be leaving for Memorial Day weekend. We will have the ability of standing in front of our constituents, looking them straight in the eye, and saying that one of the last things we did before we went back home was to cast a vote for something that can be described as one of the biggest pieces of pork legislation we have. A contingency from North Carolina, both congressional and senatorial side, come to Washington and they brought something back home. Even though this particular bill does not meet the definition of general welfare as was intended in the Constitution, does not meet a critical need, does not enhance the purpose of a specific park that we have, it does spend money upfront and will yearly require this country to have a larger financial obligation. And it does also tell us that enough votes can deliver anything regardless of the merits. 
   We intend to show to all those who may be listening that this bill fails on the size, the cost, and the logic of it. We intend to introduce three amendments eventually within this process. One that will say that 5 acres included in this recommendation has logic to it, that we admit that is truly there. There is a need for safe public parking and a visitor center, which is the 5 acres they requested. 
   We will also present an amendment which will say the first thing we need to do is make sure that we are dealing with the backlog of resource needs that we have. This particular park, according to the National Park Service, has $600,000 worth of construction needs in the regular park itself, which we should be doing before we try any kind of expansion. 
   We will also be introducing, by Mr. Heller of Nevada, an amendment that says if this land wishes to be donated, we will accept it. 
   Had any of these three amendments been adopted in the committee, the committee of jurisdiction, this bill would probably be here as a suspension bill. But when the attitude is it's all or nothing, rejecting any kind of minority input, we will probably object for the logic in this bill. This bill can be jammed through by the numbers but certainly not by the logic. 
   Mr. Chairman, I realize the chief sponsor is here, and I think it would be only fair to allow him to have the opportunity to speak now in defense of his bill before I go on. 
   Mr. Chairman, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This bill authorizes the purchase of 115 acres. I have already said 5 acres is legitimate. There is a need for safe parking and a visitor center, and that is the amount of space that they need. It is the other 110 acres which, unfortunately, fits the title of ``pork.'' 
   This park is about Carl Sandburg. It is supposed to venerate his life and his literary legacy. Unfortunately, the extra 110 acres has absolutely nothing to do with his life or literary legacy. 
   The National Park System said, and some that sit here on the floor, that this land would protect the viewshed. The logical question is what viewshed? The ridge is the natural boundary of this park. The land to be adopted is over the ridge, which means you stand anywhere in that extra 100 acres and you can't see the house from that acreage. You stand at the house and you can't see the acreage unless we give you some complimentary periscopes. Simply, there is no view to deal with. 
   The county came up here and said, well, this park has evolved, kind of like Jurassic Park, and now we are trying to protect some of the historic pasturelands.     
   Historic pasturelands? This is about Carl Sandburg. He wrote about Abraham Lincoln. He did not invent Arby's. 
   They also said during the committee that this is to protect the resources. The resources of this park is the house. You could be on that 100 acres they want to add, and the house could burn to the ground, and you wouldn't know about it until the fire trucks from the town came running by the road to get there. This has nothing to do with preserving and protecting the vast purpose of this particular park. I've got four problems with this bill, this is the first one. 
   The second one deals with the cost. When we had the hearing in the markup, it was said that this bill would cost between 2- and $3 million. CBO has now scored it at $7 million. They have also said it will incur to the Federal Government an ongoing expense of a half million dollars a year. This park already costs about $1.2 million to run. They bring in about $100,000 to $200,000 worth of revenue a year, so it is a $1 million drag on the Federal Treasury at first. This will add to that, making it a $1.5 million net deficit every year the existence of this park is there. 
   Now, some people will say, look, it's only 100 acres. We're only talking about $7 million. In the scope of what we do here in the Nation, that's not much. But if you actually spend $7 million here, 2- or $3 million there, pretty soon you realize that we are in a situation where we have squandered all our money, and we don't have anything for those deserving projects that actually are before us. 
   The National Park Service said this park itself needs $600,000 in maintenance work. It is galling that a park system that is always talking about the need would in any way recommend or that we as a body would adopt that recommendation to try and expand into areas that we are not necessarily dealing with. 
   I show you this picture right now because it is Dinosaur National Monument. It straddles the border between Utah and Colorado. This is the visitors center. I used to go there. This is exciting. The entire mountain has been scaled back, and you can see the fossil remains of dinosaurs. Unfortunately, this is condemned. No school kid can ever go into this building or see the fossil remains. No Park Service employee can go in there because this is on the backlog of stuff that needs to be done. 
   Before we buy extraneous territory that adds to something that has nothing to do with the mission of the park, we should solve these types of problems first, because the money we use to buy this land in North Carolina is money that will not be used in real parks, for real needs, for real issues anywhere else in the Nation, in California, in Arizona, in New Mexico, in Maine. None of those will receive that. It is simply a misplaced sense of priority. 
   Now, this area was represented in the past by a gentleman who used to chair the appropriations subcommittee that dealt with public lands. He could have easily added this kind of money to an appropriations prospect. But having the ability of seeing the overall needs that we have in our forest system, our  parks system, our public lands system, he flat out didn't. He did take, instead of a parochial view, a very patriotic view of the needs of this country, and I am hopeful that we will do that as well. 
   There is a third area of concern I have, and that deals with community. To be honest, we are dealing with a community that overtaxed its citizens by $5 million last year. They brought in $5 million more than they spent. They have a general reserve fund of $21 million. If this is definitely needed as open space, because it doesn't really fit the park, but any kind of open space, they could easily do that. Or they could do what cash-strapped cities in the West do, which is simply bond for that kind of an approach. Even the idea that 20 acres was given to the State, and that the State will now dedicate that, still presents another problem because that means that forevermore this county will have additional PILT land, and additional PILT money will be going to that, which, once again, cuts into the amount which is a finite supply for all of us that are left. 
   The fourth reason I have a problem with this bill is simply it's not pork. If this was a significant addition to giving the message of Carl Sandburg, I would not object to it. If this was the 5 acres that is a significant addition for parking, safety and for a visitors center, I would not object to it. But this is simply land that doesn't protect a viewshed, that doesn't have any historical connection with the family. It is land that is simply being gobbled up and will forevermore be subsidized through PILT payments by this body to this county. And when we have these other needs, the question is simply, for what? There is no logic for that. 
   This is a hard place, I know, to deal with logic; but this is one of those bills that simply defies logic. Mr. Chairman, for that reason I have to oppose this particular bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, as I said in the opening remarks, we are going to try to present some amendments that can actually make this into a better bill. 
   This is the first one in which I want to do which simply deals with the backlog we are talking about. 
   This amendment requires the Park Service to eliminate its maintenance backlog at this particular national historic site, the Carl Sandburg site, prior to the purchasing of land. 
   As I said already, there is a $600,000 backlog that the Park Service has said exists already at Carl Sandburg's historic site. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill costs $7 million to implement. Those funds must be prioritized on an ``existing needs'' list, which means the Park Service has the discretion to use the $7 million to buy new land before they actually fix the existing buildings that happen to be there. 
   Overall, the Park Service has a maintenance backlog that's anywhere from $5- to $10 billion. This is not the time to buy more land until we fix the existing problems. Any addition to this park simply exacerbates the problem. And this bill, not only in the overall cost, but also add an additional $500,000 a year on operating costs of this particular park. 
   So once again, Mr. Chairman, this is the purpose of this particular amendment, to say, fine. What we will do, though, is make sure that what we own and what we are operating and what we are using, which is actually the house, it's about Carl Sandburg, should be properly maintained first before the Park System uses any of this money that may be appropriated or any of their dedicated funds that they may have for that kind of appropriation to expand the park. Fix what we have first. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I think it is one of those things that it's a simple question: Do we expand what we have, buy more stuff to take care of, or do we take care of what we have first? And I have to admit that under Republican leadership we have had huge increases in these budgets; however, the need is still significantly there. 
   I appreciate the comments that were made by my colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, as to what those deferred maintenance needs may or may not be. Actually, the Park Service has already done that. They have listed out exactly what needs to be done there. In fact, I said $600,000. I was wrong. It's $599,673 worth of specific maintenance that has to be done on this site first. And it just makes sense that we take care of this first before we do any kind of other expansions; otherwise, we are simply not dealing properly with what should be before us. 
   I appreciate, also, the fact that North Carolina bought the 22 acres, but I would remind you also that they bought it from a group that virtually had the land so it could be kept in open space in the first place, and that as soon as we federalize these acres as well as the other 110 acres, this automatically becomes PILT money available for North Carolina. This is the gift that keeps on giving and the cost that keeps on costing the rest of this Nation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this is the amendment that does what I originally said ought to have been done. There has been compelling evidence that there is a need for 5 additional acres to provide for safe parking enhancement and to provide for a visitors center. In addition, in the testimony we had at the hearing, they asked that this acreage not be made mandatory as contiguous to the park itself to leave them the flexibility as far as the planning process. 
   So what I am asking for this to do is make in order those 5 acres, which I admit is a legitimate request, and it would not include the extra 110 acres that are supposedly for a viewshed protection that no one can see or for a resource that is not related in any way to the purpose of this particular park. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I take some umbrage at the claim that this is an arbitrary number that is taken out. In our hearing testimony, it was very clear from both the park as well as the county that 5 acres was what was needed for the parking and the visitors center. That is not a number pulled out of the air. It was specifically for 5 acres. That is why I have continuously used that particular number. 
   Things have changed, I admit, since the hearing. When we had the hearing, it was said this would totally cost somewhere between $2 million and $3 million. CBO has said today this will cost $7 million and a continuing ongoing fee of $500,000 every year. 
   I would not be necessarily as opposed to this if indeed donation was the goal. It is unfair to the gentlelady from Wyoming, as well as the bill that deals with a donation of land to the Grand Teton National Park, to compare this with that. That was simply a donation. The total cost is zero. The total expansion of that park is expanding the Grand Teton Park by six ten-thousandths of a percent. This particular bill expands this park 44 percent, and if you divide $7 million by the number of acres, that is something around $64,000 an acre. 
   That would be a cost that would be there. There is an ongoing cost and an ongoing decision that the United States needs to go into if we are going to make these kinds of decisions. 
   Like I said, the amendment is straightforward. There is a need for parking. There is a need for the visitors center; 5 acres meets that need. The rest of it is simply not a need, it is not necessary, and we should reject this kind of pork. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I wish to simply address a couple of the issues that have been brought up again. 
   In comparing this particular bill to two others, one specifically still held up in the committee, it is true that one bill did have a donation, which is what he is patterning after, so the Grand Teton bill is very similar to this: Willing donor. 
   The other bill by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jindal) is with the Jean Lafitte National Park. This is the ability of coming up with area that is necessary for protecting from the devastation of hurricanes. It is also area coming mainly from State and local lands, not from private owners, and we do not actually oppose the boundary revisions because it makes sense on a case-by-case basis in this particular area, especially when the cost for the land is only $1,000 per acre. It would only increase the size of this particular national site by 15 percent, not the 44 percent as in this one.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It is indeed an honor for me to be here with the distinguished chairman of the Resources Committee. Through his illustrious career I have been impressed with the way he has run the committee. I've also been impressed with his commonsense approach to issues, except for this one. And I appreciate the opportunity of being here. 
   You know, Mr. Chairman, this is the time of year when everyone has a great deal of hope. This is the beginning of the baseball season, where every team, with the possible exception of the Royals, still has a mathematical chance of winning the division. 
   And as a loyal Cub fan, who is now in my 99th year, consecutive year, of reconstruction and renewal, there is still hope for me. 
   It is also sad because we are about to commemorate very soon the 43rd anniversary of the worst trade made in the history of baseball, according to many scholars. And that trade was a six-player trade in which my Cubs sent three players, including Lou Brock, to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for three other players and Ernie Broglio, who was an 18-game winner at the time. 
   Now, on paper this trade made great sense for the Cubs. They were getting an outfielder, a veteran relief pitcher, and a starting pitcher, a 20-game winner who had won 18 games the year before. 
   What happened in reality, of course, is that Lou Brock accepted the role of a lead-off hitter when he went to the Cardinals and spurred them to not only the Pennant but also the World Series victory on his way to a Hall of Fame career. 
   Broglio, a great pitcher, actually developed arm problems, won only seven games the rest of his career, and 2 years later he is out of baseball. 
   Now, this is known as one of those great trades that looked perfect on  paper but in reality it simply wasn't there. 
   With all due respect, this bill is one of those great bills on paper, but the reality of it simply isn't there. This is an Ernie Broglio bill if there ever was one. 
   Now, I have to admit that I don't have a great deal of personal knowledge about horses. My reference to horses in the last 30 years is probably helping my kid to choose either the striped or the painted one on the merry-go-round. The unfortunate thing is that most of the people who will be voting on this bill have the exact same background that I do have. 
   I am happy to note, though, that I do have a brother who met his wife while he was the rodeo clown, and his wife was in the barrel racing contest and is one the few people who has actually trapped and trained a wild horse on the open desert in Utah and Nevada. So I am using that background from the history as we talk about this particular bill. 
   And as I looked at this bill as it came out of committee and studied it closer, there are five areas in which I think this bill has significant flaws. 
   The first is that this bill does not do what its supporters claim it will do. Not the sponsor. He's been totally honest in this. But many of those who have been writing about this particular bill have exaggerated what it actually does. 
   Secondly, this bill takes away a tool of management from BLM and does not replace it with anything created to help them in their established goal. 
   Number three, this bill has a difficult system in making the ecosystem of the West, the desert West, a more difficult area to manage. 
   Number four, there is indeed an extreme cost that the taxpayers are paying in this program that actually ends up being more abusive of the animals that we are trying to preserve and to help. 
   And finally, I think there is, indeed, a regional bias that can be seen in this particular bill. 
   Now, if I could, Mr. Chairman, I would like to just talk about perhaps that first issue, just that first issues. This bill does not do what the proponents claim. I have seen the Dear Colleague letters from Robert Redford and Willie Nelson, and one came from the Humane Society making all sorts of claims that are actually not done by this particular bill. The reality is, as well-intentioned as this bill may be, there is actually no change in what will happen with the BLM and their priorities. 
   If this bill passes, no horse is actually safer than it would have been. And if this bill fails, no horse is actually going to be eaten in France. The idea is this is a very narrow bill that only deals with BLM and deals with forestlands. It doesn't deal with all public lands, doesn't deal with national parks or wildlife refuges or reservations or military affairs. It has been said there are about 90,000 horses a year that are unwanted. Their owners either cannot or will not maintain them. 
   On BLM lands we are only talking about 7,000 horses, 6,800 last year that were taken off land because of the inability of the land to sustain them. This is only a small portion that this bill deals with, so the overall idea of trying to help all the animals, to stop foreign sales consumption of those, it's not covered in this particular bill. What it does do, though, is take away a management tool the BLM has. 
   And with that, Mr. Chairman, in the coming speeches by my colleagues who will be down here, and as we go through for the next hour this particular bill, I hope to explore those other issues. 
   Therefore, I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Once again it is my pleasure to try to say a couple of other elements. As I said, there were five concerns that we have with this particular bill. 
   The first one, as I mentioned, is it really does not solve the problem. This bill does nothing that the BLM is not already doing in common practice. That is why I said if this bill were to pass, it simply would have no more impact on horses than it does now. No horse would be safer. If it doesn't pass, no horse is going to the slaughter, and no horse is going to be consumed by someone in France. 
   This bill is very, very narrow. It only deals with a portion of the public lands and a portion of the number of horses that are there, not the overall situation. 
   But it does do one thing that is harmful. This is the second element. It takes away the tool, as the gentleman from Colorado clearly enunciated, that is used for the management of wild animals, wild horses, on public lands. 
   There are only two things that we can do. You can either allow these horses that are excess, that are destroying the habitat, that have to be taken off the land, roughly 7,000 last year. About 28,000 are being held in pens right now as we speak that are excess horses, about half of everything the Federal Government actually controls. You can either adopt them, which is a year-long practice and individuals are limited to four adoptees per individual. Or you can sell them. Sell them either for $100 to $2,000, if it is especially a unique animal, and it is limitless. That is what has been happening in the past. BLM has had the ability and about 2,500 horses have been sold. None for consumption purposes. 
   Now, you have to realize that if you buy a horse from the BLM today, by law and by contract it cannot be resold for consumption. It cannot be resold for slaughter. If that happens, that is a felony. That is why this bill does nothing that it is not already doing today. But this bill does take away the ability to sell those animals, which means you are down to the adoption, which is a very difficult process to go through. That means it will be harder for BLM and the Forest Service, which actually doesn't run their process, which always works through BLM, to actually find homes and places for the excess animals on public lands. 
   In taking that tool of management away, this bill does nothing to give BLM a creative solution to the situation. Just saying ``no'' may be a good slogan for a drug policy, but saying ``no'' to the BLM does not help them in their chartered task of trying to manage the herd as well as the ecosystem that is going on there. 
   These horses are not native species to these lands. They do hurt the environment. They trample it down. That is why since 1971 almost a quarter of a million, roughly 200,000 horses, have been taken off the public lands because the habitat is not there for them. 
   The bottom line is there are too many horses for the land that is available. The bulk of these animals are in my State, Nevada, a few in Colorado, and some in Wyoming and Arizona. This is desert territory. It is not the natural habitat of these horses. This is not the idea of horses running over the rolling hills. If you did that, you would probably want to send them back east to where the natural habitat is, but there is no BLM land back there. 
   Actually if you really want to help the situation out, you would take about 150 head and put them in Central Park where they could roam freely without any fear of contamination, disease, or muggings like the New York citizens themselves have back in Central Park. That would really help the situation out. 
   What we have to do here is either allow nature to take its course, in which case these horses will die a pitiful, miserable death of starvation, disease, or by the hands or by the mouths of a predator; or destroy the ecosystem; or, worse, both situations happening, unless we give BLM the tools to remove the animals and find an alternative source for them. 
   This is a cost for the government. In reality we are spending $38.6 million every year to run the wild horse program. The overwhelming majority of that, almost either $20 million to $25 million, depending on which source you look at, is simply for holding these excess horses in pens, not letting them run free, not giving them the freedom in the wild that you think of, but actually holding them in pens. 
   Some of the problems for the horses we look at is sometimes we think of Sea Biscuit as we are talking about these animals, an animal that has been bred and groomed and is well taken care of. 
   These animals fight for their own existence. They are not necessarily the most lovable of animals. And, therefore, they have a hard time being adopted, which means BLM has to put them in a pen where they don't move, they don't do anything except sit around all day and eat. And since they eat and are fed and there are no predators around, these animals can live for up to 30 years at a cost of about $15,000 per animal to the Federal taxpayer, to have them sit around in a pen with no chance of activity whatsoever, in actually a miserable condition. 
   We are spending $20 million a year to be more abusive to animals than they would be if we gave them the tools to actually give them to other sources. We actually allow them to sell in some particular way, which is why the Humane Society, from their air conditioned offices downtown, wrote me and told me to support this bill. The Farm Bureau that actually works with these animals and knows what they are talking about wrote me and told me to oppose this bill. And in past years when we had further variations of this particular concept, veterinarian groups,  horse owners, cattlemen, over 200 organizations that specifically know and understand horses have opposed the concepts that we are trying to codify in this particular bill. 
   So once again I say the problem that we have here in the House is that most people like me have no access and no understanding or knowledge of these animals. They are like me, where the biggest decision they have to make with a horse is whether to put their kid on the horse or the snail on the carousel ride. And we are making decisions that actually go against the attitude and the advice that professionals that work with these animals and that know the situation are asking us to do. And it may seem emotional. It may seem good on paper. But trust me. This is the Ernie Broglio bill. It is not as good in reality as it looks in black and white. 
   Let me also say that to me there is an element of regional bias within this. This is a map of all the public land that is owned in the United States. Everything in blue is the amount of public land owned in the United States. You will notice that there is kind of a balance towards the West. This is where the public land is. This is where the wild horses are. This is desert country. This is not their natural habitat. All of our good friends who are proposing and supporting this type of legislation, unfortunately, are living over here, where there is no BLM land or very little BLM and no wild horse activity, but this is, indeed, the natural habitat. It is unfair to us to try to impose a solution without creative alternatives by the representatives from here on this piece of territory. 
   We know what the situation is, and that is why we are simply asking you, as best we possibly can, to vote ``no'' on this particular piece of legislation. 
   I have avoided using any cliches and any bad puns so far. And, LISA, I need to know what my cliches are. Until now, which means I am asking you to notice that this bill is all hat and no saddle. I am asking you that the horse may be with you, and I urge you to vote ``neigh'' on this piece of legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what Representative Price is trying to do. Let me try and put in context, once again, what the issue at hand in this very narrowly crafted bill is. 
   As of today, by rule, by court order, and by regulation and law, BLM, if it sells an animal, may not sell that animal for consumption. If the buyer resells that animal for consumption, that is a felony. It violates the contract they signed, which means the ability of selling, which is different from adopting, is a management tool of BLM. If this bill passes, it would take the option of sale away. 
   Last year, there were 2,400 horses that were sold. That would no longer be the case. And indeed, BLM would then incur a new burden for keeping those animals and providing for those animals. That is why we support Representative Price's amendment that applies PAYGO standard to this bill. There will be an additional cost because the policy will change. 
   If H.R. 249 passes and the BLM can no longer sell, not for consumption, but just sell wild horses, this agency estimates it will cost $12- to $15 million over the next 10 years. Long-term care and feeding of these animals were not considered when the CBO scored this bill. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS SALE AND SLAUGHTER PROHIBITION -- (House of Representatives - April 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, let me just say a couple of things to try and set the record straight about the last couple of speeches which haven't actually been dealing with the amendment nor necessarily the bill itself. 
   There are approximately 33,000 wild horses on public range lands today. There are 28,000 wild horses that are standing in pens today. That is the total amount. 
   Those animals are not slaughtered. If they are sold or adopted, it is a felony to slaughter those animals. That is the BLM practice today. Any kind of talking about animals being slaughtered for consumption are not the animals owned by the Federal Government nor the animals that are subject to this particular bill. All this bill does is take away the opportunity of selling these animals, not for consumption or slaughter, to someone else. And it takes away a standard which the BLM has estimated will cost them between $10 million and $12 million over the next 10 years to try to keep these animals standing in a pen all day. 
   The problem is, we do have an arid topography. This is not the land that can support these animals. All of my good friends in the east have perfect land for that. And, to be honest, if they would open up some of their land so that wild horses can run freely back in their districts, you might be able to solve this problem again. But it is not going to happen unless you actually give them the tools to do it on this limited number of animals we are actually speaking about.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, the issue at hand today is not the 23 miles of wild and scenic river in what is called the Eightmile River. It is on the use of condemnation power to create it. It is sad in this situation that staff did not decide to work in a bipartisan way to try and come up with language accommodating everybody, instead, rejected in both the Rules and Resource Committees on straight party-line votes, simple and direct language that the Republicans submitted. We asked that it simply read that no Federal funds be used to condemn land to carry out the purpose of that act. Every Democrat, from the sponsor to the committee, said that was indeed their goal. 
   That is simple language in section B. It is short; it's direct; it's understandable to any citizen, any attorney, any judge. That's what we need. 
   Instead, the Democrats gave us a convoluted bit of double talk about zoning ordinances by some date in 2005, later on perhaps, willing sellers, all in the wrong section of the code, section C. 
   It is nice, but it is a loophole. Simply because if you read, not the bill, but the act, read the entire act, you'll find that all of the language that is presented in this section, in this bill comes after this sentence in the law which says, nothing contained in this section, that covers what we're talking about and what they're talking about, nothing contained in this section shall preclude the use of condemnation. This supersedes everything in their bill. All the gobbledygook they want to do, it supersedes it. 
   This is the language to which we object, and the Democrat bill does nothing to mitigate this power of condemnation. 
   I don't care if we're talking about an Eightmile River in Connecticut for Mr. Courtney or 8 miles of road in Detroit for Eminem. This is still the issue that is at hand. In the district where the State and local governments tried to take the home away from Suzette Kelo, we don't want it to be replicated again. This language has to be changed. 
   So all of us need to lose yourself in this language. Read it, for indeed our citizens will. The voters will. It is clear. This is what we need changed.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (NATIVE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) very much wanted to manage H.R. 505 today, but he is on his way to an annual convention of the Alaska Federation of Natives, something that's very important to him as well as to that particular group. So I have consented to manage this issue, though there are few Members in this House who feel as strongly in favor of H.R. 505 as Mr. Young. 
   The sponsor of this bill, the gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) has done something that is very unique in this body. He's written a bill that only affects his own State. Recognizing the Native Hawaiian governing entity does not affect Native American tribes in my State, does not affect the lands or resources in my district. That is something that's becoming very unusual around here. Mr. Abercrombie, you need to be careful, you're almost becoming a Republican. 
   Congress has already enacted dozens of authorizing laws and appropriations bills for the benefit of Native Hawaiians. This bill does not create a new source of funds, nor does it let Native Hawaiians seek funds through the BIA.  
   This bill has the support of the Hawaiian delegation, Governor Lingle and the State legislature. Their judgment should be given some respect. 
   Georgetown Professor Viet Dinh, who was the U.S. Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy in 2001 to 2003, testified that ``Congress has constitutional authority to enact the Native Hawaiian Government Recognition Act, and to recognize a Native Hawaiian governing entity as a dependent sovereign government within the United States or, in other words, to treat Native Hawaiians just as it treats Native Americans and Alaska Natives.'' 
   Professor Dinh explained that when Congress recognizes Native people, it does so in a political way, not a racial way, and he established two criteria that Congress must deem having met in order to exercise this authority. Basically, one, that people must have a native ancestry on lands that became part of the United States; two, they must be members of a distinct native community. H.R. 505 appears to have passed these two tests. 
   This bill deserves a fair and open debate in this body, just as the native people who are seeking formal recognition from the government do. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity you have given us to speak for awhile about public lands and about how the public lands are treated and how the future will and will not deal with those public lands. 
   One of the facts that we have to deal with is how a government deals with property, whether personal property or public property, is a window to the soul of that government. Personal property is tangible and civil liberties are intangible, but both of them are at the center of the historic purpose of this American government, and the preservation of one is indeed the precondition for the preservation of the other. 
   Sir Henry Maine once wrote a book called ``The Village Communities'' in which he said: Nobody is at liberty to attack several property and to say at the same time he values civilization. The history of the two cannot be disentangled. The desire, the use of property, whether it is on land or whether it is the use of public property, that desire is what raises mankind from political slavery. 
   One of the things that we do not often enough around this place is to consider why we are doing what we are doing. Indeed, one of the concepts that is there is that we do what we do because we have done what we always did; and sometimes when you take a moment to look back and reflect on that, in this particular Congress we have been inundated with laws and proposals which have huge and significant impact on personal and public property in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the things I would like to do is try to go through with several Members who are in the West, public land States who understand firsthand the responsibility and relationship of this, specifically what we are doing in these particular areas. 
   One of the people I would like to address some of these issues deals with the public property in our forests. As you know, we are having major fires in this country, and the Speaker on this floor said now is the time we need to do what is right. 
   I would like to yield some time to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and simply ask him to address that, of what can this Congress do to make it right, especially when we deal with our forests and our processes for the future of our forests to make them healthier or better.

I would like him to address just maybe one element. 
   Because of mistakes, I think, that we have made in the past on how we have decided to handle the forests in the future, those counties, those areas where citizens live next to the forest and where the forest becomes an integral part of their lifestyle, are facing a huge and significant problem, and especially their kids in secure rural schools. I wonder if the gentleman for just one second would take a moment to explain what we should be doing right now with relationship to secure rural schools, forest area schools.

The Speaker of the House does have the ability of helping to move that bill along and can change the referral process to bring this one to the floor. And how significant this is, with these particular counties for the so-called secure rural schools, schools that are impacted by our policies in the passed-over forestlands. We need to have that on the floor now, and it has a funding source. It can be moved right now.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman from Oregon for specifically and very eloquently stating what the problems are in our national forests. 
   He, as well as I and many of those who will be speaking this evening, come from what are called public lands States. You see the map that I have to my left. Everything that is blue in those States is the amount of that State which is owned and controlled by the National Government, and you can obviously see that there's a unique difference between the States in the West and the States in the East. 
   Now, a big chunk of this blue in the West is national forests, which Representative Walden understands very definitely, very clearly, and needs to deal with that particular issue. And he's given us some directions on what we need to do to do it right. 
   The other part of this blue deals with land that's owned by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM land, and all of these lands, whether they be forestlands or BLM lands or parklands, have an impact on the States in which we find this particular land. 
   I'd ask my colleague from Utah, Mr. Cannon, if you'd maybe take a moment and talk about how we try to help these Western States that don't have control over their lands but still have the responsibility of providing services not just for the westerners but also the easterners that are coming directly on these lands with a program known as PILT, payment in lieu of taxes. 
   I yield to Mr. Cannon.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. We are talking about what these lands can do and how we can benefit the constituents that are out there in these western lands as well. One of it deals with the bounties that have been placed in there in these western lands, what we can do if we actually bring them about. 
   I am often amazed how we sit under this quotation from Daniel Webster saying that in actuality if we want this country to move, we need to take the resources that are here and develop them. That's where progress comes. 
   The gentleman represents a State in an area that has a significant amount of natural resources that have yet to be developed, and I am talking specifically about oil shale. I notice that he has been joined here on the floor by Representative Peterson of Pennsylvania, two people who understand our energy policy specifically and who realize some of the energy policies that we have been talking about passing on this floor are going to have a negative effect on people, on real people. 
   I wonder if he could spend some time talking about the potential of oil shale and what it can do. I guess the basic question is, is it really possible to remove ourselves from a dependency on foreign sources of energy?

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate it. I hope Mr. Cannon may have a chance to join us a little bit later. 
   We are talking about energy policies. It has an impact on people. We all like alternative forms of energy. That's important. But for the short term, we have to make life bearable for people. We have some options without having to rely simply on foreign sources. 
   Mr. Cannon understands oil shale very well, and he explained how that is one of our options. Another option we have is natural gas, which is a forte of Mr. Peterson at the same time. I guess the question has to be, we understand how high natural gas prices terribly impact citizens trying to live their lives, heat their homes. They impact the job market as well. They impact farmers when it comes time for fertilizer. I guess the question is, can we make domestic natural gas reserves available so it improves the lives of people? 
   If I could ask Mr. Peterson to spend a few minutes, 5 minutes or so, maybe explaining how that part of the energy puzzle can be dealt.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who understands this issue. 
   Let me see if I can borrow that one you have in your left hand. I'm not all that hot on a lot of the details of energy and mining, but I am a school teacher, and I just noticed on the back of this chart is a chart which goes through the salaries of teachers comparing Wyoming and Montana. And you find that a step one teacher in Wyoming is significantly higher than a step four teacher in Montana. And I want to tell you, there's only one reason for that disparity. Wyoming does more with their resources to develop them and use them to help fund their education system. It has all sorts of spin-off effects. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania who understands this concept so significantly and has spoken so eloquently about it. 
   I'd also like to welcome the gentleman from New Mexico who is here, who clearly understands the issue of energy significantly. 
   We will have a potential energy bill before us. We will have next week a potential mining bill before us, both of which could have some difficult situations especially as they deal with Americans. So I'd like to yield to the gentleman from New Mexico to have a chance to talk for a moment especially on what we are doing, once again, as to our constituents.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman from New Mexico coming and talking about these issues, and I think people can realize we feel very strong and deeply about these particular issues. This is what happens in our States. We live with this issue all together. 
   You've heard today about the nature of our forests and what we must do to have healthy forests in the future. You heard about the impact it has on school children in those forest counties. But there is a proposal; it needs to come to the floor that we can debate about that as well. 
   You've heard about the significance of payment in lieu of taxes and what it means to Western States, about oil shale development, natural gas development, mining development, all of these which have an impact. 
   Now, I said earlier on, but once again I'm just an old school teacher. And it does have impacts beyond what we naturally think about. And I'm thinking specifically about my kids, about my salary, my retirement as a school teacher and what we do in the future in our Western States. 
   We noticed before, this is the chart, the amount of blue is how many, how much land is owned by the Federal Government in each State. I'd like you to contrast that, if you would, with this chart. The States in red are the States that have the most difficult time increasing the amount of money and paying for their education. The States that are red have the growth in education but they also have the most difficult time in adjusting for that growth. And if you look at that and then compare it once again with the public land States, you'll find an amazing correlation. The public land States are having the most difficult time funding their education, and I think there is a relationship to it which we have yet to fully investigate, and we ought to. It's a subject for a future time, but it's also one of those things that are important because there are collateral impacts that are extremely important on how we actually follow the advice of Daniel Webster up there, which told us to develop our resources so that we can move this Nation forward. And this is the time we have to do it. And there are right ways of doing it and there are probably imprudent ways of doing it. It's important that we do it the right ways, and we in the West clearly understand the significance of that. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your patience.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I am actually saddened to rise today on this particular bill. The 16 heritage areas that are either existing or proposed, many of them are very good, things that I would readily support. 
   Unfortunately, they have been packaged into what the government book my high school students read called ``A Christmas Tree'' in a very real way, in which bad proposals can be packaged around the few good proposals that are in here in hopes that people will tolerate the bad in hopes of getting a favorable recommendation from the good. My State and most State legislatures would never have tolerated this type of bill. This bill would be split up in our State so that each proposal would stand on its own merits and go up or down. Unfortunately, we do not use that procedure here. We ought to, but we do not. 
   Even in areas where something like an appropriation can be justified by lumping things together, in an authorization, it should not. That is why I rise in opposition to H.R. 1483. 
   When this bill was originally introduced, it was to reauthorize nine heritage areas, giving each an additional $10 million. Since the reauthorization on these nine original areas doesn't lapse until 2012, 5 years hence, it is interesting why we are taking the time now to revisit these particular areas. Even though some of these areas are simple technical corrections and changes, for most it appears that the reason we're doing it again is because they have gone through their money and they want more. 
   It is difficult when the process of a heritage area is supposed to become self-sufficient. It is an affront to heritage areas that are trying to become self-sufficient and break themselves from Federal dependence. 
   In 1994 when these same nine areas were being discussed, the Democrat hero of heritage areas, the advocate, the chairman of the then subcommittee, the late Bruce Vento stated: ``There is a limit to the length of time or the amount of money the Federal Government can be in a heritage area.'' Not totally grammatical, but you get the point of what he was trying to say. 
   He went on to say: ``In 10 years, we are out of there. Then they are on their own and we get the benefit of that conservation.'' 
   Thirteen years later, that has not been the case. In fact, it has been said that for every dollar spent on these heritage areas, there is $10 to $20 from the private sector that comes back. It sounds like a great return on our investment if it could be independently verified. 
   In fact, during the hearings on this bill, the National Park Service testified that no heritage area has become self-sufficient. Unfortunately, it gets worse. 
   The Heritage Area Alliance, the association which represents all heritage areas, has told us in committee hearing that they should never become self-sufficient and they should always rely on continuous Federal appropriations for every heritage area. In fact, the Heritage Area Alliance has become a cottage industry where groups get grants from the Federal Government to go around telling other people how to get more grants from the Federal Government. And this performance we are now wishing to reward. While a public-private partnership can yield positive results, this program has taken on a life of its own. 
   In the Resources Committee, the bill was amended to cut back additional funds to existing heritage areas from $10 million to $5 million. I compliment Chairman Grijalva for his amendment and the chairman of the full committee for accepting it. It is like taking the balls off the bottom branches of the Christmas tree so the cat won't play with them. 
   And after taking that positive step, they reverse course and tacked on six new heritage areas. They have had hearings, but in fairness, only one has gone through the regular order that the chairman of the full committee established when we first met this year. 
   The Democrats also decided to make changes that were never part of the hearing. The new heritage areas will now receive $15 million each, up from the $10 million that they requested. It is great and lucky to receive a 50 percent bonus without asking for it. This gracious move by the Democrats means the total cost of this bill is now $135 million. Some of our committees thought that was a paltry sum. But $135 million is the total annual Federal income tax paid by 33,276 middle-class taxpayers. And this is how we are being responsible for their particular money. 
   We have some problems concerning some of the subtitles included in this new omnibus Christmas tree bill. 
   A journey through Hallowed Ground Heritage Area has been diligently sought by my colleague from Virginia (Mr. Wolf). I commend him for his dedication to this cause, and there is much of his proposed area that I like and I applaud. However, one of the problems still is there are issues that still persist. There is both support and opposition within this proposed area. Two of our colleagues have asked their particular congressional districts be removed from this designation. In committee, an amendment was offered to remove their districts, but it was rejected. And because this is a closed  rule, our colleagues do not have the opportunity of coming down here and on the floor of the House presenting their reasons why they wish to be withdrawn from this particular district. 
   We should not take Federal designations lightly. When we create a Federal designation, a Member who is opposed to that should be respected in his particular wishes. We were told this would disrupt the continuity of this heritage area. Well, this heritage area spans four States and it is supposed to still be locally operated. One must ask how a Virginia-based management entity will represent the local interests of four States. It is a legitimate question, but the bottom line is we still should respect our colleagues' privilege to represent their constituencies. 
   There has been criticism that private property protections in this bill are inadequate. The majority claims that the protections in this bill are sufficient because it states that participation is voluntary. Voluntary. 
   If two of our Members want to voluntarily opt out of this particular bill and are not allowed to do so, how will any property owner sitting in one of these new proposed districts get any kind of confidence that they are safe when it is not voluntary for any Member to remove their districts from these types of recommendations? 
   In the Resources Committee, I offered an amendment that would have simply provided for the right of private property owners to withdraw their land from a heritage area boundary. This is the exact same provision that has been on the 12 prior heritage areas. This is the same provision that Mr. Wolf added in his bill and was taken out by the committee even though he objected to the removal of that language from his own particular provision. Why are we treating these heritage areas different than the precedent we established for the other heritage areas? It is not an additional burden to the management. It would go a long way to assuring constituents that their rights would be protected. 
   Unfortunately, the amendment was defeated again because the Democrats claim that their language was sufficient, an argument that has proved inaccurate on other occasions. In light of the infamous Kelo decision, we need to be extra cautious in the House when we deliberate on property rights. 
   The other side will claim that there is no risk to property rights. While I hope that is correct, we need to be very sure because boundaries have a consequence, or why should we have them. Proponents of this bill on the one hand say we need boundaries to protect historical properties, but on the other hand there is no regulatory authority. You can't have it both ways. It is an invitation to lawsuits. We have already seen cases brought forward based on these recommendations. I would point my colleagues to Pogliani v. United States Corps of Engineers. It has already happened that lawsuits have been filed to discontinue actions based on inclusion in a heritage area. The right to opt out of the boundary we proposed would have prevented this type of situation in the future. 
   In some respects this legislation is simply not ready for prime time. The Muscle Shoals proposal, which is another one I like a lot, I think it is good, but it has not yet completed a feasibility study. In other words, we don't have the assurance this heritage area could get off the ground before we wish to actually make the check for it. 
   We were promised in this particular bill that there would be a map included. If you see in the self-executing rule of the Rules Committee, they have put a number in place that used to be blank. A small little detail. But we have not been provided with a map of what the boundaries of this new heritage area actually are. So how can we tell people they can be voluntarily in or out of it when we don't even know yet what the boundary levels are? No wonder this has become a closed rule. 
   There is another area in this bill that was created, a Niagara Falls region, at the behest of the very powerful chairwoman of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter. Proponents claim it is needed to protect the falls. Protect the falls from what? What potential harm to the falls can be protected by the provisions of this particular bill? Remember, proponents say there are no restrictions or regulations imposed. Perhaps the totally unique commission that is established in this portion of the bill that has the Secretary of the Interior creating a new entity and staffing it with Federal employees and paying for it can finally answer that particular question. There is little more in this particular provision than using the National Park Service to conduct economic redevelopment projects. The Park Service does not have the expertise, or the funds, or the desire to be burdened with this subject. 
   At the center of the economic development plan for Niagara Falls is a new casino. Niagara Falls, honeymoons, gambling, there may be a nexus there somewhere for us. But while the State of New York has the right to pursue casinos and help their development, it is inappropriate to use national heritage areas to promote the casino. An amendment was offered when the Niagara Falls heritage bill originally went through the committee to put a firewall between the Federal funds in this bill and the casino. Committee Democrats rejected again this simple amendment. Whatever my colleagues feel on the issue of gaming is irrelevant. We should all agree, though, that this is not an appropriate use of Federal funds, especially when one area is given an advantage over the other. 
   Finally, concerns have been raised that these heritage areas and their boundaries may be used to impede the placement of energy transmission lines. While this may not be the full intent of the sponsors, we must proceed cautiously before we further damage our ability to keep up with the demand for energy. The grid is already heavily taxed, and it would be a tragedy to see blackouts as an unintended consequence of these designations. 
   Mr. Speaker, because we do not have an opportunity to improve this bill via amendment as a result of the closed rule, I have to urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, unfortunately. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   The following letter--signed by a diverse group of more than 110 organizations, elected officials and citizens--was delivered on September 4 to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Minority Leader John Boehner, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Pete V. Domenici, House Committee on Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall, House Committee on Natural Resources Ranking Member Don Young as well as all the members of the House and Senate Natural Resources Committees. 
   Dear [Elected Official]: The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Kelo v. City of New London ignited a national outcry against government abuse of property rights. The ``bridge to nowhere'' and other wasteful programs triggered angry protests against the practice of earmarking National heritage areas are the Kelo decision and earmarks rolled into one. 
   National heritage areas are preservation zones where land use and property rights can be restricted. They give the National Park Service and preservation interest groups (many with histories of hostility toward property rights) substantial influence by giving them the authority to create land use ``management plans'' and then the authority to disburse federal money to local governments to promote their plans. 
   As a March 2004 General Accountability Office report on heritage areas states: ``[National heritage areas] encourage local governments to implement land use policies that are consistent with the heritage areas' plans, which may allow the heritage areas to indirectly influence zoning and land use planning in ways that could restrict owners' use of their property.'' 
   The proposed ``Journey Through Hallowed Ground National Heritage Area Act'' provides a good case study on how heritage areas can be self-perpetuating federal pork and influence projects. The chief lobbying organization for this heritage area, the Journey Through Hallowed Ground Partnership, received a one million-dollar earmark in the 2005 federal transportation bill at the behest of Members of Congress sponsoring legislation to establish this heritage area--an earmark that was granted before the organization was even incorporated. A million-dollar earmark thus was issued to help create a steady stream of future pork, at the expense of the rights of local landowners. 
   We believe zoning and land use policies are best left to local officials, who are directly accountable to the citizens they represent. National heritage areas corrupt the principle of representative government and this inherently local function by giving unelected, unaccountable special interests the authority to develop land management plans and federal money with which to finance their efforts. 
   Once established, National heritage areas become permanent units of the National Park Service, and as such, permanent drains on an agency that currently suffers a multibillion-dollar maintenance crisis. According to the GAG, ``sunset provisions have not been effective in limiting federal funding [for National Heritage Areas]: since 1984, five areas that reached their sunset dates received funding reauthorization from the Congress.'' 
   Supporters of new heritage areas have the public will precisely backward: Americans want stronger property rights protections and less pork-barrel spending--not more earmarks to programs that harm property rights. 
   Please do not support the creation of additional national heritage areas or federal funding for heritage area management entities, support groups, or groups that lobby for or advocate the creation of new heritage areas.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, the GAO report that was just referenced, it is one of those unique things, not wishing to actually criticize the Federal Government for what they do, but in the entire report, not one property owner was interviewed, not a single property attorney was interviewed, nor a Realtor, nor appraiser, nor a local zoning official. Simply put, the report neglected to ask those who actually know what the impact of a heritage area has on the property rights and values of their land. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Then I'm prepared to close as well, if that's okay. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I said at the very beginning of this particular debate, on this particular bill there are elements of this bill that I fully support and I think are wise, good moves forward. There are some things in there that simply are not. 
   We have talked a lot and heard a lot about some of the better parts of this bill. However, we're talking about heritage areas. And I'm sorry, in all due respect, a casino as a heritage area for Niagara Falls? Those are some of the stretches that we have in this particular element. 
   When we had our committee hearing, there were several people that were talking about the need for these new heritage areas. One particular individual who was testifying told of the importance of having this Federal designation, so I tried to zero in on that and ask what it is specifically about this designation that cannot be done by the local levels, by State government, the local entity. Give me one thing that cannot be done that only the Federal Government can do. There was not one element that was given until somebody behind him simply answered that the correct answer is there are 15 million reasons why you have this designation, and each one has a portrait of George Washington on it. 
   We have all been lobbied on this bill, even though lobbying is not allowed in this bill. We have tried to put amendments and provisions of these parts that would clarify, clarify that lobbying could not be used by this Federal money going to these entities, and yet the chairman's argument against this, well, it would be making it too difficult for heritage areas to then ask for money. Had we not had a closed rule, some commonsense changes as, for example, where the map actually is, should there be lobbying allowed, should there be real protection for private property owners, should we actually define what these are, they would have been allowed to be discussed and at least voted on this particular bill. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee cut out that opportunity, and now we're here with a closed bill. 
   Many of my colleagues who do not serve on the Resources Committee may not be aware that the Department does not support these bills. On each and every heritage area that we've had recommended to the committee, the Department has asked the committee to defer action until a criteria for heritage areas is established. And I can see why some deferment makes sense. Perhaps we wouldn't be here debating heritage areas that have not yet finished their feasibility studies or had their maps prepared had we listened to that advice. 
   A lot of good things, but this is still a classic Christmas tree with a lot of bad things that are hidden by the good ones. 
   I urge my colleagues not to support this omnibus lands bill, this Christmas tree of lands bill, simply because there are too many bad things that need to be fixed before it moves on. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   This particular motion to recommit ensures that the rights of State and local governments within heritage area designations will be able to regulate hunting and that it will be unharmed by this legislation. 
   This bill currently provides that heritage area designations shall not diminish the right of States to regulate hunting, but it is silent on the issue including the right to carry firearms. 
   The motion to recommit also clarifies that laws regarding fishing and possession or use of a weapon or trap shall be governed exclusively by States and localities. 
   The second amendment is a critical right. We want to protect our constituents against consequences of this legislation that could harm that right. 
   National parks have regulations that limit hunting and the right to carry or possess firearms even in States and localities where it is legally permitted. The text you see to my left is title 36 for the National Park Service Department, and this is the language that would prohibit in heritage areas those rights that even are currently allowed by State and local legislation. 
   These regulations harm wildlife and the environment because even local wildlife management officials are impeded in their work. 
   Before any attempt is made to restrict the rights of gun owners and second amendment defenders, this motion to recommit protects their legal existing rights now and in the future. It is important that it be said and be said clearly. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. As I am sure the distinguished gentleman from West Virginia knows, each and every one of the divisions within the Department of the Interior has different sets of rules and regulations. BIA land would not be a problem. A national park designation would be. So any of these heritage areas that were under the direction of the National Park Service, and there are some within this new bill, would fall under title 36. That's why this legislation desperately needs to be there,  the same amendment that we actually did present at another time in one of our committees. 
   So, yes, it's still significant. It's still important. It needs to be there to clarify specifically. If the intent is not to change what has been happening by the locals, this clearly sets in all these areas what has been local will continue and State and local regulations will have precedence.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a unique situation as I rise to speak on something that I consider to be extremely significant, and it seems as if it has almost bipartisan and bi-House support for doing this at the same time. 
   We throw around a lot of numbers in this floor, and I think there's only two that I would like to emphasize right now, 52 and 4. 52 and 4. Because one of the situations that we have in this particular issue is that if you live east of the Rocky Mountains, only 4 percent of all of it is owned by the Federal Government; and 52 percent of those of us who live west of it is owned by the Federal Government, which creates a unique and significant problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, if I could, for a moment, I would like to yield to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, when I was a young legislator in Utah, I was told that oftentimes the process we use in creating legislation is more important than the actual words of that legislation. Thus, here in Congress we have established a concept of regular order so that fair and competent legislation is brought forth that eliminates unintended consequences of poorly written provisions. So we in Congress review. 
   And yet, by mutual understanding, the bill we have before us has had no public hearing, no committee work, no review, no amendments by Republicans or Democrats, rank and file, no reading of this bill since it was printed after everyone had left last night. It's not a comprehensive solution. It has the appearance of competence but is not a real solution to meet the needs of real Americans. It does not work. 
   Let me give you one small example. The section on oil shale I originally thought was one of the bright lights in an otherwise dismal bill. And I'm sorry that my colleague--no, my colleague from Utah is still here. I congratulate him on his work. 
   It removes the prohibition of oil shale development that this body callously placed in last year's appropriations act, despite a chorus of bipartisan opposition to do such. But rather than simply remove the prohibition and move forward, it replaces it with a mandate of States' actions to pass a law to allow it to take place, something I personally like, something I think the industry would support, but which also has potential of constitutional implications. 
   There are other areas of this bill which have even more constitutional implications. And since this act has no severability clause, it simply means if one part of this bill goes down on constitutional issues, the entire bill goes down.     
   Rather than just take out the prohibition, it's almost as if we put in the margin a big sign that says, ``Look here to sue,'' so that outside agencies can do in court what some people have said they would like to do on the floor, which is not have a real solution. 
   I am saddened because we could have done so much more. We could have done so much better, and instead, we will vote on a hollow shell of a bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I guess I stand as someone who also voted against that infamous bill, happily so, because it did not solve the problem. 
   One of the things we should be here to do is try to solve the problem, regardless of whether there is some archaic rule that prohibits that solution from taking place, which is exactly what happened on that particular piece of legislation. 
   There are two numbers that I want to once again reiterate, talking about what Mr. Walden from Oregon was saying, 52 and 4. 
   This chart, everything that is blue in this chart is the amount of land owned by the Federal Government in each State. The 52 refers to those of us who live west of the Rocky Mountains. Fifty-two percent of everything west of the Rocky Mountains, the Speaker understands this very clearly, is owned by the Federal Government. 
   You will notice that Montana and California don't have a whole lot, so the rest of us pick up that slack, my State about 80 percent, Nevada about 90 percent. 
   Those of you who live east of the Rocky Mountains have 4 percent of your land owned and controlled by an absentee landlord known as the Federal Government. It becomes more insidious. If you were to take the 13 States that have the most difficult time in funding their State education programs, the slowest growth in their State education programs, you will find 11 of those 13 States also are in this infamous blue block found in the West. 
   The East, in all due respect, does not get this situation, they don't face it, and neither does the Democratic Party. The two solutions that we have right now, the best solution would be to give the land back, but the best solutions we have are PILT, Payment in Lieu of Taxes, for county governments and Secure Rural Schools for the school sections of these particular areas. 
   This program, Payment in Lieu of Taxes, was started when Nixon was president and was flat-lined in payments of 100 grand a year until 1994 when the Republicans took over. Every year since that time, the Payment in Lieu of Taxes Program has increased its percentage and increased its actual amount of funding, not ever reaching the full authorized amount, which it should have been, but it increased every year until this year. 
   Secure Rural Schools has found the same source of problems. This year, there has finally been the problem of facing it. 
   Now, this is essential to us. Schools are running in the West because of this money. Counties are functioning in the West because of this money. A gentleman from New England took recreation in my State, went down kayaking in Black Box, which was a mistake. 
   Three weeks later the county was able to recover his body. In this tragedy, unfortunately, it also consumed every dime they had set aside that year for their emergency funding processes. 
   Now, the problem for those in the West, when it comes to our schools and our counties, is we don't have a tax base to get this money back. It is controlled by the Federal Government, which is why PILT and Secure Rural Schools are essential for those of us who are in the West. 
   That's where the frustration of yesterday comes in. The Senate passed a tax extender, I think it was 93-2 was the vote, which does fund Secure Rural  Schools and PILT. I want that bill over here so I have the opportunity to vote for it and solve the problem. 
   But we were told it could not be added to the House version, because it did not have an offset. It violated PAYGO. 
   Now, here is where I become confused, because before us right now we have another bill of all sorts of spending that also does not have offsets and violates PAYGO. Now, that's okay. Those of us in the West are simply saying, this is important to us, and it should be done. 
   I have another problem in, as you mentioned, the Green Schools Initiative in this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Let me just say, the Green Schools Initiative, because I was on the committee of jurisdiction, that particular program adds construction money to local districts for their schools. The original sponsor of that bill had a program involved in there so they could allocate and find out what school districts needed the assistance. 
   In the State of Utah, we have an equalization formula. The school districts that either have a high number of students, and, therefore, it is difficult for them to keep up with construction, or had the oddity of all their schools have been built at the same time, therefore, they all fall apart at the same time. There is extra funding from the State that goes to those districts. 
   In the formula put into the school bill that is now part of this, it does not in any way, shape or form follow any need for school construction. It follows only title I funding, which means in the State of Utah, that has tried to solve the problem with equalization, not one district that has a need for extra school construction money will get one dollar from this program. It goes to the districts that don't need the money, because it's a poorly written, poorly planned bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, a couple of years ago I was in the position of the gentlewoman from Ohio managing some of the rules for the bills, and often I was chagrined and offended by people who would complain about amendments not being made in order when they had been fully vetted and defeated in the committee. 
   I want you to know as I rise to talk about one amendment that was not made in order, this is not necessarily the case. Even though I had offered it in committee, I withdrew it in the committee in the spirit of comity to try to work towards a solution for this floor, not realizing that the Rules Committee would callously deny all amendments made in order on this bill. 
   Reconciliation is already a procedural process that limits the right of the minority to have input. To further restrict their rights by not recognizing any amendments, and indeed taking out amendments that were passed in the full committee, is something that certainly is not the definition of open government. 
   The issue I wish to address I will continue to talk about because philosophically I think it is larger than the bill we are actually discussing. The Department of Education drafted the language I presented, not to say they endorsed it, but to let you know this was not a cavalier but a serious effort at solving a problem. In fact, the amendment was passed last year by this body in the Higher Ed Reauthorization Act, but was one of the bills that the Senate refused to accept or consider during the last year. 
   I want to publicly thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Kildee, for speaking to me about this amendment, Mr. McKeon, the ranking member, and his staff for talking to us at length about this amendment, and also the Department of Education. 
   To the full committee chairman I wish to apologize. Part of my process with these types of amendments is to sit down with the ranking member as well as the chairman to explain my purpose and intent. Six different times since the committee met, I have made an effort to try to meet with the chairman of the full committee and each time those efforts were rebuffed. So I apologize to him for not doing what I think should be the normal process. 
   The last time we did a reconciliation bill, there was a new entitlement that was inserted on the insistence of the Senate. That was the wrong process. But it did establish an increase in a new Pell Grant program which I like, and it required this Pell Grant to go to those who had a rigorous academic schedule, something else I like. But it also gave the Department of Education the right to establish criteria which would drive curricula. That is the part I cannot accept. 
   In the charter of the Education Department, it was forbidden for them to have this power. In Federal statutes, it is forbidden for them to have this power. State constitutions forbid it; yet this program has opened the door for future abuse.  
   In the committee it was asked: Shouldn't all States have common standards? To allow the Federal Government to establish those common standards gives the Federal Government power taken from parents and local school boards to drive curriculum decisions. It is almost like saying can't we be partially pregnant. No. 
   If the Department of Education has the ability to establish some curriculum decisions, they also have inherently the ability to establish all curriculum decisions, even though the current Department of Education is trying hard not to abuse this power by still saying there are four broad areas that qualify. They themselves have admitted that it needs to be refined. And what the future Department of Education without this same kind of approach would have simply meant that there can be abuse of the system in the future. 
   Most curriculums are always going to be driven, especially of electives, by a teacher. Other curriculum is driven by graduation requirements. But curriculum can also be driven by outside requirements. When the four colleges in Utah decided that students should have 2 years of foreign languages before they go to college, the enrollment in foreign language programs quadrupled. When the Federal Government can dangle out money for Pell Grants by taking specific classes, that will drive curriculum decisions, and it is philosophically wrong to give them that kind of power. 
   In this bill there is much good. Much of the good has already been stated in forms of hyperbole. There is also much bad. 
   In 2005 when this program to which I object was created, it was the wrong thing to do. This particular bill has nine different new entitlements which are also the wrong thing to do, so I am assuming this is probably about nine times as bad. 
   It is a poor and abusive procedure when we deny amendments on the floor and you deny amendments that were passed in committee and remove them without having the chance to address them again. So I will vote against this rule because it is an abuse of the procedure that unfairly limits the rights of the minority.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, you know, about roughly three decades ago, Congress decided to offer dental health plan benefits to Federal employees. And as they sent out the price sheet to all the Federal employees and circulated amongst them, on that price sheet was a column that said what is not covered in the dental health plan. Underneath that column of what is not covered in the dental health plan was ``teeth.'' 
   On the issue that we have before us right now, which deals with student payments and loans, I think if we had another column which said what is not covered in this bill, you might also have the word ``students.'' 
   This particular bill is one that is extremely disappointing to me. Of the half dozen message bills that we had last week and continuing on this week, this is the one that for me held out the most hope for the future. 
   In fact, my disappointment is only perhaps met by yesterday when I went to the airport planning to fly into Washington, DC, and ended up in Baltimore. No offense to some of our wonderful staff who live there, but I didn't want to be in Baltimore, it didn't help me out. 
   This is another one of those bills. I say that from some kind of personal concept, because 2 years ago, I had four kids in college at the same time. This year, I have got three kids in college at the same time. Next year, I go back to four kids in college. Sometime, I hope the hemorrhaging will stop. 
   But I was hoping in some way that this could do some wonderful things for me. But this bill does nothing to expand the opportunity for kids to go to college. It does nothing to actually help kids as they are going through college. It only impacts graduates, and then only temporarily for a small period of time, the very people who probably need it the least. 
   Earl Weaver, the old manager of the Baltimore Orioles, used to try to bait the umpires by going in their face and simply saying, are you going to get any better, or is this it? 
   In all good deference, is this it? There is a significant problem we have, and hopefully once the rhetoric of the power plays of the couple of weeks are past, we can do some bipartisan work. For, indeed, the ranking member from California, my good friend, Mr. McKeon, does have a bill which addresses the real needs of kids in public education and higher education at the same time, and it builds on a foundation of increasing support for higher education that has been going by the Republican Party for years and years and years.     
   It does try to expand access, which is what we should be doing. It does try and help those who are in school right  now, to support them. To be honest, I may even vote for this bill. This is one of those whoop-te-do bills. It doesn't spend a whole lot, it doesn't address a whole lot, it doesn't help a whole lot. 
   But, to be honest with you, what it does for my kids in college right now is nothing. What it does for the friends of my kids in college right now is nothing. What it does for the students I taught in high school who are still in college is basically nothing, when it could have done so much more and should have done so much more, and we need to move forward to do so much more. 
   There has to be something more. This isn't hopefully as good as it gets.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the opportunity of speaking on this very unique rule, which I assume covers parts of at least two or three bills. I would like to talk about one section of it, which is the Department of Defense portion. 
   I would also like to first congratulate Chairman Skelton and the two subcommittee chairmen with whom I work, Abercrombie and Ortiz, for producing a bipartisan bill. They have given the image that I think could be used on other committees that if the leadership of the committee wants to come up with a bipartisan bill, it is easily possible to do that. They have done that in this particular committee. They have been fair in their leadership, their staffs have been very helpful, they have produced a good bill. 
   I also want to thank Representative Boren of Oklahoma, who has taken the issue upon which I wish to address very quickly, and continues to move that forward in an attempt to be a bipartisan way. 
   Unfortunately, the amendment made in order under his name on this particular issue has very vague language in there and, I am afraid, only codifies the existing problem as opposed to trying to find a solution to it. 
   The problem exists in that a different committee with very little understanding and no jurisdiction over military affairs has passed legislation which has caused a massive problem for the military of this particular country.

   The military has attempted to make sure we have a process with alternative fuels to make sure that we have security for the future. 526 stops that. The Rules Committee could have waived the issues of sequential referral and allowed us to discuss that on the floor, but instead they limited and restricted the debate, so that we will not have a full debate on this important issue that is about the security of the military of this country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding. 
   I come here with a sense of disappointment, but, admittedly, not surprise. Last night in the Rules Committee, I had the opportunity of listening to a brilliant amendment that I thought was brilliantly presented. I did it, so it was brilliant. Unfortunately, that amendment, which was a new issue to this debate that has not been discussed in other venues or has not been discussed in another committee, is a technical amendment that was designed neither to inhibit nor to promote the passage of the underlying bill. 
   If Utah becomes part of this bill and it is passed, we would be required in some way, shape and form to have a special election, which would cost the State of Utah about $7 million and require the legislature to come into special session to create new rules for a  special election, as well as to appropriate money that does not now exist for that. 
   We all know there will be lawsuits on this bill, and it will take time for those lawsuits to work the court. My amendment, a technical amendment, was simply to say let us start the process of the election in the 2008 election cycle, which would simply say there would be no extra cost to an entity for performance. There would be regular process, and that would give plenty of time for the lawsuits to have their way work through the courts. It seems ridiculous for the State of Utah to have to spend $7 million on a special election that may then be invalidated by a court action later on. 
   I have to admit that in some respects I feel frustrated the way the State of Utah has been treated in this entire process, forced to have a special session to draw a map, a map in which the criteria was for incumbent protection, never before done, and now forced to spend money on a special election, when an alternate is completely there.     
   Not to allow that to even be discussed on the floor does not help the body politic that is here. 
   I also notice that my friend from Georgia has come down here. Mr. Westmoreland had an amendment that was discussed in the committee and passed in the committee. Yet this Rules Committee has stripped his amendment and offered a closed rule, so they deny him the opportunity to even discuss the amendment that has already been passed. 
   Time after time in the last few years I sat where the gentleman from Texas sat and was denigrated by people who said we denied amendments that had failed in committee and were therefore stopping the democratic process. Here we have an example of someone who passed an amendment in committee that has now been stripped out and is no longer being allowed to discuss it on a bill that is purported to be expanding the concept of democracy in the first place. 
   I realize that when we talk about process, that is extremely boring to the American people. It's boring to us. Actually, most of what we say on this floor is boring to almost all of us. 
   But the real inconvenient truth is that poor process equates to poor policy. We will see another rule that comes out here today as well that would clearly illustrate how poor process, in an unprecedented fashion, would clearly result in poor policy. 
   When I was a young legislator, I one time was somewhat of a rebel, I redeemed myself and eventually became speaker, but in my second session I had a position that was at odds with my own leadership and was numerically outnumbered. But they allowed the process in Utah to work so I stayed at the table, and eventually we designed and came up with a product that was actually before for all of us. That is what we should be doing here today. 
   Somehow I heard, over the past 10 years, how the Rules Committee, when a different party was in charge, is where democracy goes to die. Unfortunately, this day the Rules Committee is once again where democracy goes to die. Mr. Westmoreland, who will be speaking in a few minutes, is living proof of how that happens.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Then I'll be the last speaker, and I think we're ready to move on with that. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume at this time. 
   I think in closing on this particular issue, I would like to speak also in favor of the motion to instruct of the gentleman from Delaware (Mr. Castle). It's a wise motion. I don't think I or anyone else here objects to any administrator making an adequate compensation. But I also think that six figures is an adequate compensation, especially when the teachers in Head Start are averaging 25 grand a year. 
   In 2005, the independent General Accountability Office did issue a report that warned that their financial control system in the Head Start program is flawed, failing, and it did fail to prevent multi-million-dollar financial abuses that do cheat children in this particular program. 
   It is important that the resources that we have go to increasing teacher salaries, hiring more teachers or supplies that directly go to help the kids in the Head Start program. And it's important that in conference we make it very clear that our resources should be targeted to those who are simply in need. 
   Sparky Anderson was once asked why he was such a successful manager, and he simply responded that baseball is a simple game. You have good players you keep in the right positions, and then the manager is a success. 
   Even Earl Weaver once said that if you do the dull things right, extraordinary things won't be required. This motion to instruct may be one of those dull things, that if we do it right and do it right in this bill, we won't have to come back here and do the extraordinary things. The extraordinary things will be done by the teachers in the classrooms who are helping these kids who need this help in the Head Start program so desperately. 
   I urge a favorable vote on the motion to instruct. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, in one of my favorite plays of all time, ``Inherit the Wind,'' the attorney Henry Drummond is talking to his client and his client's fiancee about a lesson of life based upon an experience that Drummond had when he was 7 years old, and by his own admission, a self-described expert on rocking horses. 
   He saw in the store window, Golden Dancer, a rocking horse with a red mane, blue eyes, beautiful gold with purple spots on it, and there would always be a plate glass window between him and Golden Dancer because it would have cost a week of his father's salary. But on his next birthday as he woke, he saw at the foot of his bed, Golden Dancer. His mother had scrimped on groceries, his father had worked nights for a month and they had purchased the very high-priced Golden Dancer. 
   He jumped out of the bed and jumped on to the rocking horse. As he began to rock, it broke. It busted in half. Golden Dancer was made of rotten wood. Despite all the glitz and glamour around it, it was held together by spit and sealing wax. They had purchased Golden Dancer, but at too high a price.     
   Often for us as individuals as well as society, we go after Golden Dancers, and they are purchased at too high a price. Embryonic stem cell research in my opinion is a Golden Dancer, and it would be purchased at too high a price. It is a glitzy golden dream that is out there. 
   Last year we were discussing this bill, a lot of doctors and genetic researchers on this floor, the overwhelming majority of whom were opposed to this process, because we can do the research without having to go through objectionable processes and procedures to do it, without having to deal with the issue of innocent life. 
   If embryos are being destroyed, it is not right that taxpayer money should be used to expand that process in what I find to be a morally objectionable way and objectionable process regardless of what that Golden Dancer may or may not be. To me, this is still an issue of ethics: Does the manner in which we spend our tax dollars promote a policy that one form of innocent life at a stage is more important than another innocent life at a different stage? Will we, by our tax policies, condone tax spending, condone a policy that says innocent life can be destroyed for utilitarian purposes? Because if we do that, whatever the reason may be, in my contention that cheapens society and it cheapens us, and it gives us a cavalier attitude of life at the beginning of the process which leads to a cavalier attitude of life at the end of the process and who knows in between. 
   This is a Golden Dancer that for me is too high a price for what it does to us as a people and as a society.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Senate bill 2739 contains around 62 provisions, and I am pleased to see that they're finally on their way to the President's desk. However, this bill is also a testament to the dysfunction of a certain body on the other side of this Rotunda. 
   Many of the sections of this bill are unable to stand on their own and have subsequently been bundled into a $300 million brew to avoid individual scrutiny. To solve the problem and avoid the discomfort of saying ``no,'' this omnibus was created with enough prizes that inevitably the bad will be overlooked and everything, the good, the bad and the ugly, will be able to cross the finish line. 
   Many of these provisions were passed by this House last year, so it's nice to say that finally something is coming out of the Senate, even if it's coming in this very poor form. But in other ways this bill is also symbolic of this session. We have wasted time and then glob everything together and throw it together with one fell swoop without the ability of scrutinizing it as individual issues, and at the same time miss essential bills that address critical needs. 
   This legislation deals with land where energy opportunities do exist, and yet once again we are moving forward with gas approaching $4 a gallon. Today, the average price of gasoline in the United States was $3.61. That's $1.28 for gasoline, $1.57 for diesel, 55 and 59 percent above what it was at the beginning of the 110th Congress. And still, with no plan to solve this issue, we pass bills that exacerbate this conundrum. 
   This particular bill is full of new designations intended to draw tourists, but the only sightseeing that's going to be done in this country will be from the couch watching the Travel Channel if we don't address our fuel crisis. Every time we pass feel-good natural resource legislation with warm and fuzzy titles, we must consider the damage being done to our ability to provide for ourselves. We have locked up so much of our public land from energy development that we are now seeing the results at the pump, and these are our priorities. 
   What else do we do? Our solution is to offer biofuels; in other words, we want to burn food to power cars. Not only is this immoral, it is devastating Third World countries now unable to afford food to feed their starving children. These are our priorities. 
   We could have used forest mass that's dead every year, it would have been perfect cellulose for production of energy and at the same time save our forests from catastrophic fires, but such was specifically prohibited in the ``no energy'' bill that passed this Congress recently. So, these are our consequences. 
   We discussed many of the sections in this bill individually when they first came to the House floor in 2007. We did it the right way, even if I disagreed with some of the outcomes we decided. Unfortunately, they are back without improvements that would have made them palatable. 
   I don't believe private property rights are adequately protected in any of the heritage areas in this bill. And I question why the amendment to protect second amendment rights, which was overwhelmingly passed on the House floor, was stripped from this package. It is flat out wrong to have done that. It is almost unfathomable that the Senate would do such a thing and that we would consider passing this bill with that significant provision not there. Yet again, the second amendment and property rights take a back seat to misguided priorities of the other body. 
   As I stated earlier, there are a few positives I am pleased to support. Congressmen WILSON and BROWN of South Carolina have worked to get the ``Swamp Fox'' General Francis Marion Memorial to the President. I congratulate them. Minority Whip BLUNT has labored to authorize the Newtonia Civil War Battlefields study that we will move today. I thank him for his fine work. My Resource Committee colleague, Congressman LOUIS GOHMERT from Texas, has an important study to honor the Space Shuttle, Columbia, and I'm pleased that this is included in Senate 2739. Resource Committee Ranking Member DON YOUNG has several provisions that will benefit the country and his constituents in Alaska, and I thank him for his tireless efforts and advocacy on their behalf. 
   Finally, of all the provisions, probably the best one is a dam bill provision for my congressional district. This  provision would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to do a feasibility study on raising the height of the Arthur V. Watkins Dam in Box Elder County. And given the shortage of water in the West, by increasing storage capacity of this vital reservoir, the residents of my congressional district will have a more secure water supply and water future. 
   Having already spent too many hours debating these bills when they came before us that now make up this legislative Frankenstein, I see no need to prolong this much longer. 
   I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, this Frankenstein bill that we have before us has a whole lot of good stuff in it. It also has a whole lot of bad stuff in there, things that could be cataclysmic consequences to this particular country. 
   One of the things that is so sad is the process in which we are involved. I realize it's regular order, but it's still a sad process. We have germaneness rules that are very loose. The Senate has germaneness rules that are even looser. Former Senator Gene McCarthy said, The Senate has rules, but no one knows what they are so it doesn't really matter. 
   Bringing a bill in this pattern with these many provisions over here is something that would never be allowed in most legislative bodies within our States. One of the things we should learn as a body is sometimes it is best if we actually deal with bills on an individual basis in a timely manner. I realize part of this problem cannot be laid at the hands of the chairman of our committee because it's actually dealing with the other body on the other side, which decided to lump everything together as a big glob and just throw it at us. 
   At the same time, it should be a lesson for us to learn that if we really want to reform the system so that we have actual input on bills in a timely fashion and timely manner, we should have one issue, one bill, one vote, and plumping everything together is simply poor parts of legislation. For all the good that is in this bill, and there is much good, as well as the bad, and there is some bad, it still is the wrong process that we should be engaged. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Thank you, Madam Speaker. And I appreciate the gentleman from New Jersey in yielding a few moments so we can talk about another issue of significance, I think, right now. 
   It was in the year 2004 that the President outlined our Nation's vision for space exploration; and he gave three goals: 
   Number 1, to complete the international space station by 2010, 2, to conduct the first manned mission of a new vehicle for astronauts by 2014; and Number 3, to return a man to the moon by 2020. 
   Now, these goals won bipartisan approval by Congress in the 2005 NASA Authorization Act, and we gave clear directions to NASA to administer this act. In it, the administrator was directed to develop a human presence on the moon, promote exploration, science and commerce, United States presence in space, and to create a stepping stone to future exploration of mars and other destinations. 
   It further codified more specific requirements to use personnel and assets of the current space shuttle program in developing a new crew vehicle and two new launch vehicles. 
   Now, after the old space shuttle, the original one here has fulfilled its mission to complete the international space station, it will retire in the year 2010 and, by law, must be replaced no later than 2014 by a new vehicle, this one at the top, which is called Orion, which will take humans to the space station, to the moon, to Mars and to beyond. 
   This vision is a bulwark of our Nation's space future for the decades to come. You see, the space shuttle will have been in service for 30 years by the time it's retired, and we can expect as much or more from these new systems.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for yielding some time. I appreciate the gentleman from Texas who has introduced this particular piece of legislation. 
   Madam Speaker, many of us grew up listening to vinyl records played on phonographs, something that my kids have probably never heard, let alone seen. But for its day, the phonograph was an amazing device. It gave beautiful music, or maybe not so beautiful music, into our homes; it brought great orchestras and bands to those who would have never heard them otherwise. And a few people still use them, but most of them had replaced them long ago with tapes and CD's and MP3 files, and other types of digital media acknowledging that the phonograph and vinyl record are outdated and that better technologies are available. 
   In the same vein, most of us gave up typewriters a long time ago for computers. But there are a few who, for fear or suspicion, cling to their ancient and inefficient typewriters. Admittedly, the typewriter was a marvelous tool in its time, but there are simply better tools available now. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I want to make the point that it's always a shame to see things that last beyond their usefulness, whether it's an outdated technology, a once-great athlete eventually cut from a team, or even a U.S. senator. You like to see things end in their prime and retain their dignity. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm not here to propose a Commission for Involuntary Retirement of Senators. Nor will I suggest an investigation into aging athletes who should call it quits. I think Mr. Waxman could probably do that for us all. I'm here to support Mr. Brady's idea for a Federal Sunset Commission to evaluate government agencies and find those agencies that are outdated and beyond their usefulness. 
   You see, in most sectors of American life, the free market simply dictates that old products, as great as they may have at one time been, are replaced by newer, better products. Unfortunately in the government, that process of creative destruction stops after we create the first version. The old out-of-date programs or agencies don't really get replaced. It stays around. Performing, maybe not performing, duplicative functions and sucking up tax dollars at the same time. 
   Several years ago, the comptroller, David Walker, pointed out that the USDA, the FDA, and 10 other Federal agencies administer 35 different food safety laws; the Department of Homeland Security, Justice, and HHS administer 16 different grant programs for first responders; and USDA and HUD both provide assistance for rural housing. And I won't even go into the Department of Education; that would be too easy. 
   Why do we have such a hard time getting rid of old programs? It simply has to do with public-choice theory. Every government agency and program, no matter how outdated, has a core constituency who benefit from its existence. Those who are employed at the agency or program and those who receive benefits have a huge incentive to fight for its continued existence. I understand this attitude. I basically did the same thing as a teacher. I was not content, as many of the old-guard teachers were, to simply teach the same lesson year after year. So I and other innovative staff members started  new programs like the Historical Society, the Renaissance Festival, a scholarship program, an oral history program, and Close-Up, an internship program at our State capitol. Now, fortunately, most of these program enhancements cost the school very little money except my time, but I did it because I always wanted to have a bigger role at the school. The status quo was never sufficient; I wanted to do more. 
   And herein lies the problem for both government programs and for me as a teacher: In our mindset, if a program is not growing, something is wrong. To self justify, government agencies and offices always think of new ways to expand their ``services.'' The goal is always ``bigger'' and ``more,'' which ends up costing the taxpayers. The desire to grow is the natural instinct of any government agency, and it is the natural instinct of us, but it means to control government, a legislative body has to continually fight that which naturally occurs. It's always an uphill battle. We continue the old and introduce the new. 
   Simply, what we do is when we introduce a new program and there is still an old one in place, it puts us in the silly position of using a computer and a typewriter at the same time. Comptroller Walker, before he retired, in the same report that I just quoted, said, ``A fundamental reassessment of government programs, policies, and activities can help weed out programs that are outdated, ineffective, unsustainable, or simply a lower priority than they used to be. In most Federal mission areas, from low-income housing to food safety to higher education assistance, national goals are achieved through the use of a variety of tools and increasingly through participation of many organizations such as State and local governments that are beyond the direct control of the Federal Government.'' 
   ``Government cannot accept as given all of the existing major programs, policies, and operations. A fundamental review of what the Federal Government does, how it does it, and in some cases, who does the government's business, will be required, particularly given the demographic tidal wave that is starting to show on our fiscal horizon.'' 
   ``A fundamental reassessment.'' It's a novel idea. Make agencies and programs continually prove their value. That brings us to Mr. Brady's bill, the Federal Sunset Act of 2008. Sunset commissions aren't a new idea. States, as are often the case, are ahead of us here. I'm told that there are 24 States currently that have some form of a sunset review and have saved millions of dollars through this process, and it is simply about time the Federal Government follows their lead. 
   P.J. O'Rourke once said, ``the mystery of government is not how Washington works, but how to make it stop.'' Mr. Brady's bill helps solve that mystery. It's a practical solution that will make it easier to get rid of outdated or low-performing or duplicative or wasteful government agencies and programs, and I commend him for reintroducing this bill.     
   It is something this government has to have to put some balance and rationality and logic back into the delivery of services by the Federal Government. 
   And with that, I would be happy to yield back to the gentleman from Texas.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank you for that kind introduction. And it won't be  50 minutes unless I go into Mr. King's time in some particular way. 
   I'm excited to be here to join you and to join the others, especially the gentlelady from Minnesota, who painted such a marvelous vision of what we could, indeed, be doing in the future if we just come together on this particular issue. 
   There are many people who have said, you know, where have we been all these years on this particular issue? I haven't been here forever, but I do know, from my years here as well as in the State legislature in Utah, that we 
   have been arguing this issue for years. 
   One of the freshman Members today came to the floor and criticized us for why we haven't done any of these issues earlier. And the bottom line is: We did. I have not been here forever, but there have been countless votes I have made in favor of drilling in ANWR and I would do so again. I have made countless votes in this body on expanding our offshore drilling leases and permits in areas and would do so again. 
   From the very first day I came here, John Peterson has been extolling the problems this economy will face if we don't face up to the fact we have a dwindling supply of natural gas here in the United States. We have been talking about this forever. Even before Speaker Pelosi changed my mindset and told me that natural gas is not a fossil fuel and you don't actually have to drill to get it, despite that fact there is something that is different now. And like most issues that come to their prime, there is a catalyst that changes and a catalyst that drives the issue forward. We have seen that this year. 
   I come from the West, which is the energy-producing section. Some of my friends in the areas that I call the ``energy consuming'' sections have been very happy over the years to try and lock up areas of the West and areas off the coast which produce energy, and they can do it with impunity because it has no impact on their lives. But all of a sudden, when you start paying 4 bucks a gallon of gas, then something is different. 
   The massive spike in gasoline prices at the pump over the last 2 years is the catalyst that is taking the arguments--and the arguments that we have said over and over and over again year after year--and have finally driven it to the point where everyone realizes mistakes we have made in our energy policy and our land policy for the past 30 years have brought us to the situation where we are today. And the cost we are paying at the pump is because of misguided decisions we have made for over 30 years. And now is the time where Americans are ready to stand up all over this country and say now is the time we need to take a new direction with real solutions so that we can solve where we have been brought by past decisions. 
   And as has been stated before, we're not just talking about drilling. It's one of the common arguments they say, all Republicans want to do is drill. Yeah, we want to drill, but we have always said it's not drilling alone. When we say we need an all-of-the-above solution, it means we need an all-of-the-above solution. 
   The common fossil fuels are as important to solve our energy problem now as expanding alternative energy sources will be to solve our problem in the future. But one of the issues we have never faced in this country--once again, another decision we've made improperly years ago--is an adequate way of funding our investment and expansion of alternative resources. 
   Now, one of the things we could do if we actually do increase our production of oil and natural gas and oil shale and coal is to use the expanded royalties this Federal Government would receive and funnel those royalties into building and developing our alternative resources for the future. And that's what the all-of-the-above American Energy Act wants to do. It is both of those. 
   I have found, to my utter amazement, there is no source of energy that does not have its critics. How can one be opposed to solar power? Although when we tried to build a solar plant in New Mexico, people were opposed to it because it would take up too much of the desert. How can you be opposed to wind power? Although I was reading an article in a local paper of a farmer in Wyoming who was opposed to wind power plants simply because the wushing of the blades makes too much noise, or it chops up too many birds that are part of the Migratory Bird Treaty. 
   Every source of energy has somebody who is opposed to it, which is why, if we're really going to reach a consensus of everybody, the only solution is to say nothing is off the table, we develop everything. It is the only real solution, it is the only fair solution, and that's what we are after. If we care about consumers in the future, we develop everything. 
   Conservation is essential, but we all know conservation alone does not solve our problem. But the American Energy Act is the only bill that actually has real incentives for Americans to conserve and rewarding them for efforts to conserve. We realize we do not have the infrastructure to move energy from one part of this country to the other. And the American Energy Act is the only one that realizes we must put extra money and effort into building our infrastructure or everything else is useless. We are the only ones that realize it has legal impediments. As was mentioned before, as soon as you open up an area, it is immediately open to open-ended standing so that anybody can sue, and that is, indeed, what happened. And in the Americans for American Energy Act, that is the only area that actually talks about reforming that process so that once a decision has been made, we can move forward. 
   The American Energy Act is the only one that recognizes solutions are made by people out there, because within the soul of American people is the creativity we need to solve our problems. And what we should be doing as a government is not trying to dictate solutions from here in these hallowed halls, but allowing Americans to find their solutions by themselves and then rewarding them for it. 
   When England became a superpower on the oceans, they did not have a way of mapping the oceans, so they established a prize of 20,000 pounds to the first person who could figure out how to do it. And the British clock maker from London who invented latitude and longitude, we are still using his invention. When Napoleon started marching with his troops, he realized he did not have a way of feeding them, so he gave a 14,000 frank prize to the first person to solve the problem. The vacuum-packed concept of food is the same thing he invented for 14,000 franks and we still use today. When Lindbergh flew across the ocean he was after a prize from a newspaper. And the aeronautics industry has developed from it. 
   All we need to do is say we will reward Americans for coming up and producing a solution and reward them well for it, and they will solve the problem without our expert attention driving that way. 
   Now, we've heard a lot of blame about the problem. We've heard Big Oil blame because they're gouging people, therefore let's tax them--which is what we tried 30 years ago when the development dried up; or we have said that they have leases out there they're not using it, so use it or lose it--even though that's exactly what the status quo is, indeed, doing. We've had all sorts of other ideas that Big Oil is the problem here. As Newt Gingrich said, if you really want to help Exxon, do nothing. They already have their oil. Sixty-eight percent of all the oil that is being drilled in this country and 87 percent of all the natural gas being drilled in this country today are being done by small entrepreneurial companies, 200 employees or less, names of which no one in this body has ever heard. 
   If we really want to expand our economy and add competition, which will lower price, expand the efforts of people to become involved in this process. What we need is not another political scheme, we have had 30 years of them; we need real solutions. And that is what we want, a vote on a real solution, not some faux solution, a real one that actually addresses real issues for real Americans and solves their real problems.     
   Groucho Marx once said that ``politics is the act of looking for the trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and applying the wrong remedies.'' If we're not careful, that's exactly what we could do in these next 2 weeks. We can't just go for the cheap fix political deal. We have to go for a  real solution that helps real people. And that's the vote that we demand.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (MISSISQUOI AND TROUT RIVERS WILD AND SCENIC RIVER STUDY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and it will be quite awhile. 
   Well, Mr. Chairman, here we are in a 15-day session. We're now one-fifth of the way through our final session before we end. The Democrat leaders, who have set the agenda and run this floor for almost 2 years now, have had 5 weeks in preparation for this day. So the first issue of significance, the only issue we may have this week that has a rule, the most significant piece of  legislation we're talking about today is a study that, if passed, may perhaps someday, if conditions allow and the elements are conducive, possibly create a compromise that would might possibly pass an additional 70 miles being added to the inventory of the national government, and only costing the taxpayers $300,000 to do it. That's what we're doing today. 
   I would like to make a couple of points about this particular bill, not necessarily in opposition to it. But one point that is significant; we talk a great deal in government about transparency. It's important to government to be transparent. It's good to be transparent--until it deals with how we treat people. 
   One of the things that the Republican Party has tried to do on almost every bill that has come either to committee or to the floor that deals with a trail, a heritage area, an historic area or a scenic river is to ensure that the people who will be involved in that area are informed up front about what may or may not happen to them. Because once we go to the next step and actually create this wild and scenic river, the Federal Government is given--not in this bill, but is given in the existing powers they have--the right of condemnation of any of that land that will be in that area. They have almost unlimited rights of easement. They always have the ability of dealing with local officials to create zoning ordinances that have a huge impact on the people in those areas. 
   Almost always these studies are done with small groups. And then citizens will come back to us afterwards and say we were unaware of what was actually happening at this time. The dairy farmers along this river--who may or may not need protection and may or may not be happy and satisfied with what will result to them--may or may not have any idea what will happen as they go through this study. 
   The first year I was here in Congress I passed a wilderness bill. I made sure that I went to every single property owner in that area that would be impacted by that wilderness bill, even the guy who was dead and had no heirs, which was a neat trick. But we went to every one of them to make sure they were well aware in advance of what was to take place. And yet when we tried to add an amendment, both in committee and once again before the Rules Committee, to make sure that everyone who may be impacted by this new designation and this study was made aware and they had to respond affirmatively that they wished to be part of the study, it was again rejected. 
   Why do we not treat Americans with respect? We will pass these types of provisions to empower government, but we will not ask the citizens who will be impacted by our decisions to be part of this particular process. It's something that used to be standard language that we would add to these types of provisions, and it should be added again. That's a flaw. 
   For 2 years Speaker Pelosi has been the one who was to set the agenda for our discussions here on the floor. One of those issues that I think people would like us to talk about is obviously energy. We have been talking about that for a long time. When this new leadership took over the House, on day one, when the energy prices started to climb and it was $2.22, the topic of discussion we had on this floor was congratulating the University of California-Santa Barbara soccer team. When energy reached $4 at the pump, I was here to spend a rollicking hour and a half talking about monkey bites. And today, after our 5-week adjournment, after people have been talking to us, after our constituents have said what is affecting them, after 5 weeks of preparation, what we are proposing to talk about today as the significant issue on the agenda is to study two rivers in Vermont. The only bill we will have with a rule, to study two rivers in Vermont. 
   And I hate to say this; I'm not opposed to it. There's no reason to be. It's fine. The bill is a nice bill. It can be improved significantly, but there's nothing wrong with it. The question is, why are we here talking about that after 5 weeks of getting prepared to talk about significant issues? 
   I had a couple of my constituents come to me. They said what they wanted to see Congress do is something in a bipartisan way; that we should come back here and show that we can work together. Indeed, the Senators have already told us that there is only a bipartisan energy plan of theirs, that's the only thing that can be passed, therefore, we should come together and support what they are trying to do in the spirit of bipartisanship, not only between two political parties, but between two branches of Congress. I am sure maybe someday this week we might even have another energy bill proposed for discussion on this floor, and I'm sure somebody will say this is the only thing we can pass; let us now embrace this in a spirit of bipartisanship so that we can show that we can work together. 
   Sometimes I have the feeling that we on this floor believe that if we toast one another or we slap one another on the back or we have congratulatory comity, that that, indeed, is the end of the discussion; that is the goal, not the means to reach some kind of discussion; when the end should be, have we solved the problem? 
   We have now had eight votes over 3 days on this floor, each of them getting around 400 plus votes. That is bipartisanship, that is comity, that is coming together. But have we solved what the needs of the American people are? Those eight votes, we've named three post offices, we said we're against hunger and we're for the Red Cross. That's good. But that does not solve the problems plaguing Americans. 
   If I was to go to a hospital and I was on the gurney being rushed into the surgery room, is it logical that I would look up at the assembled doctors and nurses and say, ``Look, when you open me up, I don't really care what you do inside just as long as you do it together in harmony, in a bipartisan way''? Or would it be much more logical for me to say, ``Ladies and gentlemen, when you open me up, solve the problem''? And that is, indeed, what the American people are looking at us to do here today is not necessarily find out how many bills we can pass on suspension, how much comity we can have, but how we can solve the problem. 
   To simply pass a political statement does not make a difference to individuals. We are supposed to be here to try and solve the problem. And it is very clear that the problem has to be some way in which we have an overarching, comprehensive energy proposal. That is the problem that we're facing. We need to come to this floor and actually encourage people to conserve, not by mandating conservation efforts, but by rewarding Americans for conservation efforts and they will take it from there. 
   We must come to the floor and finally realize that our problem is supply and demand, and that we have to increase production of that supply, that we do not have a logical pattern of funding alternative energy sources. 
   But if we could actually increase the amount of oil and coal and oil shale and natural gas, that we could use the royalties this government would then create to actually fund a comprehensive energy program for alternative energies--for solar, for wind power, for anything else that happens to be there--if we simply decided to use an ``all of the above'' approach. We can solve our problem in the emergency, for the beginning, for the present time, as well as coming up with a long-term strategy for the future that actually would be funded. 
   We could finally realize that this country does not have an infrastructure that will allow energy to be moved from one part of the country to the other. There are good friends in New England who will face high costs of heating their homes this fall. We have a good pipeline that goes, but it stops before it ever gets to their part of the country. 
   We need to solve those problems. We need to make sure we have more refineries. We need to make sure we do something on the electric grid. And we are not. That is the solution to the problem for the American people. 
   We need to finally realize that the future of this country is not going to be solved by bringing experts into Washington to sit around a room and come up with an idea, but the ability of America to solve its problem rests with the people out there. Because within the American people, without their soul and heart, is the ability and the creativity to come up with real solutions if we just empower them to find those solutions and then reward them  for the creativity that they can expound. 
   We need to realize that the solution to our problem is that the next time we lose 84,000 jobs it is not exacerbated by the lack of energy; that the next time an airline doesn't have enough energy to run 100 planes, they don't have to fire 1,100 people because of it; that the cab driver in Washington, D.C. who now drives 2 hours extra every day because he needs that to provide enough funds for the new energy he has to provide could actually be back at home meeting his kids after school the way he used to; or that we provide enough energy in here so the father in Virginia can finally go with his son to a father and son outing; or the family in Maryland can finally have enough energy so they can re-enroll their daughters in dance and gymnastics; so that school kids in the middle of this country can finally make it to field trips this year; or the teachers in our districts throughout this country will not find their salaries to be depressed or in some cases slashed because of unusual and unexpected energy costs in their districts; so that home heating oil will not drive people out of existence; so the farmer in the field will have enough energy to put in diesel in his tractors to produce the food so that truckers will have enough energy to drive them to market so that the prices of food that we have to pick up at those markets will not be spiraling this winter and this next year. And all of those is what we should be talking about. 
   The river is nice; it's okay. The study is okay. But it is not where we should be at this particular time because it doesn't solve the problem. 
   There are a lot of rich people in this body. For them, this energy crisis is an annoyance. But for those people on fixed incomes, those people at the bottom of the scale, those people in the middle class, we're not talking to them about energy policy. We're talking about the way they cook their food, the way they heat their homes, whether they have a job or not. 
   Three days into the last 15 days of this session, and the most significant issue is a study bill on two rivers in Vermont. This country is aching for legislation that will nourish the body politic, and yet we continue to put up, day after day on this body, pieces of legislation that are as nutritional as cotton candy. We need to do it differently. 
   But, on the plus side, we will probably do this bill in a bipartisan way. Doesn't it make you feel proud? 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity of talking about a bill that asks us to review energy issues with this particular piece of legislation. 
   When the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act was originally established, it was designed specifically to inhibit, if not stop, the production of dams across rivers where electricity could be the result. It is fitting and proper to see what kind of impact this wild and scenic river would have in that area, as well as the fact that this river, the Missisquoi River, translated means the great grassy meadow. It could possibly be the ``great gassy meadow'' if we find some kind of minerals down there, which, once again, a review of that I think would be appropriate.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Delaware for giving me this opportunity to discuss the concept of Head Start, which is a significant program that does a great deal of good for kids who are in dire need of this kind of service. 
   If indeed the decisions that we made in life were always of a vast contrast, differences were black versus white, night versus day, even the simple ones of right versus wrong, our life would be easy and our choices would be easy. 
   But, unfortunately, life is not like that. The decisions and choices we get to make are always going to be a shade of gray. We are given oftentimes two goods, and we have to decide which is the better choice. How we make those decisions identifies us as individuals; but it also defines what we are as a society. 
   This particular debate today is dealing with one of those basic choices between two goods. We have one of the big differences with this particular reauthorization of Head Start versus the reauthorization of Head Start that we passed last year, both of them good bills, is the concept of faith-based institutions within these two bodies. 
   One of the things that bothered me also as a speech teacher is as we are talking about this issue, sometimes we are talking different angles, kind of like ships passing in the night, without discussing the same definition of terms. 
   One side will say that faith-based institutions should not be used because of the hiring practices. If this institution decides to hire within their own religious group, a program that is legal both legislatively as well as judicially, then they should not be used in the concept of Head Start, or used as a program for Head Start. It has nothing to do with proselytizing, it has to do with whether they should be used at all. The other side simply says value is what is best for kids. Those are two goods. Neither one is necessarily bad. The issue is: Which is more important to us? 
   I am going to make the argument to you that if we really want to define our society, what we have to do is to say our highest value for this education program is what is best for kids. If, indeed, a faith-based institution is the best program to help kids break the cycle of poverty, understand the importance of education to try to lead a better life and improve their lives and their family's at the same time, then that has to be our highest value. That must be our highest value. 
   What we have to do is avoid the biases that we have on any other issue. The question is what best helps kids. Once again, if a faith-based institution is the best way of helping a kid, do it. For heaven's sake, do it. Do not hold kids hostage to our own social dogma. It may not be a bad social dogma, but the question is, where is our priority? What are our values? 
   With these kids who desperately need this help, this assistance, the most important thing is to give them that help so they can move forward and they can break the poverty cycle, and they can move on with their lives and help themselves and their families at the same time. 
   If that is not our goal, if that is not our purpose, if we are really not talking about how to help kids best, then we are fooling ourselves and making poor choices and kind of demeaning the entire debate and discussion of what the Federal Government will do in the area of education. 
   Once again, Mr. Chairman, we will have a chance to discuss these issues again in some other format, but I would urge my colleagues to remember we have to make a choice somehow, and our choice should be in the best interest of kids, and everything else, everything else, has to be secondary to that goal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from California yielding me this time. 
   I suppose I speak to you here and declare it first a nonconflict of interest. I was not here on this floor when the original resolution to approve the use of force was made; therefore, I took as my role and responsibility when I came in here to make sure that we did everything in our power to make sure that our policy objectives were indeed followed through and successful. 
   You know, in the other Chamber, in the original House floor there is a beautiful sculpture sitting up there which is a clock made out of a chariot. The clock is actually the wheel, then there is a chariot. And in that chariot is the muse of history with this tablet in hand writing down what we do on the people's floor, the subject and our actions in history. 
   Perhaps it is good that that still stays out those doors and down the hallways and is not here today, because when the muse of history records what we are doing today and yesterday and tomorrow, and maybe Friday, that history is going to be written with an element of contempt. 
   There are some people who have opposed this war from the very beginning; they still oppose it now; and I give them credit to their commitment to consistency, although I don't necessarily agree with their decision. Some of those have also criticized this resolution as also being too weak of a resolution, for indeed the resolution today is a nonbinding resolution. By definition, it means it does nothing. It changes nothing, but allows us all to make statements for media consumption and allows some of those who made the original vote to use force the ability to shirk the responsibility of that particular action. 
   Yesterday, I had the opportunity of going back to Baltimore and watching a play, ``Wicked.'' And in the play, the main character, the male lead, Fiero, is in love with Elphaba. And she tries to distance herself from him by saying, ``Yeah, but you're thoughtless and shallow.'' And Fiero says, ``I know, but I am a deep shallow.'' 
   This resolution is a deep shallow. It may have words aimed at the White House and the White House action, but regardless of those words, when history is written the finger of accusation will not point to the executive branch, who has been consistent, it is going to point back here to Congress, to our actions. 
   Our Constitution gives Congress the responsibility of the declaration of war. Instead, we passed a resolution approving force. With a war declaration, there is a commitment to action and to ultimate goals. A resolution of force implies something less, and it allows Members of Congress who did that to say, yes, I agreed with force but I didn't expect it to be used this way. Or, I wasn't really that serious. Or I didn't expect it to be anything more than a little war taking place. It is a process that allows you to be deeply shallow. 
   This resolution may clear the conscience of some people, it may put political distance between others, but it does noting for soldiers, it does nothing towards a U.S. victory, to benefit this country, or to improve the body politic. Our words, our actions, our votes will be looked on in history with contempt, for they are indeed in this issue deeply shallow. 
   In conclusion, I would like to describe the good that will come from this resolution for our Armed Forces. 
   Yes, that about sums it up. 
   Mr. Speaker, with disdain of the process of this flawed message that is so limited in its scope it does nothing to help those Members on either side of the aisle explain their nuances of their belief or this situation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 229, promoting the conservation and management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. 
   The United States has been instrumental in working towards a viable and successful rebuilding plan for western Atlantic bluefin tuna. Unfortunately, the countries fishing on the eastern bluefin tuna stock have repeatedly ignored the recommendations of the scientific committee and set quotas for eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna at unsustainable levels. To add insult to injury, those countries have not even complied with these unsustainable quotas, having continued to fish at levels far over the unsustainable quota level. 
   This concurrent resolution is very timely, within the 20th meeting of the Tuna Commission, occurring this week in Turkey. The U.S. delegation should continue its leadership role and propose additional conservation measures for eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna. Moreover, the delegation should work to get the Commission to adopt viable compliance measures and, if necessary, sanctions for those countries that continue to ignore the conservation and management recommendations of the Commission. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this particular bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (ACT COMMEMORATING THE LITE, OR LIFETIME INNOVATIONS OF THOMAS EDISON -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2627, which designates the Edison National Historic Site as the Thomas Edison National Historic Park. Supporters of the park anticipate this redesignation will improve the visitation revenue to the Edison historic site. 
   I would like also to recognize the critical contributions to this legislation made by Congressman Scott Garrett. Last year, Mr. Garrett successfully moved this bill through the Resources Committee in the House. I urge my colleagues to support this effort, and hopefully it will go all the way through both Houses at this time. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I have had the wonderful opportunity, or privilege, I guess, at different times, of standing, sitting in this chair, standing at this mike either to present bills or to control time or to present rules. Oftentimes, I was perplexed at the discussion that went on, because oftentimes our side would be giving wonderful speeches and their side would be giving wonderful speeches but never on the same topic. We didn't even have the terms defined. That will not happen today with this particular bill, because there is but one issue, and the issue is clear, and it is precise. 
   We do not have a problem with the creation of the wild and scenic river for this Eightmile area in the State of Connecticut. I am under the assumption that at the public hearings that were held in Connecticut, issues that could be of concern, for example, if you have a kid and want to add a bedroom, if you want to add a garage to your home, if you want to fix the roof to your house, if you want to repair a road that's been washed out or even ask to clear some of the brush next to the river, that not only could that possibly be prohibited, but it would probably be prohibited because there is precedent in other wild and scenic areas where that exact same thing has happened. 
   But, with that, and I am sure it was covered in those public hearings, I am convinced a majority of residents in this area supported the wild and scenic area. I was somewhat disenchanted, when we were told in the hearing it was unanimous support. Later on, we found out it was not that and the record has been amended to illustrate that. 
   In one city, in which one of the letters I received said only five people were opposed to it, in reality it was about a 400-person meeting with about a third, about 40 percent who were opposed to it. Still not a majority, so I am not opposed to the scenic river. 
   What is significant, though, is there is a significant minority of individuals in this area that are fearful of what may happen to their homes in this area. Their rights and their fears should be considered and should be considered carefully. It is ironic that this happens to be in the district in which both the leaders of the State and local government turned their backs on Susette Kelo and brought about that infamous court case decision dealing with Kelo, imminent domain issues. 
   We do not want that to be replicated, which is clearly why the Republicans presented language in both the Resources and Rules Committee to make it specifically clear what was the intent of this bill. The language we propose simply says, no Federal funds may be used to condemn land to carry out the purposes of this act or the amendment made by subsection B. Nothing would be done. It is puzzling to us why the Democratic Party would not support that language, when all the Democrats from the sponsor to the committee chairman say that is, indeed, their goal. 
   If their goal is not to use condemnation, then you should say so. Why this wasn't accepted in a bipartisan way is, for me, puzzling. Otherwise, this bill need not to be here today; it could easily be handled by unanimous consent. 
   The language that the chairman of the subcommittee gave you does not prohibit condemnation. It is based on zoning ordinances, zoning ordinances. 
   It is unusual that, indeed, Federal statute should be contingent on local governments coming up with their zoning ordinance as of a specific date. 
   What happens if they don't have those? What happens if they change those zoning ordinances, as has already happened? 
   This is like a trial lawyer's dream come true in being able to take this language to a court and say, Look, Congress didn't specifically protect property rights with no condemnation language; they put their emphasis on local control. Ergo, local control should take precedence. 
   They claim that the only land that will be taken will be done by donations or willing sellers. Another phrase, we have problems, simply because we have files that are bulging, of citizens who became willing sellers only after years of harassment put on them by Federal agencies. 
   If you mean that you don't want condemnation, say it. Say it in logical terms that any citizen, any lawyer or any judge will clearly understand. 
   If you don't mean it, then use double-talk, use loopholes. There is more that we need to talk about on this particular issue. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (EIGHTMILE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   As I said before, there are some significant issues that always take place on these particular types of bills. Indeed, there is no basic statutory structure for wild and scenic bills. They've gone all over the place, including the now infamous one in New Jersey, which I think was actually the last bill to go through during the last session. 
   These are the issues that we've talked about before which can, indeed, take place under wild and scenic areas where people do not have the right to fix their roof, do not have the right to expand their garage, do not have the right to clear areas on their own property. It is not just a possibility; it is actually a probability. There is precedent for all of those. 
   But once again, this isn't this key issue. We are willing to have 8 miles of scenic river in Connecticut. The key issue is defending those people in Connecticut and establishing a precedent that is significant the rest of the way. 
   It's not simply a matter of reading the bill; it's a matter of reading the law. The language of zoning requirement, which once again is a conditional one. You mentioned the Attorney General from the State of Connecticut wrote a letter and once again he said the act flatly prohibits use of eminent domain if, and once again that's the conditional language, if the lands are subject to local zoning laws that conform to the purposes of the act. And once again the date that these zoning laws should have been in effect, the zoning ordinances have already been changed from that particular date. 
   But the key element is that that zoning language, that willing seller language, is inserted into the existing bill and it comes directly after this sentence, and the sentence is very clear. Nothing contained in this section, which is everything we've been talking about in this bill, nothing contained in this section however, shall preclude the use of condemnation. Nothing that you add as far as zoning ordinances or willing sellers precludes the right the Secretary of Interior has in the rest of the bill and the rest of the section from condemnation, unless you simply adopt the Republican language, and that is why we hit over and over and over again on this issue. 
   It is important that we stand up for property rights and personal property. It's important that people have some sense of security and safety in their own homes. And this bill doesn't take away this provision of the act which says, nothing contained in this section shall preclude the use of condemnation. That is to which we object. That is the problem with this bill. That is what must change. 
   The Republican option was clear, simple and to the point. The Democrat option, whatever the motive was, is somewhat double-talk. It's a loophole. This language that we propose is very similar to what this body adopted by a voice vote with the Department of Interior appropriations bill. 
   And in conclusion, Madam Speaker, I'm actually sad that we had this bill before us at all. There is no reason this bill should be before us with a closed rule. I wish that the Democrats had moved in a bipartisan way to work with us to meet what are legitimate concerns. And if, indeed, protection of private property is a partisan issue, I'm more than happy to be on the side of private property. That's the right side to be on in this issue. This bill may indeed sometime become a metaphor for this entire section where we can see how much muscle can be flexed to push through issues rather than sitting down and trying to solve problems. 
   I truly hope that in the future we can work in a bipartisan way, that we can actually talk together to find language that is mutually acceptable to both sides of the aisle for these issues, because there's no reason that we should actually have to go through a closed rule on this type of a bill. 
   But the issue is simply black and white or yellow and black, I guess. Will you actually ensure, by taking the money away, there is no condemnation, or do you leave the language in the act? It's clear. It's understandable. It should be clear to our colleagues. It will be clear to our constituents and our voters. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, with the exception of 2 minutes, which I reserve for tomorrow.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FOR AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - December 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for offering, for allowing me an opportunity of saying a few words on what will be a significant piece of legislation that we will maybe be asked to vote upon this week. 
   You know, it is only intuitive that this Nation should be energy independent. If we were energy independent, not relying on foreign sources of energy from obviously other places, not only would it allow our military to have the flexibility it needs to function in whatever situation upon which it is called to be used, but it allows our diplomacy to be used in flexibility in any situation. 
   So, how do we actually replace this foreign oil that is presently being brought in here? Everyone who understands the situation will tell you there is no simple, single silver bullet. Multiple means have to be used. 
   Energy conservation, efficiency in transportation, things we have talked about, those are good. That is part of the mix. But only about 16 percent of our foreign oil imports could be eliminated simply by using efficiency in transportation or energy conservation means. Other methods have to be added to the mix as well, and one of those is biomass. 
   Biomass by itself could produce 24 percent of all the foreign oil we are importing into this country, far more than even our best efforts of conservation or efficiency. If we combined those two together, we are well on our way to trying to become energy independent. 
   For those of you like me that like technical talk, biomass is dead trees, dead shrubs, the stuff that burns in forests if you don't remove it first. And as much as our friends on the other side of the aisle will continuously say they want to require biomass to be part of the fuel standards, the renewable alternative fuel standards, the bill that will be brought before us this week will not allow biofuels, dead trees, to come from the one and the largest source of those dead materials, and that is Federal lands where we have unhealthy and overgrown forests. That is specifically prohibited as part of the alternative energy formula. 
   Now, when we limit the collection of hazardous fuels from those forests, that biomass material, what we are really doing in essence is gutting the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, a bipartisan bill that was passed last year, in an effort to prevent catastrophic fires, wildfires, those fires that we have  seen that destroy property, that actually push more pollutants into the air than any highway full of cars can ever do, and, more importantly, they destroy the lives of people who are caught in the path. This act was there to bring a new energy to people in the West and to help rural economies recover from a collapsed timber industry forced on them by outside sources. 
   This bill tries in some way to help with payment in lieu of taxes to western counties and secure rural schools; yet at the same time, secure rural schools are rural districts that relied upon the timber industry and can no longer do it because of outside decisions, and therefore they are getting subsidizations for their school systems. At the same time this bill tries to help those schools, it prohibits them from ever having any kind of natural recovery within those areas by prohibiting their last source of job creation in those areas, which is recovering the dead fuel in the forests. 
   Now, that is the hope, and that is eliminated in the bill that we will have coming before us. It isn't enough that this energy bill prevents the use of this material that is grown in those areas; it prohibits the use that is used in private forests to maintain their health as well. 
   The Democrat intents of this bill seems to be clear: If you can prohibit the collection of biomass, the dead stuff of the forests, and make the provisions so unworkable, then obviously no responsible company would ever attempt to comply and go in and therefore do it. So the essence is, like Marie Antoinette of old who said ``Let them eat cake,'' the essence of this bill is simply let it burn. That is what will happen to our forests, when it could be being used to help us become energy independent and energy self-sufficient. 
   And it is a key and crucial element. Not only can we help our societies by reducing wildfires, we can help have jobs in those rural areas that need them so desperately. We can help all of society become energy independent by using a renewable source, but it is specifically prohibited by the language that you will find in this particular bill. 
   Now, once again, I am very simple, and I need to know who is going to be hurt by this situation. I am an 
   old schoolteacher. 
   We have two States in the West bordering one another, one of which puts its emphasis on proactive energy development and the other does not. A starting teacher in the school district that puts its emphasis in proactive energy development makes $4,000 a year more than a fourth-year teacher in the neighboring State will do. So who is hurt when we prohibit and eliminate the opportunity of expanding our energy production in the West? Well, the kids are, the school system is, the teachers are, the road funds that you need to construct roads in those larger western areas. Those people who actually pay taxes will be hit higher when we don't need to do it if we simply look to the resources we have. 
   As the gentleman from New Mexico clearly said, quoting Daniel Webster, this quote that is in this Chamber, we sit and look at it every day, very few of us actually look up the words, but, once again, Daniel Webster said, ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests.'' And why? ``And see whether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' 
   This bill that will be before us is a bill that is not going to be worthy to be remembered. It does not move us towards energy self-sufficiency. It does not make us independent in our efforts. It does not grow our energy needs and provide jobs and provide a cleaner kind of energy for the future. 
   It simply doesn't make the cut on a whole bunch of areas, one of which happens to be biomass. What could have been a great source for energy in the future is literally shut out by provisions in this bill that should not be there, ever. It is the wrong approach to take. 
   Now, I appreciate the chance of rambling on here for a minute, and I appreciate what my good friend from New Mexico is doing to present the concepts that are in this bill that we are glossing over in an effort to try and rush an energy bill just before Christmas. No one is going to have the time to look at it. No one is going to have the time to study it. No one is going to have the time to simply sit down and say, you know, there is a better way. We could tweak it here and there and actually come up with a decent policy. But because we have waited and piddled around until the very end of the session when our backs are to the wall, we are going to be faced with an up or down vote on something that just isn't worth it. It has too many flaws. 
   With that, I would yield back to the gentleman from New Mexico.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. It was our understanding as I was waiting for the proper time to offer this amendment that the body would take the two colloquies first, and then we would have the opportunity of presenting this in this form. So I think actually going through this form in the long run was probably more timesaving than doing other kinds of actions if this was not allowed.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the courtesies, real or unreal, that have been granted to this point so far. 
   If you go back to the movie The Natural, there is a wonderful scene where this mythical team, the New York Knights, are on a losing tradition, so they bring a sports psychologist down to try and talk to the team. And as the sports psychologist is droning on to them, he says, ``You know, men, the mind is a strange thing. What is losing? Losing is a disease as contagious as the bubonic plague, attacking one  but infecting all. And consider yourself, if you are on a ship at sea gently rocking, gently rocking.'' 
   And at that point, Roy Hobbs can't take it anymore, so he bolts out of there because he realizes that if you are in a losing situation, talking about it doesn't help, only action on the field of play will help. 
   And when given the chance to go on the field and play, he pounded the ball and led them to victory after victory after victory. 
   And what we are talking about simply here tonight is what Americans want, which is for us to do something here on this playing field on the issue of energy and energy security. 
   We are fighting for the people of my district who will be faced with a 30 percent increase in heating costs this winter. We are fighting for the 1,100 people who lost their jobs with an airline because 100 planes were not able to be provided the fuel to fly. We are flying for an Ethiopian-born cab driver here in Washington, D.C. who, for the first time in his life since coming here, he cannot meet his kids at home because he has to drive two extra hours every night just to make up what he loses in these fees. We are fighting for a father in Virginia who can no longer go to his father-and-son outings because he can't afford the gasoline to drive there. We are talking about the Clark County School District which had an unexpected 62 percent of its budget all related to energy costs, and that all comes out of future salaries of the teachers of those poor areas. 
   If you are rich, this problem is simply an annoyance. Only 11 cents out of $1 goes to energy. But if you are on the poverty line, 50 cents of every dollar goes to energy. And that 50 cents that comes out of the pocket of a poor person or somebody on a fixed income is money that cannot be spent on luxuries like tuna casseroles or Hamburger Helper. 
   We are a country that has the technology and the ability to solve this problem. We are a country with a proud history of solving our problems with technology. Since 1784 when we invented the bifocals, to 1867 when we changed the world by inventing the typewriter and changed the West by inventing barbed wire and changed our lives by inventing toilet paper in the same year, to 1945 with the microwave, to even soft contacts today. We have had the technology to be able to solve this energy problem. And before us is an amendment which will reward Americans for their efforts of conservation in a way that we have not done in a long time. It will increase production of our energy sources by recognizing that not only do we have to have the fossil fuels increased, but all the royalties that we will now make by increased production in oil and gas and oil shale and coal will be used to fund the improvements and the innovations and the research for alternative energy so that we can look forward to the future. 
   We recognize that we have to do something with our infrastructure. We do not have the refinery capacity that we need. We recognize that Washington is not the seat of all wisdom, that bringing an expert into a room here is not going to solve our problems; but what we need to do is unlock the brilliance within Americans and within what they have to offer to the American people. By offering prizes, we can find solutions that have been plaguing and missing us for years. 
   In 1714, the British didn't have a way of mapping their waters in the navigation, so they offered a $20,000 prize and a clock maker came up with the system of longitude and latitude that we still use today. 
   In 1810, Napoleon needed a way to feed his troops. He gave a 12,000 franc prize to find somebody to use the vacuum-packed processes we still use today. 
   Lindbergh flew across the ocean to get a prize from a newspaper, and it spawned a $32 billion industry. 
   We have that capability today. We have the Roy Hobbs who realizes that the only way you solve the problem is get on the playing field and do it. 
   We have the ability to solve our problem today if we just come to this playing field and do it, and to require a vote on this amendment so that we can fulfill the words of Daniel Webster that are looking at us every day we come here to inspire us, to tell us to take our resources and to build from that, and to do something that is worthy to be remembered. 
   This amendment would be worthy to be remembered, and I urge that we accept this amendment and I urge that we have a vote on this amendment. This may be the only chance we actually have to have an up or down vote on this particular amendment, which impacts the lives of everybody but especially the most vulnerable in our society. 
   Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time remains? 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman has 15 seconds.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman from Wisconsin chose not to extend our time by debating energy here tonight. 
   I wish to speak specifically to this point of order. The issue on a point of order is the nexus between the amendment to the underlying bill, and it would be my contention there are multiple in which one can look. This particular bill on MILCON has at least eight references to runways and roads which are to be produced, all of which will be made by asphalt, which is a petroleum-based substance. With costs increasing, it would be a difficult price to try and do that. 
   We will have people coming in here talking about VA benefits to people, falling all over themselves stumbling to be good about it. That is great. But if, indeed, those VA hospitals are going to have a 30 percent increase in heating costs which have to be paid first, many of the benefits that we are looking at in this bill will be unable to be provided. It is almost like taking medicine off their trays when we require people to get those benefits to pay 4 and $5 a gallon to get there. 
   The couple in West Virginia that drove 80 miles every week and were reimbursed 11 cents a mile. For 8 bucks they could not fund their ability to get those benefits. 
   We will increase our benefits and, at the same time, tell veterans they are going to have to pay at a higher price out of their pocket to get those benefits. What we give with one hand will be taken back simply with another because of our inaction. 
   There is precedent for what I am attempting to do. In 1999, there was an amendment that was made in order even though it was in violation of the germaneness rule by Spence and Ortiz. In 2000 there were two more that were part of the Department of Transportation bill, bipartisan amendment. 
   There was another one that was made in 1990, and those are the original ones we were able to look at, let alone the concept of all sorts of legislation that we routinely put into appropriations types of measures. There is precedent for what I am trying to talk about. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is one of those situations where a ruling by the Chair will make a decision on whether we deny discussion on energy in this body or not. A ruling by the Chair will decide whether we talk about conservation and production and infrastructure needs; will deny or not a vote by the representatives of the people on an issue the people are asking for us to take a vote. 
   Benjamin Franklin, when talking about the Revolution once said that ``revolutions come into this world like illegitimate children.'' He didn't use the word illegitimate, but illegitimate children, ``half improvised and half compromised.'' 
   We have provided the improvisation for this issue. We are looking to the gentleman at the Chair to provide the compromise; to simply say that we can go forward with the debate that is significant, it is timely, it is important and does have significant nexus to this particular piece of legislation for, indeed, what we are appropriating cannot be accomplished if the energy prices continue to soar and make it an impossibility to do that. 
   This is a chance, Mr. Chairman, that the fate of the American economy and maybe our military intelligence will rest in the hands of your decision. It is my hope that you will decide in the favor of people on this particular point of order.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the recognition and the opportunity to say a few words on the topic that has been talked about here on the floor repeatedly as well as by our constituents on almost a daily basis. 
   For those of you who may not have heard it originally earlier this morning, I want to harken back once again to that old movie, ``The Natural.'' As you will remember, the fictional team--the New York Knights--in an effort to try and stop their losing streak, brought in a psychologist to speak to them, to the team. 
   As he was sitting there, talking to them, he simply said, ``The mind is a strange thing, men.'' 
   We must begin by asking what is ``losing.'' ``Losing'' is a disease as contagious as syphilis. ``Losing'' is a disease as contagious as the Bubonic plague, attacking one but infecting all. Now, imagine, if you will, you're on a ship at sea on a vast ocean, gently rocking, gently rocking, gently rocking, gently rocking. 
   At that stage, Roy Hobbs, not being able to take it anymore, realizing the possibility that actually winning a game has nothing to do with talking to a psychologist or to a psychiatrist at the team meeting but that it has everything to do with performance on the field, just bolted out of the room and ran up there because he couldn't take it anymore. 
   What Roy Hobbs realized is, if you are going to be successful, it has got to take action. You have to do something. There are too many people on this floor who have been talking and talking about energy. There are too many people who have tried to find scapegoats to blame for the energy situation we are in. They blame Big Oil. They tell you we're in an energy bubble of some kind. Yesterday, someone even suggested that Enron was the reason. The only thing we have done under the auspices of the majority party so far here is allow attorneys to go and sue OPEC countries so they'll give us more oil. Now, that is like talking to them and simply saying, ``Lack of energy is a disease.'' 
   Imagine you're on a ship, on a vast ocean of oil, gently rocking, gently rocking, but are not doing anything to get the job done. Indeed, if we continue on that pattern, we can be living in reality the words of the book, which are simply ``how we get along by freezing in the dark.'' 
   See, what Roy Hobbs understood in the movie was that, if you want to win, you don't get there by talking about it. You have to get out and do something. He went out on the field; he was given a chance to play, and he pounded the crap out of the ball. In so doing, he was able to be successful, and the New York Knights started to win, to win more than they ever had again. 
   One of the things this party is talking about is, if given the chance to play one more time on the field, we will go out there, and we will do things. We will promote action. We will not be satisfied with simply the psychology of saying, ``We will freeze in the dark and accept it and be happy about it.'' We will produce energy to eliminate the need for the consumption. Because you see? It is, indeed, an attitude. Our attitude should be that we are not accepting the status quo and that we are not going to be satisfied until we have a new goal in this country, which is to be energy-secure and energy-independent. That has to be our goal and that we are going to do things now to do it. 
   I hate to say this, but I am one of those who strongly supports American energy production. There was a time, if you actually admitted that in public, it was kind of like you're in favor of drowning kittens, but with gasoline's now costing $4 a gallon and being likely to rise, people's attitudes have now been changing. Some people used to say, if you were for American energy production, you were merely a shill for Big Oil. Unfortunately, there are still people who are saying that, but that's not the reality. 
   Who I am fighting for are the people who are being impacted by our energy crisis. I am fighting for the thousands of natural gas users in my home State of Utah who are going to be asked to pay next winter to heat their homes at an increased cost of around 36 percent. It will be the largest increase in their ability to heat their homes in the history of this country. 
   I am fighting for 1,100 citizens who lost their jobs last week and for the countless others who are going to pay increased ticket prices with the airlines because United Airlines announced it was cutting 1,100 jobs and was removing 100 airplanes from its fleet because it could not contain the spiraling oil fuel prices. 
   I am fighting for an Ethiopian-born, Washington, D.C. cab driver who for the first time since his kids started school was unable to greet them when they came home from school because, every day, he now has to work 2 hours longer just to make the same daily income he was making before this energy, gas price spiked. 
   I am fighting for people like Christine of Utah, who is actually selling her plasma now to make ends meet with this high-energy demand. 
   I am fighting for dozens of citizens in my State who are reportedly selling their jewelry, electronics--even one gold tooth--in order to cover the high cost of gasoline. 
   I am fighting for a young father in Virginia who was not able to attend his father-and-son outing last month because the cost of the gasoline to go there was too excessive. 
   I am fighting for the students in Nevada's Clark County School District who are facing a 62 percent budget overrun solely because of the amount of gas it takes to run the school buses in that county's district. 
   I am fighting for citizens in my home State who choose to risk imprisonment in order to fill up their tanks. One Utah minivan and truck driver, a minivan and truck that belong to the Alpine Medical Equipment Company, had his gas tank drilled, and the sole motive was to steal the gas in his tank.  Because of that, there were 30 needy people who did not receive their scheduled deliveries of oxygen tanks, wheelchairs and beds at their homes on that particular day. 
   Now, to my Democratic colleagues, I want you to notice there was no mention in that litany of people of Exxon or of Shell or of Conoco or of BP or of Chevron or of all of the other Big Oil scapegoats that we often hear about. But let me make no mistake. I do support these entities because I am for a fair and level-headed recognition that our main focus, that our main mission in this country, must be to deliver and to develop cheap, affordable energy for American citizens. They are not public enemy number one nor should we try and push off on scapegoats the inability to do that. We have the ability. We have the resources. That's why we're fighting today, and I will not cower in support of average Americans who need this kind of support. 
   Now, in so doing, the Western Caucus, of which I am a member, will be introducing a bill that is trying to do what needs to be done, which is to make sure that we have a comprehensive approach to energy development. Conservation is a key element in meeting our energy needs, but that alone will not solve the problem. Production of all means of energy because there is no one, single, silver bullet is a key element. That alone will not meet the needs. Innovation is also needed, innovation in some kind of effort that, when we have the new sources of energy that we can develop, we need to be able to deliver those sources of energy. 
   So the three elements that have to be in any particular bill and will be in a comprehensive American energy act are the concepts of pushing conservation, of pushing production and of pushing innovation, not necessarily in any particular order. All three of them have to be there if we are ever going to meet the needs of the American people. It has to be there. 
   There are some who would like to try and single out some particular area. There is a city in France that is kind of going back to the future. In fact, what the city in France did is they got rid of their entire municipal fleet, and instead of their municipal fleet of automobiles, they bought horse-drawn carriages. They are called eco-friendly, horse-drawn carriages. Each one of those fleets costs $17,000. They feature disk brakes, signal lamps, removable seats. That's how they're trying to solve their energy problem. 
   Now, the only thing I will caution once again, when we try to go backwards into history to try to solve our problems rather than using modern technology, is that, in 1900 in New York City, just before the automobile was introduced and everything was once again with those eco-friendly, horse-drawn carriages, New York City produced 90,000 tons of horse manure every year, not to mention the millions of gallons of horse urine every year. I'm sorry. That had to be disposed of, most of it in the water. 
   What they found in New York City is that it was impossible to get rid of all of the horse droppings, and therefore, there was on the streets a fine mist, a mist that was always in the air, and there was an endemic tuberculosis problem to the point where environmentalists in New York City, when automobiles were finally introduced, were happy because, for the first time, they could limit the amount of horse-drawn carriages and could actually improve the health of citizens in New York.     
   Sometimes, trying to go back in history or try to find a cheap, easy way is not the solution. The solution is technology. Technology can present solutions to all of our problems. Sometimes it's a long time in coming, sometimes it comes as rapidly as new cell phone plans. 
   Consider in 1900 what Jules Vern must have thought as he predicted in the future in his writings. Did he ever realize we would go from radios to iPods, from antibiotics to organ transplants? Do you think he actually envisioned the concept of bottled water? All those things are results of technology. 
   New technology will allow us to better use our existing energy resources, and that technology, which has to be part of this equation, the innovation part, has to be both in the public and the private sector. We need a major overhaul of the way Washington manages our input. We cannot solve all our problems by bringing in a bunch of experts to sit in a room in Washington. We must reach out with an aggressive national research effort. 
   One of the reasons we want to produce more energy in the United States is because the royalties we use can, and in this bill, will be funneled back into research so that technology can find even better ways of doing things. We also have to realize that as we are looking for that, it has to be market-driven. We cannot have an over-reliance on old technologies and uneconomical resources simply because they happen to be politically successful here in Washington. 
   The best way to destroy this effort of using technology is to allow government to pick winners and losers. It has to be done through the concept of the private sector. Federal mandates and massive government programs will not solve the problem. Certainly we will have government-funded labs. But they cannot be the only solution. I do not believe it is the only, nor is it the most practical way of solving our problem. If we want to think of how we can spur on innovation, what we have to do is tap the greatest resource this country has, which is the American people. 
   Just think of what American people have been able to do in history. In 1784, we invented bifocals, something I still don't use; 1794, the cotton gin, and it changed the world; 1805, Americans invented refrigerators, and the next year, coffeepots; 1837, it was power tools; 1849, the safety pin; 1867, the typewriter, which revolutionized the way information is handled; 1867, it was barbed wire, which enabled us to secure the West. Even more important, and also in 1867, we invented for the first time toilet paper. 
   In 1888, it was revolving doors. Three years later, it was escalators, which evolved into the Ferris wheel the next year. In 1903, crayons; 1905, windshield wipers; 1930, Scotch tape; 1945, microwaves; 1955, nuclear submarines; 1957, polio vaccine; 1970, optical fiber; 1972, the artificial heart. It continues on and on. 
   Clearly, a country creative enough to come up with bifocals, the first oil well, the first blue jeans, the first telephone, the first crayon, not to mention airplanes, lasers, computers, everything else, is capable of developing the next source of energy and the technology to develop and deliver that energy. 
   If we look at history, it's likely that we would have even begun it before we imagined it today. How are we able to do that? By doing what our bill proposes to do and presenting prizes for technological breakthroughs in innovation. 
   I remind you that the British government offered a prize in 1714 for a device capable of measuring longitude, and John Harrison, a clock maker, got 20,000 pounds for devising the first accurate and durable chronometer that transformed the way we traveled across the oceans. In 1810, the first vacuum-sealed food was produced, after 15 years of experimentation, because Napoleon offered 12,000 Francs as a prize. We still use that technology today. 
   Will the Speaker be kind enough to tell us how much time remains.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. In 1909, the first flight across the English Channel was spurred on by a prize from a newspaper. Charles Lindbergh made his flight, nonstop flight from New York to Paris because there was a prize offered. And a $30 billion aviation industry sprang out of that. The British Spitfire, which saved England in the Battle of Britain, was developed as a result of the Snyder Trophy, a prize for technological development. 
   The United States Government also offers prizes today with its NASA Centennial Challenge Program, and it reaches out to nontraditional sources of innovation in academia, in industry, as well as the public. 
   Americans have always looked to ourselves for solutions. If we just have the confidence in American ingenuity, American creativity to deal and to overcome our problems and to insist that we do it now, we do not wait, I am confident that we can do that. 
   As I said, in all sincerity, if we are to solve the problem at the gas pump  today, there are three elements that have to be there. We have to be able to produce more, to conserve more, and especially to innovate. 
   I am happy to be joined by my good friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson) and ask him if he would join us and talk about one of these areas which is extremely important to him, and he knows so much about it, that is the production end that has to go along with the increased technology for the innovation, as well as conservation. But without production, we cannot make it fit. 
   I am sure if we can have one of our good pages bring the easel and the first of the charts here, it can illustrate exactly what we are talking about as we move forward in this particular piece of legislation in an effort to try and make sure that we have a complete and rational policy towards energy production and solving the problems of people; letting them have their lives back with cheap and affordable American energy.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. It's my understanding the Forest Service is only removing about 2 billion, not 20 billion, but 2 billion board feet a year. Is that not a potential plus for it, and is it also not true that this Congress prohibited any new development in that area?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, who has done a great job in explaining the reality of the situation that we have and the reality of what our future can be if we are willing to take to the field right now and do it. So we are fine. 
   What we hope to do when we do a comprehensive bill is actually provide 12 steps that will fit what Mr. Peterson was talking about and the three goals: Increasing our conservation, increasing our production and increasing our innovation.     
   Those 12 steps are very simple. 
   First is increasing American natural gas. As Mr. Peterson just told you, we could heat 100 homes for the next 30 years with the natural gas we have available but not yet developed in this country alone. 
   Step two, increase American oil resources that we have in this country. We have increased the amount of oil we import seven times since the 1970s, and we decreased our exploration and production of American oil in the 1970s because of American policies, government policies. And the only thing we need to do to increase that so we can recover American oil supply is change American government policies. 
   Step three, look at coal, American coal. We have 200 to 300 years' worth of coal undeveloped, unsecured in this country. 
   Step four, develop American oil shale. 70 percent of all the oil shale in the world is in three western States in the United States, where there is more undeveloped oil than underneath the entire country of Saudi Arabia. 
   Step five, increase affordable and clean nuclear fuel. Since the 1970s, we have had no new nuclear power plant built, while our friends in France in that same time period have built 58 plants. That has to be part of a future solution. 
   Step six, we have to invest more in renewable sources of energy: Sunlight, wind, rain, tide, geothermal heat. All of those have to be increased. Right now, only about 7 percent of the total energy consumption comes from renewables. We are not going to solve the problem by this source alone; but if we could increase that, double it to 15 percent, 16 percent, 17 percent, we would  go a long way toward doing that. And part of the way of doing that is government policy again. When we try to improve our solar and wind power plants, if we would simply extend the investment tax credits by another 5 years we could start moving forward dramatically today in that particular area. 
   Step seven, greater efficiency and conservation, and especially giving incentives for the government to do that, for individuals, business, as well as government. And the reason I actually put business in there, they are already doing it. The U.S. steel industry today uses 45 percent less energy to produce 1 ton of steel. The U.S. forest and paper industry today uses 21 percent less energy to produce 1 ton of paper. We have the technology to do that. What the American government needs to do is to provide rewards for individuals and the government to do the same thing that the business community has taken on as a means of being profitable. 
   Step eight, we increase our gasoline refinement capacity. We all know we produce in the United States about 17 million barrels of oil a day, but our consumption need is 21 million barrels of oil today. And we all know we haven't built a new refinery since 1976; and only 23 years ago we had 324 operating refineries, today we have 148 operating refineries. And for those who are operating, they are still only marginal because the market does not bear them. What we have to have is increasing supply of American oil going to American refineries; we need, and this bill calls for, an additional 10 new refineries immediately built on property owned by the Department of Energy to do that part. 
   Step nine, to adopt common sense regulatory relief. Department of Interior suggests that we have about 80 billion barrels of recoverable oil and natural gas that are locked away because of regulatory controls that Congress has put on those areas. Our need for standards don't have to be sold out, but they need desperately to be reformed simply so we can make decisions faster, because we need relief now, not sometime in the future. That time was long ago. We need it now. 
   Step ten, we have to improve our transmission and energy infrastructure. We have 5 million miles of electrical distribution lines; we have 1 million miles of natural gas pipelines, and they are incredibly outdated and they do not supply America's needs. We have to improve those. If we are going to improve them with ethanol and we are starting to unload ethanol, we have to have blending terminals. We don't have it. Department of Interior has right now been tasked with trying to develop energy corridors for the future, and there are people trying to stop them from at least identifying where we will have energy corridors for the future. That cannot be. We must identify them, and they must be useable. 
   Step 11, we have to restore our domestic energy workforce. I hate to say this, but there are 90 percent fewer petroleum engineers and geoscientists who are graduating now than 20 years ago. Unfortunately, our workforce for the future and how we develop technology to innovate is simply not there. We have to provide some incentives, some rewards, some scholarships to develop that workforce. It has to be part of our program. 
   Finally, step 12, we have to tap American innovation to develop our new energy technologies. And I mentioned how we did that, the same way we have in history: We prepare and provide rewards for people in America who can solve our problems. 
   Now, as I said, one of the things my party is willing to do is move forward directly on this. Just like Roy Hobbs in The Natural realized sitting there listening to a lecture on the psychology of defeat does not produce a solution. Getting out on the field produces a solution. And what the Republican party wants to do is to get out on the field and make it happen, do the work now. And this comprehensive bill is one of those that have to take place. 
   We are ready to move forward with an attitude that it can be solved, it must be solved, and we have the capacity to do it. And our goal will be to become energy independent and energy secure now, not in the future, but now, in our lifetime. 
   I keep coming up here every day looking up at the top of this building with a quote by Daniel Webster up there which simply reads and tries to exhort to us: Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its power, and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered. 
   We have the capacity and the ability to do something worthy to be remembered, and the Republican party wants to get on the playing field to do that. That is our goal, that is our destiny. The American people deserve it. And we can't wait; we have to do it now. 
   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   So here we are debating a bill under a rule which we all know should have best been under a suspension. It's not a perfect bill. If they accept an amendment later on, it will be a perfect bill. But for any imperfections that are here, this bill has far better drafting, far better intent, far more bipartisanship than perhaps some illogical partisan gamesmanship that produced vociferous debate under suspensions yesterday. 
   But one would wonder why we are taking time on the floor to consider a bill which was passed out of the Resources Committee by a voice vote and a bill in which I intend to vote in favor? What is it about this bill that is actually so important that we are talking about it rather than other more pressing national issues such as an energy crisis? Why does such a relatively innocuous bill take precedence over finding solutions to gas prices that are now around $4 a gallon and probably going higher?     
   It must be that this bill accomplishes something so dramatically important that we are foolish to consider other issues, such as national security or our deepening dependence on foreign oil. 
   This bill deals with an area that includes no Federal waters. There are no Federal assets that are a part of it. It could easily be done with an inter-local cooperating agreement, which many States in the West use. Instead, the Federal Government is involved in that. Despite that fact, I still intend on voting for this particular bill. 
   This is a recreational bill. This bill provides moneys for trails, maps, signs, and all the nice things in the quest of healthy outdoor recreation in the Chesapeake Bay region. This program was originally authorized in 1998 as a 5-year program, and then reauthorized for another 5 years in 2002. And now the authorization, not for the program but for the appropriations for this program, are set to expire and the proponents are offering this legislation to authorize funding this program for eternity. 
   There will be no caps on the funds that can be appropriated for this program, no time limit. Maybe this is such a big priority for the Democratic majority because the National Park Service testified this program has received $7.7 million in earmarks since its creation. Maybe the Democrats wish to preserve a conduit for earmarks masquerading as a recreation bill. This is what takes precedence over national security and the energy crisis here on the floor of the House. 
   Yet, I don't object to the earmarks that were made for this particular bill, even though some of them are different. Part of the money that goes to this particular bill or has been earmarked in the past has been $20,000 dollars for a Native American interpretive brochure. I don't oppose that. Funds go into this for a Dino-Mania! Camp-In so that people can delve into the world of dinosaurs as your family spends the night in a Virginia Living Museum, explore how big some dinosaurs were, find out what might have caused their extinction, and it also comes with an evening snack and a breakfast. 
   My favorite, the Tree Spirits. The ancients believed the trees had spirits, and if you look hard enough, you see them in this woody bark. This workshop will focus on the old beliefs to trees, their meaning, their practical purposes. Fathers and sons will join the rangers on a hike as we scavenge the materials to make our own Tree Spirits for you all. 
   I actually don't object to that. I still intend to vote for this particular bill. 
   Nature hikes, picnics in the park, learning about ecology are causes to champion, and I'd be happy to support those things, but this bill doesn't solve the major threat to those activities. How will one be able to afford to get to these outdoor locations, enjoy these earmarks when the gas is too expensive to allow them to travel anywhere. At this point, Americans are not working to live, they are working to pay for the gas to get to work and back home. With gas at $4 a gallon, weekend family visits to the Chesapeake are becoming less and less of a possibility. 
   Unfortunately, our unwillingness to address the dramatic spike in energy prices today hurts American families, not only by putting some recreational activities beyond their reach, but by wrecking the household budget for basics, such as food, electricity, and medicine. Some people talk about our goal should be to get revenge on companies that produce energy, but such a program does not add one barrel of energy to meet the demands of the present time. 
   The Resources Committee, from which this legislation originated, is the same committee that has jurisdiction over domestic resources, resources on public lands, such as the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR. It's past time for the Resource Committee to stop in its quest to become merely a ``Recreation Committee.'' This country has locked up more resources in America than other nations have in their entire country. America is blessed with a wealth of natural resources and historically we have had the unique ability to develop and continuously improve the technology needed to use these resources. 
   We have faced and overcome bigger challenges in the past, but we in Congress must act now to meet the critical energy needs of today. We need to stop creating obstacles to domestic energy production so the American people can get to work and solve the problem. That should be the priority of the people, that should be our priority as well. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, if you recall back to the movie ``The Natural,'' if you remember there is that one wonderful scene where this mythical team, the New York Knights, have called in a psychologist to talk to the team to try to get them out of their losing slump. And as they are sitting there, talking to these ballplayers he says, ``The mind is a strange thing, men. We must begin by asking, what is losing? Losing is a disease that is as contagious as syphilis. Losing is a disease as contagious as the bubonic plague, attacking one, but infecting all. But curable. Now I want you to imagine you are on a vast ocean. You are on a ship at sea gently rocking, gently rocking, gently rocking, gently rocking.'' 
   In that scene Roy Hobbs, now in disgust, breaks out of that and leaves this therapy session, because he recognizes that the solution to their losing season is not sitting there talking philosophically about it, but actually going out on the field and doing something. 
   We today in the issue of energy are in the mode of simply talking about it. All we are doing is coming here and talking about these theoretical approaches, gently rocking, gently rocking. We are talking about building straw men that we can then knock about, whether it is big oil or a so-called bubble, or yesterday someone said the reason we are paying so much at the pump is because of Enron. Ken Lay has somehow reached up from the dead and somehow hiked up the price of gasoline. And our only solution to this entire situation so far is we have passed a piece of legislation that allows lawyers to go out and sue OPEC, in the hopes that maybe they might give us some more energy money. 
   It is almost as if what we are trying to say is we are going to have everyone sit down and listen to a psychologist that will try and convince us that freezing in the dark can be an enjoyable thing if we just have the right attitude towards it, because losing is simply a mind game and it is contagious. 
   What Roy Hobbs did is the exact opposite. He left that stuff. He went out on the field, he knocked the cover off the ball, and when they actually started doing something, that is when this mythical New York Knights team started to win. 
   If we want to solve the problem of energy for American citizens, we have got to stop, quit talking about it and our secret plans and coming up with these mythical enemies which we want to attack, and we simply have to go out and do something. And that means production now. We cannot sit here simply idly by while American people are suffering without actually doing something in reality. And that means yes on conservation, but it also means we have to increase production. If we don't do that, recreational opportunities like this particular bill have no purpose and have no meaning. There is nothing left for them to do. 
   If I could give a few statements that have been given by people who live in this area and who will be impacted by this particular bill and what they are  saying about the energy issues and how it impacts and affects them. 
   ``Repercussions,'' a quote here, ``from the escalating price of fuel are felt everywhere. Sportsfishing is no exception. Neither is the business of chartering, headboating or commercial fishing. The same applies to businesses associated with fishing. One big tackle shop proprietor told the other day, `I have four people and myself working now and not a single customer in the shop. Haven't seen one in 10 minutes.''' 
   ``Alex DeMetrick reports gas prices are soaring, having an impact on those who depend on boats and the Bay to make a living. Naming a work boat the `Last Penny,' which may have been a stab at some kind of subtle humor, it is striking a little too close to reality at the fuel docks around the bay as diesel is now at $4.50 a gallon and climbing. `Gas is doubling and the price of seafood is going down,' said one of the watermen who works there. `Working the water takes constant moving, but with crabs spotty and fuel high, watermen are trying to conserve. They are hurting us bad,' he says. `It's almost double in the past year, so it is taking a right good bite out of us,' says another one of the watermen who works there.'' 
   Over at Dredge Harbor, New Jersey, another one of those people who work there said high gas prices are also affecting his customers. ``Instead of taking four trips down the Chesapeake Bay, they now might take two trips this year, and most of their customers use their boats as homes afloat so they can conserve as much fuel as possible. High prices are somewhat affecting the sales.'' 
   Another one of the reports from this area, ``Elevated prices are causing some charter fishing captains to want to jump overboard.'' As one said who owns a yacht yard, he is selling gas for $4.20 per gallon at his fuel dock, and he has noticed fewer and fewer small power boats on the water. 
   What we are simply doing as we go along with this, there are other people that simply say, ``Now I can see no way of getting over the hump of fuel costs. We have got good fishing, but we have fewer and fewer customers. With gas prices going this way, we are simply losing the opportunity of using this resource for the purpose in which it was therefore designed. High costs not only affect the fishing industry on the water, local businesses are also feeling the gas price pinch. A local tackle shop simply said, `I still got people working there and no one is coming in there.' Gas prices are dipping into his resources and his ability to make a living.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have?

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. One of the things we have to deal with if we are actually going to deal in a proper way with the reauthorization of this entire program is to understand that if we are going to have these types of opportunities, either for people to recreate, people to learn, people to enjoy, people to enhance their entire environment, we have got to be able to get them there. Kind of like today. We seem to be needing to get people up from the White House, in which case they are walking because we can't afford the fuel to put them on buses to get them here. Therefore, things change because of those circumstances, and it is one of those concepts in which we are working. 
   If we really need to be serious about this, we have to realize that our energy crisis today is limiting the ability to experience this type of an environment, this type of attitude and this process. And if we want to make full use of the Chesapeake Bay resources that are there, we have to make sure that real people have the opportunity of going there and experiencing it. Because when we talk about oil prices, we are not simply talking about some concept, some ethereal project that is out there. We are talking about real people, how they live, how their jobs work, how they get to the chance to recreate and make their lives fuller and better. And that has to be an integral part of this discussion, ought to be an integral part. In fact, it is a more significant part of this discussion on a bill that still is a decent bill that should have been done as a suspension, not as a rule here on the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, one of the things I would still like to try and reemphasize as we are talking about this particular bill is this bill deals with the reauthorization of the appropriations concept. This is not about cleaning up the environment. Several of the speakers who have spoken today talked about the necessity of environmental protection. This is not the EPA's program. This is a wholly separate issue and a separate concept. 
   One of the things that we should keep in mind is the purpose and the concept of an authorizing committee, is an authorizing committee should be reviewing what we are trying to do at periodic bases. That is our purpose. 
   One of the things in this particular bill that is a problem, is problematic to the future, is that it rejects the ability of Congress to take periodic reviews of this particular program. When it was first initiated in 1998, there was a 5-year statute in which we would then review it. In 2002 we reviewed it. We are now looking at a bill that I think we are all going to agree is needed to go forward, but there still should be some kind of review. 
   It should not be forgotten that when we voted this particular bill in the Resource Committee on a voice vote, there were six other bills at that time similar in scope, similar in fashion, similar in funding, but each of them had a periodic review attached to it. So a bill by Mr. Udall, a bill by Ms. Baldwin, a bill by Mr. Bilbray, by Mrs. Bono Mack and Ms. Bordallo, all of them had the responsibility of allowing Congress to do what it is supposed to do and try to take some kind of review at regular basic intervals. 
   That still is the wisest approach to it. It is one of the few flaws that I actually find in this particular bill, and it is one of those flaws that probably should be addressed. 
   We talked about the kinds of grants that have been awarded in the past. There are $7.7 million worth of earmarks not asked by the agency that have been added to this. We have added grants in certain years that have been, for example, $34,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Marine Museum, $21,000 for the Stratford Hall Plantation; $12,000 for the Mason Neck State Park; and $18,000 for the Annapolis Maritime Museum. I am not objecting to these as being inappropriate. In fact, I could probably argue they were appropriate and they were needful. They are useful. But I am  saying that what Congress should do if we actually fulfill our responsibility is make sure that we look at these on a periodic basis, and that should be part of the statute. That is what we commonly do in most pieces of legislation, and it all should be part of this legislation at the same time. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, one more time, if we can try and emphasize the point of this. 
   This is still a decent bill. There are a few flaws, but it is a decent bill and I support it going forward with this particular bill. There are still some changes I would like to see in that bill. 
   Also, we must realize, though, that if we are talking about the overall use of this bill, we are taking time on the floor when we should be talking about much more significant and vital issues than this particular bill. 
   Having a rule on this bill is a strange use of the time of Congress, especially when there are much more significant issues that need to be debated and discussed at this particular time. And even though I plan on voting for this bill, it is one of those things that is still sad that we are as a Congress not addressing the core issues for which the people have sent us here and not looking at what should be the core issues for which the people have sent us here.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, the amendment that I proposed here was actually proposed in the committee as well, and it is an amendment which in all sincerity is an effort to try and make a good bill into a very, very good bill. It has no intentions whatsoever of trying to derail the path of successful completion of this particular bill, but actually solve a problem and present a sense of comfort that might not necessarily be there as the bill proceeds to the other body. 
   We are dealing, obviously, as some people have--not here on the floor, for all of us here on the floor who are Members, but some people have said that this is simply a sunsetting provision. It is not that. This program is not going to be sunsetted. But there is an authorization of appropriations which desperately needs that time to be looked at. 
   My amendment is designed to bring this bill in line with all the other bills that we have passed out of the Resources Committee this year. Typically  in the Resources Committee we review authorizations on specific periods of time. For this reason, I anxiously anticipate the support of Democratic colleagues, because this is good government. It is a fiscally responsible amendment. 
   My amendment reauthorizes the review of this program after 5 years. This is a compromise between the National Park Service request, which was no authorization at all. They were fine about technical assistance, but they suggested there should be no more grants given to this program, as they said this program has matured enough and don't need any more, and the bill's sponsor who was asking for an eternal unending authorization of appropriations. Five years was good enough the first time this program was authorized, it was sufficient when this program was reauthorized, and it ought to be a sufficient time for Congress not to abrogate our responsibility but do our responsibility to review the programs that we authorize and how they are being funded. 
   There is a reason we add these positions to bills. As I told you in the committee, the very committee that sent this bill out, there were six other bills in a similar status; and on each of those six bills we put in this process so that the committee could review that authorization and the funding source and what those programs were doing at 5-year intervals. Some bills we have passed out have no time limits, but in every situation they have funding limitations that are put on them. This particular bill in the course it is drafted right now has no funding limitation nor any review process to it. And that is where it can be improved. 
   There is a reason we add these provisions to bills. Without them, programs have a tendency of languishing, depending upon Federal funds, where we want them to encourage recipients of these funds to use them wisely and to have an incentive to produce results. When programs expire, we have a chance to reevaluate them and conduct this oversight. That is our responsibility as an authorizing committee and as Congress as a whole, and we should not abrogate that responsibility. Without my amendment, we are relinquishing our oversight and leaving it simply to appropriators. 
   Already this program has received, as I said earlier, $7.7 million in unrequested earmarks. This bill also eliminates the annual cap on the funds that are eligible to be received. I understand that this has been an excellent conduit for earmarks, but let us not lose the fiscal responsibility that we have to do and get away from simply handing out a blank check. 
   I mentioned earlier parts of the program that are funded, somewhat sarcastically, I admit. They do sound on the surface humorous. I am not opposed to what they are doing; I am not opposed to those programs. I am simply saying that Congress should have the responsibility of looking at those at a regular period. That is our job. 
   It is nearing impossibility for the average family to drive to any of these recreation areas; much of the responsibility for that lies here in Congress as well. Despite that fact, the other side of the aisle is unwilling to increase oil and gas reductions. I hope they will cut the taxpayers at least a small break by accepting this good government amendment, and allow us to review how the money is spent on a periodic basis as we traditionally do in most bills that come out of this committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate one more time the opportunity of talking about this. 
   It is one of the fundamental elements that we have as the concept of good government that Congress should exercise its right of oversight on programs. Even if we authorize a program, however good it should be, there still should be at a regular basis an oversight. It is not threatening to a program. It is the responsibility of Congress. 
   We do have a bunch of programs that simply run without that kind of oversight. Some programs whose authorization has lapsed still function on. That is not the concept of good government. We have things especially in our area, Coastal Zone Management, Endangered Species Act whose reauthorization has lapsed, still functions on under their authorization by the appropriators, but it needs to be reviewed by the Appropriations Committee. That is its purpose. 
   We have some programs that are permanent, that have no oversight whatsoever: Defense, food stamps, child health care, school lunches. But, once again, in each of those areas what Congress should be doing is exercising our responsibility, and simply saying there is nothing that we should pass that shouldn't ask Congress to relook at a bill and relook at a program, and evaluate the essence of that program if it is still the most significant thing we should be doing. Or perhaps our priorities have changed. That should not be seen as an attack on the bill, it should not be seen as something that is negative or unfriendly. It should be seen as something simply as reauthorizing and re-recognizing what we are supposed to be doing. That is our job as representatives of the people, is to constantly be looking at what we have authorized, reevaluate, and reappropriate. And we are doing something in this particular amendment in an effort to do that at a 5-year basis. That is not illogical. In fact, that is the norm. That is rational. That is what usually happens in these particular situations, and it is what should happen in this particular situation. Again, it is nothing again to try to harm the bill in any way; it is simply an effort to try to move us forward to make sure that Congress does its job, and does its job on a regular, appropriate level. That is why we are here. We should not abrogate that responsibility. We should accept that. We should embrace it. And we should try to move forward from that position. 
   I apologize for trying to elongate this in some particular way. I think I have said repeatedly what the crux of this issue is. This is not a proposition from Liechtenstein; this is simply the concept of, do we periodically review what we authorize. It is a plus thing that we should be doing. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

I hope it has been profitable for all of you as it has been profitable for us as we benefited from your particular system here, and I hope it also spurs you to have a continued interest in government and in politics. I realize that is not the norm. 
   When I was born, my father was mayor of the community. I always saw him involved in politics. I thought every family did that. What I found out, quite frankly, is that it is atypical. But what I hope for you is it is not atypical, and this spurs you on to continue to want to study, to participate and be a part of government. 
   The brilliance of our system of lay government is that common people can come together and you don't have to be trained to do this job. I know the way we do it, you think probably we should be trained. But, at the same time, common people can talk about issues and can make decisions for themselves. 
   We are both old teachers. As a history teacher, I now get to talk about F-22s and F-35s and public land policy and can do that because that is the way the system is designed. And through all of the flaws and the bumps and the grinds, the bottom line is still our system works. 
   I encourage you as you go back there to finish your education, become involved in your communities, become involved in your political parties, become involved in the system, and keep that encouragement, that interest alive. The future of this country depends upon you doing that. 
   So thank you for being here.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF GENERAL MICHAEL T. MOSELEY -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to express my appreciation to a fine public servant and military officer, former Air Force Chief of Staff, General Michael T. Moseley, who recently resigned on orders from the Secretary of Defense. 
   The timing of this unprecedented decision to dismiss both top Air Force leaders only days before the decision on the tanker program, and during a time of wartime stress on Air Force personnel, is unfortunate. Nevertheless, every military and civilian officer knows that he serves at the pleasure of the President and can be dismissed for any reason. As professional leaders, General Moseley and former Secretary Wynne accepted that fact. 
   Unfortunately, the entire record of their decades of public service may be at risk of being pushed aside. 
   In particular regard to General Michael Moseley, it would be hard to find a more competent and experienced Air Force chief since the service's inception over 60 years ago. Entering the Air Force in 1971, he quickly rose through the ranks, and his competency as the top F-15 pilot led to command responsibilities around the world. Like no other Air Force Chief in a generation, General Moseley demonstrated he knew how to command air power during combat operations because he led coalition Air Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq that employed greater precision and air-ground coordination than ever before. 
   He served as Chief of the Air Force during a very tumultuous time. He confronted the challenging budget and personnel cuts posed by the Quadrennial Defense Review, as well as additional cuts administered or mandated by the administration. 
   He helped to steer the Air Force through some tough times, and in so doing, and to his credit, he always put the airmen and their families first. He recognized that our Nation unwisely took a ``holiday from history'' in the 1990s by delaying aircraft modernization and, as a result, our pilots are flying aircraft that average nearly 40 years of age. We have F-15s literally falling apart in the air. We have F-16s that are nearing the end of their service-life. We have 40-year-old tankers and 50-year-old bombers. 
   And we have Third World nations that are fielding fighters that are, or soon will be, equal to our fourth-generation fighters. And, at the same  time, we have not committed to recapitalizing our fighter fleet of F-22s and F-35s in the number necessary to meet validated military requirements. It takes almost 20 years to develop, test and field a new advanced weapons system. If we take more ``holidays from history'' we leave our Nation and future generations at risk. This Nation has taken for granted our traditional air superiority. And General Moseley was right to have pointed out these vulnerabilities. 
   We never know in advance our next adversary. We must be prepared and strong for both asymmetric threats as well as resurgent adversarial nations, and General Moseley understood this very well. 
   The Air Force is still called upon around the clock to undertake combat missions, targeted air strikes, deliver troops and cargo and provide intelligence platforms. 
   Our ground forces have come to rely on the Air Force, mainly because, well, they're so competent. And that's no accident. General Moseley understood this because he was there actually commanding airmen in combat operations. 
   General Moseley recognized the national security implications posed by the growing cybersecurity threat. He did not just wring his hands. He took concrete actions to establish the Air Force Cyber Command Initiative. He oversaw the historic development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in combat, and also instituted training to help instill a ``warrior ethos'' in the Air Force. He should be commended for that vision. 
   I am proud of General Moseley. His sense of responsibility to the Air Force's overall mission led him to voice legitimate with Congress on matters like serious deficiencies in aircraft modernization, even at the risk of his career. To me, this is real integrity. When we have hearings on the Armed Services Committee, what we're after is the real truth, unvarnished and unblinking. We're not looking for a sanitized version. General Moseley was an advocate for modernization, and this advocacy is something which, though he was absolutely correct in both fact and merit, earned him criticisms where he should have found support. 
   The Secretary of Defense cited a failure of leadership within the Air Force in regards to its nuclear mission. Those are indeed serious charges, but the Department of Defense shares the responsibility through the impact of both budget cuts and BRAC mandates. These cuts clearly de-funded and de-emphasized nuclear matters. Cuts that were not the Air Force's preferred choice have taken a toll, and those budgets cuts must be acknowledged and corrected by this and future secretaries if we are truly going to address shortfalls in nuclear surety matters. I know that first-hand, as even I have had to request funding additions to cover documented shortfalls in the Minuteman III modernization program. 
   So in conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank General Michael Moseley, as well as Secretary Michael Wynne, for their dedicated public service to our Nation and our fighting men and women. From where I sit as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I believe that both these Air Force leaders can hold their heads high. I believe they are both men of great personal integrity, and I wish them well in their future endeavors.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, it is said that politicians live in the past and statesmen vote for the future. Indeed, the options that we have today, both militarily and diplomatic, are based on votes that were taken by Congress 10 or 15 years ago. 
   The supplemental act recently unveiled by the Democratic majority appears to have been written by politicians, not statesmen. It includes the postponement of the acquisition of two F-35 fighter aircraft, which by itself does not seem too significant, but it bespeaks an attitude to be feared. For when we postpone the acquisition of technologically advanced military equipment, we place the future air superiority, something we have had since the Korean War and take for granted, in jeopardy. When we divert dollars from one branch of the military to support another branch of the military, we place all of the military in jeopardy. All four branches of the military deserve to be fully and adequately funded, and that is something this supplemental does not do. 
   This supplemental simply starts us down the road to a place where a future Congress will look back and criticize us for our failure to be statesmen.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (WASTE AND ABUSE -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, when I was first elected to Congress, my incoming class decided to concentrate on the concept of exposing waste, fraud and abuse in national government. I wish I was still doing that because with all due respect, I have struck the mother lode of waste, fraud and abuse. 
   Tomorrow we will debate on this floor under a rule a perfect example of abusing taxpayers, fraud on taxpayers, and wasting of taxpayers' money. 
   Less than 10 years ago, Secretary Babbitt established an organization called the National Land Conservation System. He said it was his idea, his hope, to move from what he called the ``Bureau of Livestock and Mining,'' which was actually his legal responsibility, to what he wanted to be, a bureau of landscapes and monuments. He wanted this organization to emphasize and recognize the crown jewels of the Bureau of Land Management. 
   One has to ask: How does one actually recognize and emphasize the crown jewels of the Bureau of Land Management? 
   In hearings, we asked the bureau spokesman if before this entity was established, was the Bureau of Land Management incompetent in handling these goals, or of emphasizing and recognizing these lands. And the answer was, obviously, no. 
   So the question once again is: Why do we want tomorrow to codify and make permanent this entity which is at best redundant and is at worst simply a waste of taxpayers' money, because you see, this new entity doesn't appoint anyone. It doesn't fire anybody. It doesn't write or remove regulations. It doesn't administer or regulate. It doesn't do anything except cost the taxpayer $50 million a year to run it. 
   The best argument that the proponents of this bill will have is that it doesn't change anything. In essence, it does nothing to an entity that does nothing; so why do it. 
   Another of the great arguments is it won't cost us a dime, except when the sponsor was asked in his State newspaper whether this new system would have more funds and regulations, his response was, ``Well, you've got to establish the system, and then you go to step two.'' 
   In what actually is being purported as something that doesn't really change anything, my fear is this bill might actually do something. 
   The Department of Interior tentatively supports this proposal because it says it helps them to maintain the basic difference between a national park and a national monument on BLM land as opposed to a monument or park on National Park Service land. And the key element in the difference between the two is the concept in the BLM of multiple use on the public lands. 
   And yet when our side tried to introduce an amendment in the committee to make sure that multiple use was one of the key values of this new system, it was defeated on a party-line vote. And when we went to the Rules Committee to try to bring this issue to the floor, it was once again defeated on a party-line vote. 
   The only difference between BLM and National Park Service is this concept of multiple use, and yet this is one issue that is specifically eliminated from the bill that will be in discussion tomorrow. This bill is supposed to take the status quo and make it permanent; and yet all of the problems inherent in the status quo are not solved by this particular bill. We have great issue with private in holdings on these lands, none of which is addressed. 
   We tried to make sure that those people who like to recreate on these lands, that no boating, no shooting areas would be diminished if this went into effect, and once again that issue was rejected on a party-line vote and not even allowed to be discussed on the House floor.     
   We talked about potential border security, and an amendment will be granted tomorrow that says we will do nothing to change what we are doing on border security on these lands which are part of our border, and that is, indeed, one of the problems because it's not the status quo we want. It is change that needs to be done. 
   This area is sometimes called sarcastically the Trail of Amnesty, where it's estimated that every year a quarter of a million people will go through, those who are most of the worst in the human traffickers, the drug dealers and some of our gang members. 
   There is one ranch that is near this area; already in a short period of time has been burglarized 16 times even though he has iron bars on the window, a security system. When he's on horseback riding his ranch he finds needles, baby clothes, two skulls, four dead bodies. No Country for Old Men looks like a soap opera compared to this territory. 
   It is not the status quo we need to do. It is change that is essential. And once again, nothing like this happens. When we write fuzzy and vague language we invite lawsuits against the Federal Government. 
   We'll have an amendment tomorrow to try to eliminate or at least limit the kinds of potential lawsuits we have. We will see what happens because, once again, that was rejected in the committee. 
   This national land conservation system should not be codified and made permanent; if anything, it should be eliminated as a $50 million example of waste, fraud and abuse. The dream of Secretary Babbitt is really an expensive millstone around the neck of all taxpayers in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (REAFFIRMATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, when I was young, growing up, I would often ask my mother if I could go to my friend's house to play, and she would say no. And instinctively I would then say, well, Billy's mom lets him go. And my mom would then say, I know, but I am not Billy's mom and I don't care what Billy's mom lets Billy do. 
   Well, that was an important lesson that I learned. Unfortunately, some of our courts have failed to learn that specific lesson, and that is why I feel honored to be able to stand here and talk about the Reaffirmation of American Independence Resolution, which my good friend, the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, briefly introduced in his remarks. 
   This bill states that ``judicial determinations regarding the meaning of laws of the United States should not be based in whole or in part on judgments, laws or pronunciations of foreign institutions unless those foreign judgments, laws and pronouncements inform an understanding of the original meaning of the Constitution of the United States.'' 
   Now, why would we do this? This only sounds logical. We are doing it simply because one Supreme Court majority admitted that they referred to laws of other countries and to international authorities as instructive for its interpretation of our 8th amendment. 
   Another case, the Court once again took into account the European Court of Human Rights in establishing the belief systems that they came up with. 
   Now, you may ask, once again, so what? What does that mean? 
   Justice Scalia made a good answer on what that means. ``It lends itself,'' as he said, ``to manipulation.'' In fact, it invites manipulation. If I am a judge who wants, in some way, to overturn a decision, I need some reason for it. I have to sound in some way like an attorney. I need to cite something. You can't cite something that is American because what I am trying to do is overturn two centuries of American precedent. So you find some intelligent man living in Zimbabwe or Poland or somewhere else in the world and cite his examples, and it looks very lawyerly. But it is, of itself, a manipulation. 
   Precedent is extremely important in our system of justice. Having a standard that does not change is important for the judge so that he realizes the standard he used in case A and case B will always be the same. It is even more important for citizens, for individuals, so that they know whether they go before judge one or judge two it will once again be the same standard that will be used in that situation. When we break those precedents, when we allow foreign precedents to take over, what we are simply doing is opening up the process for arbitrary and capricious decisions to be made. We are not in the process of, as someone once said of evolving our standards of decency as a mark of the progress of the maturing society. Because as Justice Scalia again said, sometimes society does not mature; it simply rots. 
   And the purpose of the Bill of Rights was to prevent change, not to encourage it, so that you leave people guessing as to what is appropriate, what is politically correct and what is indeed legal. 
   Satchel Paige used to talk to young pitchers when they were trying to learn how to pitch and being too cute at the plate by hitting the corners and were walking people. And he simply said, ``throw strikes. Home plate don't move.''     
   If we allow the court system to base their decisions on foreign opinions as opposed to American precedent, then home plate moves and home plate moves in a way that hurts citizens of the United States. 
   Now, there are some lawyers, maybe Supreme Court Justices, and others who would say that my comparison of my mom's reasoning to foreign law used in an American court would be inaccurate or oversimplistic. Perhaps so because, after all, they say, didn't our Founding Fathers look to foreign law when they were forming the Constitution? Indeed, if you read the Federalist Papers, you will see lots of references to the Swiss system and the German system. It is full of it. But the issue at hand is, once the Constitution is established, then our job is to try to understand what it meant when it was adopted, not search for some hook to find an alternate opinion for personal reasons or personal pique. Now, that is the key. 
   We shouldn't care what Billy's mom or foreign courts let Billy do because our court is not Billy's mom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I thank the ranking member from California. 
   Madam Speaker, I stand, I guess, to oppose the reconciliation bill that doesn't reconcile much. In this particular bill, it encourages direct loan programs, programs that are paid for and controlled by the Federal Government, and whether intentionally or not, a tax to discourage programs like FFEL, which are public-private partnerships where the government actually provides funds, but they are not administered by the government. 
   In a clumsy way of verbiage, by lumping not-for-profit programs, and not-for-profit program lenders in the same category as for-profit lenders, it creates an unintended consequence that does harm to college students in my State. 
   My State has a higher education authority program. It's a not-for-profit-program administered by the State that provides students who have loans under this program with deductions. It's 1 1/4 percent automatic deduction if you have an automatic payment program. It's a 2 percent deduction on the rate after 48 consecutive payments have been on time, which means for a kid on this program on a standard $15,000 Stafford loan, he could actually save $2,000 over the cost of that loan and over what would happen in a direct pay program. Perhaps I am a little bit sensitive to this because I still have four kids in college, and I know what the expense of college actually means. 
   In this reconciliation bill, by lumping the not-for-profit programs with profit programs, the margins that they have in these not-for-profit programs are so small that these deductions will no longer be available, if, indeed, the program can survive by itself. 
   It will force students in my State either to pay the full government rate without any deductions or go to the full rate of a for-profit lender. 
   I know the intention of this bill is not to hurt kids. The intention of this bill is perhaps to rid FFEL programs; but in so doing, it actually does, in fact, hurt real kids who have programs right now or who may be having programs in the future. 
   Oftentimes when we fiddle around education, we have unintended consequences; but our actions here, because it is at such a gross level, have unintended consequences of hurting real live people. This bill does that. Not intentionally, but it still does that. 
   It would have been far better for us to do the program that the ranking member was always talking about, encouraging and expanding Pell Grants. That would do more to help kids than all the other restructuring we are doing in this particular reconciliation bill. 
   For those reasons, because it does hurt kids in my State, I have to oppose the reconciliation bill.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, the first chart that will eventually come up here, and I am sorry about this, indicates the States in the United States that have the hardest time increasing their education funding. This is where the funding is growing the slowest. 
   You notice the common denominator with these is not an attitude towards education, it is that most of these are land-based States. The land has been taken away from us to develop a property tax base. Fortunately, God has given us resources underneath that to compensate for that. But any program that would retard the leases or the royalties that will come from those will harm education in Western States. 
   My kids in Utah will be put at a disadvantage because of this particular amendment. There is collateral damage that takes place with amendments, and one of those deals with education. 
   If you can look at this chart in the proper way, this chart shows the salaries that are given for first-year teachers in Wyoming versus the salaries on average for fourth-year teachers in Montana. Now, this should not be that way, because Montana has the fewest amount of public lands of any of the Western States. They have more of a property tax base. The difference is Wyoming has the resources that they have developed, which allows them simply to put more money into their education system. 
   My colleagues who are still teachers deserve a decent salary, they deserve a decent retirement, we deserve the right to build our public schools. When you ask anything that shackles them from a brighter future, either by postponing or forcing to replow the data that the professional land managers have already established, it harms them. 
   You have taken away our land for property tax benefits. Allow us to develop the resources so that we can have  a future for education in the Western States that is on par with those in the Eastern States. It is important that we move forward. And I'm sorry, but there is collateral damage with this amendment that harms educators and education in the West.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, gas prices have finally hit $4 a gallon. That's $1.71 higher than when we first met as a Congress, and the Speaker said she had a secret plan to lower those costs. 
   Yet rather than talking about energy issues, we are talking, spending time to find scapegoats to blame for those costs, not realizing that for every dollar that goes up in energy costs, jobs are lost, income is reduced, our social programs are harmed and people simply suffer. We should be fighting for these issues, for the 1,100 people that worked for American Airlines but were fired because they couldn't afford the gas for 100 planes; for the Washington, D.C., cabbie who, for the first time in his life, cannot greet his kids at home when they come home from school because he has to work 2 hours a day longer for the same amount of money; for the Virginia father who can no longer attend his father-and-son outing because he can't afford the gas to go there. 
   People are suffering, and, instead, we are here on the floor dealing with congressional minutia. We must be dealing with legislation to improve conservation, improve production and improve innovations of how we deliver those fuel sources to the people. Otherwise we will become, as John Adams said, one useless man is disgraced, two are a law firm, and three or more become a Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to support H. Res. 978, which expresses the support for the designation of the week of March 3-7 of this year as the School Social Work Week. And it will promote the awareness of the vital role of school social workers in schools, and in the community as the whole, where they help students to prepare for their future as productive citizens. 
   From time to time, students face certain challenges to achieving academic  success. The emotional, social, and behavioral problems can be serious impediments to learning and can have a deleterious effect not just on the individual student, but on others in the school setting. Schools, families, communities must work collaboratively to assist students to achieve the positive academic and behavioral outcomes. 
   School social work service provides a comprehensive approach to meeting the needs of students through early identification, prevention, intervention, counseling, as well as support. And school social workers are trained, qualified professionals who meet the State requirements to practice social work specifically in a school setting. They provide direct services to students who experience academic and social difficulties. They develop relationships that bolster self-esteem, reward positive behavior. School social workers support teachers by offering options for addressing student needs and by participating in the student support team. School social workers work with families and communities, coordinate services to the students as well as to the family. 
   According to the National Mental Health Association, there are between 17 and 18 million children who are in need of mental health services, and those are just the ones I taught in my classes. These workers address those particular needs. School social workers help students who otherwise might not receive services due to inaccessibility or lack of availability of services. 
   So I commend these dedicated professionals for the service they provide, and I ask my colleagues also to support this resolution which would identify School Social Work Week this coming March. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 930, which supports the goals and ideals of Career and Technical Education Month. 
   Eighty-five years after the passage of the first piece of Federal vocational education legislation, career and technical education continues to evolve from its original and sole focus of preparing students for work immediately following high school. 
   Today, the goal of career and technical education is to empower students to participate effectively in an international economy. Career and technical education programs contribute to broad educational achievements of students. These programs may include classes in basic skills, but also higher level skills, such as the ability to utilize technology, the ability to think creatively, solve problems, and the ability to work independently and as part of a team. 
   Career and technical education is offered in middle school, high school, 2-year community and technical colleges, as well as other post-secondary schools. And career and technical education is designed to prepare high school students to transition successfully to post-secondary education. It is also designed to help college students acquire the skills and knowledge that are needed to find gainful employment. And it is designed to help workers acquire job skills in new fields or to refresh skills in their existing career path. 
   According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18 of the 20 fastest growing occupations within the next decade will require career and technical education. And according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 40 percent of employers report that job applicants need better skills in this area. 
   Career and technical education programs are an integral part of the public education system and are designed to educate for careers. Career and technical education prepares students for more than just a good-paying job; it is the beginning of a career path. And in today's workforce and economy, it is essential that students and workers remain life-long learners because the cutting edge skills don't remain cutting edge for long. Access to formal and informal training opportunities is critical to remain competitive. Career and technical education programs are the solution for securing this type of training. 
   Today's career and technical education programs are increasingly incorporating rigorous and challenging academic content standards. They provide a non-duplicative sequence of courses leading to an industry-recognized credential or certificate, or an associate or baccalaureate degree. 
   The programs of study offered through career and technical education are essential for our students and our workforce. For these reasons I stand in support of Career and Technical Education Month. 
   With that, I also thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird)  for introducing this bill. At some time I would hope he would answer whether skiing is considered part of career and technical education in his bill. And I ask my colleagues, in the bipartisan spirit that permeates our committee, to support this bill as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (PROVIDING FOR THE CONTINUED MINTING AND ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN $1 COINS IN 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill before us is truly a technical amendment that deals with the Native American $1 coin. It is a good bill for collectors. It does no harm to the Nation. It does not cost the taxpayers a dime, or in this case, it doesn't cost them a dollar. I urge its immediate passage.  
   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us is a technical amendment only. When the Native American $1 Coin Act passed the House last spring, it was envisioned the one-dollar coins with a regularly changed reverse celebrating different Native American themes would start being issued by the Mint last month--January 2008. 
   However, due to the press of other important business, the Senate was unable to pass the bill until the end of July and the minor changes made there required House approval. The result was that this very laudable program did not get to the President's desk until September, which triggered language in the text intended to ensure that the U.S. Mint had enough time to properly design the first coin, and so the program wills start next January instead. 
   To avoid having to send the bill back to the Senate again and further elongate the timeline, no attempt was made to change language that ended the production of the then-current design of the Sacagawea dollar coin, so that there would not be two designs co-circulating. That meant that the Sacagawea dollar by law cannot be produced this year, for the 5-10 million U.S. Mint proof sets that otherwise would have contained it. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill merely corrects that issue, so that collectors will be able to get the last of that design of the dollar coin during 2008 in their collectible sets. Next year new dollar coins will start circulating alongside the Presidential dollars, still bearing the image of Sacagawea on the front but once a year having a different reverse design representing the contributions of Native Americans to our heritage. 
   This bill will be good for collectors, will do no harm and will not cost the taxpayers a dime--or a dollar. I urge its immediate passage.  
   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 944, which honors the distinguished career of Army Lieutenant General Russel Honore, who is retiring, as has been said, after 37 years of service to this great Nation. 
   The United States Army is known for its tradition, strength, and valor, and Lieutenant General Honore exemplifies what it means to be a soldier. The general has had a career that young soldiers dream about. He saw action in both Iraq and Kuwait during the first Gulf War. He has earned 15 awards and decorations and has served overseas in both Germany and Korea. But perhaps  his most significant contribution to the Nation was as commander to the Joint Task Force Katrina following the devastation of the gulf coast in 2005. 
   The general commanded troops from all branches of our military in one of the worst natural disasters that our country has ever experienced. He was working not only to help repair his native State of Louisiana, but he was working to repair his country, and he did so in exemplary fashion. 
   I wish to honor Lieutenant General Honore and his family, Beverly, Stephanie, Kimberly, Stephen, and Michael, the best in what comes next for them, and I thank them for their commitment to this country as a family. I congratulate the general on his magnificent career, and I urge all Members to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3651, the Utah National Guard Readiness Act, was cosponsored by the entire Utah delegation. There are only three of us, but we all agreed. So Mr. Matheson, Mr. Cannon, and I are sponsoring this bill, as requested by the Adjutant General of the Utah National Guard as well as the Governor of the State of Utah, in order to address the long-term growing pains of the National Guard at their Camp Williams headquarters. 
   The Utah National Guard has run out of State-controlled land on which to expand and build and support its vital national guard and national defense missions. 
   The lands transferred under this act are already withdrawn from military use by the Guard from the Bureau of Land Management. So placing the land in the State's name for use by the National Guard will allow for the consolidation of ownership patterns in the critical headquarters area, and allow the State of Utah to bond for future Guard facilities in a more streamlined and cost-effective manner. 
   I thank the chairman of our committee, Mr. Rahall, and his staff, for working on this bill and moving it forward. I also thank the subcommittee chairman, Mr. Grijalva, for his assistance and that of the subcommittee professional staff. 
   In this day and age, we are asking the National Guardsmen to do more  and more heavy lifting for our Nation's defense and in deploying overseas in armed conflict. At the same time, we are asking them to also be on the frontlines in protect the homeland, and also to be there for our States and communities in times of emergency or natural disasters. We ask a lot of them, and they deliver. 
   This bill will allow our Utah National Guard to support its future mission growth in meeting these challenges. It is a small thing for us to be able to help them down the road in meeting their obligations. I thank my colleagues for consideration of this bill, and I strongly urge its adoption. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   This particular bill helps solve the conundrum that we face in the protection and conservation of certain species: For example, the bony-tailed chub, the razorback sucker, and the humpback chub. 
   H.R. 2515, introduced by Dean Heller of Nevada and Harry Mitchell of Arizona, is an amended bipartisan measure aimed at protecting endangered species while keeping the waters running and the lights on for consumers in the Southwest. 
   As amended at the committee level, this bill has been scaled back, but still codifies a very popular multi-species habitat conservation plan on the Lower Colorado River. I note that some water and power supply organizations support key provisions taken out by the majority. However, in the interest of moving this bill forward, they support the passage of this bill with the hope that the final bill signed into law will better resemble the original legislation. 
   At a time when our water supply is being diminished due to a number of factors, this bill--although somewhat incomplete--is still a win-win for our water and power consumers.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I rise in opposition to this legislation. This legislation would double the size of two of the marine sanctuaries off the coast of California, adding approximately 1,200 square miles and almost 100 miles of coastline, and with little or absolutely no public comment. Moreover, this is happening at the very same time that the management plans for the two sanctuaries are being reviewed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. NOAA could have considered this expansion during the ongoing process, but it did not because it considered the expansion to be complicated and something that would require effort, analysis, and public input. This legislation ignores the need for public comment on a very complicated expansion. 
   The entire intent of this legislation could be accomplished through public process that already exists. But, unfortunately, Congress can't wait to hear from the people. It is sad that the citizens of California, who are most affected by this legislation, will not have the opportunity to comment on this expansion in the normal statutory public comment process. 
   Again, I reluctantly oppose this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, allow me rhetorically, if I can, just to concentrate on one issue, the one at hand, which is the significant proposal, the motion to instruct made by the gentleman from Michigan. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, as well as the Education Committee, I strongly support this extremely important motion that has been given to us today. 
   On the day in July when my State celebrates the arrival of the pioneers into Salt Lake Valley, in a remote Pakistani town, the Pakistani police were closing in on one house that had been given as an intelligence tip that the top Taliban leader was inside. According to the Washington Post, this Taliban leader, Abdullah Mehsud, if I have pronounced that properly, was a short, round man in his early thirties, who had been an active Taliban commander in Pakistan for many years. 
   Amazingly, though, this same man had been among the first military detainees at Guantanamo and had been released in 2004. Upon his release, what did he do? Go back to Pakistan, once again working with the Taliban, helping al Qaeda infiltrators coming into the rugged mountains area of Pakistan. 
   But on this fateful day back in July, with the Pakistani police closing in, this top Taliban leader, who only the year before had been leading terrorist activities against mosques, had kidnapped a couple of Chinese engineers, and who knows what else, pulled the pin on a hand grenade and blew himself up rather than resubmit to the authorities. 
   It's memorable and reminds one of the extravagances that took place in March of 2004 in Madrid when the subway bombings killed 200, injured 2,000 people. This al Qaeda-inspired terrorist activity and the leaders of that were tracked down by Spanish authorities; and as they surrounded the apartment where they were, the terrorists, the al Qaeda terrorists, had preplanned their own self-martyrdom by having wired their own apartment. So as the police closed in upon them, they pushed the button, not only blowing themselves up but also almost imploding the entire building, which would have killed hundreds of other innocent victims. 
   Now, the reason, Mr. Speaker, that I present these two anecdotal stories is simply this: these people are not nice people. They're murderers of the worst sort. They're ideologically driven to kill. They would stop at nothing to try and kill as many men, women and children, if possible, in their goals of maximizing the amount of pain and destruction, especially those relating to us. They do not belong on American soil, nor do they belong to be released back to their own countries, where they can reorganize again, in this war, not just again on terror, but also the war against civilization and basic humanity. 
   The motion to instruct asks this conference to accept the language passed in a similar bill in the Senate on an overwhelming 94-3 vote that rejects transferring a terrorist detained in Guantanamo to the United States soil. Our penal system, as we envision it, is one of rehabilitation. Obviously, these people have not been rehabilitated; and as we discuss what we will do as our options, as we discuss any kind of closure that may take place in Guantanamo, we should obviously say which options are not acceptable. 
   Moving any of these prisoners to the United States is simply not acceptable. Returning them to their homes is simply not acceptable. Destroying the intelligence value we have at Guantanamo is simply not acceptable. 
   This sense of the Congress resolution simply is one of those things that this body, the people's body, the House of Representatives, should overwhelmingly support. I cannot imagine anyone honestly believing it is a good idea to close Guantanamo and bring these individuals into our neighborhoods and into our backyards, nor to release them back to their country of origin where they'd be free to reorganize themselves. 
   As Mr. McConnell said on the floor today, this is not a motion simply for the status quo. Flexibility of what our choices will be would still be allowed, but it does clearly say that the one option that is not acceptable would be a closing of Guantanamo Bay with the only option being of removing these people and bringing them back into our neighborhoods, back into our homes and back on American soil. 
   For that, I appreciate what the gentleman from Michigan has done in bringing this once again to our attention so that we can join the Senate in  making sure that this is very clear of what is not our policy option.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Chairman, first of all, I wish to thank the two gentlemen from California, Mr. McKeon and as much as I hate to, Mr. Miller as well, for continuing to work on this particular bill. To say that this bill that is before us today is vastly better than the one that came out of the committee is definitely one of the understatements of the century, and so I appreciate their efforts to continue to try to make improvements on this particular bill. 
   I still have some problems. You know, this is the era of the NBA draft, and every team that's involved in the NBA draft is going through all of the data. They are going through all the pictures, they are going through the reviews, and they are checking the schedules of all the players. Not one of them is basing their decisions on a couple of comments in the yearbook written in the high school year of one of the kids. 
   Unfortunately, this bill is based upon a GAO report that is spotty at best which dealt with anecdotal evidence, several deaths of teens that were reported in this program. My office received a very emotional call from one of those who was cited, one of the programs that was cited, saying that the death had been found to be an accident, but GAO had never asked them about it. In fact, the GAO investigator admitted the eight anecdotal cases that were brought before us, only one resulted in any kind of criminal activity which simply meant either these problems were dealt with in a professional way or the legal system failed us miserably. 
   The GAO investigator admitted not knowing how many problems existed and the depth of the problem, if there was any, because no official study had been done on those particular areas. 
   Instead, perceptions were made on these particular programs which are designed to help troubled youth, youth in difficult situations to begin with. 
   One of the studies I did see indicated that in a study that was done, wilderness programs like this designed for troubled kids estimate about 1.1 injuries of all kinds per 1,000 days of participation. High school football camps have 19.7 injuries per 1,000 days of participation. In fact, even average kids living at home who have a driver's license are estimated at 4.5 accidents per 1,000 days. 
   We are dealing with a situation here which is more anecdotal than actual, and we are still coming up with a bill, much better than what we had in committee, but still has a few problems. Subsection (J) still insists on a sex offender registry that is yet to be up and running. Subsection (M) deals with parental requirements in which the parent is supposed to give information yet there is no enforcement mechanism to ensure the parent actually gives that particular recommendation. So there is still work that needs to be done on this. 
   Perhaps I can end with a quote from a parent whose daughter was actually in the same program as one of those who testified in front of the committee in which she said: Improvements can only happen when they are based on reality rather than generalizations and politics. 
   The reality is that there are three basic approaches to residential placement of youth, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses and a different route to improve each. First, there are juvenile justice institutions; second, treatment facilities including psychiatric hospitals and residential treatment centers; and the third general type are those that we refer to as parental-choice schools and programs. 
   We can and need to do better, but a solution will come about from reasoned discussions and step-by-step improvements that address the real problems in each type of approach. I am dubious that the Federal Government has the ability to improve the situation. This is partly based on what I have seen in the committee hearings where the emphasis was on wringing political condemnations, blurring boundaries and appealing to ideology and biases, and partly because of chronic problems existing in the current public-funded and controlled programs. 
   In short, this is an approach in which the States, especially my State, are actually solving the problem in a better way right now. We do not need the Federal Government to be involved in this particular program.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I am told that one of the quirks of the system we have right now is in the State of California. Anyone who is age 14 or older can check him or herself out of a situation or a program, which may be one of the reasons why programs in other parts of the country have almost 30 percent of their residents in these parent-type choice programs coming from the State of California. Maybe in the future we should work on how California deals with the situation internally instead of having a one-size-fits-all program here when the States are close to the problem and actually have stepped up to the plate and are doing a better job in trying to emphasize and control these programs than anything that we can do here on the Federal level. 
   With that, once again I thank the chairman and the ranking member for improving this bill from where it was.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the time being yielded. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the processes of this particular bill is one that I hope we do not replicate very often because indeed there are nine separate bills tied together into one package. Each bill has a separate amount of merits to those particular bills. Some of them, like the bill by Mr. Skelton, the chairman from Missouri, is a very well-written bill. I particularly would like to thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Boozman) for writing a bill that I think went above and beyond the call of duty in trying to ensure that the rights of citizens who would be in this study area are protected, as well as ensuring that the maximum amount of participation can be given to those people who are living in that particular area. 
   There are also some elements in the bill as it came out of committee that I found personally egregious. Those have been removed from the bill that is here. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee and the subcommitees respectively as well as Democratic staff for making changes in this particular bill in a way that I find very appealing. I appreciate them for entering into discussions in an effort to find some kind of bipartisan cooperation with this, and I also am very appreciative of the professional manner in which the Democrat staff worked with our staff in coming up with a bill that I think is very positive coming out of here. 
   With the bill that is now before us, I certainly have no objections to this particular bill, and I wish to express my appreciation for putting this particular piece of legislation in a form that I think is commendable, and we can commend it and represent it and encourage our fellow Members of the House to vote for it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I had intended to obviously reserve my comments till the bill itself this afternoon, but after listening to the debate on the rule I felt somewhat compelled to say a few things about it. 
   Earlier this morning in the 1-minutes, one of the members of the Massachusetts delegation came to the floor and spoke about the significant problem of heating that will be taking place in the State of Massachusetts. He said that there were 350,000 people of Massachusetts that needed LIHEAP. That is subsidization for heating energy that all of us in the United States pay for the citizens of his State, and there would be more this fall. In fact, he said heat is not optional. It is something that has to be there. 
   Certainly this action right now does not help that problem. It retards our efforts to try and come up with it. 
   I am also somewhat confused as we are talking about this proposal. It is very clear that this proposal to study this river had certain sections. We are only talking here so far about segment 4; the lower part of the Taunton River, which, for the first time, has been designated as a potential wild and scenic river site. 
   I will say though that when the Park Service presented their information, they did not come up with a recommendation; they came up with three recommendations. Only recommendation B is the one that has decided to be included in this particular bill, the so-called environmental recommendation. 
   But I want you to know in the recommendation in which they said this particular recommendation is easily for a river that is the most developed of any that has ever been submitted for this kind of designation, and that would be problematic, and there is no precedent, no precedent for this kind of area to be included in a wild and scenic designation, although it does meet political expectations of the area. 
   Now, there are other options that we could take, and there will be an amendment put on this floor to do this the right way, by taking the area that in 2000 was designated for study and appropriated for study and putting that which does have wild and scenic designation and characteristics into existence. But not this lower portion. 
   In fact, there is another article that appeared yesterday in the Massachusetts paper which simply said, scenic designation could sink riverfront businesses. Indeed, what we are trying to do here is an effort that will aid some businesses but harm other businesses.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Just as in 2002, the Massachusetts delegation asked and received an appropriation to dredge this river in the effort to help some economic businesses and not necessarily others. The fact that it was dredgeable and that it was dredged, I am sorry. I don't know if it was actually done, but the fact that it was eligible for dredging ignores the area and the criteria that is necessary even for recreational purposes in the wild and scenic designation. 
   There are significant problems with this type of approach, not represented by us but represented by the Park Service. There are problems, as we have talked about, the denial for the permit for an LNG port that was supposedly done by Commerce, supposedly done by the Coast Guard, and the other group to which the gentleman mentioned, those were not permanent denials. Those were temporary denials. In fact, each of them said that they could be reinstituted and reapproached. It is very possible to reinstitute another proposal for a LNG port at this site, unless this bill is passed. 
   Now, that is the reality of what is going on here. It is far different than some of the spin that we have been hearing. But this is a problematic approach.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (TAUNTON RIVER WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   If this body were a debating society or we were involved in a high school forensics tournament and this bill were the topic of the tournament, I would be giddy with happiness every time one of my teams was given the negative side of the debate because there are so many reasons why this bill is a bad bill for policy reasons that it would almost be a rhetorical feast for even the most inexperienced and naive of my high school debaters. 
   Let me at least start by addressing three of the main problems with this particular bill. 
   First, this bill is very clearly an abuse of the Wild and Scenic River language. In 1968 when this bill was passed, its purpose was to inhibit dams and locks along rivers so that there could be a free flow of water on rustic rivers. The verb used in that act was ``preservation.'' The goal and purpose was preservation. Not rehabilitation, not restoration, certainly not economic advantage or economic development, but simply preservation. There are some elements of this particular river which have the qualities of a wild and scenic river, specifically the upper parts of the Taunton River. But the lower parts of the Taunton River, what is sometimes called segment 4, are the elements of this river which provide major problems. They are not and do not have the qualities of a wild and scenic river. 
   You've seen the pictures before. All you need to do is look at the pictures and you recognize this is not the design of a wild and scenic river as envisioned in the 1968 legislation. In fact, the only part of this river that's scenic is the graffiti that's found on the bridges and the human embankments that are part of this river system. The only thing that's wild about this river are the gangs that wrote this graffiti in the first place. These are not the qualities of which we are looking for. In fact, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that if you are floating down this river, it is not a wild and scenic if you can look over and see the local McDonald's right there on the bank. 
   What we also have is the understanding that this lower portion is supposed to be for recreation. We could believe it would be for recreation if you believe that tugboat races or barge surfing would be considered recreational activities. This is not the kind of material that one would want to find floating in a river for Boy Scout troops to try to paddle their canoes around or by. 
   This bill simply violates the concept of the wild and scenic river. The wild and scenic river was never intended to go through an industrial park. It was always intended to be water that was surrounded by public lands so that you could control and preserve both the water and the embankment of those public lands, not something that goes through a privatized residential/industrial park. 
   Also, if you look at section 1 of the act that it specifically talks not only about preservation of the water but the embankment as well, that actually in a real wild and scenic river, the National Park Service is required to take the embankment as well up to a quarter of a mile away and put that aside. Obviously, you can't do this because there is no public land on this lower Taunton River, although the National Park Service does have eminent domain power; so if you really wanted to create a true wild and scenic river, we could probably accomplish that deal if that was really what you are after. 
   This bill provides economic advantages to some elements but not to others. In 2002 the sponsor and other members of the Massachusetts delegation received an earmark to try to dredge this river, a fact which should disqualify it within the National Park Service criteria in the first place. Yet what it does now when we want to make this a wild and scenic river is simply take the law and turn it on its head. This bill gives current businesses disadvantages and some current businesses advantages, as is clearly illustrated in the newspaper articles that are coming from this area already where people are wanting to know what we do to see how it impacts, positively or negatively, their business operation. And that was never, never, never the intent of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   Secondly, this is simply an abuse of the system, an abuse of power. In the year 2000, this Congress authorized a study of the Taunton River, the upper Taunton River. The authorization was for the upper Taunton River. The appropriation was to study the upper Taunton River. And yet mysteriously the National Park Service, a system that has millions of dollars of backlog, a system that has 37 studies still in backlog for Wild and Scenic River projects, a system that is always talking about how pressed they are for cash, volunteered in actual disregard to the legislative direction and legislative intent to study something never intended to be studied, never directed to be studied, and spent roughly $400,000 to do it, in total violation to the aspect of Congress and the requirements of Congress. 
   One low-level employee within the National Park Service felt in some way compelled to violate Federal law to study the wrong part of the river and to spend money illegally to study the wrong part of the river and then in his report had the audacity to say, well, this would be the most developed river we would ever have in this kind of status. When asked why he did that, his response was very simple to us in committee: He did what the river would choose to do if it could speak.     
   He said that twice. Not only do we have a mid-level bureaucrat who is talking to water, but he is now interpreting the will of water. And if in 2002 it wished to be dredged and in 2008 it wishes to be wild and scenic, this must be schizophrenic water at the same time. 
   Here is the problem: When the National Park Service came up with their report, they did not come up with one alternative. The sponsor has chosen one of the alternatives to make part of this bill. They call that the ``environmentally preferred'' alternative. But there were two other alternatives  which I compare to the rational and the intelligent alternatives that did not include the lower Taunton River. And, in fact, in this so-called second version that has now become part of this bill, the report said it was problematic that there is no precedent for this kind of action, no precedent for this kind of action, but it does meet political expectations. 
   Let me give a third reason, and yes indeed, this is an energy reason. The potential LNG port which would be put in Weaver's Cove would have been the largest taxpaying entity. And it was not agreed to to move on so far, but it has not been stopped. This project is still viable until the year 2015. This bill, if passed, is the only way to permanently make this a moot issue. 
   This language is the language of the report, which simply meant that the current proposal was to be rejected but that they encouraged an additional proposal to try and work out the situational problems to be encouraged. And they gave them the time to do that. The actual report encourages them to review this issue one more time. So it is true that this issue of an LNG port is still on the table. And the only way it can be permanently taken off the table is by passage of this type of bill. 
   Now why would that impact me because I live in Utah and I really don't care about this river all that much? It is simply because one of the members of the delegation came down on the floor this morning and said that last year 350,000, according to his numbers, individuals in the State of Massachusetts had to be given subsidies under LIHEAP, paid by all the taxpayers of the Nation, because they did not have the ability to handle the energy crisis within their State and that, indeed, heat was not something that was negotiable. However, the problem is, why don't we simply solve the problem by providing the energy there so that you don't have to tell the citizens of Massachusetts to freeze in the dark but solve the problem yourselves? 
   There was an interesting discussion on the floor during the rule which the gentleman, Mr. Hastings of Washington, was criticized for not having LNG ports in his home State. I wish to simply respond that it was a factual accuracy that has total irrelevance to the issue, because Washington State does not need LNG ports. It has gas pipelines. The entire West is provided by gas pipelines that do not reach to the eastern coast. The only way Massachusetts can step up and solve their own problem is by having not fewer but more LNG ports. That is the only option that is left to them. And this bill does inhibit that particular option. 
   Now with that are only three of the many reasons why this bill should not be passed, why this bill is poor public policy, why this bill does abuse the statute and change the meaning of the words that were intended for a wild and scenic river, why this bill does disrespect to this body and how we decided to try and do this study in the first place by ignoring the will of Congress and ignoring the authorization and appropriation of Congress and going off on some other particular way. And it does stop any potential improvements of an LNG port on this river which is desperately needed in that part of the country. 
   Those are only three of the possible reasons. There are others. I'm sure we will hear from those others as this discussion continues on. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate very much the gentleman from Massachusetts standing up to defend his constituency. It is the right thing to do. It is the proper thing for him to do. It is his job and purpose. But once again, I want him to focus in on the reality of the situation, which is not the quality of the individuals in Massachusetts. It is simply the issue at hand. This, by the way, is that same battleship--assuming there should be a battleship in a wild and scenic river zone--this is the same battleship from the other angle which is decidedly less pristine and much more urbanized. 
   But the issue at hand that the gentlemen on the other side need to deal with is that the purpose of the act is for preservation, not rehabilitation, not for economic development, which are the very words that were just used. That is not what the Wild and Scenic River Act was ever intended to do. And that is what is going to be done in this particular bill. That is why we are abusing the vocabulary of the Wild and Scenic River Act. And we must focus back in on what we are doing. Indeed, the proposed LNG port is in an existing brownfield, zoned for maritime industrial use. But the issue is for what purpose are the verbs and the nouns in the Wild and Scenic River Act supposed to be implied? And does it apply to the lower Taunton? And the answer is simply ``no.'' It doesn't meet the definition. 
   With that, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia, unless, Mr. Chairman, you would like us to reserve and then come back.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate once again the comments that have been made here. I appreciate the defense of constituencies. I appreciate that there is a difference between gasoline that goes in a car and gasoline that heats a home, and LIHEAP does deal with gas that does heat homes. 
   But once again, the issue is not the same. I want to focus on the issue. The beautiful picture you had here of the park does not qualify for the purpose of a wild and scenic river designation. That is why under the law, you are supposed to take a quarter mile on either side of the river and stop everything from that area. It is already developed. Development does not qualify even under the concept of recreation under the letter of the law. 
   This bill is bad because the study itself violated the law. Congress told the National Park Service to study the upper river and paid for a study of the upper river which has legitimate merits to it, and instead they studied the lower river in violation of the congressional directive. 
   Once they wrote their report, they still said it was problematic. There is no precedent for the lower river. It is still the problem of the details of what the river is supposed to be. 
   The department still recommends not doing this. The National Park Service recommends not doing this until the entire study has been totally completed. So once again we are back to this issue of what does it mean to have a wild and scenic designation? 
   The upper Taunton River has those qualities. The lower Taunton River does not because the purpose is for preservation, not for economic development, not for creating more urban parks, not for changing the landscape on the sides. It is for the purpose of preserving a river in its native state. That was the purpose of, and that is the intent, and there has never been a proposal to this date that is this far afield from the purpose of the 1968 act. Never. That is why there is no precedent ever for this type of action. That's why this bill should not go forward. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Once again I appreciate the comments from the gentleman, and I would like once again to try and focus on what is indeed the issue. The State of Rhode Island, the State of Massachusetts do, indeed, have coastal zone management acts in which they get Federal money to help maintain the quality of their coastal zones and rivers. The fact that they are cool rivers running in urban areas is wonderful. You can do it, it's great, but not under the definition of this act. 
   When the gentleman from Rhode Island says you want to put it back to the way it were, it disqualifies it from the concept of preservation of existing facilities and preservation of existing embankments. That's why you have struck too far when you go into the lower Taunton River. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have letters in opposition to this bill from the Shipbuilders Council of America, as well as from three companies who actually do business on the lower Taunton River who are worried about the kind of economic disadvantage they may be facing that I would like to be placed in the Record.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate once again the discussion that we have had here today. 
   The gentleman from Massachusetts, who is the chairman of a very important committee, does a great job, charming, witty, one of the funniest Members we have in Congress, actually said what my close was going to be. Someone once asked me, why do I care about this? I'm from Utah. I don't care about this river in Massachusetts. 
   And you're right. I really don't. I didn't get involved in this issue by choice. The gentleman introduced a bill that had to come to my committee. 
   But the reason that I do care is because exactly what the gentleman from Massachusetts said. We are attempting, in a vote, by a majority vote, to change the definition of law. 
   When I was in college, I had a professor that told me that all those men that went to the Constitutional Convention had baggage that they took, which meant they had a common educational, classic educational system. They understood what they were talking about. They went back to the concepts of Aristotle, who loved to make  definitions of everything. He said government was of the one, the few, and the many, and it could be either good or bad depending upon the attitude of those who were empowered to govern. 
   Government that was good is a government where the people, the leaders of that government, cared about the individuals and were self-sacrificing. Government that was bad is where the people didn't care and they tried to make things for themselves. 
   Then he gave definitions to that. So a government of one that was good was a monarchy, called a monarch back then, that's positive. Government of one that was bad was a tyranny. It is no coincidence that Thomas Jefferson, when he wrote the Declaration of Independence, of all the terms he could use to describe King George called him a tyrant, because it harkened back to their common understanding of classical literature and everything that Aristotle wrote. 
   The government of the many that was good, he called a polity. The government of the many that was bad, bad intentions, bad mindset, he called a democracy. 
   That's one of the reasons why we very seldom used the term ``democracy'' for the first 150-plus years of this country. The idea was that the worst form of government is one in which by a majority vote you can either take property from someone else and redistribute it or you can change the definition of the law--by a majority vote. 
   And that's why I object to this bill, because that is exactly what we are trying to do. The language of the original act is still clear and has not been changed. The language is clear, and that's why the Park Service did say that this proposal for the lower Taunton is without precedent, that it is problematic, that it does have its problems, because the law and the words of the law need to have a meaning. The law gives us guidelines. It gives us parameters. It protects the minority at the same time it directs the majority. 
   It's just like if we ever come to a point of time where by a majority vote we can come in here and change the meaning of the law, we have moved to the time where we are back with Petrucchio and Bianca, where the sun is the moon and night is day and by a majority vote we can accomplish it, and that is why I am so opposed to this bill because it is exactly what the gentleman said and exactly what we are doing. 
   By a majority vote, we are going to change the definition of wild and scenic rivers. By a majority vote. So I really don't care if you want to do this, if it's nice, if it enhances the attitude of any kind of urban area, it is not explicit with the letter of the law and with the spirit of the law, with the understanding of the law, which is why you are supposed to take a quarter mile of an embankment on either side of the designation and keep it free from development, for preservation purposes, not economic discovery and not economic development. 
   I have great concerns, and I have expressed this many times, with the process that we have. At no time in the debate on this floor have we had more than perhaps a half dozen Members who have heard the debate and participated in it, perhaps a larger number are listening, but what will soon happen is we will call for the vote on this bill, and through those doors will come 300 Members who have not heard the debate and do not understand the issue of this bill. They will look up on the screen and say, it's an issue, it's a bill for Mr. Frank, and they will say, I like him. He may be of my party. I'll vote for him. He's an influential chairman. I'll support him. He is a very nice person. He is a very funny person. He is probably the best debater we have on the floor, and I'll vote for it. 
   But that is not the reason, and that is not a rationale for changing law by vote instead of changing the words. Words have meaning. 
   And if we ever deny that words have meaning, we no longer have the rule of law. All we have is what Aristotle warned and threatened and criticized that our attitude is going to be what drives us in the future, not what we should do, but what we want to do at the time. 
   So, yes, it is important what the 1968 bill says. Yes, it is important. Yes, the upper Taunton River has all the qualities for which the gentleman wants. And, yes, the lower Taunton River does not. I don't care whether you are talking about LNG ports or not, it doesn't meet the qualifications of a wild and scenic river. 
   Until we change the law, we should not, by a simple majority vote on this bill, try and change the definitions of those words. That is why I, from Utah, care about this river. 
   Because if we can change the meaning of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act by this vote, there is no river in America that is not in danger of being made wild and scenic if you have enough votes to do it. There is no law that can stand if you have enough votes to do it, which is why this is supposed to be a republic, why the words have meaning and the words of the law are significant and important. 
   That's why I beseech the handful of Members of this floor who actually are listening to this debate to please understand the rudiments of this debate and the significant issue that we are doing right here. That's why we are making this significant. That's why we are putting this. That's why I am opposed to this bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Once again, I appreciate the discussion we have had on this bill. I think that is perfunctory. We have to say that. But let's once again make common the facts of this particular bill. 
   The Department, the National Park Service, has not supported this bill. They have asked that we refrain from it until the study is final. They have also, though, in that study, given options, three different options of what to do with this river. This bill happens to take the worst of the options, an option that has no precedent, an option that is problematic. 
   My amendment makes this a legitimate bill. The area to which I object, the area that does not meet the standards of a wild and scenic river, those areas I am asking to be removed. The Upper Taunton River, that is the area this Congress, in the Year 2000, mandated the study and paid for a study, and that what the study should have done, has those wild and scenic qualifications that match the law. 
   That is my amendment, to remove the offending sections of this bill and limit just to those which meet the meaning of the words in the law. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate that. And to be honest, I anticipated going first in the closing of this, so the gentleman from Massachusetts could have had the last word. So I will try and be kind with that. 
   But to be very honest with you, Mr. Chairman, it doesn't matter how many property owners may or may not object to it. Under our constitutional system of laws, if there are three people with property rights, they must be respected. It doesn't matter how many dislike it. They must be respected. 
   The gentleman has very nice people in his district. I am positive. Look who they elected. But that is not the issue. The issue is the language of the law. The language in section 16 talks about free-flowing rivers, natural waterways, existing and flowing in a natural condition. There should not be low dams, diversion works or other minor structures at the time the river is proposed. 
   This ain't minor structures. This is a large urban development. It does not meet the definition of those terms. We say it over and over again. 
   It is not the House that is denying the constituents the right to have this designation. The State of Massachusetts could do the same thing if you just used local ordinances and State authority. It is not the House that will be denying them. It is the law that denies them. It is the law that does not allow this lower river to meet definition of wild and scenic rivers. Period. 
   Pass the amendment, and I can easily and happily support the bill because if you pass the amendment, the parts that do qualify as wild and scenic rivers will be included as wild and scenic rivers, and the parts that do not qualify will be exempt. 
   I yield back.

However, this amendment is a wonderful, positive, good amendment. It's been mine up until the last couple of bills.

To be honest, in our committee, on H.R. 1528, this same amendment, you voted against. I'm happy for your conversion.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Thank you, sir. If I had known we were having a vote on the last one, I might not have fished for the first one. 
   It's a wonderful opportunity for me to introduce this particular amendment from the gentleman of New Mexico who spends so much time in this area and understands it so well. We're facing, obviously, an energy crisis in the United States, and we do have a dearth of solutions that have been forthcoming in this particular body. And we have repeatedly passed legislation that actually has, over the last 30 years, restricted access, limited our resources. 
   This amendment is once again simple. It calls upon the Secretary of Interior to provide us the full accounting of the resources this bill may take away from the American people. Simply, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and private industry, if it remains, shall complete and submit a report accounting for the energy resources withdrawn from future development by designation of this land and waters included in the Taunton River bill. Specifically, the report shall identify, among other sources, the amount of geothermal, wind, solar, biomass energy and any impact on electrical transmission. 
   The amendment is simple. If Congress is acting to take energy resources away from the people, we should know if there is a true impact by these actions. 
   I would urge your support of Mr. Pearce's well-thought-out and significant amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I think the other side of the aisle will be happy to know that this amendment does nothing to prevent a proposed LNG port in the Taunton River. The legislation does, but the amendment does not. I'm not really sure exactly what the amendment does. About the most you can say is it doesn't appear to do anything negative, and for that purpose I will be happy to support this amendment, because at least it recognizes that energy is important, and that's an excellent first step. A curious one, I admit, but an excellent first step, especially if it's accepted by those who are supporting the underlying legislation without the first Bishop amendment to be added to it. 
   It is curious also to understand what domestically produced energy source will come in this particular area unless maybe you actually do have the Park Service use their eminent domain power and actually condemn all of the land a quarter mile from either side of the river in the way a real wild and scenic river should be done. But let's see what happens. 
   An LNG port, if it was actually produced there, would be able within 3 years, according to best estimates, to reduce the amount of energy needs for the people that live in this area by 10 percent or more, just from this one port. But the issue at hand is not domestically produced energy because an LNG port does not bring in domestically produced energy. It's all coming from abroad.     
   The countries that produce LNG are Australia, Trinidad, Malaysia, Algeria, Nigeria, Oman, Brunei, Qatar, with other developments in Norway, Venezuela, Egypt, Bolivia, Peru, Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Russia. 
   It is true that some is produced in Alaska, which I don't know if the gentlelady actually accepts that as part of the United States, but that doesn't go all the way around to the east coast. That stays up here in the West. 
   That's the issue. So I accept this amendment, but we're actually talking not about domestic production. The LNG port was about foreign production coming in to the country, but because it at least addresses the issue that energy is important, I'm happy to accept it. 
   I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (SANTA MARGARITA RIVER, CALIFORNIA, CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION -- (House of Representatives - February 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 29 was introduced by our colleague, Darrell Issa, and authorizes the construction of the groundwater recharge and pumping project in the lower Santa Margarita River basin in Southern California. 
   If constructed, the project would provide much-needed water to the local water utility district as well as to Camp Pendleton, the Marine Corps base, for its military training needs. This project would augment the local water district supply, would relieve future additional demands for constantly limited imported water supplies, and would set aside and preserve valuable environmental habitat. 
   This project is an excellent example of local and Federal agencies working together to secure safe, dependable water supplies for future generations. This bill is good for water consumers, and it is good for our soldiers. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, which has been considered by the House twice already. Perhaps the third time will be the charm. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman from Arizona has adequately explained H.R. 2251, and we're prepared to accept this legislation with a brief clarification from the chairman of the subcommittee on the intent of this bill. 
   The question we have is, is the proposed intermodal transportation center intended to limit the access to the park by automobile, or is this part of a larger plan to abolish the public's ability to travel through the park by private automobile? 
   Mr. Speaker, I would yield to the gentleman from Arizona if he is prepared to address that issue right now.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the comments that have been made so far. I'm reminded by President Reagan, who once said there you go again, and some of those statements can apply here. 
   But one statement was they aren't accurate, but what we are talking about here in this part of the discussion deals with how real people are impacted in their daily lives. 
   We no longer are talking about energy consumption as an ethereal process or whether it meets different needs, kind of a policy concept. We're talking about how people, real people, bake their food, heat their homes, and how they keep their jobs. 
   For every dollar that there is an increase in oil prices and gasoline prices, it simply means that jobs are lost, that revenue does not flow here. Social Security programs are diminished, and the overall quality of life is diminished. We're talking about real people and how real people are impacted. 
   For every dollar a poor person or a middle-income person has to spend on increased energy consumption, that's a dollar they cannot spend on luxuries like tuna casserole. This is what we're talking about. If you're extremely rich, you can try and buy your way out of it like an old medieval duke buying indulgences from the Catholic church. But for middle-income people and poor people, we are talking about how they live their lives, and we're talking about a country that has more energy potential locked up than other Nations have in their entire countries. 
   That's the concept that is here, and yet we always come back to picky little reasons why we can't develop the source, renew that source or build on that particular source as well. 
   We can't develop in ANWR because even though the Carter administration set this particular piece of property aside for energy development because it offends somebody. We can't have windmills off the coast of Massachusetts; it doesn't look right. We can't drill off the coast of Florida because it might offend the tourists someway. 
   We all have picky little reasons on why we can't do it, and the net product is we harm our own people because we don't have a policy that provides a positive reinforced policy, a strong program that will encourage conservation but also encourage production of every source of resources that we have at our disposal. 
   It has to happen and it has to happen now because we're dealing with real people. 
   We're also dealing with the security of this country. Early on this floor, they talked about an element of section 526 that was passed in the energy bill which simply had the proposal of cutting out the needs of our military in their advancement for alternative synthetic fuels. That's one of the things we're looking at. Five years ago, it cost us $2 billion a year for petroleum for our military. Today, we're talking about $12 billion a year. We cannot do that any longer. Those are the issues we have to have. 
   We have to realize that what we're talking about is real people.

   And the more we talk about the philosophy, what should or should not be done, and the later we decide to take as our policy statement that we will become energy secure and energy independent and we will develop all the resources we have at our disposal to become energy independent, that's when we actually decide to try and help people.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (21ST CENTURY GREEN HIGH-PERFORMING PUBLIC SCHOOL FACILITIES ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. When this bill was originally introduced by the gentleman from Kentucky, it would have required the Department of Energy to conduct a study of needs nationwide and then provided grants to meet those needs. 
   This doesn't quite do it. There have been no studies. NCE did one about 8 years ago which talked on a regional basis but not anything more specific. Another study was done about 3 years ago, and instead of trying to identify construction needs, this bill tracks money based on title I spending, which simply asks the question, is there a connection between construction needs and the distribution formula in this particular bill? If not, and this bill escapes, we will be coming back repeatedly with ideas that we need to tweak this or that in the effort to create some kind of fairness for the future. 
   At the committee I raised the question, because my State has an equalization formula, not just for maintenance and operation which is programmed, but also for capital outlay. And I asked how this bill would impact my State and I was told we would find that out; get back with you. That still has yet to happen. 
   So let me try and tell you what this particular bill would do in my State as it relates to how we fund construction needs within a State. The State of Utah has two different categories, historically. First of all, we have continuing school building aid which basically went for areas that were overcrowded, where there was a surge of students creating crowded school conditions. 
   We also had a category that we funded which was continuing. I'm sorry. Let me switch that around. Continuing was for overcrowded. Critical school building aid was for those districts that happened to have all their buildings coming of age at the same time and needed an infusion of cash. 
   We then equalized the formula so that districts in the State of Utah were given State money, in addition to what they could raise locally, to meet these particular needs. 
   So I simply went through the formula that this bill would equate, and what would it do in the State of Utah. This is the bottom line. The districts that have continuing school building needs, overcrowded, would not get money from this formula. The districts that have critical school building needs, which simply means the age of their buildings are all coming together at the same time, would not get money from this formula. 
   Indeed, the districts that get money from this formula are the ones in the State of Utah that do not have the construction needs. And that's a simple problem with this bill. 
   If we had gone along with what Congressman Chandler had originally established and tried to establish a criteria of where this money would go, there would be some logic to it. There is no logic. We are simply throwing money at a target that is constantly on the move. 
   Satchel Paige used to talk to young pitchers and say, ``Just throw strikes. Home plate don't move.'' 
   Well, in this particular bill, we can't throw strikes because not only is home plate moving, it doesn't even exist. And that is a key problem with what we are trying to accomplish in this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I have one other issue as well. We have talked, both in committee, the Rules Committee and I'm going to bring it up here on the floor, of the issue of charter schools. The committee has stated as their policy they wish to have charter schools treated fairly in this particular bill. 
   If a charter school is, of itself, a local education agency, the language in this bill covers charter schools and they will be treated fairly. Unfortunately, if a charter school is part of a different local education agency it does not guarantee in the language of the bill that that charter school will be treated fairly. 
   We have examples, anecdotal I admit, but anecdotal from coast to coast in this Nation, of charter schools who were not treated fairly by local education agencies. And unless specific language is placed in this bill, it does not guarantee that will happen. 
   I appreciate the chairman of the committee adding new language in a manager's amendment that will try and make a study of this to see if they can report back. But the bottom line is simply this. Despite our statement that we want charter schools to be treated fairly, the language of our bill is a gaping loophole that does not meet that if the charter school is not part of the LEA, and I would hope, I would certainly hope that the chairman or the sponsors would guarantee that they would continue to work on this issue to make sure that this is given out in a fair and equitable manner because we want fairness and logic. It doesn't exist in the distribution formula in this particular bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BISHOP of Utah. (PUBLIC LAND COMMUNITIES TRANSITION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This is, to be honest, a very sad day on this bill today on the floor. As an educator, I simply understand the need for secure rural schools funding. As a westerner and someone who served for a long time in the State legislature, I understand what payment in lieu of taxes, or PILT, means to western counties. 
   Unfortunately, though, this bill that is before us today did not get here through regular order. This is not the same bill we discussed in committee nor is it the same bill that I and some others cosponsored. It appears almost as if political games are now being played in an effort to pass this particular bill, which breaks new ground. The precedent has always been, in dealing with secure rural schools and PILT, that we have dealt in a bipartisan manner in an effort to find legal and politically feasible solutions to pay for secure rural schools and payment in lieu of taxes. We have always addressed these two issues in a bipartisan manner, always, until now. H.R. 3058, this version of it, has broken that covenant. 
   When a version of this numbered bill was passed in the Resources Committee, two promises were made to the Republicans who cosponsored it, Mr. Walden and me and others. The first promise was that PILT would not be decoupled from secure rural schools. I cannot stress enough the importance of PILT funding being coupled with secure rural schools, as was promised. Even the majority leader in the Senate has said this is the key to the success of this piece of legislation. And yet this promise was broken. 
   Second, the offset using the 1998/1999 lease moneys was supposed to be taken out by the time this came to the floor. This set of money, which has already been spent three times on three different bills, not the same pot of money, the exact same dollars which have been spent, is not going to be a solution to this. The gentleman from Oregon suggested last night that there might be constitutional concerns and we should not listen to those. I have some sympathy for that approach, but the fact of the matter is his speech last night was to the wrong audience. It should be to the lower courts, who have already ruled that this pot of money is not accessible to us. 
   In 2006 we passed the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act. Using these fees for that was justifiable. Using it in this bill is not justifiable. Those fees for the Deep Ocean Energy Resources Act was to fund programs and projects related to conservation of OCS-related resources. It was to increase America's energy supply and encourage domestic energy development on the Outer Continental Shelf. Because we are no longer using that and have now taken them to a different level, it will be a breach of the oil and gas leases and designed to punish energy companies and discourage much-needed domestic oil and gas production. This bill sends now a message to every energy company in America that Congress will not respect lease contracts and will result in less oil, less gas production, which I certainly hope is not the objective of the Democratic Party. 
   We need to have a different way of paying for this bill that does not include an energy price-increasing bankrupt offset. We need a genuine offset that will pay for both PILT and secure rural schools without making America's energy more expensive, less available. And to be honest, if the court upholds their ruling that they already had, if the other courts do, there won't be any money for secure rural schools in this project anyway. 
   Now, I know there will be people who will tell us this is merely a bogus placeholder. We don't really mean to use this money as the bill progresses through, which simply shows that perhaps PAYGO is nothing more than an accounting game or scam as we're looking at it, and that all we need to do is give a blank check over to the Senate, pass it along, and they will fill in some reasonable way of funding this particular bill. We will abdicate our responsibility of coming up with legal, legitimate, responsible legislation because somewhere down the line, someone else will do it. 
   If the Senate, indeed, has a secret magical formula for funding this bill, why wasn't it in the farm bill? Why wasn't it in the extension of the Rural Schools Act? Why did the Senate not put it in a bill and send it over here? Or why did the sponsor not negotiate with the Senate to insert it in this bill so we could discuss it in the House? 
   The promise was before this bill to the floor there would be a legitimate source for an offset. It is not there. Instead, we seem to be playing a game of political gotcha, which is so sad because there was a compromise that could have funded this bill and done it in a legally effective way. It was presented by the National Education Association on behalf of schools. It was supported by the consortium of counties. It was supported by energy producers that would have fully funded PILT, fully funded the secure rural schools, expanded energy options. It would have given States control over sand and gravel for beach replenishment, over the viewshed, States control over their offshore renewable energies, would have funded energy and minerals higher education program, and be done with real money, not the funny money in this particular bill. It is language that is similar to a bipartisan bill passed in the 109th Congress which was supported by Mr. DeFazio and 39 other Democrats in a bipartisan way. 
   The question that we have to ask ourselves today is why are we confronted on suspension with a bill that has a phony PAYGO offset, money that we know is not there? Why are we presented with a suspension bill that has already been rejected by the Senate, that has already been rejected by the administration? Why instead did we not agree to go with the compromise approach, which would have had real offsets and provided real solutions to fully fund our schools, to fully fund PILT, and not to have to take it out of the hide of anyone who stops at a gas pump this weekend? Now, that's what we should have done, and we didn't do it. And that's why this is a very, very sad day on a bill that was not discussed in committee. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I appreciate Chairman Rahall from the committee coming down here earlier to speak on the bill. When this bill was under his control, he treated us with kindness and consideration. 
   In the tornado of words that we have heard here today, there is one thought that still comes through: We need a permanent solution. This bill is half a bill without a permanent solution and without an offset that is legitimate. The counties, the education community, and the energy companies presented a real solution that would really pay, not a phony placeholder, but real money that would pay for full tilt, full secure rural schools, a real solution to real problems. This bill is the wrong bill, the wrong process, at the wrong time, and should be defeated.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 154, recognizing Stax Records for enriching the Nation's cultural life with its 50 years of soul. 
   Stax Records is a name which is synonymous with Southern soul music. The record label began as Satellite Records in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1959. Founded by Jim Stewart, a former country fiddler, and Estelle Axton, the company had its first top 10 hit in 1961 with ``Gee Whiz'' by Carla Thomas. During the next few years, Stax developed a branch of music which was to have worldwide repercussions. With its house rhythm section, better known as Booker T. and the MGs, its tight horn section, which later became the Memphis Horns, and its gospel-rooted recording artists such as Otis Redding and Sam and Dave, Stax virtually created contemporary soul music. 
   The death of Otis Redding in 1967 signaled the end of the first Stax era, but it was soon to be revitalized with a successful new breed of Stax artists, including Isaac Hayes. In his own way, Hayes developed a unique blend, part jazz, part soul, part easy listening. He talked on his records in a mellow, bantering manner, and he used an orchestra in many ways to provide instrumental cushioning. In many ways, Hayes was a founding father of the sweet soul of the 1970s. 
   Stax's roster ran the gamut of black popular music. Albert King displayed his great personality, playing his guitar with a bluesy sense of urgency. The Staple Singers were at their artistic peak when they recorded for Stax during the late 1960s and early 1970s, turning out records that blended a utopian social vision with rhythmic excitement. The music behind these singers was more varied than in early days, and some of it was recorded outside Memphis, but the spirit of Stax was burning as brightly as ever. 
   The thing that made Stax go was teamwork; and when artists visited the studio, they could feel it. The halls were always full of people who seemed to be working furiously, dropping in on friends in their offices, or heading down to Studio A to check on the progress of a mixing session. The cooperation between white and black musicians and producers was practically unprecedented. Indeed, it was one of the secrets of the company's across-the-board success. 
   On August 20, 1972, the Stax label reached a pinnacle of success by representing a major concert, Wattstax, featuring performances by Stax recording artists and the humor of a rising young comedian named Richard Pryor. Known as the ``Black Woodstock,'' Wattstax was hosted by Reverend Jesse Jackson and drew a crowd of over 10,000 attendees, most of them African American. Wattstax was filmed by motion picture director Mel Stuart, and a concert film of the event was released to theaters by Columbia Pictures in February 1973. 
   The influence of soul music permeates nearly all of today's modern music art forms and has deepened American music history and the Nation's cultural life. Today, we recognize the 50th anniversary of the founding of Stax Records and its role in launching the careers of many legendary soul music artists. 
   For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand to honor Lieutenant General Kevin J. Sullivan upon his promotion to Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff for Installations and Logistics. 
   Kevin Sullivan was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in an Air Force family. He married the former June Young, also from Connecticut. He is an alumnus of the University of Connecticut, and he and June are Husky fans through and through. 
   General Sullivan entered the Air Force and was commissioned through the Air Force ROTC program upon graduation. His first assignment took him in 1975 to England Air Force Base, Louisiana, as a weapons loading officer. He has since had assignments in the Philippines, North Dakota, Nebraska, here in Washington, Alabama, Germany, Utah, Ohio, Florida, and most recently a return engagement to Hill Air Force Base as Commander of the Ogden Air Logistics Center. 
   General Sullivan is the longest serving commander in the history of the Ogden ALC and he has led with superb application of financial, human and material resources during his tenure. 
   Despite living the itinerant life that is part and parcel of the Air Force, and despite his affection and affinity to his alma mater, we consider Kevin and June to be true Utahns, and we look forward to their future visits, official and not-so-official. 
   General Sullivan, please accept my heartfelt thanks for your outstanding leadership and stewardship at Hill Air Force Base during the past 4 years and my very best wishes upon your important new assignment. You exemplify the tradition of ``Integrity first, Service before self, and Excellence in all we do'' that is the hallmark of the United States Air Force.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 475, congratulating the University of Arizona Women's Softball Team for winning the 2007 NCAA Division Women's College World Series Championship. 
   On June 6 of this year, the University of Arizona Wildcats Women's Softball Team defeated a very strong and successful University of Tennessee Lady Volunteers Team by a score of 5-0 to win the three-game series 2-1 and capture the 2007 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women's Softball Championship. 
   This is Arizona's second consecutive title. Much of the team's success is due to its coach, Mike Candrea. Over the last 21 seasons, he has compiled a record of 1,131 victories, only 228 defeats and two ties; however, you have a tie in the softball game. He has won 18 Coach of the Year awards and is an inductee in the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall of Fame. 
   In his career as a Wildcat coach, he has taken the team to the College World Series 19 times and has won eight College World Series titles. During the 2007 season, the Wildcats compiled an impressive record of 50 wins, 14 losses and only 1 tie.     
   The junior, Taryne Mowatt, the 2007 World Series MVP, set a record for the most pitches thrown in the College World Series by throwing 1,000 pitches in a week, pitching every inning of the tournament for the Wildcats. This season she compiled a record of 42 wins and 12 losses. 
   The University of Arizona should be recognized as an outstanding academic institution as well. Now in its second century of service to the State, the University of Arizona has become one of the Nation's top 20 public research institutions. It is one of only 62 members in the Association of American Universities, a prestigious organization that recognizes universities with exceptionally strong research and academic programs. With a world-class faculty in fields as diverse as astronomy, plant science, biomedical science, business, law, music and dance, the University of Arizona offers a rewarding educational experience to all of its students. 
   I extend my congratulations to the University's president, Robert Shelton, the athletic director, Jim Livengood, head coach Mike Candrea and his staff, all of the hardworking players, the fans and to the University of Arizona. I am happy to join my friend and colleague, Representative Grijalva, in honoring this exceptional team and all of its accomplishments and wish all involved continued success. 
   I ask my colleagues to support this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 485, expressing appreciation for the profound public service and educational contributions of Donald Jeffry Herbert, fondly known to all of us of my generation as ``Mr. Wizard.'' 
   Donald Jeffry Herbert will be remembered as the host of two popular children's television shows about science. A general science and English major at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, he showed interest in drama until his career as an actor was interrupted by World War II when he enlisted in the United States Army as a private. 
   He later joined the United States Air Corps, took pilot training and became a B-24 bomber pilot who flew combat missions with the 15th Air Force, flying out of a base in Italy. As the gentleman from Arizona said, he distinguished himself in combat, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with the three oak leaf clusters. 
   After the war, Herbert worked at a radio station in Chicago where he acted in children's programs such as the documentary health series ``It's Your Life.'' It was during that time that Herbert formulated the idea of Mr. Wizard and a general science experiments show that utilized the new medium of television. Herbert's idea was accepted by a Chicago NBC station, and the series ``Watch Mr. Wizard'' premiered on March 3, 1951. That was even before I was born. 
   The weekly 30-minute show featured Herbert as Mr. Wizard, with a young assistant who watched while Herbert performed interesting science experiments. The experiments, many of which seemed impossible at first glance, were usually simple enough to be recreated by viewers. The show was very successful, and 547 live episodes were created before it was cancelled in 1965. It was briefly revived by NBC during the 1971-1972 season. In 1953 Herbert won a Peabody Award for his work on this program. 
   In 1983, Herbert developed ``Mr. Wizard's World,'' a faster-paced version of the show that was shown three times a week on the cable channel Nickelodeon. This show ran until 1990, and reruns were shown until 2000, making it the longest-running show on Nickelodeon. 
   In 1994, Herbert developed another series of 15-minute spots for Nickelodeon called ``Teacher to Teacher with Mr. Wizard.'' The new show highlighted individual elementary school teachers and their projects and was sponsored by the Daschle Science Foundation. 
   Mr. Wizard inspired legions of children across the Nation. Kids in every town joined thousands of Mr. Wizard clubs and did some of the same experiments that were seen on television, sometimes even without burning up the house. Many of these young viewers went on to careers in science and all were at least taught the practicalities of science in our daily lives. 
   On June 12, 2007, Donald Herbert lost his battle with cancer, slightly more than a month shy of his 90th birthday at his home in Bell Canyon, California. For the immeasurable contributions he made in children's lives and to the field of science, I would ask my colleagues to support this resolution recognizing his life and work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I'd ask the gentleman from Arizona if he has other speakers on this particular topic. I do have one other I'd like to yield time to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, Resolution 406 is a resolution honoring the 35th anniversary of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. I would like to recognize my colleague Ms. Hirono for introducing this resolution. The Education and Labor Committee will continue to celebrate the 35th anniversary of this law with a hearing tomorrow on this subject before the Subcommittee on Higher Education, Lifelong Learning and Competitiveness. 
   President Nixon signed title IX into law on June 23, 1972. The purpose of title IX was to eliminate discrimination based on gender in the education arena. While title IX applies to all areas of education, it is possibly best known for its role in sports. Thanks to this law, and perhaps more significantly from the growing interest in sports in this country, we have seen a dramatic increase in female athletes. 
   This law is far from perfect. Institutions continue to struggle with how to comply with title IX, trying to balance the participation rates of men with those of women. We do not want institutions to build up female participation at the expense of men's teams at the schools. 
   As I stated earlier, title IX is best known for its effect on sports. However, title IX does apply to all areas of education. In a time when we are continually talking about the need to educate America's students in the area of math and science, it is important that we also recognize the increasing numbers of female students pursuing careers in math and science. In 2004 the General Accounting Office issued a report on the participation of women in science. The report found that women's participation in the sciences increased substantially over the past 30 years. However, there is always more that can be done. As Congress looks to reform current programs, we should ensure that the programs being reformed are to encourage all students to enter into the sciences, math, and especially history. 
   The committee has no stated opposition to this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. I appreciate the gentleman from Washington yielding me the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, if you remember back in the 1960s when Volkswagens were very popular and they had this wonderful self-deprecating campaign going on for their advertising. For instance, putting a Volkswagen in a carport and the caption would read, ``It makes your house look bigger.'' My favorite one was taking a Volkswagen, ripping off the fenders, putting big tires on it, putting even a spoiler in the back, a painted stripe, jacking it up on the back, and the caption read ``Is nothing sacred?'' Sometimes while I've been here in Congress, I have often wondered if nothing is actually sacred. 
   Education, even higher education, is still the purview of States. The 10th amendment gives them that parameter. And yet it is possible that we often ignore that. It is possible to soup up a Volkswagen, but we never should. It is also possible for us to tell States how to run their policy on education and how to appropriate their money to education, but it never should happen. 
   The provision to which I object is called ``maintenance of effort.'' This is a provision that was added to the Budget Reconciliation Act, or was attempted to, and was removed. And most of the people in local government are surprised to see this effort coming back here in this particular bill. This was also not discussed in our committee to any detail. 
   It is one of those things that the Rules Committee will always talk about how these things should be discussed in committee. But when we, in committee after committee, have major pieces of legislation held close to the vest and only brought forward only hours or days before the actual markup in a committee, oftentimes we find things within those bills that are surprising. This provision was found in this bill, and it was not one of those pleasant surprises. 
   The maintenance of effort amendment that was put into this bill requires the States to maintain a 5-year rolling average of their funding for higher education, and if they ever go under that 5-year average of education, their LEAP funds, which are now renamed in this particular bill, will be yanked from those States, unless they go to the Department of Education and grovel before the Secretary of Education to try to get some kind of penitence so they can get those moneys back. 
   This proposal is counterproductive. We all know that States have cyclical budget years like we do. In 2002, the average State increase in higher education was 1.8 percent. In 2006, it was up 9.3 percent. If I was a State legislator again responsible for those budgets, realizing this proposal was in here, when we had a chance to add more money for higher education, knowing we would now be judged on a 5-year rolling average, there is no way I would ever put that kind of increase in there. This is going to be counterproductive to actually States funding their higher education system. 
   But even if this policy worked, we should not do it. H.L. Mencken once said, ``There is always an easy solution to every human problem. It's neat, it's plausible, and it's wrong.'' Even if this Federal stick to States was effective, it is wrong. It is wrong to tell States how they will appropriate their money. It is wrong to give them more Federal mandates. 
   Now, the chairman of the committee, Mr. Miller, will soften this proposal in the manager's amendment. That is good but doesn't nearly go far enough. Mr. Hoekstra had a perfect compromise amendment that was refused to be considered by the Rules Committee on a technicality. It is wrong. It should have been considered. And I had an amendment to remove this, to put it back to the status quo so we could have a chance in the committee to discuss this issue, and it was not allowed to be made in order. That is wrong. The proposal is wrong. The discussion process is wrong. If we're not going to discuss these issues in the committee, it should be the purview of allowing people to come here on the floor and discuss these issues, which are not just  technical in nature but philosophical in nature, of what the Federal Government ought to do and what it ought not to do. This particular provision in here should be discussed. 
   We should know full well what we are doing to States if we move forward in that area. And for the Rules Committee not to make that in order, I think, is wrong.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 903. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 903 would require the Forest Service to review non-Federal lands in or adjacent to the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest and recommend strategies to maintain open space. Republicans do not object to this legislation, but considering the current budget constraints on the Forest Service, we believe funds would be better used to tackle the enormous risk of catastrophic wildfire in Colorado. Currently, 42 percent of Colorado's forests are suffering from bark beetle infestation, which continues to spread and will likely kill thousands of acres of trees. These dead and dying trees pose extremely high wildfire risks to Colorado's forests. Surely funds would be better spent on removing dead and dying trees that pose a tremendous threat to homes and communities, watersheds and wildlife habitat. 
   Moreover, we believe that local and State governments should address open space and smart growth options rather than Federal Government agencies based here in Washington, D.C. While we commend Mr. Udall's good intentions, we believe recommendations and solutions to these problems should come from the counties and the States, not from the Federal Government.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 122, as amended, and yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 122, sponsored by our colleague, David Dreier, authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to participate in two water recycling projects in Southern California that will allow the water districts there to be less reliant on imported water. 
   As the water demand grows and supplies become more scarce in Southern California, this bill would help to drought-proof this arid area. These projects would add over 75,000 acre-feet of water annually to one of the last recycled water distribution systems in the Santa Ana River Watershed. This legislation passed the House during the past two Congresses, and I urge my colleagues to support this noncontroversial bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield as much time as he may consume to the sponsor of this piece of legislation, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).

   As I walked past the Supreme Court this evening, remnants of the two groups were protesting this very issue, one dealing with a press conference, the other marching in chants in a way that was really more appropriate to a high school pep rally than to this particular issue. 
   And I was saddened because this is one of those issues that should never be  simplified into simply chants or slogans or sound bites because this issue is one that deals with the soul of this particular country. For when we have a cavalier attitude about life at the beginning of the cycle, we tend to develop a cavalier attitude about life at the end of the cycle. And then for those areas in between, we tend to look at life not in terms of its sanctity but in its quality of life. 
   I firmly believe that man is both perfectable and savable. But we are perfectable and savable not in the ease in which we make our lives or the material possessions which we can accumulate, but in our relationships with others and our development of our families. 
   I appreciate being able to add my voice to this particular discussion, and I appreciate the representative from Arizona, as well as the gentlewoman from Minnesota, for leading these two hours because this discussion is truly about the very heart of this country and where we go.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding. 
   Bill Veeck was an old baseball owner and entrepreneur who used to say, ``I don't ever break the rules, I just test their elasticity.'' Apparently the Democrats on the Rules Committee are doing that same standard of testing the elasticity. When the time for amendments to the Rules Committee was closed, I did have one that was filed that dealt with second amendment issues, the only one that dealt with second amendment issues. After the filing was closed, apparently Democrat staff then took that amendment, without public hearing, without any Member input, they amended that to leave the most important part of second amendment protection on the floor, and then introduced it as a self-executing rule. 
   Self-executing rules were originally intended for technical amendments only to help the process along, but more and more we see the Democrat Rules Committee using substantive amendments now under self-executing processes. 
   Now, in the good old days, I tried to get Chairman Dreier to do that for me, but he always said I had to give him my first born son, and it still had to be technical. I am willing to give the gentleman from California my first born son--actually, he's out of college now, it won't help me at all, but I'm still willing to do it if that's what it takes now to meet the process. But I realize, you're not breaking the rules, you're just testing the elasticity.     
   There are groups out there that rank Congressmen. There's even a fantasy congressional league that's out there. They give us all points for how many bills we introduce, committee assignments, amendments that are passed. I've known the pain of having a fantasy baseball team where half of the members were on the DL. 
   So I'm asking the gentleman from California if he would have the courtesy of calling these groups and letting them know that this self-executing rule that is now part of the bill was actually mine so I could get those points. Not because of me, mind you. I'm just worried about my friends who have me as part of their fantasy congressional team because I know you're just testing the elasticity of it. In fact, it was suggested that sometime in the future we should start copyrighting our amendments before we actually give them to the Rules Committee staff. 
   This is not necessarily the first time this has ever happened, as the gentleman from California mentioned. There was another lands bill where I introduced an amendment with the same topic that once again was redrafted, this time refiled with a Democrat as the sponsor of it and it did pass this House and I was happy to vote for that because it was a good idea. It was my idea, but it was still a good idea. But I realize you're just testing the elasticity of it. 
   I'm not saying you're stealing, mind you. I am not saying anyone is stealing. But John Stockton has called and wondered if his NBA steal record still exists. The Patriot coaches are wondering why they're in trouble. The 1919 Black Sox want their title back. And Henderson has actually discussed it because he could have beat Ty Cobb's record years earlier had he had these same techniques in line. In fact, to be honest with you, I had a softball game last night that we won and we are now 9-1. And I'm wondering if the gentleman would actually do another self-executing rule to make us 10-0. That would actually do something for me. And since we're pulling stuff out of thin air without committee assignments, without floor discussion, I think it would fit within the concept. 
   Now don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that we're doing all the work and someone else is taking the credit. Because we're used to that. We work with the Senate all the time. We understand how that works. But if indeed we are becoming the Puff Daddy of legislative efforts in here, I would suggest that if the Rules Committee really wants to do something to further discussion and actually do something positive to make it worth the 4-hour flight we had to come back here for this particular bill, why don't you take my Americans for American Energy Act and do a self-executing rule to put that in. At least that would be a meaningful discussion that we would have on the floor of a meaningful bill and would make it worthwhile for us to come back here and finally start talking about something that is meaningful and useful for the American people.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Over the July 4th holiday, my wife and I rented the movie 1776. It's one of my favorite ones. It has some historical accuracy, a lot of historical inaccuracies, but it's a fun movie. 
   In the exposition of that, to show John Adams's frustration at Congress at that time, he was called down to vote on a motion by Josiah Bartlett of New Hampshire, which is an effort that says that during the hostilities in which they are in, they shall dissuade any kind of dissipation, any extravagances, any gambling, or any horse racing. That is when John Adams explodes and goes out on the street, with the classic lines in his opening song, which says about Congress in 1776: We piddle, twiddle, and resolve not one--I can't use a swear word here, but it's in there--not one thing do we solve. 
   Now, the issue at hand in 1776 in Philadelphia was independence. They had already been fighting for a year. They had raised an army and appointed George Washington to do battle. Yet, they still refused to talk about the key sole issue of the day, which was independence. Instead, they talked about everything else, every small, piddly idea they could come up with, rather than coming to the core. And that was John Adams's frustration with that. 
   As I was watching that movie, I thought, Gee, that is exactly like Congress today. We are doing the same thing. 
   I have to admit that I have a sense of frustration with congressional leadership. It's a 4-hour flight for me to come back here. Yet, every week I have been coming back on that 4-hour flight to deal with non-issues. We haven't dealt with homeland security, we haven't dealt with the appropriations, we haven't dealt with energy issues. 
   Instead, the key issue of this week is to federalize a trail that already exists, that is controlled by local governments, and there is absolutely nothing, nothing the Federal Government can do on this trail that couldn't be accomplished by States and local governments through a well-written interlocal cooperation agreement. 
   The sponsor does not live in the area of this trail. It encompasses nine States. Not all of the Members of Congress who are impacted either in the trail area or abutting the trail area are cosponsors. 
   The other side cannot even refute how many people understand or know that this trail is going to be impacting their lives. The estimates we have are less than 10 percent are understanding about this. 
   Yet, the key issue is not necessarily the trail, because it's already there. The key issue is who will be making decisions in the future about this trail. If it were possible that everyone involved in this particular trail was happy about it, they liked the idea, they wanted it, but at some future date would like to make a decision about that trail, by passing this bill, all of a sudden we change the process and the place of that decision from localities back here to Washington. 
   It's about power, it's about where do you actually make decisions in America. It's about empowerment of individuals. This bill simply takes the decision-making process away from localities and puts it back here in Washington, where we have too many decision-making powers that we are already avoiding as is. 
   They did take one amendment of mine and they eviscerated it, an amendment that dealt with second amendment rights, an amendment that dealt with all second amendment rights. Yet, the issue at hand that is now part of the underlying bill through a self-executing rule only deals with hunting, not all second amendment rights, which was the goal and the idea and what should have been in place, which simply means that if I'm hunting, I'm okay on this trail. If I'm trying to protect myself, I'm not. If a mugger tries to attack me, I cannot protect myself unless first I'm trying to hunt the mugger. Or if a moose is shot by me, I better shoot it in the posterior because if a moose is charging me, no longer is that hunting, that is now self-defense, and that is not allowed with the amendment that came in here. 
   It is simply an absurdity of situations, and it's not an unrealistic absurdity. Even the Washington Post did a recent article about serial killers along the Appalachian Trail. It is not a false fear in there, it's a realistic fear. It's a realistic fear that will be noted that when the Democrats made this self-executing rule, they did not defend all of the second amendment, only the so-called hunting rights, which is not, not the purpose of the second amendment. 
   But this is now simply the only bill that we will have of significance today.  It's basically the crux of this entire week, which simply means Democratic leaders don't want to address other issues. Specifically, energy issues. There is no issue of comprehensive policy of what we will be doing to address the energy crisis the Americans are facing. The appropriations process has simply shut down over the potential of doing that. 
   So I fly back for 4 hours to come back here last week to talk about banning pet monkeys from crossing State lines. The week before, about the Chesapeake Bay. This week, I came back here so we could talk about a trail. 
   Mr. Chairman, in all due sincerity, this is nothing but legislative filler. We are not dealing with the real issues that affect people or should be affecting this Congress, we are dealing with the small stuff, the triviality, the legislative minutia. This is like junk food, like cotton candy. It's there. It's fluffy, it's airy. But it is not filling and has no fiber. It gives the illusion of activity, but in essence we are dealing with a cotton candy agenda. 
   We have in essence a Democratic de facto filibuster against energy, against ever talking about it in any way, shape, or form. Instead, we have a trail. A trail that already exists, a trail that would be federalized, a trail that encompasses more power back here in Washington, instead of allowing people to help make decisions for themselves. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I will reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I apologize for starting out here with my old profession as a teacher coming out. But the gentleman from Connecticut and a couple of others on this floor have said some things that I think bear discussion simply as a review on the fundamentals of how legislative government works around here. 
   Outside in the hallway we have the distinguished Speakers. Most of them are the most recent ones, but there are the four that I always consider to be the four great speakers of this House, one of whom was Thomas Bracken Reed, who is the one that transformed this House from a minority body into a majority body. He is the one who determined, in fact he said: If the tyranny of the majority is harsh, the tyranny of the minority is unendurable. And he was the one who prohibited the practice of calling a roll call and then not allowing people to say ``here''; therefore, not having a quorum to conduct business. He forced the counting of a roll call, which made this from that time on a majoritarian body. 
   The problem we have over in the Senate is that has never been a majoritarian body; it will always be a minority body. It takes 60 votes to cut off the debate and move onward.     
   So even though today the Democrats have the leadership positions in both the House and the Senate, I would never jump to the conclusion or the inaccuracy of saying that the Democrats control Congress because the Democrats will not control the Senate until they have at least 60 votes there. It is a minority body. 
   In like manner, the conversation that Republicans controlled Congress for 12 years and didn't do anything has the same problem because in none of those 12 years did Republicans have 60 votes in the Senate. And, therefore, a minority body was actually in control. 
   We have had split government. We will probably always have some form of split government in that respect. But to assume that because there was leadership of both parties is not to assume the same basic core that goes along with that factor. And, indeed, over the last 5 to 10 to 12 years, there has been a great deal of energy discussion from this body, and when Republicans were in control of this body, there was a great deal of legislation dealing with energy that was passed in this body only to be prohibited from going through the entire process because this majoritarian body could pass something that the minority-controlled body on the other side could not do. 
   I appreciate the distinguished chairman from West Virginia of our committee speaking so passionately, especially about coal. I share that passion. We have a great deal of coal in my State. The only difference between the two is, unfortunately, the coal in the State of West Virginia is on private property. 
   I was so impressed when the chairman had a bill that dealt with wilderness and the coal companies were there to advocate for wilderness because it did not impact them. They were on private property. 
   In the State of Utah and much of the West, we have the exact opposite problem; the coal is found on public lands. And so I appreciate his commitment to the concept of coal, and even though it may indeed be a form of competition at some time in the future, I take his words as a commitment to try to work forward to try and free up the coal in the West that is on public lands so it can all be part of the energy solution that we are looking for in this Nation. 
   You know, we are talking about a bill that dealt with Washington. Washington led the troops in an era where he simply was out of ammunition. He had the opportunity of failing, but he did not allow it to be so because the American spirit worked out the details and then worked out the process so he overcame those competitions, those difficulties. The United States today is in the same situation. We are out of energy ammunition, and it is a significant problem for those who are on fixed incomes, the poor and the middle class. If you are rich, this energy problem which we face is merely an annoyance. If you are on a fixed income or a limited income, or if you are poor or middle class, then it becomes a significant life situation so that every dollar that they no longer can spend, that they now have to spend to energy on consumption, is a dollar that they can't spent on such luxuries as Hamburger Helper. 
   In this particular bill the Democrats accepted an amendment from one of the great young Republican freshmen from Virginia, Mr. Wittman. It is an amendment that is still part of this bill that aims to protect energy production and transmission in this particular trail system. It is a microcosm. It is  the appropriate thing to do. The real question then is why not? Why not do this same thing not just in this trail bill, but throughout this entire country so we can honor and protect to do that. 
   Mr. Chairman, what we are dealing with now is simply the concept of the future of where we are going. We can either find scapegoats or we can find solutions. I think it is time that both sides of the aisle look very carefully at trying to find solutions. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, while this legislation prohibits the use of eminent domain by the Federal Government, it does not prohibit State or local governments from doing the same thing, in essence doing the same dirty work. So my amendment is very simple and clear. It prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from accepting lands from State and local governments that were acquired through eminent domain to expand this particular trail. 
   We are talking about George Washington and the Revolution. I think it is fitting to remember how strongly George Washington felt about ensuring private property and that his soldiers respected the property of civilians, even if they were a Tory sympathizer. He gave orders that forbid looting even though plunder was the norm of the time. And even though his men were hungry and dressed in rags, it is remarkable that in so desperate a situation with such a noble cause for which he was fighting, he imposed on his side such a high standard of conduct and a high respect of individual priority property rights. 
   In our world, the post-Kelo decision world, we cannot allow our constituents to fall victim to any abuse of power from any level of government that disproportionately attacks them, sometimes even disproportionately attacks those on the lowest level of our economic scales. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask for a favorable vote to an amendment that simply says that the Federal Government will not accept land that is taken by eminent domain. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.
