<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENTS TO H.R. 6, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Just yesterday, OPEC told the world that $90 oil is okay and they won't be increasing production. They want $100 oil. They want more.  
   Now, on the surface, Americans will say, Thank God. We have a Democrat energy bill coming to help us as energy prices continue to skyrocket as we move into the cold winter months. However, what hope does H.R. 6 actually give to young families with high home heating costs? Unquestionably, nothing. 
   What hope does H.R. 6 bring to poor folks living in rural and urban America that struggle to afford fuel to travel to work, to drive their kids to school and do Christmas shopping? Absolutely nothing. 
   What relief does H.R. 6 bring to seniors living on fixed incomes who struggle to make mortgage payments and stay warm? Absolutely nothing. 
   What does H.R. 6 do for rural and urban seniors who kept their thermostats at 58 degrees last winter with temperatures below zero because that is all they could afford? Nothing. 
   What does H.R. 6 do to prevent the tragedy that happened in my district last year when an elderly gentleman living alone tried to keep warm on a subzero night by putting coal in his wood-burning stove and perished when his modest home burned? It does nothing to prevent that. 
   What does H.R. 6 do for small business owners and manufacturers who happen to be high energy consumers to remain competitive and be able to keep America's best jobs here? It does nothing. 
   What does H.R. 6 do to the large manufacturers who have to compete in the global marketplace and provide jobs for middle-class America and compete against countries with cheap labor and cheap energy? It does nothing. In fact, it will continue to push more jobs offshore to countries like India and China where energy is cheaper and more accessible. 
   The working men and women of America who struggle to heat their homes and travel to and from work deserve action from this Congress. We need to provide them with available and affordable energy not 4 years from now but today. 
   Yes, Congress is the reason we have the highest world energy prices because we have continually locked up our abundant supplies of gas and oil and coal, increasing our dependence on unaffordable, high-priced oil and gas from foreign countries. 
   H.R. 6 is not an energy bill. Efficiency standards, conservation and renewables are vital to our future, but they are 4 and 5 years down the road before they provide energy. Americans need energy now, not tomorrow. We have the highest prices in the history of this country; and folks, I am going to tell you, they are going higher. The height has not been reached. We are going to have more than $100 oil because OPEC is in control because we have decided that we are not going to produce energy for America; we are going to buy it from those who are holding us hostage. This bill has some good futuristic parts, but nothing in the next 5 years to heat and cool this country and allow Americans to drive to work affordably. We need an energy bill. 
   I challenge the bill Democrats, let's do a bipartisan bill and let's argue the points. Let's bring affordable energy to America.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I think this is one of the more important amendments we're going to deal with today. 
   America needs available power, and especially electric power. We have a system that has not worked. The legislation doesn't give the Federal Government the right to usurp States rights. It only gets involved when multiple States can't get their job done. I was in State government for 19 years, and I wouldn't bet the farm on four PUCs adequately performing on a time basis so we could connect our grid. 
   Here's what Bill Richardson said in 2001. ``The United States has a first-rate economy. We're the Superpower of the world, the best military, a booming technological economy, but we've got a grid that is antiquated, that is Third World, that needs beefing up. We've got very weak power transmission lines to connect our generation capacity.'' 
   And here's what Sam Bodman said in 2006, a year ago. ``The Nation is currently facing serious near problems in adequately delivering electricity to its customers.'' 
   It means we have to fix the grid. And we've been unable to get States to work together collectively. This is a process that only kicks in when the States can't get their job done. 
   Connecting this country is a national issue. I don't want my State in charge of the national grid. I had a Governor's person come into my office protesting a power line that was proposed. It had been off of the table by the PGM for a year and a half and they didn't even know it. It wasn't even up for consideration. And the three States that were involved in the little piece that was left was not that State. 
   Folks, there's a lot of disinformation out here. The connectivity of our electric system is vital to our economic future and we need a process. This was put in the energy bill because it wasn't working, because we couldn't upgrade our grid. 
   And two Secretaries of Energy and leaders across this country, the Edison Institute, all say, don't pass this amendment.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, today, June 11 of the year 2008, we had an interesting happening in the Capitol. We have had $4 gasoline for some time now, we have had $5 diesel, record high natural gas prices approaching $13 per thousand, the most expensive energy America has ever known. 
   We had a chance today in committee the deal with this issue. I was stunned. I have been working on this issue for many, many years. We passed a major bill in 2006 with good bipartisan support, a lot of Republicans, but we had probably 40-some Democrats. A lot of people in this Congress realize that we must produce more energy in America if we are going to deal with the prices in America. 
   Today the Interior subcommittee met. I offered an amendment to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. As you look at the chart to my left, that's the east coast and the west coast and down  here in the gulf on both sides of Florida. The red or pinkish areas are locked up. There's 86 billion barrels in those areas, by old standards, by old seismographic tests which was 30-some years ago. Most people feel there is many times that. There is 400 trillion cubic feet of natural gas there. 
   My amendment today would have removed the moratorium. For 27 years Congress has had legislative language that says we cannot produce here. It's locked up. This Outer Continental Shelf is from 3 miles offshore. The first three miles is controlled by the States. Next 197 miles is owned by us, the taxpayers, citizens of America. Not by any company, not by the President, not by Congress, but owned by the citizens, not by any State. It's our resources. 
   The interesting and troubling fact is my amendment would have opened it up from 50 miles to 200. 
   Every country in the world that has energy offshore produces it. It's the most environmentally sensitive place to produce energy. 
   In most places the fisheries are better, they like the platforms, they like the places to hide. The fishermen love them being there because it's where the best fishing is. 
   Down here in this little blue area, 40 percent of our energy comes from there that we produce in this country, that little bit of the gulf. 
   Now there they produce right up to the shoreline. We were given a 50-mile buffer. There has not been an oil spill on a beach from a well except for the one in Santa Barbara in 1969, pretty good record, in my view. There has never been a natural gas well that's ever caused an environmental problem that I know of. 
   But today we had a vote of nine ``noes'' for the Democrats and six ``yeses'' for the Republicans. I don't like to be partisan. I like to have bipartisan support, and I worked very hard on this amendment. I thought I had strong support from both parties, and I was stunned today. 
   I guess it's another example of Speaker power. 
   I have been in the legislative business for 31 years, 19 years at the State and 12 years here. I have seen legislative bodies that were good process bodies where you debate the issues from the subcommittee to the full committee to the floor. Then when the House and Senate meet in a conference committee, that really gives you seven shots at a bill. That's not happening here. 
   This is the most top-down legislative body I have ever been a part of. Today showed that. I would bet the farm there are members on this subcommittee that wanted to vote for this, but for some reason chose not to. I am not going to name them, I am not going to second-guess them, but I was stunned. 
   I think America would be stunned. I believe this Congress is way behind the folks, approaching 60 percent of Americans at a recent poll, who want us to produce offshore, on shore, wherever we have energy. I find, in talking to town meetings and large groups, when you discuss the issue and explain the facts and explain the alternatives, almost all Americans want energy produced so it's affordable. 
   Our economy was built on affordable energy. The problem we have, the arguments today were that there are 68 million acres already leased, and that's enough. This is the percentage, and, actually, it's less than 3 percent, of the Outer Continental Shelf where there is a lease that has been offered. So there is a very small part of the continental shelf that actually has a lease on it. 
   They said, well, there are 68 million acres, we need lease no more. Well, if you have leased property--yes, there are leases, there are leases that are not active--but if you have leased property and spent millions and millions of dollars and you get dry holes, you don't drill anymore. You find out there is not oil in there. 
   As we look on here a little bit, this is interesting, this is a map. It's not as good as color as I had hoped to see. This is Cuba, this is Key West, this is Florida. These are the leases that have been granted by Cuba, China, Canada and Spain. I am not sure here, but these are the ones that are being negotiated now. Canada is going to be producing energy off our shores, and we absolutely disallow it. 
   Does that make any sense? No. Our biggest competitor, China, will be possibly producing our oil and our gas, using it to compete against us. 
   Natural gas is the one that's really in trouble in America. We know the oil prices today closed at $137, natural gas at $12.75. Natural gas is the one that we don't talk enough about. Oil is painful, but every country that competes with us pays that price. America may be the only country paying--now, this is not the price people pay. This is what the price today coming out of the ground is. 
   Now, what's sneaking up on Americans this year, they already know it costs a lot to travel. Those who are on propane and fuel oil last year know it was pretty expensive to heat their homes. 
   Natural gas did not rise a lot last year. But here is what happened to natural gas this year. This is the chart of natural gas for this year. This is what's happened this spring. 
   Never before have I ever seen natural gas prices--this is the time of year when we are not heating and cooling much, it's call the shoulder season for use, and this is when we usually put it in the ground for next winter's storage to heat our homes. We are putting gas in the ground at a price more than we paid for it last year. Now you have to add storage costs, transmission costs and processing costs. 
   Americans will be getting somewhere between a 60 to 100 percent increase of natural gas prices this winter. So those who are struggling to pay $4 to drive their cars are now going to struggle to heat their homes. The sad story is, with natural gas, our big employers like Dow Chemical in 2002 paid $8 billion for natural gas for a year's use. This year they are paying $8 billion every quarter, that's $32 billion. 
   Folks, here is what has happened to the jobs and what will continue to happen if we don't deal with energy 
   prices because the rest of the world is. Natural gas will push petrochemicals, polymers, plastic and many other steel and aluminum jobs--I predict, glass will be made offshore, bricks will be made offshore. Bulk commodities will not be made in this country because of natural gas prices, because you use so much. 
   Here's what the arguments were. This is what people want to use. This is oil. From the middle over is history, this is what the Energy Department predicts for the future. 
   I don't quite agree with this chart, because we are turning down coal plants all over the country. The natural gas will be much wider, coal will be much shallower. I don't see the growth in coal. We also all had high hopes for coal-to-liquid. That's sort of on hold in this country. Why, I don't know, because of carbon, I guess. The concern of carbon has become a greater concern. 
   Nuclear, to stay here, we have to have 35 to 40 nuclear plants built in addition to what we have to keep nuclear where it's at as 20 percent of the grid. 
   Nonhydro, the amount, everybody wants--hydro is not growing because we are not doing dams. Nonrenewables are mostly woody biomass and hydro. That's what most of this is. 
   If we double wind and solar, and we hope we can, we are less than 1 percent of our energy needs in 5 years or 10 years whenever we do that. That's the scary part. 
   Now here's the dependence part. When I came to Congress, we were in the 40s. We are now 66.3 percent dependent on imports, and here is where we get it. Canada is our best friend to the north, Mexico is our next best friend, nonOPEC and Ecuador, and then we go down here. 
   These are the countries that are going to own us. These are the countries where our wealth is going. In fact, I think I heard a speaker a few moments ago on floor talk about the purchase of the Chrysler Building by one of the Mid East countries. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, if America does not deal with energy, we will not compete in the global economy of the world. We cannot have the highest energy prices known anywhere and compete. We will not have middle-class jobs. The middle class in America will disappear. That's not the America I want. 
   Now, how we get past this partisanship, how we get past that we can take the minuteness of wind and solar and replace fossil fuels, I wish I knew. I am  for hydrogen. I belonged to the hydrogen caucus for years, but it has not grown. Wind and solar has grown a very small amount. 
   Until we can store electricity, we are going to depend on fossil fuels to make it. If we continue with the chart I just looked at to not produce coal plants, that's going to come on natural gas. If we don't open up the Outer Continental Shelf and much of the Midwest, we are not going to have the natural gas--and natural gas, let's come back to the natural gas chart. 
   Natural gas, in my view, is the clean, green fuel. We would have been far wiser, in my view, to have used compressed natural gas in automobiles than ethanol. Automobiles, with a couple of thousand dollars addition can burn natural gas. That's a clean fuel. 
   If we open up the Outer Continental Shelf, if we opened up the Roan Plateau in the west and some of the new areas that we know are potentials in this country--but we have to drill a hole in the ground, and why aren't we doing that? Well, here are the people that I think have been successful. 
   I was having a debate late week with the Sierra Club on NPR radio in California. When the debate was over she assured the audience that she would be beating me back next week when I offered my amendment. They won today. 
   The Sierra Club, they are against shale oil development. They are against coal gasification, and they are against offshore energy. Then we have Greenpeace, and they want to phase out all fossil fuels. They want to eliminate all of these and replace them with these. 
   Now, I wish we could do that. They are opposed. Environmental Defense Fund, no power plants, no smokestacks, League of Conservation Voters, no coal-to-liquid, wrong way to go; Defenders of Wildlife, no offshore, no coastal production; Natural Resource Defense Council, no coal, coal is evil; Center for Biological Diversity, no oil and gas drilling. That's devastating on public lands.     
   Friends of the Earth, no liquid coal, that is dirty. 
   Folks, we have technology in this country today. We can produce energy cleanly. We can burn it cleanly. We have clean coal technology we are refusing to build to replace the old plants. 
   If we continue, we are the only country I know of in the world that is on a madness mission, I call it, that we are not going to use fossil fuels. Now I want to grow all of these. I would be building hydrodams. The only one that has grown on this chart, and I have another chart that shows it better, woody biomass has doubled in the last decade. That is wood pellet stoves. Almost a million Americans use them now. That is using wood for generators, small plants for electricity using wood waste, and heating small factories. I am from a wood area, the greatest hardwood forests in America are in northern Pennsylvania, and we dry kiln our wood. We used to use propane and natural gas, now we use wood waste. Wood waste has found a marketplace, and it is continuing. But that's the only one that has had measurable growth that you can put on a chart. I don't have that chart here. 
   But folks, we need to have a comprehensive policy. But until we have the renewables available to use, we have to use clean fossil fuels in the very best manner we can. But if this Congress says no in full committee a week from now, we will be doing our bill in full committee, if they say no again, partisanly, and if they say no on this floor when we do the Interior bill, America will miss its only chance. 
   My bill, the Outer Continental Shelf bill, has 170-some cosponsors, and can't get a hearing or a discussion. We are not going to talk about fuels in this Congress. 
   Now we passed a great bill a couple of weeks ago where the Democrats proposed to enable us to sue OPEC. We are going to sue a group of countries, I had the chart here a minute ago, that we don't think have produced enough energy, when we refuse to produce it at all. Now what is the logic of that? What court is going to listen to that, and how do you even have a serious face. Back home, people laughed about that. They thought it was stupid. 
   We also have proposals to tax oil companies. Who pays the taxes, the energy users. I know there is hatred for the energy companies. They are really a small part of the mix. The vast majority of energy in this country is not produced by Big Oil. It is produced by small producers in my district in Pennsylvania and all down through the south. It is mostly independents. They are the brand names. They own some of the refineries. They own a lot of product lines in their names, but they are a small part of the production of energy. Yet we want to punish energy production. 
   We passed a bill here once, fortunately the Senate didn't, that was going to tax all energy companies. And I have two refineries in my district, one who was struggling, American Refiners and United Refinery, and we were going to make them pay higher taxes than the businesses right down the road. Did that make any sense? No. That is taxing American energy; not taxing imports but American energy. 
   I believe this Congress is way behind the American public. When I go back to my office many times after giving one of these speeches, I have phone calls for hours, I have phone calls for days saying I believe in what you said; I believe America should be producing energy; thank you for speaking out. 
   I believe the American public in the next election, I believe energy availability and affordability will be one of the major issues that they will be looking at because I don't think we are done. I don't think $4.05 gasoline is the end. 
   We have these high prices today that have scared the American public. I have people in my district who don't know how they are going to get through the winter and how they are going to heat their house. They don't know how they are going to make it. We have these high prices today. We have not had a storm in the gulf, which interrupts a lot of production when it happens, for 2 1/2 years. Everyone is predicting we are going to have major storms in the gulf, hurricanes, and that will eliminate a lot of energy production and prices will skyrocket. 
   We have not had a successful terrorist attack on our energy supply system. That could happen tomorrow. We have not had a major foreign country, and I had that chart of countries we get our oil from, most of those are dictatorships that could tip over. When there is a little trouble in Nigeria, energy prices skyrocket. When there were problems in Venezuela, prices skyrocketed. When Chavez was arguing with Exxon, oil went up $20 just because they were arguing. 
   The reason is there is no surplus in the system. Historically we had eight million barrels of oil that another country could produce if some country couldn't produce. Today we are down to where this is about a million barrels of oil. It is 86 million barrels a day countries use. We use 21, and so there is only a one million barrel surplus. So if a country has problems and produces three million less, there is not enough oil. 
   Now the reason these gas prices that I showed you earlier are going up, we are using more gas than we are producing. One of the big storage companies told me a month ago, they are not sure they can get their storage full this winter and they have always had it full by winter because we cannot produce enough gas, we have to put it in underground caverns and store it for winter. 
   I believe this Congress is at the root of the high prices of energy, and three Presidents, too, I am not going to hold them countless, because we have not had an adequate, thoughtful energy policy for America. While the rest of the world is building an energy supply for themselves, we are twiddling our thumbs and we are refusing to produce fossil fuels. 
   I think if this Congress before we recess in July does not deal effectively with energy and open up supply, you are going to see the beginning of the decline of the America we know. It is a national security issue. It is an economic issue. American companies cannot compete, and when they can't compete here, they will diminish their operations here and they will expand them over there. They have had other reasons to do that, but the biggest one has been energy. So I beg my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's get by this partisan bickering and let's support an energy policy for America.  
   The gentleman from Ohio has come to join us, and I yield to Mr. Latta.

   The president of DOW Chemical said in a letter I received, he said, We have a debate going on in this country and one side wants production, the other side wants conservation and renewables. He said you're going to need them all. You'll need them both. There's no room for choice.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for their bonding of bipartisanship. We could use a lot more of that around here. I think it has been great. 
   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my amendment in full committee that was a GAO study on the implications of changing our fuel source from coal to natural gas. That's a symbol for America to listen to our carbon imprint, so we will go to the clean, green fuel, natural gas. 
   I see universities doing it. I see State governments doing it already. As our symbol, if that happens in all agencies, State, local, education, we will have a huge impact on the need of affordable, clean natural gas in this country. 
   My concern is we have a body here who is very much opposed to the production of clean, green natural gas. 
   One point, on Green the Capitol, I have not been able to find a window that was Energy Star. I have not been able to find a window that was not a single-pane glass that is a great transfer of heat out and cold in. It seems like we ought to be using fuel-efficient first. Maybe that's our next objective. 
   We're going to be accepting an amendment in a few minutes, and I am not going to protest it, I will not debate it, on light bulbs. It's going to mandate energy-efficient Star-rated light bulbs. 
   I have them in my home. I have a large home. We have a lot of lights going, and I try to put them where I burn them all the time. But they are not very bright. They are not good for reading. My wife has replaced the one in her reading chair. They buzz sometimes, they just buzz like a transformer, so they are not exactly what we are used to. 
   Oh, by the way, next year at this time, every light bulb in the Capitol will be made in Communist China, will have mercury in it, and the incandescent light bulb industry that's left in this industry, and I have two plants, those good union jobs will be leaving quicker, not later. 
   I am not saying Americans shouldn't switch, but we need to know what we're doing.     
   I believe we need to have a much more thoughtful approach and look at where the jobs are in America in that we are transferring jobs to China. We're putting mercury into the workplace, and we're eliminating some of the best jobs that we have back in our districts. We need to think about that.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. This amendment, I believe, is one of the most important issues that we will deal with in this Congress. It's about having affordable, available, clean, green natural gas, the fuel that we take for granted. It's the fuel that heats about 60 percent of our homes, 70 percent of our businesses, and is the major building block to all the industries that are left in this country. 
   The petrochemical industry, 55 percent of their operating cost is natural gas. The polymers and plastic industry, 45 percent of their operational cost is natural gas. And fertilizer can be as high as 70 percent of their cost is natural gas because they use it as a fuel and they use it as an ingredient to make their product. It's an ingredient in all those products. 
   Clean, green natural gas now generates about 20 percent of our electricity. That didn't used to be. Biodiesel consumes huge amounts of natural gas in the production cost. Ethanol, 96 percent of the plants that make ethanol use huge amounts of natural gas. We are consuming more natural gas in this country than we're able to produce. 
   The chart on the left with the red, that's the gap that's growing, because we as a country, 26 years ago, Congress decided that we shouldn't produce energy offshore. Every country in the world produces both oil and gas offshore. Now, they have setbacks. But they all use offshore production because it's the cleanest, best, safest way to produce energy, and there's huge amounts out there. 
   Now, for this country to have the highest natural gas prices in the world almost is insanity, because we have lots of it, but we have chosen to lock it up and not produce it. This is the clean, green fuel. It's greener than biofuels. It's what we use to generate electricity when the wind doesn't blow. It's what we use to generate electricity when the sun doesn't shine for solar. It's what we use to make hydrogen for the hydrogen vehicles that are oncoming. It's the bridge to our future because it's clean, it's green. No NO  
   X, SO 
   X and a third of the CO 
   2 that all other energies project. For this country not to open up its Outer Continental Shelf to natural gas, my amendment opens it up from 25 miles on out.  That doesn't mean it's going to be drilled. It would still have to be in the 5-year plan, but it would open it up. 
   Let me tell you, folks, we're going to do this sometime. It depends on whether we do it in time to save the millions of jobs that are leaving. Dow Chemical's energy bill went from $8 billion in '02, natural gas bill, to $22 billion in '06. They came to our committee the last 2 years and begged for release. Produce natural gas. We didn't. They just invested $30 billion that they wanted to invest in America for working men in America and working women in America to have a good job. They're putting it in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Libya, because natural gas is a fraction there of what it is here. It is absolute insanity for America to starve itself of the clean, green fuel that has never foiled a beach. 
   California, New Jersey and Florida will protest the most. It will never foil a beach. A gas well has never foiled a beach. It has never washed up on a shore. It's a gas. And they are the three States that are the largest consumers and who have switched their electric generation to gas and helped cause the problem that have protested the production of clean, green natural gas. 
   My amendment is the amendment that can keep America competitive. It can keep us strong as a nation. It can keep American working people working in their jobs, in their factories. But if we don't pass my amendment, we will lose millions of jobs in this country; in fact, all of the manufacturing jobs. I lost a plant this year that made clay tile. Natural gas prices. I got a letter the other day from a guy who re-formed steel, and he said if it continues to go up, it has went up three times in the last 2 years, 300 percent.     
   He said, if it goes up any further, I am out of business. I can't make sign posts. I can't make bed rail anymore out of recycled steel rail. 
   Folks, clean, green natural gas is more America's fuel that can keep this country strong and growing and environmentally green.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. 
   Several things have been said that I think must be responded to. Oil and gas spills. Could someone here show me a gas spill? A natural gas spill? There is no recorded history of one. Natural gas comes out of the ocean floor and bubbles into the air all over the ocean all the time. But there is no spill. 
   The fact is you can't drill for gas without oil. I grew up around it. I have never made money in the oil business. I have never invested a dime in it. But I grew up around it. You drill a hole in the ground. You put a steel casing in the ground. You register every place you go through, coal, gas, oil, rocks. It is actually rocks that have oil and gas in them. Then you notch the pipe where you want to produce. 
   In Pennsylvania, there were three or four oil sands, and the gas is way below the oil in most places. There was a little bit of gas in the oil, but not a lot. You notch the pipe where you want to produce it. So if you want to produce gas, you notch the pipe and you produce the gas, and that is sand. 
   Natural gas is the future of America until we can grow our renewables. I am for wind. I am for solar. I am for biofuels. I am for hydrogen cars. But let me show you how small that is; 86 percent of our energy is fossil fuel; 40 oil, 23 gas, 23 coal. That is 86. Eight percent is nuclear. We are now at 94. Six is percent renewables. Listen closely, 6 percent renewables. Five percent is biomass and hydro. Wind, solar, hydrogen, and geothermal, our future, is 1 percent. If we can double it every 5 years, it will cost a lot, but I am for it. But we are still then at 2 percent. 
   How do we fuel this economy that is growing a need for energy by 2 percent, and we have countries like China and India that are growing at 15 to 20 percent, and their energy consumption is sucking up the world's supply? When the moratorium was put on, we had $2 gas and $10 oil. We were awash in it. It didn't matter. 
   Oil and gas is scarce today. There is a world shortage. Right now, they are predicting $79 oil this summer, which will be $3.50 gas without a storm in the Gulf, without a country being upset. The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that if we have a storm in the Gulf and we have a country that gets upset that produces a lot of oil, we could have $85 to $89 oil. Do you know what that will do to home heating this winter? Do you know what that will do to travel costs? Folks, it is crisis time. Clean, green natural gas is the best alternative for a healthy America.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with 100 miles offshore. When we had the debate last year, I wanted to clarify something. Everybody kept talking about a compromise. We passed a major bill in the House that opened up the OCS for both gas and oil. The Senate passed what I call a little small bill in little pieces of the Gulf that President Clinton actually had in the 5-year plan, but never leased it. 
   In my discussions with the other body, we were always hoping to have a compromise, but we never had one. We never had a conference committee. We reluctantly agreed to take the Senate bill because it was something, and America needs something, so we took this small piece in the Gulf because it is some additional energy for America. 
   We will soon be 64 percent dependent on foreign, unstable countries. I hear on both sides of the aisle here that people are distressed about that. These are not our friends. These are countries that are not democracies. They are not real stable. We often lose energy when they just have their government topple or be out of favor for a while. 
   We are dependent on undependable countries of the world who are not our friends. They now set the price. OPEC is back in charge. OPEC turns the spigot and lets big oil make a lot of money. I said to somebody one day, big oil's best friends are Congress and OPEC.     
   Collectively, we have slowed up the ability to produce oil and gas. And when we slow up the ability to produce oil and gas, the price rises. And if you owned it when it was worth $30 a barrel and were able to produce it and make money, and government restriction of supply and OPEC's restriction of supply raises the price to $70, are you going to make money? You betcha. 
   If you want to drop prices down, open up supply. Wall Street traders run the price up. They set the price of gasoline, fuel oil, natural gas, oil. Wall Street. Why? Strategizing on it if they can buy it and sell it and make money today or tomorrow. We often pay 15 or 20 percent of our energy prices to Wall Street as they play with it because there are shortages. When it is plentiful, they don't monkey with it. 
   Folks, we need a plentiful supply of gas and oil for this country. Cuba is going to be producing with China and other countries 35 to 40 miles from the Keys, our most precious Florida parks. And we are going to stay completely 200 miles offshore. 
   Folks, this is insanity for this country to not utilize its resources, to be dependent on undependable countries who control our destiny. And as we grow the renewables, as we get more wind and more solar and more geothermal, it is going to be years, if not decades, before we have in sufficient quantity, and in the meantime we are going to need fossil fuels, and we need to produce them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, as we talk about the production of energy and as we talk about oil being so devastating and gas being so devastating, Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Great Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are all known for being environmentally sensitive countries. They all produce offshore. All of them. We are the only nation in the world that has chosen to close up our energy supply. We are dependent on unstable, unfriendly countries who control our prices and control the future of our economy. 
   The working people of America are counting on us to give them affordable energy that they can heat their homes with and drive their cars and have a decent competitive job. That is what this is about. And I wish we could do it with wind. I wish we could do it with solar. I wish all of those things were bigger and could grow faster. 
   Folks, we need to produce energy if we want to compete in the new global economy.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Do you realize how long it has been since we have actually done a modern seismographic on the OCS? It has not been done in 40 years. We didn't have good seismographics then. We don't really know, but we know there is a lot out there. If we had modern seismographics, it is usually three to four times what we thought.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. To those that propose this bill, I want to tell you I support a large fund for renewables. I am for all renewables. But why did you choose to tax American-produced oil and gas and not tax foreign oil and gas? When you tax our production, you will have less of it, when you tax their production, you would have less foreign. You have stacked the deck. It is already cheaper to produce foreign energy than it is American energy. We have locked up so many of our fields, and where in old tired fields the cost of producing has increased, the incentive to go in deep water because it cost so much companies wouldn't go there, and we couldn't even get there. 
   In 10 years since I have been here, we have increased foreign oil from 46 percent to 66 percent. Why is foreign energy taking over? Ninety percent of the land in this country available for oil production is government land, and this Congress has been locking so much of it up. 
   I totally agree with a large renewable energy fund, but instead of increasing the cost of producing energy in America, open up new fields. The Outer Continental Shelf is our greatest untouched area. We are the only civilized country in the world that doesn't produce there. Everybody produces there. It makes no sense for us not to be there. We haven't even allowed seismic testing to find out what is there because we might produce it. 
   Locking up supply by this Congress in the past, by Congress and by those proposing this bill, is why four of the oil companies are making huge profits. When energy usage is increasing more than renewables can increase, you need more oil and gas. And when you need more oil and gas and you lock it up, you give those who have purchased the rights to it all over the world, their $30 oil becomes $60 oil becomes $70 oil, that is where their huge profits are. It is the Congress of the United States that has rewarded Big Oil with increased profits.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am going to ask again: Why did we start the new energy independence with taxing domestic production but not taxing foreign oil? We are going to lead us in the wrong direction. 
   In your anger against Big Oil, I understand that, but you are penalizing everybody. Eighty-two percent of natural gas is produced by independents; 68 percent of oil is produced by independents; 50 percent of refined products is from independents. My little refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, will get taxed harder because of your new bill. And I have watched them struggle to fund clean diesel; I watched them struggle to fund clean gasoline units, very expensive. 
   The use of foreign oil under your bill will continue at the same rate of increase, and I predict in 5 years will be 76 percent dependent. I am for all your renewables, I want to fund them all. But if we produce the energy, took the royalties from the new energy that keeps us alive in this country, we could fund them adequately. If we don't open new fields, we will not have a fertilizer industry, a petrochemical industry, a polymers and plastics industry, and we will make bricks and glass in South America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to, I hope, bring some balance to this debate. I was stunned in my office listening to the opening comments that it is going to be a new era in America on energy prices. 
   Americans are struggling to heat their homes. Americans are struggling to have fuel to drive their cars affordably. Companies all across this country are struggling to make a profit because of energy prices. And the bill before us will not change that in the next 3 to 5 years. 
   I don't oppose better CAFE standards. It takes 2 or 3 years to design new cars, other years to build them. You are 4 to 5 years away from people. And the poorest among us seldom ever own a new car with high efficiency standards, the poorest among us. 
   Folks, America needs more affordable energy. We have the highest energy prices in the world because of this Congress, because we have locked up natural gas reserves, we have locked up oil reserves. We have not allowed the movement that should be in coal-to-liquids and coal-to-gas, and there has been resistance to expanding nuclear which provides the vast majority of America's energy. I hope renewables become a major force, but it will be years if not decades. 
   Today, Americans need affordable gasoline. They need affordable diesel fuel to fuel our trucks. They need affordable home heating fuel to heat their homes. They need affordable natural gas. And this bill does nothing for any of those. 
   The ethanol, biofuels, the second part of this bill, it is futuristic. We now have 7 billion gallons; that mandates 36 billion. It limits 15 to corn. And we know that corn was $1.80 when it started; it is $4.37 today, and rising. It is going to raise food prices. God forbid we get dependent on corn and we have a bad crop year. We will have high-cost food and unaffordable energy. 
   Now, I am not saying we shouldn't do that, but we should do it carefully. But we can't build America's energy future on CAFE standards. I am all for the fuel efficiency appliances. It takes years for that to happen. Americans today expect more from this Congress. High oil prices on the backs of Congress because we locked it up. Clean green natural gas, the affordable fuels that Americans should be using in greater quantities if it were affordable. $11.37, it spiked a couple bucks in the last couple days because it is cold and we are starting to use a lot of gas. Natural gas is used in heavy amounts to make ethanol, almost an even swap. Natural gas is what will be the hydrogen car if we get there. 
   Folks, we need affordable energy that runs 90-some percent of this country's energy needs, and we are ignoring it. This bill does nothing. The big bill that we voted on last week did nothing. Natural gas supplies need to be increased; oil supplies need to be increased in this country so we are not buying it from foreign countries. Coal-to-liquid, coal-to-gas needs to be advanced like we are force-feeding cellulosic ethanol. I am not against cellulosic ethanol. It is being sold to do most of the 36 billion gallons, and it is still in the laboratory, folks. I hope it comes out. I hope we build a successful plant. But it won't be this year; it won't be next year. It will be down the road. 
   People are struggling here in 2007, and 2008 coming, to heat their homes; and they are going to struggle in rural America to drive their car a long distance because they have to drive everywhere, they don't have mass transit. They need money to run their families, and energy costs are robbing them of their ability. Fifty-eight degrees was common for seniors in my district. That is because they couldn't afford more energy.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I'm not opposed to CAFE. I'm not opposed to fuel efficiency. I'm not opposed to biofuels. But, folks, you are overselling them. We have an energy crisis today, not 5 years from now. OPEC told us last week no more oil, get used to $90 to $100 oil. Today it is $92. Today we have the highest home heating costs ever, the highest diesel costs ever, the highest gasoline costs ever. The poor and middle class of this country are struggling to heat their homes and afford to drive. 
   Under this bill, foreign dependence will not decrease. It is currently at 66 percent, and for the last 10 years, for the last 10 years, 2 percent a year, dependence, 2 percent a year, folks, it is going to continue for the next 5 because this doesn't produce energy for 5. If this continues, 76 percent of our energy will be foreign dependent. 
   The gentlemen from Massachusetts and California stated we will save 4 million barrels a day with CAFE and biofuels today combined. Not now. Not in 5 years, but by 2030. That is 23 years. Our increase in energy need from population growth alone will be greater than that. We grew 5 billion barrel a day in the last 25 years in need for oil. This will have no impact for 5 years. Can Americans afford no relief for 5 years? $90 to $100 oil can sink the economy of this country. Every recession has been energy related. This country is on the verge of going into a recession because of energy prices. As we conserve and become more efficient, we must have more energy also, produce the Outer Continental Shelf, Alaska, and the Midwest and lessen our foreign dependence, increase nuclear production of electricity, implement clean coal technology, stimulate the production of fuel and gas from coal. 
   Our growing need for affordable energy is growing faster than the savings in this bill. America expects more of us. They don't want to wait 5 years: high home heating costs, high driving costs, the chance of their job going abroad. We are going to lose a million or two jobs in this country because we have the highest energy prices in the world. Our natural gas prices are higher than everybody, and clean, green natural gas, which you oppose producing, is the best fuel for America's future to get us by this difficult stage we are in. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we need policy that will bring energy to Americans so they can afford to live their lives, so they can maintain the manufacturing and processing jobs, so we can afford to move our goods across this country. 
   We are in an energy crisis, folks. This bill does not resolve a crisis. It has futuristic things in it. But we are not going to resolve the energy crisis in America. People in America expect more of us, and we should be delivering more.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I've been listening to the discussion and the debate here. Having served in local government and State government and here in Washington, I find it unbelievable that we're talking about an issue that came from an energy discussion of the beginning of the Bush administration's e-mail records. 
   Back home people are struggling--and I live in a big rural area--to drive their cars. They're soon going to find out that natural gas prices are probably going to double by fall and the costs to heat their homes are going to double. My schools are going to pay twice as much to transport their children. They're going to pay twice as much to heat those schools. My hospitals are going to pay twice as much to heat those facilities and to transport patients. I'm losing the air service at my rural airports because you can't fly small planes with these fuel prices. 
   This country's economic base is crumbling as we talk here today because of exploding energy costs. We are not going to live in the country we were born in. Opportunity is not going to abound. Americans are frightened and concerned, and we're worried about e-mail records of a meeting 8 years ago. 
   I think our priorities are backwards. We passed an energy bill in `05 that was timid. I think this administration has been timid. We've had three administrations in a row that locked up our Outer Continental Shelf, the only modern country in the world to do that. We've had 14 Congresses in a row that have locked up the Outer Continental Shelf where there's huge resources. 
   I'm for all the wind we can produce. I'm for all the solar we can absorb. But if we double them both in the next 5 years, we're less than 1 percent of our energy need, and our energy need is growing more than 1 percent a year, so it can't even fill that gap. 
   Whether we like it or not, we need fossil fuels. We need coal, we need oil, we need gas--clean, green natural gas. I can't believe that people are afraid of drilling a gas well. 
   Natural gas is driving the blue collar jobs out of this country as we speak. Dow Chemical used to do 64 percent of its business in this country in 2000; they're now at 34 percent of their business in this country. They paid $8 billion for gas in `02; they now pay $8 billion in natural gas quarterly. They can't afford to be here, folks. 
   Americans can't afford to heat their older homes. They can't afford to drive their older cars. One hundred small trucking companies are going out of business every week because they can't afford fuel oil prices. 
   The working poor of this country are being destroyed economically. The middle class are going to become poor. Most people in this Congress won't feel much pain. They can afford to pay these prices. But I want to tell you, my neighbors can't. A young lady that lives besides me drives 36 miles to work. She makes $11 an hour.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Iowa and for the opportunity to share time with him. 
   I don't know about you, Mr. Speaker. After the 4th of July recess where we had $4 gasoline, $5 diesel, almost $4 heating oil, and Americans are shuddering because what they don't know, and they will be even more concerned, is that in a few months, they will be getting 50- to 60-percent increases in home heating costs with natural gas. Those passed-through costs will be approved by our State PUCs. My home company in western Pennsylvania raised the rates at 6 percent in May and are going to be raising it 50 percent August 1, and they have another opportunity to raise it again in November. And they're just passing through the costs of gas. 
   Just like New England just had a 42 percent increase in electric costs because of the percentage of their electricity that is now made with natural gas. So as natural gas prices escalate, theirs escalate. 
   When we have these prices, I have neighbors who don't know how they're going to heat their home this year. I have churches in my district who probably won't use their sanctuaries, seniors who are living on limited budgets. I know a gentleman, a neighbor, this week--he's 75 years old. Four years ago, he sold his pellet stove because he was 71 and decided he was getting too old to carry 40-pound pellet bags into the basement. He had it in his basement and ran heat up through his registers. And he took it out. And with the current energy prices, he bought another pellet stove. He has to cut another hole through the cement wall that he had cemented and put another pellet stove in because he can't afford fuel. 
   I have neighbors and friends who kept their house at 55 last year. And this year energy prices are double if they're heating with home heating oil. They're about 75 percent higher with propane, and they're going to be somewhere between 50 and 75 to 100 percent higher in natural gas when those prices hit the market. 
   I know Americans who are driving 30 and 40 and 50 miles to work. I have a neighbor lady who makes $11 an hour. She has two children. She travels 36 miles to work. Her balanced billing bill is $175 a month, and she has no money in her budget for a 60 percent increase in natural gas prices that are going to hit her for this winter. 
   People all over America are scared. Should we open the reserve? Well, I guess if we do, we sort of say we didn't need a reserve because the reserve is only several months' supply in case there's a tragedy in the world market, there is a major problem in one of the big sending countries. Let's just say, God forbid, that terrorists would blow up the sending platforms where we load our tankers in Saudi Arabia, we would have $250 oil quickly. 
   The petroleum reserve is in case of war, is in case of tragedy somewhere in the country, some tragic incident that cuts off our supply. Because today, we get one-third of our oil from home, we buy one-third of it from our friends like Canada and Mexico and other friendly countries, and we buy one-third of it from the Middle East. The one-third in the Middle East, as we've heard earlier, is fragile. We don't know that will always be available. Should we use the reserve? I don't personally think we should. I think we should have kept filling it because 70,000 barrels a day is a drop in a bucket. It did nothing for prices, will do nothing for prices. 
   So use the reserve and say July, August, and September it will be all gone. And what do we do in October, November, December if we have tragedy or what are we going to do then? That's not a solution. 
   It amazes me, because I'm not giving high grades on energy to many people around here. It's my view that 3 Presidents and 14 Congresses in succession have not gotten good marks on energy, have not had a bona fide energy plan. And you say, Why is it? Well, it's kind of understandable. Up until 7 or 8 years ago, except for a spike in the 1970s and 1980s and 1990s for a year or two at a time, we had $2 gas and $10 oil. And the argument was--and I remember debating it at the State--should we use theirs or should we use ours. I always thought we should produce ours. It creates jobs here. It's part of our economy. There's no better jobs than oil-  patch jobs and all the related jobs, the refineries and the pipelines and all of that whole system. 
   You can go down in downtown Washington and buy gasoline made in Russia, and the only person making money off of it is the guy selling it. It was refined in Russia. We can buy that in Washington, D.C. They only chain the stations here in the east coast. 
   So I just find it, I guess, unconceivable that we don't--we can't figure this thing out that when we're one-third dependent--we're two-thirds dependent--but one-third dependent on enemies or people who aren't our friends, and people who--or they're not stable governments. And when they say not to drill here, every day we don't drill here we become more dependent. 
   Since I've been in Congress, we've averaged 2 percent a year. This year we will increase another 2 percent. We're at two-thirds now dependent on foreign countries. 
   And what happened was--I don't give the Bush administration high marks. In fact, looking at, you know, they actually get higher marks than many. They had the hydrogen car initiative 2 or 3 years ago. They pumped a lot of money into hydrogen cars. But do we have a hydrogen car? No. Do we hope to some day? Yes. But that's futuristic. That's a good thing. 
   Last year they had the mandate, they urged us to increase the mandate on biofuels to 36.5 billion by 2030, switching from corn after 15 billion gallons to cellulosic ethanol. Now, I get a little nervous when you mandate cellulosic ethanol when we still don't have the design of a plant to make it. Now, we're hoping and praying, and the thought is making it out of wood waste and making it out of garbage and out of sweet grasses like switchgrass. That looks hopeful as a better way to make ethanol. Because we do know that corn prices have edged up a little from $2 a bushel to I think it hit a high of $7.70 last week. It's down to maybe $7.40 this week. 
   But the first Bush administration locked up the Outer Continental Shelf. We're the only country in the world to do that. Canada drills right up here. And they drill right up here within sight of our coastline. Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, every country, all of South America, everybody produces offshore. In fact, Brazil, the country everybody gives high marks for, and they gave the credit for ethanol. Ethanol is 15 percent of it. But they went out and opened up their continental shelf and just recently in deep water found a huge reserve of oil, and now we're going to be an exporter of oil. 
   Now, what we don't know about America is when we did seismographic on our shores 30-some years ago, since then for the last 28 years law has prohibited us from even measuring out there to see what's out there. That's how stupid I say we are. We don't even want to go out and look. We could have somewhere out here, or somewhere out here, the largest oil and gas reserve because all over the world, offshore is tremendous energy production. 
   In fact, everybody tells me, everybody that knows the business and who have regulated the business, not necessarily producers, that it is the least environmental hazard. When you're out in the ocean and you drill a hole in the ground, I mean, one little storm stirs up more than a drilling bit going down into the ocean floor. And we've not had a major spill since Santa Barbara in 1969. We have the technology today. And the cost offshore is big. 
   But here offshore when we did the seismic measurements 30-some years ago. We only did it in water less than 4,000 feet. Now, today we can drill in 2-mile deep water so we've never even used--and the seismic of today would be like comparing an old seismic 30 years ago. It would be like a black and white TV to the current thin-screen TVs like we have today. That would be the difference. I mean, the new seismic tells you what's there. Tells you a lot. 
   But we're not there. We just drill in a small part of the gulf. That's the other thing. And it amazes me when we listen to these talks about we got 64 or 84 million acres. Until they drill that we're not going to let them. Well, you know, four out of five deep water wells are dry. It costs $900 million. I'm going to say that again: $900 million to build a deep water platform. It costs $1 million a day to operate it, and it's four out of five wells you will drill. 
   Now, I'm not able to personally assess. I'm meeting with some people tomorrow in two different groups to learn more about the potential of those 64 or 84--I keep hearing different figures--million acres that they're talking about. But I do know that these are great and the rest of the gulf here are great areas, and we are saying can't drill there. 
   Now, it seems to me drilling for oil's not a sure thing. Four out of five deep? No. You don't get anything. Three out of four shallow? No. You don't get anything. So you explore, and when you find three or four good wells, now you know you've hit a pool and you will go in and try to figure where it's at and maximize it. 
   We know in much of the gulf we've been drilling for so long that the gulf is actually depleting. Although we're drilling twice as many wells there as we used to, we're getting less energy because we're in old, tired fields. We're drilling between wells. We're drilling deeper where it's more costly, and it's still exploring, trying to find more gas and oil. 
   Now, I guess the part that really confounds me is the hope we have for renewables. And you know, I hope for the day in my lifetime that we can run our country on renewables. But here is the chart. From the middle of this chart towards me is history. This is the Energy Department's figures. From the middle of my chart to my left is their projection of the future. Of course, oil's the Big Kahuna. Natural gas and coal are the other big ones. 
   Now, they show coal increasing. I disagree with that because of the carbon issue and because 70 coal plants in the last 8 or 9 months have been turned down by State agencies, and they will all become gas plants. And the reason we have such high gas prices in our country today is that 12 years ago we took away the moratorium for using natural gas to make electricity. Historically, Mr. Speaker, we only made electricity out of natural gas in a peak power plant that ran in the morning and the evening when we consumed huge amounts of electricity when we're heating water at home and cooking and doing the washing and so forth in the morning and evening, and all of the plants that were running to. So that was a maximum load of electricity. 
   So 12 years ago we took that moratorium off, and now 24 percent of our electricity is made with natural gas. From 7. That's a huge increase, and we didn't open up supply. 
   Now, just several years ago natural gas was $2 a thousand. The last few months it's been running at $1,300 to $1,350 a thousand. Those are figures that will drive most industries left out of this country because natural gas is not a world price. It's a country-by-country price. When we pay $130, $140, or $150 for oil, it's very painful; but it's painful for our competitors. It's painful to our neighbors. 
   But on natural gas, we've been paying the highest prices in the world, and we have competing countries who are right in South America. Trinidad has $1.60 gas. Now, if you're going to make glass or you're going to make bricks, you're going to make petrochemicals, you're going to make fertilizers which consume enormous amounts of gas. 
   Just to show you. Dow Chemical in 2002 paid $8 billion a year for natural gas. Today, Dow Chemical pays $8 billion a quarter for natural gas. And to show you the migration of jobs out of this country, Dow Chemical in the year 2000 had 64 percent of their production on shore in America. Today they have 34 percent. Why? They can't afford to be here. Just like my neighbors can't afford to heat their homes and drive their cars in rural areas. Companies and small businesses who heat treat things who bend metal and twist metal and have to heat it with natural gas, they can't afford to function competitively in this country if they're competing with products made in another country that can buy gas for a fraction of the cost.     
   Now, let's look at where we're putting all our faith. I want wind and solar to be huge but it's not. 
   Nuclear, we did in the 2005 Act streamline the nuclear process. We have thirty-some permits applied for. I think we have 33 about ready to be  given. We need 35 to 40 new plants built for nuclear to keep nuclear at 20 percent of the grid, just maintain, 20 percent, not gain. 
   Hydro continues to lose ground--that's the brown line here--because we're not building dams. We aren't allowed to build dams. That's the cleanest energy we could have. 
   The top line is the renewables. Now, over on my left, I'm going to have a big chart tomorrow, but the red is biomass, woody biomass. Now, woody biomass has grown almost a percent in the last 4 years. That's pellet stoves. Over 1 million Americans this year will heat their home with a pellet stove. That's wood waste factories burning boilers with wood waste, heating their factories with wood waste. And it's power plants topping their coal loads with some wood waste to meet air standards there near the edge. So woody biomass, and I don't think there's been any initiatives, any tax credits. That's just happened. 
   Then we have hydro, and it's not gone. It's going to stay there. The yellow line is geothermal, and there's all kind of incentives. They get the tax credits, but as we grow our economy, it just remains a small portion. 
   Then we have the blue line, which is wind, which has bubbled somewhat. But if we double wind and solar in the next 5 years we will be less than 1 percent of our energy portfolio. Now, I hope we can, and I hope we can double it again the next 5 years, but we'd still be less than 2 percent of our energy portfolio, maybe even less than that because our energy needs will grow. 
   Now, the problem that's changed in the world, and a lot of people don't realize it, is the growth of use of energy in the world. It's not us. We're flat on energy use. In fact, we're decreasing because of price. 
   China is increasing 15 to 20 percent a year. India's increasing at a huge rate. You have South America developing. You have Malaysia developing. You have millions and millions of people in this world who are buying their first car and owning their first home, and when they buy their first car and own their first home, they're in the energy use business. 
   So, no matter what we do, we can't control prices by conserving. I'm for conservation. In fact, we need to figure out how to help Americans to use energy more wisely and let them write it off on their income taxes in a 3- or 4-year period. We need to do that, whether it's more efficient heating, whether it's better windows, better doors, whether it's more efficient appliances, yes, we need to help them out, because, really, I hate to say it, but the only thing Americans have today that they can do is use less energy. There is nothing now because we are not going to drill. We're not going to drill. 
   I have a bill to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. I had it poised. I offered it in the committee, in Interior, in the subcommittee, and it's the first time that it's been treated partisanly. We had six Republican votes were ``yes'' and nine Democrats votes ``no.'' Now, I'm not going to blame those Members. They had tremendous Speaker power applied to them. There were Members who voted against energy who have never voted against energy in this Congress in that sitting. 
   A week or two later, we were going to offer our amendment again in the full committee, where you have about 75 or 80 Members. And I think somebody in the Speaker's office took a count, and when they didn't have the votes to beat my amendment, we didn't do the Interior bill. And here we are today, weeks later, we are still not doing the Interior bill. Why? Because Congressman Peterson has an amendment that would open up the Outer Continental Shelf that would open up drilling 50 miles out, from 50 to 200. 
   Like I say, I don't pass out any gold awards around this place in the last three decades on energy leadership, and I mean that sincerely. We haven't had a President. President Clinton didn't lead on energy. He vetoed the ANWR bill. And I personally think President Bush tried hard to do ANWR. I voted for ANWR, but if he would have put the same effort on offshore, we would have probably accomplished it, but he didn't. In fact, he has never supported offshore until a news conference two weeks ago. But he also--and I'm going to say this critically--there's a Presidential moratoria and there's a legislative moratoria, and he said, if Congress will lift their moratorium, I will lift mine. 
   Mr. President, I was disappointed that you didn't lead. I was disappointed that you didn't lift your moratorium. Now, your father put it on. It was not supposed to be long-term. It was supposed to be 5 years until they could assess what parts of our coastline might need to be protected. President Clinton came in, had no energy initiative. He extended it to 2002, and then come Bush II, and because he had a brother in Florida and offshore drilling was an issue, he didn't touch it. 
   In fact, last year we passed a major bill here in the House to open up offshore. The Senate wouldn't deal with it. They passed a small bill down here in the gulf that was tracked 181 that had been on the 5-year plan in the Clinton administration that had not been leased, was taken out of the 5-year plan because of its proximity to Florida by the Bush administration, and was legislated back into the 5-year plan by the Senate, and I had to lead the fight here to get that accomplished in the House. They wouldn't conference with us on our bill so we could merge the two bills, but I led the fight here to make sure that we got that passed. That lease sold for I think $3.6 billion and is on its way, and it was done rather quickly. 
   Now, there are those who say we can't do anything in 10 to 20 years just don't know what they're talking about. If we work close to the areas in the gulf first--and we will--that have been leased, there's infrastructure. And if we would expedite the permit process legislatively like we did with track 21, and force the hand of the bureaucracy not to sit on this and to get it done, we could have oil and gas production in several years. 
   We still have 27 platforms active in the western coast that were exempted by the moratorium. They're still functioning. In fact, the governor of California uses some of them to drill in his 3-mile zone, when he's telling us not to drill nationally. Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, issues permits, and California approves them or his administration does, to drill off the shore of California every year, drilling in the 3-mile zone. Now, they drill part of them from onshore with a slant drill. They go on our Federal platforms in Federal Waters and slant drill into the 3-mile area to produce oil. 
   I'm sorry, but California and Florida are huge users of energy and both of them have thwarted us. I've got to give credit to the Florida delegation. They have come around. Many of the Florida delegation realize--and the Florida citizens picked it up first--they're now supporting offshore production of energy. Offshore production of energy is not a threat to our coastlines. It's the best reserves we have. It's close to where the people are. We have pipelines and refineries there. 
   It's what really works. 
   When you produce oil in some parts of the Midwest it's hard to get it to market. I'm not saying we shouldn't produce it, but when you produce it on your shorelines where your population centers are, it's the best place. 
   I find this Congress almost unbelievable that we use excuses like there's 68 million acres that are leased and are not producing. Well, if you punch 10 holes in the ground and they're all dry holes, you stop spending your money. 
   I know also there's probably hundreds of cases in the gulf where there's lawsuits preventing them from drilling a hole in the ground. Citizen lawsuits, the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, all these organizations continually sue to stop the production of energy. 
   Yes, the problem we've had, we've had three Presidents in a row and 14 Congresses in a row, and all these 10, 11 environmental groups that said we must stop using fossil fuels. We must stop using these, and we're going to replace them with these. They're going to replace these with this. 
   I wish we could, but until we can, we better produce and we need to be doing coal-to-liquids and coal-to-gas. We need to be continuing to push hydrogen. We need to do all of the above. 
   And I want to tell you something, it's my opinion, my humble opinion, that if we drill offshore and we drill more in the Midwest and we do coal-to-liquids and coal-to-gas--they all take time--this country is going to be in an energy  crunch for a number of years, and there's going to be pain felt in this country. We're going to lose middle-class jobs. We're going to lose industries out of this country because they can't afford to be here, no matter what we do, because we've waited too long.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That's one of the things I didn't mention is I think nitrogen fertilizer is 70 percent natural gas. Petrochemical, 55 percent natural gas, as an ingredient. Polymers and plastics, 45 to 50 percent natural gas. We have steel. We all know the manufacturing of steel and aluminum use huge amounts of natural gas. 
   My prediction is if we don't open up natural gas and get the price down, we'll make our bricks--bulk commodities like bricks that are easily made in our own neighborhoods from clay somewhere in a mountain nearby, those will be made in Trinidad, where gas is $1.60. Glass for our home windows will be made in Trinidad. In fact, car windows are coming in from overseas right now because of natural gas prices. 
   Natural gas is the mother's milk of the manufacturing process in this country. And if we don't fix the natural gas problem, we're not going to have a manufacturing base of anything. We will import everything that's manufactured. And at the same time, Americans, this winter and the winters ahead, are just plain going to struggle to drive their cars and heat their homes.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. This has been an interesting discussion. Oil prices record high, $119, gas prices, $11. And is Congress acting? What is on the table here to help Americans for affordable energy? Very little, folks. We're about restricting supply. 
   Consumers are paying the highest prices. The people in my district, and I'm sure in yours, are struggling to drive long distances. I come from a rural district. People are paying $20 and $30 a day to drive to work. They can't afford that. They're struggling now to catch up with their winter heating bills, which were unreasonably high. 
   Well, who's the bad guy? Who's causing this price rise? Mr. Markey from Massachusetts said it's Big Oil because they just charge too much. He also says it's because we're putting 70,000 barrels a day in the SPR. Well, why are oil prices high, folks? It's because this Congress, three decades ago, locked up supply. Look at the red on the map. That's the Outer Continental Shelf. We're the only country in the world who doesn't produce gas and oil there. The only country in the world. There are huge reserves in the Midwest. 
   This body and the Democrat Party have been talking about locking up the shale rock, there's been legislation to do that, the Roan Plateau, the best gas reserve in the Midwest, locking them up. 
   They talk about us not being dependent on foreign energy, but everything they're doing makes us dependent on foreign energy, where we have no control. Yes, prices for energy are set on Wall Street. Right or wrong, that's the system. They set the prices. When you lock up supply, if we stopped growing as much corn, prices go up. If you stop making as much steel in this country,  if you limit, steel prices are going to go up. We're limiting the production of energy. 
   Are we against wind and solar? Absolutely not. Look at the chart here. Here's the renewables. They think that's going to be an instant answer. I want all the wind we can get, all the solar we can get, all the geothermal. We're promoting biofuels. On the biofuels issue, we mandated 35.5 billion gallons a year by 2030. We had 6.5 billion gallons last year. 
   Corn prices have tripled. Wheat prices have tripled. Food prices are getting so people now are struggling to go to the grocery store after they've been to the gas station. If we have a bad crop failure down the road, not only are food prices going to go crazy, but ethanol prices. Folks, I think we better be very careful about the biofuels. I'm not opposing them, I never have, but I would be surprised if biofuels can increase the use of gasoline we need in growth. Energy prices, folks, are dependent on supply. If we double wind and solar tomorrow, we're at less than three-quarters of 1 percent of our energy supply. I hope we can do it. 
   Folks, we need to produce energy so Americans can afford to live.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I find it ironic today the maker of this amendment represents one of the more affluent parts of America, one of the parts of America that wouldn't be there, wouldn't be growing and prospering without billions and billions of Federal investment. 
   We can start with the 336-mile diversion canal that diverts water from the Colorado River so they can irrigate the desert and make it a city. It seems to me that's a pretty expensive economic development project taking desert and making it grow. 
   Mesa last year, his home area, $35 million of their budget is Federal money, and he keeps talking about the process. Well, I think I understand the process, and I'd be glad to debate the process with him any day, anytime, anywhere. I've been in business all my life, retailing. I served in local government 8 years, State government 19 years, Federal Government 11 years, and I understand process. 
   Rural America is not a part of the process of funds from the Federal Government. This bureaucracy you brag about how they allocate money and how they hand it out as if this was some pure process. Rural communities don't have planning departments. They don't have planning directors. They don't have consultants. They don't hire lobbyists like Mesa and Phoenix and Arizona do. They're fighting for their economic lives. 
   This little forest county is less than 10,000 people. I think the population went from close to 5,500 to 7,500 because we opened a prison there. It used to be the home of an Evenflo Bottle Company, and those people would like to see a little investment in economic development in that community. It used to be the home of a glass plant. It used to be the home of a cabinet factory. They're all gone. 
   It is a beautiful area, some of the most beautiful parts of America. It is the best hunting and fishing in America, and tourism is the only tool they have that's working. This Hunting and Fishing Museum is another tool to try to keep hunters and fishermen and travelers and visitors to visit that part of the area. 
   Another thing, its interactive displays teach young people about hunting and fishing. We have a lot of people today that don't have fathers at home teaching them to hunt and fish. The Hunting and Fishing Museum is going to have classes. They're going to have classrooms. They're going to teach young people the joy of hunting and fishing. I find you take a young man and you teach him to fish, you teach him to hunt, you get him involved in a sport, he's less likely to be in crimes, drugs and on the streets. 
   It's a part of the fiber of America. There is no urban museum that isn't loaded with Federal dollars to build it.     
   Rural museums don't have that same pathway. I defy a museum in America that doesn't have Federal funding in it. Because a little community asks for 50 or 100,000, this is some sort of a crime? 
   I'm sorry. I'm not going to apologize. I served Forest County as a State House member, a State senator and now a Congressman. I ran a business within 10 miles, and many of these people were customers of mine when I had a supermarket. These are good people fighting for their economic lives trying to build this museum. 
   The State has allocated $4 million, but they have to get matching money. This $100,000 will get them another $100,000 from the State, because as they raise money, they get money. I gladly debate this museum. It's a good investment for the future for Forest County and for America. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. According to the Department of Transportation in 2005, his area received $580 million for its construction of a $1.4 billion, that's a pretty big percentage, of a 19.6 mile light rail system serving metropolitan Phoenix. 
   Why should people from Forest County have to pay that? I should make that argument. We can use it. Mass transit gets huge amounts of money, and Arizona gets lots of that. The largesse goes to the urban areas that have the ability to get it. 
   One thing about the earmark process, I am not saying it's perfect, but I have  never asked for an earmark that I wouldn't defend publicly in any setting. I am proud today to ask this Congress to give $100,000 to the Hunting and Fishing Museum in little Forest County, that is trying to rebuild their economic base, enhance their tourism and teach our young people the value of wildlife and fishing and hunting and the beauty of the area. That's a noble issue. 
   I will gladly support the ability to help that rural county. I ask support of this Congress for this earmark.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I cautiously come to the floor today, but I'm troubled by the process here. 
   I come from a Great Lakes State, Pennsylvania. We cherish the Great Lakes, but we're passing a resolution today because of a newspaper article, a column, and we have legislation without any hearings. This is why we don't have refinery capacity in America. 
   In light of recent attention given to the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's permit to the BP refinery, I would like to provide the facts and clear up misunderstandings, says the Department of Environmental Management in Indiana. 
   The BP wastewater permit was issued in accordance with State and Federal environmental laws which are protective of human health and environment. The State coordinated with EPA during the permitting process to ensure that the final permit was compliant with the Clean Water Act. On April 5, 2007, EPA issued a letter that they had no objections to the permit being issued pursuant to the Clean Water Act. 
   There are many inaccuracies in the recent media reports. They have given no exceptions to environmental conditions for this facility. The wastewater treatment permit meets all State laws and regulations that apply to the facility and project. Many of the limits placed in the permit are actually more protective than required by Federal law. 
   We need to deal with these issues with the facts, not newspaper reports. We can't build refineries in America. We blame the refineries. This happens every time they try. 
   I'm not for pollution in Lake Erie, but I would like to have had a hearing where Indiana could have had its case heard. We shouldn't be here on the floor debating this with very little knowledge and hysteria. 
   The future of refining in America, the future of energy availability in America, we must have clean water and clean air, but if we are going to have a political reaction without the hearings, without the information, we shouldn't make these kind of decisions on the floor of the House. 
   I'm for cleaning up the Great Lakes. I have a bill on the outer continental shelf to produce natural gas that will give $21 billion to Great Lakes cleanup. That's a bill that will help us get rid of the sludge of the past. 
   I just wish this wasn't before us without adequate process and hearings so we could understand what's really happened there, where we have a real knowledge of information, because we desperately need the capacity they're talking about.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (IS AMERICA READY FOR AN EXPENSIVE HEATING SEASON? -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is September 27. We are just finishing the first week of fall. It doesn't seem possible, Mr. Speaker, that summer has slipped by. We are now entering the fall season. That means the cool nights and chilly days will soon be coming. The northern part of the country has already had a couple of movements of Canadian air down where we have chilly nights. That will soon cover most of the country. That means the heating season will begin. 
   The question I ask is this: Is America ready for the most expensive heating season that we may have ever faced? Yes, all of the last week, the first week of fall, we have had $82 oil. In fact, at the close today it was just 12 cents, it would have been $83 oil. I remember when $50 oil caused a panic, and $60 oil was going to be the end of all, and then $70 oil, and this week we have had $82 oil all week. I haven't heard many people talk about it because that price hasn't hit us yet. It hasn't hit the pump yet. It hasn't hit home heating costs yet.  
   But $82 oil will give us the highest home heating oil prices we have ever had. It will also give us very high propane costs to heat our homes. Now, 60-some percent of our homes are heated with natural gas. The current price of natural gas, which is at the low ebb because of the summer low usage, is at $7 today. That will soon be rising as we get into the fall season and gas consumption increases. This year, all of the gas distribution companies are warning their customers that they will pay from 9 to 15 to 20 percent more this year than last. That is only on a prediction, because that depends if we have no storms in the gulf or no major supplier of gas that goes offline. A storm in the gulf, and we have not had one that really damaged the gulf now all of last year and all of this year, would give us $90 to $95 oil quickly, could give us $12 to $15 gas quickly. Then we would have real pain in America, not only for those that are heating their homes, but the ones that buy this energy every day of the week, every week of the year, the manufacturers and the processors in America that run our plants: the steel mills, the aluminum mills, the chemical plants, the fertilizer plants, those who process our goods, those who bake our bread, those who cook our foods. I was talking to Hershey Foods today about the energy they use to roast the peanuts and melt the chocolate and make the candy. Energy is consumed in every process of life. 
   What has this Congress, in the few months we have been here, what have we accomplished to stabilize energy prices? I am just going to turn this chart over because that simplifies what we have not accomplished, because we haven't accomplished anything. There has not been one bill passed. There has been nothing changed. But we have been stirring around doing things. 
   I want to ask you tonight, Mr. Speaker, are the things we have been doing productive and helpful? Will they help Americans heat their homes and drive their cars with affordable energy? Well, the legislation that has been approved by this body, and I believe the Senate, removes 9 trillion cubic feet of gas in the Roan Plateau that was permitted. All the NEPA studies were done. All the environmental assessments were done. It was ready to be drilled. This legislation takes 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas off the market. 
   This legislation also locks up the oil shale reserves in the West. What are the oil shale reserves? 
   Well, some think it is the largest reserve of oil in the world. We still haven't figured out how to unlock it from the shale rock. But to the north of us, we have the tar sands that are very similar. It is going to take a lot of energy and a lot of heat to warm it up and get it out of there. I was talking to a Canadian company this morning, and in Canada they are now producing about 1.5 million barrels per day of tar sand oil. Their goal in a year or 2 is to be at 3 or 4 million. They have been working on that for a long time, because it was a process that they needed to develop and that they needed to refine. They needed to figure out how to make it work. 
   Now, it seems that we down here in the States ought to be working just as diligently on the shale oil reserves so that we would be energy independent. The lady from Ohio was just talking about dependence. What we are talking about is the issues I am talking about here. Taking the 9 trillion cubic feet away, taking the shale reserves out, will make America not less dependent, but much more dependent on unstable foreign countries. 
   I don't understand the lack of urgency in this body. We have not had an urgency in this body since I have been here that I think is adequate, because America does not realize that $82 oil might almost be a plateau upon which we can have spikes. If we have a storm in the gulf, it will spike. If we have a major sender of oil or a country we are getting a lot of oil from has any trouble with their government or any instability there or any kind of explosion in a pipeline or a loading dock, we can have $100 oil. And we know then we would be looking at maybe $3.75 to $4 gasoline. We currently don't have $3 gasoline in most of the country, some parts, but we soon will have, because $82 oil will be more than $3 gasoline when it catches up in the pipeline. 
   The legislation we have before us is making it very difficult to produce in the Alaskan National Petroleum Reserve that was set aside a long time ago. The rules are being changed. They are making it harder to permit. They are making it harder to produce there. That is a $10 million oil reserve. 
   Then this one is the one that surprises me. I know a lot of Members of Congress hate oil companies, hate big oil. But we passed legislation here in the Senate, it is not law yet, thank God, that increases the taxation on anybody who produces energy and processes energy by 5 percent. So any company that produces energy in America will pay a 5-percent higher corporate income tax than anybody who manufacturers anything else. Now I don't know why we would do that. I know they want to get at the five big oil companies, but probably 75 to 80 percent of the production is not by big oil. They are the processors. They are the refiners. They are the marketers. But there is company after company that are investing billions in America and billions around the world to produce energy that are not big oil. They don't market oil. They drill and produce and move and transport petroleum and other products to the marketplace. Well, we are causing them to pay these taxes. 
   I have two refineries in my district still. One is a Penn grade crude refinery, American Refiners in Bradford, about 10,000 barrels a day, just a small refinery. They are going to pay 5 percent more corporate taxes than any other business in Bradford, Pennsylvania. Is that fair? No. That is not fair. What will that do? That will make energy more expensive, not less expensive. It will not encourage people to produce in this country. It will encourage them to produce in other countries so they don't have to pay it. 
   United Refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, that gets Canadian crude, gets it under the lake; it comes under the lake in a pipeline. It is a very good refinery. It has been growing about 70,000 barrels a day now. It is a company that I am very proud of and have worked with for years. They are going to pay 5 percent more corporate taxes now if this becomes law. That will make it more expensive for them to produce the gasoline and fuel oil for our people. Who will pay that? The consumers. We will pay that. 
   Also, the language that we have been working on, I was fortunate in the energy act in 2005 to put an amendment in that took away redundant NEPAs. Now, NEPA is a study. It is an environmental assessment that is very important that we do before we do anything on public land. Well, those who oppose the production of energy, and that is a lot of people in America, who don't want us to drill for oil, who don't want us to drill for gas, who don't want us to dig for coal, don't want us to use fossil fuels, and don't want nuclear, so they fight it. They fight it in the courts.     
   They use processes to make it difficult. I had people telling me in the West they had leased 6, 7 years prior and were still unable to drill a hole in the ground and bring any oil or gas up. It was because they were being caused to do a NEPA study for every step in the process. 
   Now, a NEPA study is a complete environmental assessment, and it's appropriate. But should you do five or six NEPA studies before you can drill for gas or oil? I don't think so. I don't think that is fair. That is just about delay. That is not about environmental protection. That is to prevent the production of energy. 
   I don't understand, because when you look at the chart, and let's look at it, we are using 40 percent petroleum, and currently 66 percent of that comes from, as the gentlewoman from Ohio said, foreign, unstable non-democratic governments that you really can't depend on. 
   Natural gas is 23 percent of our energy. That is the one that has been increasing. About 12 years ago we took away the moratorium on using natural gas to make electricity, and now 21 percent of our natural gas makes electricity. We now, for the sixth year in the row, have had the highest natural gas prices in the world. That has been a serious problem for business and industry, our job creators. 
   Dow Chemical, the largest chemical company in the world, in 2002 used $9  billion worth of natural gas. That seems like an incredible figure. Four years later, in 2006, they spent $22 billion. That's $9 billion in 2002, $22 billion in 2006. In four years, $22 billion, because the price of natural gas had spiked in this country, higher than Europe, higher than all our competitors, five to six times higher than South America. 
   Natural gas prices have been one of the biggest drags on the American economy, because we use it to melt steel, we use it to bend steel, we use it to make aluminum, we use it to make ethanol, we use it to make hydrogen, we use it to heat our homes. In the petrochemical business, which Dow Chemical is in, they use it as an ingredient. Fertilizer, it's an ingredient; plastic products, it's an ingredient; polymers, it's an ingredient. 
   So natural gas is not only a fuel, but it's an ingredient. The face creams that we all like, the skin softeners that keep our face and hands soft, that is a direct product from natural gas. Natural gas is the finest product known to man to make things with. 
   Then we have coal. The bulk of that is used to make electricity. I had a gentleman ask me the other day, how are we coming on coal to liquids, coal to gas? 
   Well, we are not. In World War II, Germany fought us with liquids made from coal. It was called the Fischer-Tropes process. We have paid many universities in this country and researchers to come up with other ways. There are numerous ways now to make liquids. We could make jet fuel, we could make gasoline, we could make diesel out of coal. We have not refined it and we have not made it cost effective, but we know how to do it. We can make natural gas out of coal. But there is such an anti-coal sentiment in America, because it produces carbon in the air. 
   I said to the person, there have been groups in the Senate and there have been groups in the House trying to put pilot projects or some way of helping push the ball down the road for coal to liquid and coal to gas so that we can be less dependent on foreign oil, but not one of those has even come close to having a vote to get in any of the energy packages that are moving. 
   We have clean coal technology to make electricity out of coal. It's much cleaner than the old processes. 
   But there are those who think today they probably couldn't build one of those plants because there is such opposition. Though we are the Saudi Arabia of coal, it's kind of sitting on the sidelines. 
   Eight percent of our energy comes from nuclear. Since the Energy Act of 2005, thirty-some companies have put in plans and requests for permitting of new nuclear facilities, and I think all on existing sites, expansion of current plants and new plants. In fact, I see the other day that the first two permits to come in to build a completely new reactor, not just additions, have come in. 
   But the 35 permits we have in process, I am told by the industry that by 2020 we need them all to just keep nuclear at 8 percent of our electric generation, because our electric use is rising so fast that we need to grow nuclear or nuclear won't be 8 percent; it may be 7 percent, then 6 1/2 percent. 
   Hydroelectricity is not growing. Clean energy, no pollution, but there's great opposition. You couldn't build a dam in this country today; that is not allowed. So hydroelectric is just where it's at, and that percentage will continue to shrink. As the use of electric goes up, this will go down to 2.5, 2.3, 2 percent. We have lots of dams in this country that have not been harnessed, and there's been a real resistance. 
   The only good news on the chart is biomass, which is wood waste and things, pellet stoves, people heating their home from pellets. You have factories heating in the woods where we have lots of forests and mills where we process wood. They use it to heat the boilers to heat the factory. They use it to top off some of the coal plants, which allows them to meet air standards. It may be 80 percent coal and 20 percent wood waste. Biomass has been growing. Of course, down the road we hope to get into cellulosic ethanol. I will talk about that a little later. 
   Geothermal is a very good form of energy, but a very small percentage. We use that by using the ground temperature, whether we drill into wells and use the well water, or whether we put a loop system in deep enough that you have the ground temperature and you take heat out in the wintertime and take cold out in the summertime to cool your home or heat your home. But that is a very expensive investment and is usually done in new construction, and it is pretty disruptive to do it in an existing neighborhood. 
   Wind and solar are the two sexy ones. They get a lot of talk, and there are a lot of things going on there. But we see the percentage. If we double these percentages, even if we triple these percentages, we are not to 1 percent. These are very small numbers. 
   We all like them because they are clean. I shouldn't say ``we'' all like them. We had a bill introduced this year that was introduced in the Resources Committee that said if a bird was found at the foot of a windmill, it was going to be a criminal offense. I think that language was removed in the bill that moved. But that shows you that someone is not very pro-wind, because birds and bats will occasionally get in that path and hit those blades. 
   But these two, what the problem is, when the wind doesn't blow, we have to have a natural gas generator to turn on. That is what we do. Then solar, when the sun doesn't shine, we have to have a natural gas generator to turn on. When you add these up, wind and solar and geothermal, you are less than 1 percent of the overall energy mix. No matter how much we increase them, they are a fraction. It will be a long time before they are real numbers. 
   So what does that mean? That means whether we like fossil fuels or not, we must have more petroleum, we must have more gas, we must have more coal, we must grow nuclear, we should be growing hydroelectric. Biomass is the only one that is really showing much growth. 
   But I want to tell you, the environmental groups in America that are running energy policy, and certainly today in this House, are anti-petroleum, because you drill a hole in the ground. They are anti-natural gas. I don't understand that one, because natural gas is a clean gas. There is no nitric oxide. There is no sulfuric acid. There is one-third of the CO  
   2, if you are concerned about CO 
   2. It is really the green field. 
   In my view, the only way we will survive or prevent a crisis in America on energy is if we really pull the stops up and open up every natural gas field we can until we can develop some of the renewables, until we can find other sources of energy. 
   We have ethanol. Ethanol now, in 2006 we produced 5 billion gallons. This year, we are at 6 billion gallons. So we are growing. Our ethanol is made out of corn. Brazil's was made out of sugar cane. That was cheaper to make. 
   To make ethanol out of corn, you have two processes. You have to take the starch and turn it to sugar. Then you ferment the sugar and make the ethanol that you use 
   as a fuel. So it is a dual process. Ninety-five percent of all these plants are fueled with natural gas. So we need natural gas for that. 
   Natural gas, like I said, is the only fuel that can really prevent this. We have a lot of petroleum being produced in this country, but we can never be self-sufficient. People who think we are going to be independent are just talking. 
   Natural gas, we can be self-sufficient, we can keep moderate prices. We can expand natural gas use in our auto fleet and save a lot of oil with natural gas, in my view. But natural gas is looked at just like oil. You have got to drill a hole in the ground, and you must not do that. 
   In my opinion, from the administration on down, there are really no strong proponents of coal. There are Members of Congress that are strong proponents, but certainly far from a majority. And I don't look for any progress on coal. I don't look for any progress on petroleum. I have not given up on natural gas, and I will talk about my bill in a moment, because we believe that natural gas is our only hope of diverting an energy crisis in America. 
   What do I mean by an energy crisis? I mean oil prices where we cannot afford to compete. The problem we have today, Americans are struggling, the poorer Americans are struggling, by the time they heat their homes this winter, drive their cars, to have adequate funds left for health care and  food and all the other substantives of life. Energy prices are going to make it very difficult on the poor in this country as they continue to rise. But even worse, and I know people don't care as much about companies, but companies and businesses who are employing us, they make up the payrolls. They give people a chance to make a living. 
   We have the highest natural gas prices in the world; and when our companies are paying the highest prices for the fuel they use to make products, then they are not competitive in the world marketplace. 
   We have lost more jobs in America than we can count. We blame it on trade agreements; we blame it on lots of other things. But the last 6 to 7 years, natural gas prices were between $1.77 and $2 for years, we had a couple of spikes in the seventies and eighties, and then the climb started. Then came Katrina. Now we are up in the $7 and $8 figure. With a storm in the gulf, we could be back up to $14 or $15 again, because as we enter the heating season, we are at the low ebb of the year, about $7 per thousand, but a lot the gas that is in the ground for this year's use, we paid $8, $9 and $10, because we put gas in storage all for the winter usage. I don't know what the average price is coming out, but most of the utilities have told us 9 to 20 percent more for heating a home with natural gas this year, depending on which utility you are on, when they bought their gas or how they bought their gas. 
   So we are looking at a measurable increase. We are looking at a real spike in fuel home heating prices, because $82 oil will be the most expensive home heating prices we have ever had. Propane comes from both, so propane will be somewhere in the mix. It is always more than natural gas. So the cost of heating our homes this year will be very important. 
   Now, let's bring up the chart on what we think is the solution, the best thing we can do. 
   Here is a picture of this country. You could also have some great big blobs in here where we have locked up huge resources of natural gas and coal and oil that are on public land, because in the West, the vast majority of the land is owned by the Federal Government. 
   But where we are different than any other country in the world is we have chosen to lock up our Outer Continental Shelf. What is the Outer Continental Shelf? Well, Mr. Speaker, that is from 3 miles offshore to 200 miles offshore. Every country in the world produces a lot of their oil and gas out there, because it is very prevalent. 
   Now, we produce in just a small piece in the gulf, and we get 40 percent of our energy from there. This small area down here is what keeps America alive. Otherwise, we would be importing 80 to 90 percent of our oil from foreign countries. 
   I just find it amazing that we have chosen as a country that we are just not going to produce more. Maybe 10 years ago when gas was $2 a thousand and oil was $10 a barrel, it may have been a smart argument, let's buy theirs while it is cheap and save ours for when it is expensive. 
   Well, we are still saving ours. We have $82 oil. We are still saving ours. I think if we had $90 oil next month, we would still be saving ours. I have been here awhile. We have been trying to open up this for a number of years. We had a successful bill last year, but we didn't have success in the Senate. But it makes no public policy sense to not be producing oil and gas off our Outer Continental Shelf.     
   It is the safest with the least environmental impact. The sight line from shore is about 11 miles, so when you are past that, you can't see it. The commotion caused from a drilling rig, a thousand drilling rigs, is less than one storm as far as turmoil on the ocean floor. And there hasn't been a major spill of oil except for the one in Santa Barbara in 1969. 
   The technology of today is when a storm comes or there is a problem, the valve of the rig on the ocean floor is electronically turned off. When we had the tremendous storms in the gulf several years ago, we had very little spillage because when the storm was coming, they turned off the valves. If the platforms move, the rig is ruined, nothing happens. We have always had more spillage in the ocean from hauling oil in tankers than from wells. But we don't prohibit tankers because then we wouldn't have any oil. 
   I don't understand why we are financing all of these countries in the world by being dependent on them. They are not our friends. They were the ones that sent those here on 9/11, but we are funding them with these huge oil costs and we just plain will not use our own. There is no good reason why we couldn't be producing a lot more of our own energy, totally self-sufficient in gas, stable prices and competing with the world with all our manufacturing. We can help oil prices in the world by supply, but we cannot dictate them because we are not that big a player unless we learn how to use our shale oil down the road, and then we could say good-bye to the foreign imports. 
   But it seems to me that we ought to be opening up the OCS. That is the simplest. And my proposal is pretty simple. We are just going to open it up for natural gas. We are going to say the first 50 miles, that is up to the States. Only if the State wants to open it, can they. We are not opening it. 
   The second 50 miles would be open for natural gas only, but a State would still have the ability to say no. They could pass a law in their State and say Congress, we don't want this open. Then it would be protected for 100 miles. 
   For the second 100 miles, our bill would open gas. I would like to be opening oil out there, too, because that is so far out, there is just not an environmental problem. But we are just asking for gas because we think gas is more of a crisis than oil because we are going to lose more jobs in this country because of the highest natural gas prices in the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, $80 oil is pretty painful, but it is painful to the whole world. That is the world price. When we have gas that is twice and three times and four times what competing countries are at, we are at a disadvantage. 
   We have lost half of our fertilizer industry in the last 2 years because of natural gas prices. We are losing our petrochemical industry. Those are some of the best jobs left in America. We are going to be losing our polymer and plastic jobs because of natural gas prices. It just seems to me that we really, really need to change our attitude in this country and say let's be more independent. 
   Those who tell you we can be independent are not being honest with you. I don't know of any way we can be independent. We will also always be dependent on foreign energy in our lifetime. Maybe some day with new forms of energy or new ways of powering vehicles and new ways of lighting and heating our homes, if we can do that, some day we might be. But all of the things that we are working on are still on the margins. We want to grow them all. We want to move them as fast as we can. We want all of the renewables that we can get. But those who tell you that renewables will take care of even the growth in energy needs are not being honest with you. And those who say that renewables displace oil and gas and coal needs in this country are not being honest with you because they just can't. 
   We need to have the OCS opened up. We need to promote all of the renewables we can. The President is promoting cellulosic ethanol. We are at 6 billion gallons of ethanol, and they want to get to 35. That is a big jump. I don't know whether we can get there. They want not to just be corn. And I noticed today corn prices are approaching $4 a bushel again. When we started making ethanol, corn was less than $2. Nobody knows where it is going to be when we go through another season because there are a lot of ethanol plants being built. We will have a lot more capacity a year from now to make ethanol. 
   There are problems with ethanol. It takes a lot of energy to make it. I am not opposed, but it costs a lot to make it. And one of the problems is that ethanol cannot be put in a pipeline system where the vast majority of our energy is put out to the stations. We have to blend it at the station or blend it at the distributorship and haul it in tankers because it has a corrosiveness to it. So unless we change all of the pipelines in the country, ethanol has a serious problem that we have not been able to overcome yet. We have to haul it separately and then blend it at the station  in a tank. So it has a distribution problem. 
   The President wants to do cellulosic ethanol which will be from any kind of waste material. It could be from wood waste when you ferment it to make it. Or it could be from garbage, which seems to make some sense. It could be from things like switchgrass and cornstalks and any kind of cellulose, cellulosic ethanol. 
   The problem is that it is still in the laboratory. We think we have about got it to where we can make it. They are funding six plants which are going to be experimental. I am for that, but I think we should be doing the same thing simultaneously with coal. Taking every process we have to make liquids from coal and refining it, improving it so we can do it in volume down the road. Coal to gas and coal to liquid, every measure we know, we ought to be refining those and getting those to where they will help us to be independent. 
   And we should be continuing to promote nuclear. The nuclear we have on the drawing boards will keep us from losing percentage. It will not help us grow, but we need to figure out, and that may be one of the biggest mistakes we made, if we are really concerned about CO  
   2, we certainly should be for nuclear power plants. 
   But we need to be doing all of these, Mr. Speaker. We need the OCS open. We need that clean, green natural gas, affordable and available to heat our homes, run our businesses, and manufacture products so we can compete in the world marketplace. We need clean, green natural gas as well as cellulosic ethanol, as well as all of the renewables, as well as coal to liquids, as well as coal to gas, and as well as clean coal technology and more nuclear plants. 
   A lot of our competitors, like China and India, they are buying up reserves of oil and gas all over the world. They are building coal plants, coal-to-liquid plants. They are building hydrodams. They are building every form of energy there is at breakneck speed. We as a country are sitting here on our hands twiddling our thumbs, actually today moving in the direction of less available energy, which will make us more costly and more foreign dependent. 
   The legislation that we have before us, if it becomes law, I think will speed up, and we have been gaining in dependence on foreign oil about 2 percent a 
   year for the last 10 years. I think we will speed it up to 3 to 4 percent a year if we go down to the road of taxing oil more, of taking major plateaus and major reserves off the table, refusing to open up the OCS, our dependence will grow. When you are at 66, you don't have to go very far to where you're three-fourths, and then you are 80 percent and the rest of the world will just plain own us because they today, OPEC today sets the price of oil. Five years ago they didn't. They had lost their grip. But today, they set the price of oil. 
   Imports. This is not quite up to date. I am going to have to get a new chart with 2 more years on it. But we are back on a steady climb. I predict it won't be very long until we will be at 70. And if we pass the legislation that is before the House and do nothing else, do nothing to open up, do no OCS, do no Alaskan, and continue to take much of the Midwest out of the picture, continue to lock up more reserves, we will be 70 and climbing towards 75 at breakneck speed and America will be dependent for their total economy, for the ability to heat their homes and manufacture, on foreign, unstable nondemocratic countries who will actually and literally own us. That's not the America I want for my grandchildren and for your grandchildren. I want an America that has a sound energy policy that produces oil, produces gas, produces coal, moves into all of the renewables and does more on conservation. 
   I haven't talked about conservation, but prices are going to force us to conserve. There are many who want prices as high as we can get them so we will use less energy. Well, they are winning. And I am going to tell you, energy prices this winter will be the highest they have ever been, and we will be dependent on weather as to how high they go. 
   Major storms in the gulf, major cold weather where we consume a lot of heat, will set prices far higher than they are today. We are not in control. The weather and unstable parts of the world will dictate what America does for energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY POLICY IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I want to thank the gentleman from Utah and thank him for his leadership in the Western Caucus. Even though I'm from Western Pennsylvania and Central Pennsylvania, I've been a proud member of the Western Caucus my tenure in Congress, and have enjoyed working on the many issues that the West is interested in. 
   $129 oil today. I remember a short time ago when it hit 80 and then it hit 90. I came down on the floor, thinking this Congress would start to react as if it was a crisis. Here we are today with $129. We've been over 120 for a week or so. 
   Do we have a bipartisan Senate/House task force formed to deal with energy? No. Not an issue. 
   Do we have a special committee in the Congress here in the House to deal with energy, maybe bipartisan or partisan? No. 
   Is anybody calling for a special session that we deal with energy? 
   No matter where I go, where I fly, what coffee shop I sit in, everybody's talking about energy prices. Why? Because a young lady said to me recently, Mr. Peterson, I make $320 a week. I'm raising two children as a single mom. I'm now paying $130 a month, no, $130 a week to drive to work. 
   In rural America people drive distances to work. They drive distances to school. They drive distances to shop. They drive distances to go to the doctor. There's no transits, there's no cheap way to travel. 
   She said, I'm spending $130 a week. I said, what are you spending to heat your home? She said, I'm spending $175 a month, year round, to heat my home with natural gas. 
   What this young lady doesn't know that, since she told me that, energy prices have risen considerably. That was a few weeks ago. And what she doesn't know, and most Americans don't know that natural gas prices to heat our homes are going up measurably this fall. 
   Last year, at this time, in the summertime, we put our natural gas in reserve, underground caverns because we can't produce enough during the winter heating season. Last year, at this time we were putting gas in the ground at $6.50 to 7, and that was a little bit higher than usual. Not a lot but a little bit. 
   Today we're putting $11 gas in the ground. And I talked to one of the experts at the Energy Department today, and he expects that figure to rise. If we would have a major storm in the gulf, which we have not had for 2 years, and we always lose some production in the gulf when that happens, we could have 14, $15 gas go in the ground. If that's true, home heating costs next winter, with natural gas, and that's 62 percent of Americans, will double. 
   Those who are heating with propane and home heating oil this year paid huge prices, and are going to pay much higher prices next year. Natural gas only went up about 10 percent. But that's going to change. 
   Folks, America has chosen, the leadership in America has chosen to not produce our own energy, to lock ours up. Now, we did pass a bill today called, interesting name, the Gas Price Relief Act for Consumers of 2008. Now, wouldn't you think that's going to do something with prices? 
   Well, here's what it does. It's trying to figure out a legal way for us to sue OPEC and other countries who we don't think's producing enough oil. If, you know, I think Saudi Arabia, I looked today, is 12 million barrel a day. And the President was just there, and the Speaker asked him to ask for more oil, and I think he asked for more oil. 
   A month or so ago, Vice President Cheney was over there, and the Speaker and others asked him to ask for more oil, and he asked for more oil. 
   But now we're going to pass a bill saying that if they don't produce enough oil, and if we think they're kind of conspiring and not producing as much as they could, we want some court to sue them in. 
   Well, it seems to me, we're a little bit vulnerable, because I want you to look at my chart here. Congress, for 27 years, has locked up the Outer Continental Shelf. That's offshore production of energy. Every country in the world produces out there, a major part of their energy, both oil and natural gas. 
   We've also locked up major parts of the Midwest. Up here in Alaska, we locked up the portion of ANWR that was set aside for energy production. That's why it was set aside. I think we heard in earlier testimony here that 2,000 acres out of millions would have been actually the footprint. And yet, this Congress said no. 
   Now, we've said no to Alaska. We've said no to the Midwest. The oil shale rock was recently locked up, not signed into law yet, but we passed a bill here with six plus votes, I think, to lock up the shale oil in three States in the West. 
   We heard earlier about the huge coal lock up with one Presidential order. Congress, and three Presidents, have locked up offshore production. 
   Now, we have the nerve to say that we're going to sue other countries because they're only producing 12 million barrels a day for us? 
   I think maybe we ought to pass the bill that Americans could sue Congress and the administration for not producing adequate energy. We have been negligent.  
   This Congress has the mind set that we're going to run this country with renewables. Now, I wish that was true. But let's look at the chart. The left of this chart is history. The right of this chart is the Energy Department's prediction. There's not much change. 
   Hydro, non-hydro renewables. This is wind, solar and geothermal and woody biomass. And the one that's increased the most is woody biomass because a million Americans are now heating their home with pellet stoves. That's sawdust made into pellets. 
   All the wood companies are drying their wood. If they dry their wood they're using wood waste now instead of fuel oil or diesel or natural gas because they can't afford that. 
   And many power plants are topping off their loads. To keep under air emission standards they may use 80 percent coal and 20 percent wood waste. And we now have some plants coming on-line generating with wood waste. So woody biomass, and now we're talking about cellulosic ethanol, which will also be another use for woody biomass. So that's been the only one that's growing. 
   Nuclear, we need, we have 45 to 50 plants that are now applying for new permits, and we need all of them to be completed by 2030 to stay equal. 
   Coal, it shows coal growing. I don't believe that's going to happen. We've had about 60 coal plants in the country that have been turned down by States because of the threat of climate change legislation, which will put a tax on energy. 
   When you hear people talking about carbon taxes and carbon trading, you need to realize that in every country that's went down that road, that will increase energy prices another 20 to 30 percent. Now, let's say it's 25. Well, at $4 gasoline, that means, with a carbon tax, gasoline would be $5 pretty quickly, without oil prices going up. 
   Now, they show natural gas flat here. I disagree with the Energy Department, because every one of those 60 coal plants that have been turned down will be a natural gas fired generation plant. Just 10, 12 years ago we produced 7 percent of our electricity with natural gas. 
   We're now at 23 percent and growing. And whenever you deal with carbon in any country, the only field you can shift to is natural gas. It's cleaner. No knocks, no socks, and a third of the CO  
   2. So it's the clean green gas. 
   Now, we should be using more of it. But if we're going to use more of it, we need to produce more of it and we need to be out on the Outer Continental Shelf. As we showed before, we need to get into the Midwest, we need to do the coal to liquids, coal to gas, as we heard others talking about earlier. We need to do all of those things, and those are all doable. 
   Folks, we need all the wind and solar we can get. And I'm for it. But if we double it in the next 5 years, we will be less than 1 percent of our energy use in this country. So it's not big numbers. We can't run the country on renewables. 
   We're not increasing hydro. Folks, we're really not increasing anything. We're sitting on our hands. We're a policy-less country, as far as energy is concerned. 
   The 2005 Energy Bill did a lot of good things. The reason we have 45 to 50 permits on nuclear is because it streamlined the process and we now have all those in the pipeline. 
   The unfortunate part, when we build these nuclear plants, the basins are going to come from Japan, that's the base because we don't have the ability to make them here anymore. And many of the components are going to come from Germany, which has a lot of capacity. And we've kind of lost our capacity.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. And that comes from Third World countries, dictatorships, the same type of countries that we're purchasing oil from. 
   But let me tell you, it's not that simple. LNG, and I'm not opposed to it, but when a tanker is loaded with LNG it becomes a commodity, and countries like Japan and Spain and other countries that have no natural gas, live by it. They will currently, are paying 14 to $15 per thousand for a tanker load, and we can't afford to pay that. We're paying 11 to put in the ground. We can't put 14 and $15 dollar gas in the ground, or we are automatically doubling natural gas heating prices for next year. 
   Now, natural gas is not just a heating fuel. We run our country with it. You know, we use--70 to 90 percent of the cost of fertilizer to grow corn to make ethanol is natural gas cost. That's what we use. 
   Petrochemical business, 55 percent of their cost is natural gas because they use it as an ingredient and as a fuel. 
   Polymers and plastics, 45 percent of the cost of that industry is natural gas because they use it as an ingredient, as a fuel. Almost everything we manufacture in America has natural gas in it as an ingredient, as a fuel. 
   Really, I've had people tell me it's such a wonderful substance, we never should burn it, we should use it as the chemical that it is to make products. But we know that's not going be the case. 
   We have lots of natural gas in America. Unfortunately, all the rich fields are locked up. Offshore is loaded. The Roan Plateau in the West is loaded. They've just found the new Marcella Shale in the Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia area. It's going to take a while to develop it. But we have lots, but we are not producing enough of it to keep it affordable. And we are looking at a huge spike that's coming at us right now. 
   But LNG, we can only buy it in the off season. In the heating season, when we need it, we never can afford to pay for it because the other countries bid it up. And they have to pay the price because they don't have any other oil.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I was in a hardware store last month, and they had their coats on. And I said, what's going on? He said, in the spring and the fall season now we don't heat our store because people, working people are coming in to buy hardware and lumber, it's a lumber yard. And they said because it costs us 800 in the month in the spring and the fall season, now it's going to cost us a lot more than that in the winter, but we have to keep it warm in the winter. But in the spring months, when nothing will freeze, we shut our heat off. That saves us 800 a month. Those are two fall months and two spring months. That saves me $3,200 profits. So he said, we work with our coats on. Our customers come in with their coats on, they just leave them on and they don't complain. He said, that's how we do it now. We can't afford to heat our store.     
   These costs of natural gas, costs to heat schools this year are going to double. Costs to heat our hospitals are going to double. Almost everything that we use gas for will probably come close to doubling this year. It's going to be terribly inflationary, and it's going to make some businesses just noncompetitive.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Someone was talking the other day  here on the floor that we're drilling twice as many wells and we don't need to drill more. Well, we're drilling in old, tired fields. We're drilling the cracks and crevices that we haven't drilled before. You get out into some fertile territories, there's huge gas fields. Just huge. In fact, off the coast of Florida, there was a huge gas field that I think the lady from MS said it was called very sweet gas and it was tremendous volumes, and we actually bought the leases back so we wouldn't produce it. Yet 50 miles offshore, we have Cuba cutting deals with China, Norway, and Canada. They're going to produce gas 50 miles off the Florida coast, and we can't produce 100 miles off the coast. Does that make sense? I don't think so.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Well, the good news is within the next 3 to 4 weeks, we will be offering an amendment to the Interior bill that will open up on the offshore--let me put my sign back up, my chart back up here--in part of the gulf, east Atlantic, Pacific. Both oceans will all be open from 50 miles out for gas and oil. 
   Now the site distance is level. So if you're at your condo at the beach, when it gets past 11 miles, you won't know it's there. We're going to be 50 miles out. Now, I'd like to come in to 25 or 30 because there's a lot of energy in that section. But we're going to go 50 in hopes that a majority of Congress, House and Senate, will feel the heat from back home and we will open up production. 
   Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, Australia, New Zealand, all of these very sensitive environmental countries, they all produce. Canada laughs at us. They actually produce in the Great Lakes. They produce in Lake Erie where I live and they sell us the gas. And I asked them the last time they were in, Do you slant drill to our part of the lake? And he smiled and he said, You bet. 
   Now, we don't allow drilling there either. 
   We could actually drill the Great Lakes from offshore. We wouldn't even have to get in the lakes. But since 1913, Canada has produced in the Great Lakes, and now they're selling us, because we get 15 percent of our natural gas from Canada. Our largest producer of oil outside of our own is Canada, and it's also the only major source we have of natural gas other than our own, and I think 2 percent LNG. I think 15 percent of our natural gas. Thank God Canada produces. They also produce right off of the Washington coast, right off the main coast. Right off within sight of us, they're producing energy with no negative results. 
   I hope in the next 3 or 4 weeks that Congress will feel the heat, understand this issue a little better. A lot of people in the country, a lot of people in Congress don't realize that natural gas is not a world price, and when we're putting $11 gas in the ground, that's the highest price for natural gas coming out of the ground anywhere in the world. In South America, it's a buck-something. In Russia, it's a buck something. 
   So our fertilizer, 50 percent of our fertilizer industry has went offshore now. Polymers and plastics are going offshore. Petrochemicals are going offshore. Those are the best blue-collar jobs left in America, and they need natural gas to produce.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Well, maybe 30 years ago when oil was $10 a barrel and natural was $2 a thousand, it was smart to use theirs. But when it's $129 a barrel and $11 for natural gas, I think it's time to produce our own. Americans do not need to be sending all of our resources to these other countries.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Thanks for the time. In a couple, 3 weeks we will have the opportunity to fight to open up offshore production of oil and gas, and that alone I think will take some, if we could pass that, House and Senate, have the President sign it, I think that would take some of the excitement out of the oil market and oil and gas would settle down because everybody feels there's a lot of hype in there because the traders see it keep going up and they keep bidding it up to make money. 
   And so we have Wall Street, you know, 15 to 20 percent of our energy prices might be Wall Street making money. But if you take the risk out, you make sure that we have adequate supply opened up, that takes that away; and I think we could see a settling down of the markets, and we might see some measurable price decreases because if we don't, it's going to be a hot summer and it's going to be a long, cold winter for America.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. In fairness to those countries, they're producing more and more energy, and we have chosen not to produce very much of our own only in the whole entire fields. And yet we pass a bill so we think we can sue them because they're not producing enough? I find that interesting. The bill ought to be that the American public can sue us because we've locked up our resources and forced them to buy foreign expensive energy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (WHAT IS CONGRESS' PLAN FOR AFFORDABLE ENERGY? -- (House of Representatives - October 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about a different subject than you've been hearing about, one that I think should be talked about in the halls of Congress here: What is Congress doing about available, affordable energy for America? 
   I know it's Halloween, but when we find out the price of oil today on the market, we are all going to think it's a Halloween joke. 
   First, I want to show the record of oil prices, of how they have been rising. Now, this doesn't show the spikes up and down all along. These are annual average prices. 
   Just last week I was here speaking and we were at $90. But today I think we're off this chart because at the close of business on Wall Street today, oil was $94.53 a barrel. 
   I don't know about you, but that puts fear in my heart. The winter season is coming. People are going to need to keep their homes heated. People are going to need fuel to drive their cars. The American economy is going to need affordable energy to compete in the global economy. On October 31, 2007, oil closed at $94.53. 
   Now, 6 years ago, it doesn't show it on the chart, but 6 years ago, natural gas was $2 a thousand; now it's $8. Oil was $16. This is a 600 percent increase in oil prices in just 6 years. 
   Is it an issue? It hasn't been mentioned here today. It wasn't mentioned here yesterday. It wasn't debated last week. We are going to have record high home heating oil prices for those heating their homes, record high diesel prices for those who are transporting our goods up and down the highways, and so I guess the fair question is, what is Congress's plan for affordable energy for America? 
   Months ago I was down here on the floor and debated the House bill. The House passed a bill. We'll talk about it later in content. And simultaneously a little later, and the Senate is usually a little behind, they passed a bill. Now, you would think with energy prices spiking to record levels, there would be some sense of urgency in Congress. There would be some sense of urgency to get the Senate bill and the House bill together and get it on the floor to help Americans meet their energy needs. 
   Now, we have had some interesting things happen here. Speaker Pelosi forced the curator, those who run the Capitol here, to switch from coal to gas so we could lessen our carbon imprint. Now, that's going to cost the taxpayers $3 or $4 million because gas is the clean, green fuel and she thought it was better that we heat the Capitol with gas and not coal. Now, what is interesting is it would seem like we should be about conserving. I haven't seen a dollar appropriated to put double-pane windows in all of the Capitol complex. Most of them are single-pane glass. Now, most of us at home have done better than that. My office building, single-pane glass. On a cold winter day it frosts right up. It transmits lots of heat out, lots of heat in. Depending on where the heat is, it goes right through single-pane glass. But wouldn't it make more sense to conserve energy in the Capitol complex and do energy efficient windows and doors? No, we just switched fuels and spent an extra $4 million so our carbon imprint was less. 
   Now, we have also mandated that all government agencies, including ourselves, use those little round fluorescent screw-in light bulbs. I have some at home. My wife doesn't like them. I don't like them if it's a reading light. At least they vary. They are not the same quality of the incandescent bulb we are used to. We're spoiled. But we have mandated those in every appropriations bill this year, and what's disappointing, though, is that they are all made in China. We are mandating that our light bulbs come from China. 
   Now, while we talk about energy, we can talk about why we have such high prices. I want to switch charts here. And here we have a chart of the percentage of imports for America. Now, this chart is a little behind. It actually is almost up to 70 now. Every year we increase dependence on foreign, unstable countries by 2 percent. That's in the last decade. Every year. I think that number is going to increase, and I will explain to you why later, that it may even go up faster. 
   Now, while we are becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, we have countries like China and India, and this is one of the reasons for high energy prices today. We have always been the only big user. We have always been the big dog economically. Well, we're one of the pack now. There are a lot of big dogs out there. China and India's energy use is increasing between 15 and 20 percent a year. They are building a coal plant in China every 5 days. They are opening a new nuclear plant for electricity every month. They are building the largest hydrodams ever known in the world routinely. They are buying up oil and gas reserves and making deals with other countries all over the globe so that China has the energy it needs to run its country. What is America doing? We will talk about that. 
   America does not have an adequate sense of urgency about providing energy for America, affordable energy for America. We passed a bill in 2005 that had a lot of positive incentives. But the problem is when you pass a bill, it's years before you have production of energy. And many of the incentives that were in that bill, many of the things that were helping us produce more energy are now being tried to be rolled back by the Democrat bills that are going to come before us, that have come before us, and will come back before us again in a conference report, and we will talk about that in more detail. 
   What does America want us to do? Well, the Americans I talk to, they want to be able to afford to heat their homes and drive a decent car. They'd like to be able to afford to buy food and other things after they pay their energy bills. 
   Now, these energy bills that have been passed some months ago have been languishing. I haven't heard much discussion. In fact, I haven't heard of a conference committee meeting.     
   It doesn't seem like 3 weeks ago when we had $80 oil; that was enough sense of urgency. It doesn't seem like last week when we had $90 oil; that was enough sense of urgency. And here we are at $94.53 oil, and that doesn't seem like enough sense of urgency. Now, reading the Wall Street Journal today, the article was scary, it said, ``We don't expect oil to stop at 100.'' 
   Now, I expected energy to get expensive this year. I've been predicting it. And I had someone say, How did you know that? And I said, You've just got to be watching what's going on. There's an oil shortage in the world. There is tremendous demand because all the developing countries are now driving cars and have factories and are using energy. And specifically the big ones, like China and India, their economies are growing at record paces, are consuming a lot of energy. And we're going to be competing with them down the road. 
   What scares me, and I'm going to put $94.53 back up here, because that's correct. Here is what's scary about $94.53 oil. We, for the first time in many years, have not had a storm in the gulf. Every time we have a major storm in the gulf, it reduces supply of oil and gas; about 40 percent of our energy comes from the gulf. So when a storm like Katrina or Rita hits the gulf, or even one not as severe as them, it shuts in a lot of oil for weeks and months, and any damage that's done to rigs or refineries or pipelines or processing stations for the gas, it just shuts down capacity. We get a lot less energy after a Katrina. Some of those were not repaired for 9 months to a year, and that energy is just lost. You just don't get it because you have to keep producing every day.  
   Now, we have not had, for the first time in years, a storm in the gulf that has disrupted any amount of supply. That's a record. We always have at least one storm. And we still have a few weeks left, but the season is getting short. We have not had an unstable country. And the fact that's scary with $94.53 oil is that now about 90 percent of the oil in the world, of known reserves, is not owned by companies, but is owned, produced, refined and marketed by dictator, unstable, unfriendly governments. So a majority of the energy in the world is controlled by unfriendly, dictator-type governments. And if one of those tips over and their 3 million barrel a day is disrupted, where will the price go? 
   I asked one of the large energy producers this week in my office, I said, what if we have a storm in the gulf? $120 oil in 2 days, a serious storm. And this company knows because they produce there; they produce about one-third of the gulf. What if a terrorist struck a sending port or a ship or a major pipeline or a major refinery? Where will energy prices be? These are all potentials. 
   And I have been predicting this, and I have energy experts tell me I'm probably not wrong, we will read in the paper one of these days where China has purchased the total supply of some country that normally sold us oil, and that oil will no longer be available to us. 
   And on gasoline, we don't produce enough in this country. We don't have enough refining capacity. Twenty percent of our gasoline comes from Europe because when they switched to diesel, they have excess gasoline capacity, so they sell us gasoline. And this spring, when we had abnormally high gasoline prices, we had 60-some-dollar oil and we had $3 gasoline. And I was shaking my head, what's going on here? That's not normal. But that's what was happening. And so I checked, and here Europe was short on gasoline. They didn't have enough to sell us. And so there was a shortage in the marketplace, and of course Wall Street ran it up, abnormally high prices. 
   Now, today, with $94.53 oil, or more than $90 all week, if that translated into a market gasoline price, we're probably talking somewhere between $3.39 a gallon for gasoline and $3.59 a gallon of gasoline, depending on where you're at in the country. That's a long ways above the $3 price that we're approaching right now. And that's going to come because 80-something-dollar oil will put us at $3.19, $3.29 gasoline; $90 oil is going to push us up into the mid $3. And it's just a matter of time because, at the end of the summer driving season, when we switch the refineries over to make it home heating oil, there was a little surplus of gasoline in the marketplace, and so it has held the price down. And when that burns off and there is none of that left, we will be paying a lot higher prices to drive our cars because the truck people, the fuel oil is already up there. It's already higher, much higher. And home heating oil is much higher. Those who didn't fill their tank early this year for home heating have missed that opportunity because those high prices are already there. 
   The question I ask, I was concerned, and there are those who I've talked with that know a lot more than I felt that $75 oil for any period of time would put America into a recession. Now, that didn't happen, because we've had higher than 75 now for quite a while. What figure can the American economy absorb and not go into recession? All of our recessions have been energy driven, almost all of them. I think maybe there was one that wasn't, one or two. Every time we've had a recession in this country, and they last for years, a lot of people lose their jobs, employment slips, tax revenues are down, the government doesn't have enough money to pay its bills, a lot of Americans are hurting, unemployment rates go up. What figure can America absorb and not have a recession? Well, I don't think we have any wiggle room. I don't personally think we can handle this for a very long period of time. I'm not the expert, but a lot of people agree with me. 
   And I want to tell you, it's almost guaranteed that this is not the ceiling. See, we don't have a spike here because of a Katrina, a country tipping over, or some terrorist attack in the supply line system. Things are kind of going along. Now, there is a lot of instability in the world, but there is always lots of instability in the Middle East, so those little tremors come and go. So, what price can the American economy absorb? I don't think much higher. 
   The other thing that we don't talk about is natural gas prices a lot because people don't realize that natural gas prices are not like oil. This is a world price. Natural gas prices are country by country. And for 6 years now America has had one of the highest natural gas prices in the world, and that puts all of the manufacturers in this country who use it for heat and who use it as an ingredient, and we will talk a little more about that later, are at a tremendous disadvantage because of our continued very high natural gas prices. 
   Yes, it wasn't very long ago, just 6 years, that we had $2 gas and $16 oil, and today, we have $94.53 oil. And our dependency is at 66 and will soon be 70. America should be concerned about that. 
   I remember people talking that, when oil was cheap and gas was cheap, use foreign oil. We will use theirs while it's cheap, and we will use ours when it's expensive. Well, theirs is expensive, but we're not using ours. 
   Here is the map that's interesting. These red circles are areas loaded with natural gas and oil, and they're off limits to production. We're the only country in the world that says our Outer Continental Shelf, that's around the edges, 85 percent of it, is not open to production. Canada produces there, Great Britain produces there, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia. Now those are all environmentally sensitive countries; they all produce there. Norway has become a rich country because of their offshore oil finds. 
   And a lot of people talk about Brazil being energy independent because of ethanol. Ethanol was just a piece of the pie. Brazil also went offshore and produced their energy. America, for 26 years, a combination of Presidential and congressional moratoriums from producing energy on the Outer Continental Shelf, and many parts of the Midwest like this one are locked up, too. And the legislation that's coming before us will lock it up some more. 
   Now, I don't understand that. I don't understand where a six-inch hole in the ground with a steel casing producing oil or gas, and specifically clean natural gas, is a threat to our environment. All the studies show that offshore, the majority of the oil that's found is from leakage of ships or natural seeps, because when oil is under high pressure underground, it will find its way to the surface. In fact, I come from Titusville, Pennsylvania, the home of the first oil well, Drake Well. We're all very proud of that. It changed the world, it started the Industrial Revolution. It started the new transportation system. Oil that was transportable, refinable, and it developed this country into the power it is today. 
   And it has the potential today of making us a second-rate nation because we refuse to use our own energy and we're forcing ourselves to purchase from unstable, undependable countries around the world. And their $95 oil, they're going to own us. 
   We just heard people talking here about them buying our debt. Yeah. Because we're spending so much of our resources purchasing energy that we have, but we've locked it up. I just find it amazing. 
   Now we're going to look at the legislation that should be coming, but there doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency. This is sort of a compilation of the energy bills that have passed both the House and the Senate and have not been conferenced on. 
   Now, first what we're going to talk about is it locks up 9 trillion cubic feet of American natural gas. It cuts off production from the Roan Plateau, a huge clean natural gas field in Colorado that was set aside as a national oil reserve in 1912 because of its rich energy resources for our future. This means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas the OCS bill that passed last Congress was put off limits. 
   Roan Plateau has already gone through NEPA. That's the environmental assessment that says it's safe to do it, all done. It is ready for lease sale. The provision was not in the original bill when it came out of the  Resource Committee, but was added almost with no debate, no hearings, and no real serious discussion. Make sense? No. 
   The next part here locks up 18 percent of our Federal onshore production of American natural gas. It cuts the categoric exclusion provision. And I will explain that a little in my terms. I helped put that in in the 2005 energy bill. 
   Redundant NEPAs allowed the anti-energy people from allowing the Americans to produce energy. So, land would be leased in the West, mostly in the West, and 5 or 6 years later, after they purchased the rights to it, they still weren't producing it because they were required to do multiple NEPAs. They do a NEPA on the original plan. Then they have to do a NEPA for the road plan. Then they have to do a NEPA for every site. And then for putting in the production equipment, another NEPA. So year after year after year, a NEPA study takes about a year. So years later, they still didn't have any production. 
   And so we said that one NEPA that covers all the aspects of producing energy in that area should be done, and that should pass the test. And we shouldn't do redundant NEPAs. But now they want to go back. 
   It locks up, this is huge, the third one, 2 trillion barrels of American oil from western oil shale. Now, western oil shale, everybody knows, is a huge oil reserve, and the underground can be tricky. We have oil companies on some of the private land they own there trying to release this, and they think they have a way to do it. It is somewhat similar to the Canadian tar sands. The Canadian tar sands have been around since I was a kid. In fact, I have a neighbor who bought rights to them many, many years ago, and he's now laughing because everybody wants to buy them at huge prices. And I don't know whether he has sold them yet or not, but I was kind of stunned that he was smart enough 30, 40 years ago to buy tar sands in Canada as an investment. And today they're producing 1.5 million barrels a day there. It's just over the American border into Canada. And their goal is to be up to 4 to 5 million barrels a day down the road. And fortunately for America, most of that's coming here. Our biggest supplier of energy is Canada, our good friend. 
   Now, Canadians are a little frustrated with us because they produce their energy resources. They're offshore, they're onshore, they're tar sands, and we keep locking ours up. Thus, North America has the highest natural gas prices because of us. If we produced equal to Canada, North America would have reasonable natural gas prices, not the highest in the world. But they keep selling to us. 
   Now, this 2 trillion, this bill stops the leasing program for oil shale reserves on Federal lands that will hold enough oil to supply us for 228 years. Now, that's a study. If it's half that, if it's a third of that, it's huge, and it could eliminate our dependence on, and that's the only reserve that I know of, that if we learn how to release it, could eliminate our foreign dependence on energy. But that's the only way.     
   But that is the only way. This is more oil than the entire world has used since oil was discovered at Drake well in my district 150 years ago. Meanwhile, in China, they are busily developing their oil shale fields. 
   The next one here locks up 10 million barrels of oil from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. That is, again, an area that was set aside for production, set aside in 1923 for production of future energy needs in America. Then the next one breaches legitimate legal offshore energy contracts, and I have had several of those companies come in to me and say, hey, this is a contract. If Congress changes that, we are going to win in the Supreme Court because Congress doesn't have the right. I am not saying I agree with these leases and how they were done. They were done in the Clinton administration, but we have this legislation coming that is going to override those. It won't work. It will just delay the process. I am hoping that we can continue to negotiate these leases and have them out of the way. 
   The next one is really foolhardy. There are a lot of Members of Congress who hate oil companies. This inflicts a $15 billion tax increase on the American oil and gas industry. Seventy-five to 80 percent of the energy in this country is not produced by Big Oil. It is produced by little companies. I have two refineries in my district who will now pay a higher tax than any other company in Pennsylvania if this bill becomes law because we are going to tax the production of energy with an added tax over any other business. 
   Now, when you are short on something, and the prices are high, if you want to get less of it and make the prices higher, the sure remedy is to tax it. Well, they are going to tax it. I am not going to, but they are going to tax it. 
   Now, the next one down here, I am a big proponent of offshore drilling, and I will talk about that later, but I am also a big proponent of using coal, to gasify it, to make electricity, and that is called clean coal, and make liquids out of it. Penn State has a process to make jet fuel out of coal. The Air Force is in the process of trying to figure out how to have 60 percent of their jet fuel available from nonimport sources. They are working with natural gas right now. They are doing other studies, too, but they are working with natural gas now. If they are successful, and they get 60 percent of their 3 billion gallon a day, they are going to inflate gas prices even more, which will make it harder to heat our homes. I will talk more about that later. But coal to liquids should be getting the same treatment as cellulytic ethanol. I am for cellulytic ethanol, and this administration is funding six plants. It is still in the test tube. We are still working at it in the university laboratories, but I am for building those plants and streamlining this process. I think one plant is going to try to make it out of garbage, another switchgrass, another cornstalks, another one is woody biomass, but we need to be doing all those things. But to be not having an equal emphasis on coal to liquids, I fault this administration, and I fault this Congress. Because that is the largest energy source we have. We need to figure out how to use it cleanly. We need to be developing, and again, curtail our dependence on foreign countries. 
   Now, we also have in the legislation a false expectation by mandating a 15 percent of renewables to make electricity. I wish that were doable. I would vote for it if it was. I didn't vote for that. I voted against that amendment. I fought against that amendment. We currently make 3 percent of electricity with renewables because they will not count hydro, only the new hydro, and there is not much new hydro coming down the line. So to go from 3 percent, they are going to allow cost savings of 4 percent, so that gets us to 7, but the growth of wind and solar is nowhere near enough in the next decade or two to get us to 15 percent. 
   Now, what we are going to do is we are going to force those companies to pay fines. Do you know who is going to pay the fines? The electric rate users. Some States will come close because they have a lot of wind, and there are States that have solar. But most States will not. It should be an incentive-type program. It should be a carrot, not a stick. We should be incentivizing renewables for electricity. But when you mandate 15 percent, and I have charts and graphs to show that. I don't have them with me tonight. But there is no way to get there in the time frame they are asking. 
   I am going to change charts here and talk just a little bit about current energy use in America. These don't change a lot. I have been watching them for a long time. Currently, petroleum is 40 percent of our energy needs, and 66 percent of it comes from foreign, unstable countries. That number is going to escalate if we lock up the Roan Plateau. It is going to escalate if we lock up shale oil. It is going to escalate if we tax energy production and make it more expensive. Natural gas is 23. Now, this is a growing figure. It is interesting because about 12 or 13 years ago now, Congress removed the prohibition of making electricity with gas. That is when gas ceased to be cheap. We have always had $1.80, $2 gas, and it would go up a little, down a little, maybe up to $3 a year, $3- 1/2 or $4. I remember some of those years in the seventies when it was a lot more costly to heat our homes. But it would come  back to $2 or $1.80. It never went much above $2. Now, it is way above. It is $8 and something right now, and we are still not into the high season. The average price for the year is somewhere between 9 and 10, and then when you get transmission costs and storage costs, we, as consumers, are going to be paying $13, $14, $15 for gas. 
   I believe that clean, green natural gas is really our best hope. But we have to drill for it. And people in this Congress are just as much against drilling a gas well as they are against drilling an oil well. And I think they are wrong on both. But there is no good argument. There has never been a beach dirtied by a gas well. There has never been an environmental threat by a gas well. It is the cleanest fuel we have. There is no NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, and a third of the CO 
   2 if that is keeping you awake at night. 
   Now, coal is 23 percent. Coal has great potential for liquid or gas. But there is a real push around here against coal. I think it is a mistake. It is the one we have the most of. If we continue that, gas will be the winner, and gas prices will continue to rise. And if we continue to have the highest gas prices in the would, we just won't be a competitive country. Nuclear is at 8 percent. From the 2005 bill, we have a lot of companies going in for permits now. We need all 35 that are starting the process to be completed in a very short period of time if we don't want this figure to go down, because the energy electric use in this country is rising fast and nuclear is about 20 percent of it. But that figure will drop because nuclear has not grown. We haven't built a nuclear plant in a long time. The interesting part is, as we attempt to build nuclear plants, the shroud, which is the big steel casing that they use, we don't make them in America. The companies that are that far along in the permit process are buying them from Japan. I find that unfortunate, and someone told me an awful lot of the components are going to be purchased in Germany because we don't have the capacity because we have done so little with nuclear in the last decade. 
   Hydroelectric, a figure that continues to decline. Biomass is the fastest growing figure. That is wood waste. A lot of it is being used. There's a million Americans heating their homes with pellet stoves. That is compressed wood waste. We have power plants that are using it to top the coal load so that they can slide under the environmental standards because it burns a lot cleaner than coal. We have a lot of companies in the wood business and around where there is wood waste using it to heat their factories. Most of the dry kilns drying wood are now biomass burners. So biomass has just been sort of growing on its own because sawdust used to be a commodity. I remember in Pennsylvania when I was in State government, they were trying to make it a hazardous waste. I fought that because it is not a hazardous waste. And now it's a commodity that sells. People want it. 
   Geothermal, a nice way to heat your homes if you are not in zero climate. In a mild climate, it is a good exchange of using underground water, whether you have a loop system where you have a big piping system with water or whether you drill into the aquifers and use that water, you take heat out of it in the wintertime to warm your home, and you take cold out of it in the summertime to cool your home. But, again, it is an investment up front. I know people who have it. If they build a second home, they usually put it in unless they are in a high zero where there is a lot of cold weather. It has its limitations when the weather is zero. 
   Wind and solar, this is the part that I find scary. Too many Americans think that wind and solar are prepared to become major energy sources. You can see the numbers, 0.06, 0.12. If we double those numbers, they are still a pretty small fraction, and it will take years to do that. But, unfortunately, an awful lot of Americans want this group right here to be our major energy source. I wish there was a way to do that. There are an awful lot of Members of Congress who think petroleum, gas and coal are just evil and we shouldn't do any more production of it, and they won't vote for a bill to lease land. They won't vote for a bill to open up areas. Some of them are against nuclear. Some aren't. That is a mixed bag. But, folks, this is the major part of America's energy production. It is 94 percent of our energy production, nuclear, coal, gas and petroleum. And it will be a major part of our energy portfolio for a long time whether we like it or not because none of these are prepared to take over. I wish they were. 
   Now, there's a lot of creative things. But they are little niche players. They are little niche markets. They are not huge volumes. So it is important that Americans understand that whether we like it or not, fossil fuels are going to be our major energy source a lot longer than we want them. If we continue to not produce our own, then we are going to have to buy them from foreign countries. 
   Now, I want to talk about natural gas a little bit. This is America's gem. We have lots of natural gas. And I find it astounding that so many Members of Congress and three administrations in a row have locked up our Outer Continental Shelf, which has huge reserves of clean, green natural gas. I don't understand it. I don't know what they are thinking about. I don't know what their hopes are or dreams are, because, folks, we can't afford to continue to do that. Natural gas is a far more bigger part of our life than most people realize. Now, you see all of these products here. They are all made with natural gas. Not only as a heat source, but as an ingredient. Somewhere here you will find soaps and skin lotions and skin softeners. Yes, ladies, the skin softeners that you love and we all like that keep our skin soft are a direct derivative of natural gas stock. Polyurethane, plastics, petrochemicals, fertilizer, all made, fertilizer that we grow corn with to produce ethanol, 70 percent of the cost is natural gas. It is the reason in how we make all of these products. And yet we lock it up and treat it like it is something evil. I just plain don't understand that. 
   We have a bill that opens up the Outer Continental Shelf. Now, we are only doing it for natural gas. I think it should be for both because every other part of the world produces both. But I have not been able to get natural gas here. Now, we passed a good bill last session in the House that opened up gas and oil both. But we didn't get any action in the Senate. So we are going at it cautiously this time, just natural gas. This bill is very States' rights oriented. We will lock up the first 25 miles, can't produce it, that is out of sight. Eleven miles is sight line. The second 25 miles, States have a right to open up if they want to just by passing a State law. We will repeal the moratorium, but it doesn't repeal unless the States pass a bill. Now, the second 50 miles will be open unless the State passes a law and this gives States rights for 100 miles to close it. Now, this is much more conservative than I would like, but we are trying to get some natural gas for America to stop a calamity of starving our industry and our homeowners from affordable natural gas. Now, the second 100 miles would be open, period.     
   Those who produce natural gas say this would help immensely because clean, green natural gas can be our bridge to renewables. To make ethanol, we use a huge amount of natural gas. If we go to a hydrogen society, the only good way right now of making hydrogen quickly is natural gas. Natural gas is used to make biodiesel. Natural gas heats 50 some percent of our homes; 58 percent, I believe. It runs our major industries. It's the major feedstock for the polymers and plastic and fertilizer and petrochemical. We use huge amounts of it to make bricks and glass and steel and aluminum and to bend metal and to treat products, heat-treat things. 
   In my district, we have the powdered metal industry. They use huge amounts of natural gas to make that new powdered metal product that has brought the price of cars and vehicles and all kinds of moving parts down because it's so much less expensive than the old machining and forging of parts. Powdered metals. But they heat treat it with clean, green natural gas. 
   Natural gas is the fuel that should bridge us to where some kind of new energy, whether when we learn how to release hydrogen from water and then learn how to transport hydrogen safely, it takes years to develop all of the facets of an industry so that it becomes  our stable fuel source of the future. We need to be doing everything we can do in America for renewables. But we need to have adequate fossil fuels, and, specifically, natural gas. 
   Now, my bill rewards some people. The States would get up to $150 billion in royalties because States would get 30 some percent. There would be $100 billion left over in the Treasury of money we wouldn't have to pay in taxes because we could get the royalty off the gas, not oil. Now we have some cleanup funds here that I think are pretty unique: $32 billion for renewable energy research. That is real money to allow us to develop the fuels of the future. We have $32 billion for carbon capture and sequestration research so we can learn how to take the CO  
   2 from coal plants and the CO 
   2 from any fuel we burn and utilize it somehow, or sequester it. We have $20 billion to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, exactly what they need; $20 billion for the Great Lakes restoration, exactly what their program needs; $12 billion for the Everglades restoration; $12 billion for the Colorado River basin restoration; $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay restoration; and $10 million for LIHEAP and weatherization to help the poorest among us make their homes energy efficient and make energy affordable by helping pay their energy bills. 
   America is at a crossroads. We have been the big giant of a Nation, the powerful Nation all of our lifetimes. You know, it makes me sad to think that this Congress and administrations were unwilling to in totality agree and deal with the energy issue, making sure that America has available, affordable energy. Folks, that's doable. 
   I know there are people who talk on this floor about energy independence. That is really not doable. The only way we can be energy independent is if we got oil from the shale rock in large quantities over a period of time and where we no longer had to import oil. We import 17 percent of our natural gas today. If we opened up the gas field, we wouldn't need to import any. We would have lots of gas. 
   This is an interesting point about natural gas. We could fuel a third of our auto fleet. One of the problems with using gas in a vehicle is you can't go as far. You can't put a big enough tank in there. But we have lots of vehicles that don't go anywhere. We have all the service vehicles that are out servicing our homes, whether they are heating contractors or air conditioning contractors or lawn services, they could fuel up every night. In fact, they are developing ways you can fuel up from your gas line in your house if you have gas in your home. They are working on a way to fuel a car. 
   Every construction vehicle could be on natural gas because they already are fueled by a truck that comes up to the construction site and fills up the tractors and fills up the Caterpillars and all the heavy equipment and the trucks. Every taxicab could be on natural gas because they don't go big distances. Every school bus, every local person who doesn't drive a long distance could fuel their vehicle with clean, green natural gas. 
   If we opened up the gas fields that are really available to us, it could be a whole lot cheaper than oil. A whole lot cheaper and a whole lot cleaner. No knocks, a third of the CO  
   2. I don't understand why we haven't embraced natural gas as our bridge fuel to the future, as I said previously. 
   But, folks, America better think very seriously in the weeks ahead. We don't have a long time to wait. Energy prices are going to continue to skyrocket because we are competing the whole world for the energy because we are buying it from them. If we produced our own, we don't have to worry about that. 
   I understand the complacency when it was $2 for gas and $10 for oil and it was so cheap. But, folks, it's not cheap today and it is never going to be cheap again. Now we do need to use less, we do need to conserve, we do need to keep continuing to research how to produce things with less fuel, heat our homes more efficiently, make them more energy efficient. We, in the meantime, need a strong, viable source of energy for America, and clean green, natural gas is the bridge to our future. 
   I hope and pray that this Congress will suddenly get a sense of urgency about the energy problems in this country. 
   Mr. Speaker, $94.53 oil should scare us into movement. We should have fear in our hearts, because this isn't the ceiling, as I started out at the beginning. There is no storm in the Gulf, no countries tipped over, no terrorist threat that has taken out supply. If they all happened simultaneously, only God knows what energy would be. It is imperative. Congress is the reason we have high energy prices, because they have locked it up. 
   There is also a lot in Alaska. There are huge reserves in Alaska that are not shown on this map. Congress has locked up this energy and three administrations have supported the moratorium for twenty-six years. 
   We are the only country in the world to lock up our own resources and force ourselves to buy from unstable countries who will own us. They are going to have the resources to literally buy every good, profitable business in this country. They are going to buy whatever they want to, because we are going to be forced to sell it to them, because when you are paying $95.43 for a barrel of oil that it costs them a dollar or two to lift in their country, they have nothing but riches. 
   Americans are going to have nothing but tragic situations, where our businesses can no longer afford to be here. We won't manufacture anything in this country of substance, and Americans will struggle to heat their homes and afford to travel around this beautiful land. 
   Energy affordability, available, affordable energy for America, should be the cry of this Congress. And if this Congress doesn't do that, if the energy bills when they come out that the House and Senate have now are not altered and talk about opening up energy, about increasing supply, that is the only thing that brings down prices. 
   Folks, we need to conserve, but we can't conserve our way out of this problem. As a country, we are demanding more energy every day as we grow, as our number of people grow, as the number of people that drive cars grows, as our population grows. 
   Folks, available, affordable energy is the issue that can bring this great country down to where it is a second-rate nation. I don't want that to happen, and I hope Americans will push their Congress Members into making available, affordable energy the number one issue in this Congress before we adjourn the 110th Congress, and that we deal with this issue, because we can deal with it. 
   This is an issue we can change. It won't change quickly, but we can make a lot of right moves. We can deal with all of the different forms of energy. We can open up supply for gas and oil. We can do coal-to-liquids, coal-to-gas. We can give nuclear another push. We can promote all the renewables and look for new transportation fuels to blend with our current fuels. 
   Ethanol has potential. Corn ethanol has limited potential, but there are problems with it. The biggest problem with ethanol, and I am not against it because it is made out of American products, but it is competing with our food supply. And ethanol does not go in the pipeline. The majority of our gas stations deliver by pipelines, and you can't put it in the pipeline. Already, with the ethanol plants we have, we have distribution problems, because you need a blending station to blend it and then need to haul it by truck or trailer. That is a system not in place adequately around the country. 
   We have as many ethanol plants under construction as we have producing ethanol today. I am not saying that is bad, but it is not a situation without problems and great challenges. Ethanol takes a tremendous amount of natural gas to make it. In Pennsylvania they are talking of doing a couple plants with coal. Many States would reject that. I commend the Pennsylvania government for going in that direction, using waste coal to make it so it doesn't further strain our natural gas supply. 
   But as we look at this map and think about Alaska, America can be far more self-sufficient with available, affordable energy if we just have the desire and the willingness to produce more of our own. I believe we must if we want to compete in the global economy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky, Ranking Member Rogers, for yielding time and for the leadership he and Chairman Price have given this committee. It has been a pleasure to serve. 
   I rise today to speak about an issue of vital importance to me, the infrastructure protection and our energy delivery system protection.  
   This bill has $532 million to protect the infrastructure of this country. Our transportation system has been a very high focus because that is how we were attacked, the use of our transportation system. But in my view, the vulnerability of America is very much its infrastructure on energy. We lack oil refineries and cannot afford to have any refineries offline from a terrorist attack. We now import 13 percent of our gasoline from foreign countries and often have to bid for it when it's in the ship. 
   Our natural gas system is struggling to furnish adequate and affordable natural gas for us to heat our homes and run our businesses because we are using huge amounts of it now to generate electricity. We are using large amounts of it now to make ethanol because it is a fuel. Ninety-six percent of all the new ethanol plants use natural gas. 
   We are finding that natural gas is the mother's milk of this country, and any disruption in our pipeline system, because we are not able to produce adequate amounts of natural gas without any disruption in the current delivery system. 
   Our electric grid, in my view, we were short on generating capacity; that has been beefed up because we have built a lot of natural gas electric generators. But we have not adequately invested, or in some cases have not been able to build the grid that connects our country. We need to have all of our country criss-crossed with a stronger grid, so that if any portion of it goes down, another portion, we can come in the back door with electricity. 
   Our dependence on electricity and our use of electricity is growing every day. And in my view, with wind and solar slowly coming online, those are often in areas that we don't have a good hookup to the grid, and we need to build transmission lines to bring that capacity to the system. 
   I believe the Department of Homeland Security must be more stringently identified as a priority within the Department of Homeland Security. I have said throughout the process of marking up this bill that the vulnerabilities of our electric grid, our pipeline system and our refinery system need to be a higher priority. I am thankful for the language that was accepted in this bill to require the Department of Homeland Security, with input from the Department of Energy, to provide a report on the most critical capacity limit segments of the North American electricity transmission and distribution network. And we probably ought to be doing the same for all of our other energy infrastructures. 
   It is critical that we identify these segments and also identify if disruption of any of these segments would generate a cascading affect that could cripple the economy of our country. It is vital that we protect our energy infrastructure. 
   I want to thank Mr. Rogers and Mr. Price for their dedication on this bill and their willingness to work with me on what I believe are the vulnerabilities that need to be beefed up to make sure this country has the energy it needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (MANAGING PUBLIC LANDS -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Yes. Natural gas, I call it America's clean, green energy, no NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, a third of the CO 
   2. It's almost the perfect fuel. Now, a lot of people don't realize what all we do with natural gas, but natural gas is the basic ingredient of many of our products, polymers, plastics, petrochemical. Everything we manufacture has some form of natural gas in it or we have used natural gas to do it. 
   Natural gas is America's hope for the future. I call it the bridge fuel. 
   Now, just a few years ago, in fact, 6 years ago, we had $2 natural gas, and we had $16 oil. Just 6 years later we now have $7 natural gas, but we haven't had a storm in the gulf yet, we haven't started our winter heating yet. We know those prices will skyrocket much higher. 
   Well, it amazes me. I am going to speak a little bit about oil. $87.50 was the price of oil, that it just closed at. Not a crisis in this Congress. I haven't heard any rustling of activity. We have a Senate bill and a House bill not conferenced on yet. I haven't seen where the House and the Senate have agreed to have their conference committee and move forward with their bill. 
   Now, maybe it's a good thing they don't, because let's just look at it. With the natural gas prices we have today, highest in the world, here is what their bill does. Their bill locks up 9 trillion feet of natural gas in the Roan Plateau. The Roan Plateau is a huge, clean natural gas field in Colorado that was once set aside as the Naval Oil Shale Reserve in 1912 because of its rich energy resources. That means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas from the OCS bill that passed last Congress in the gulf, will be put off-limits. 
   The Roan Plateau is ready to go. It has already gone through NEPA. It's ready for lease sale. This provision was not in the original Resources Committee bill and was added without any hearings in the 11th hour. That's the kind of legislation this Congress is putting forth to cause natural gas prices to continue to increase, locks up 18 percent more by policy changes. 
   I had some amendments in the energy bill in 2005. This guts the categoric exclusions if we stop allowing redundant NEPAs to stop the process. We had leases in the West where they had leased the land for oil and gas production, and 5, 6 and 7 years later, they are doing redundant NEPAs. 
   They had to do a NEPA for the whole layout. Then they had to do a NEPA for the road construction. Then they had to do a NEPA for every location. A NEPA study takes about a year. There is no reason that an overall NEPA on  the project couldn't cover all those aspects in a year's time and make sure we do it right. No, we are 
   going to take away that, and that will lock up more natural gas. Of course, we just heard from our friend about the 2 trillion barrels of oil from western oil shale. 
   Well, it's similar to tar sands in Canada. Everybody thought that wasn't a good thing. Well, they are now producing 1.5 million barrels a day. Their goal is 4 million a day. They are increasing every month, because they figured out how to release the tar sand oil, and we need to be working at releasing the oil shale oil because we have trillions of barrels there. 
   Should we have policy? Should we have legislation going that's going to take oil and gas? Then we go on down here a little further, we are going to have a $15 billion tax increase on the production of energy and the processing of it. Does that make sense? That means it is going to cost American taxpayers $15 billion more for energy somewhere down the road. Should we be taxing the production of oil and gas? I don't think so. 
   There is nothing in the bills before us about coal-to-liquids. We are the Saudi Arabia of coal. It's a tragedy in America that we are not moving forward with coal-to-liquid and coal-to-gas, because, you know, today we are 66 percent dependent on foreign oil, and we are growing 2 percent a year, and we have $87.50, today's closing price. We hit $90 a few days ago. And just 6 years ago, it was $16. How much can the American economy absorb without a recession? 
   I was told by someone from the Department of State that they thought $75 oil for any length of time would put America in a recession. It didn't. What some figure is a figure that the American economy can no longer absorb. Now we are approaching the heating season. Sixty-two percent of Americans heat their homes with natural gas. 
   What do we have? We have it locked up. These are all areas that are locked up. Clean, green natural gas. A natural gas well has never contaminated a beach. It has never really done major environmental harm. But, no, America has a policy that we are not going to use the cleanest, greenest fossil fuel there is, natural gas. We're just not going to produce it. 
   I don't understand that, but that's where we are, folks. High gas and high oil prices are because this Congress, not just this current Congress, but historically, 26 years ago Presidents and Congress locked up the outer continental shelf. We are the only country in the world not to produce it, the only country in the world not to produce. 
   This is the greatest energy reserves we have. Eleven miles offshore you don't even know they are there. You don't see it. I have legislation that says the first 25 miles will not even be open for drilling. The second 25 miles would be controlled by the State. The second 50 miles would be open, but States would still have the right to pass a bill to not produce if they don't want to. That gives States rights. Then the second 100 miles would be open. 
   Folks, when we make these decisions to open these up, when we make the decisions to make any major coal-to-liquid, coal-to-gas, when we make decisions to reopen nuclear and get it moving again, you are talking 8 to 10 years before you have any energy. 
   America is in a crisis today. I think $87.50 oil is a crisis. We have $7 gas, and we know it's going to spike as soon as we start using our winter supply. When American homeowners find out the price of home heating oil, they are going to be pretty angry at Congress, and they ought to be. 
   Now, the gas prices that are out today, I heard the gentleman say $3.09. In my State it's $2.89. But gasoline prices have not caught up with $80 oil. $80 oil means $3.29, $3.39 gasoline. There is still a glut of gasoline in the marketplace. This spring we had $3 something gasoline with $60 oil because there was a shortage of gasoline in the world. 
   We buy 20 percent of our gasoline now from Europe. We don't produce enough in this country. Europe didn't have any to sell us because they were using more than normal. There was a world shortage and so our price was much higher than it ought to have been, because it's a separate marketplace. 
   Now, just wait till gasoline catches up, the summer fuel burns off. Our refineries are now making home heating oil, and those on home heating oil are going to pay a tremendous price because there is none of that in the system. Those heating with propane are going to pay a much higher price. Those heating with natural gas are going to pay 10 to 15 percent more. Home heating this winter is going to be very expensive. 
   Do you know who even feels the pain worse, small businesses who use a lot of energy. There are no programs to help them. There is no LIHEAP funding to help them.     
   Small businesses in America are going to struggle to make a profit because of energy prices. And natural gas, being one of the highest prices in the world, and we have lots of countries with very cheap natural gas, we're going to continue to export petrochemical jobs, polymer and plastic jobs, fertilizer. You know, here we're using ethanol now, it's big. We have to grow a lot of corn to make ethanol. We have to use a lot of fertilizer. Seventy percent of the cost of fertilizer is natural gas. If we make a hydrogen car, it's going to use natural gas. Natural gas is the feedstock for most of our manufacturing. It's what we heat our homes with. 
   We need energy policy here in Congress. We don't want a bill that takes energy away from Americans. This bill takes energy away from Americans. This bill makes energy more expensive. The bill before us does nothing to produce energy and to bring down gasoline prices, to bring down home heating prices and to keep American jobs here. And there's no reason that America cannot be in charge of its future destiny with natural gas. 
   We can't control the oil market. We can control our natural gas market. We can be self-dependent. We now import 17 percent of our natural gas. We wouldn't have to import any of it. America is rich in natural gas, the clean, green fuel. 
   And I impose this Congress, natural gas could actually fuel a third of the auto fleet. It would save a lot more than CAFE standards. And I'm for better CAFE standards. But it would immediately take all construction vehicles, school buses, taxicabs could all be on natural gas. That's a known technology. It's just a conversion. 
   Folks, clean natural gas is what America needs to be about as we build our renewable future. All the renewables are built off of natural gas. Natural gas is the feedstock. Folks, we need clean, natural gas so Americans can afford to heat their homes and can afford to drive their cars.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to thank all the Members of this body for participating. Those of you that have been down here for hours, I want to thank you. I want to thank my friend Mr. Abercrombie from Hawaii, who has worked at my side for half a decade, bipartisanly, to try to figure out how we can make America energy independent and open up the resources that we have. 
   How can the most powerful country in the world allow itself to be in a position where its energy prices depend on three things that they have no control over? We just faced one, and we dodged a bullet again from major damage; storms in the gulf. They happen most years. It will depend on that whether we have available affordable energy. 
   The stability of the 13 largest oil companies in the world, all bigger than Exxon, unstable countries, non-democracies who have governments that tip over often. And if any one of them tips and produces two or three million barrels less oil, there is a shortage of oil in the world.  
   And then we have been lucky that terrorists have not yet attacked our energy system. It is so vulnerable. 
   How did we let ourselves get there? Well, most of our lifetime, in fairness to the former Congresses, energy was cheap, $2 gas and $10 oil. A spike in the seventies, a spike in the eighties, a spike in the nineties. We tried alternatives, but they didn't work, because cheap oil ran them out of the market. 
   Folks, cheap oil is gone. Cheap natural gas is over. We are in a new era. We are sharing energy now with a whole part of the world that didn't use it before. We will soon not be the biggest user of energy. 
   Twenty-eight years ago, we decided it was better to use theirs, not ours. We started locking up our Outer Continental Shelf. A few years later we tried to open ANWR when it was starting to get a little tighter, and a President vetoed it. About the same time, they set one of the largest coal reserves in America, I believe it was in the State of Utah, aside, as if it wasn't important, millions of acres. 
   More recently, in legislation that slipped through and got signed, unfortunately, we locked up shale oil, the big new field that has awesome potential. 
   And the one that stuns me, the fastest growing renewable, and I haven't heard anybody mention it here, woody biomass, 3.6 percent now. Woody biomass. Pellet stoves, wood waste for boilers, and we are hoping to do cellulosic ethanol from it. We have legislation that says wood waste from our Federal lands can't be used. 
   Tar sand oil, the new oil from Canada that we have built our refineries to use, we have legislation that is going to made it difficult to get that. 
   Every year since I have been here we have become 2 percent more dependent on foreign oil, and we will again next year. Unfortunately, this legislation locks up 97 percent of the west coast energy availability. It removes the part of the eastern gulf that is the most easy to obtain, close to where we are producing today, where the infrastructure is there and we can do it quickly. On the east coast, most of the energy is between 25 and 50 miles out, and it is locked up. 
   Then I guess the part that bothers me, I was a State legislator before I came here, we are kicking the ball to the State legislatures. It is Congress' role to provide energy for America. We are saying to State legislators, vote to open up. We are not going to give you royalties. There is no win in it for you, but you be statesmen. You take on that environmental lobby and you open that land up, because we won't. 
   Yes, prior to this bill, the ANWR Interior bill was available, and for the last number of years I forced many of you, and some of you groaned, to vote on whether we continued the moratorium. 
   Fourteen Congresses and three Presidents have not adequately valued energy availability for America. There is lots of blame to go around. Let's stop blaming each other here. 
   Who are the losers? The working people of America, Mary and Joe, retired seniors, living in a family homestead, struggling to have money for their automobile fuel and going to try to heat that big old home this year. Last year they kept it at 58. They don't know what they are going to do this year. 
   Jim and Nicole with three children. They have an eight-year-old vehicle and a modest older home. They kept their home at 60 raising kids, and they don't know how they are going to do it, because their bills are going to be much higher this year. 
   Then Margie, a single mom with a teenage daughter and a teenage son. She drives 40 miles to work one way, that is 400 miles a week. That is really stretching her budget with these gas prices. Her gas bill has gone from $175 to $220 to $230. She has no idea how she is going to pay it. 
   The small businesses that employ the bulk of our friends and neighbors are struggling to pay their energy bill. 
   Folks, we need to deal with this energy issue, and we need to deal with it bipartisanly and get cost-effective energy for this country.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
   I want to thank the leadership on both sides. I want to thank all of the Members for the opportunity tonight to offer America the first bipartisan energy bill that may have been offered in this century written by Republicans and Democrats in a room with just cold sandwiches night after night, working with no lobbyists, no power brokers, trying to come together like the American people want us to. They want affordable, available energy as soon as we can get it, and they want it ongoingly, and they deserve it. 
   We're the most powerful Nation in the world, and it's unfair to the American public that their future depends on weather in the gulf, that their future depends on unstable countries that provide us half of our imported oil. We get half of the 70 percent we import from friends and half of it from unstable nations. The American people are not comfortable with that. They want better. 
   And the American people know that our energy system could be sabotaged each and every day by the terrorists because there is no slop in the system, there's no surplus, there's no extra. There's just enough oil to meet the oil demand each day, and whenever anything goes wrong, the prices skyrocket. 
   Folks, we have the chance here to reevaluate our policies. I understand many years ago when we set it aside, it was cheap: $2 gas, $10 oil, use theirs, save ours. Folks, that day is gone. We need to now reassess where we're at. We need to be energy independent in this country, and we need to start down that long road. It won't be easy, and it needs to be a broad-based plan. 
   Our bill opens up the Outer Continental Shelf. It takes away all the prohibitions that have been put upon the Department of the Interior for leasing land. It repeals the prohibition of preventing Federal agencies from entering into contracts for procurement of alternative and synthetic fuels. It repeals limitation on the number of new qualified hybrid and advanced clean-burn technology vehicles eligible for the alternative vehicle tax benefits. That's electric and gas cars. 
   It allows the use of woody biomass, the fastest growing renewable we have that's fueling pellet stoves and factories with wood waste and will be part of cellulosic ethanol as we move from corn to cellulose, prohibited today by law from using off of Federal land, wood waste. Removes that. 
   Folks, it removes the prohibition on shale oil, the biggest oil opportunity this country has ever had. And folks, it takes the revenues and funds the renewables better than they've ever been funded. It funds conservation better than it's ever been funded. It funds clean-up efforts, environmental clean-up efforts. It funds carbon sequestration with large amounts of money. 
   And let me read you that paragraph which I think is vital: ``The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Reserve offsets the cost of legislation enacted after the date of the enactment of the National Conservation, Environment and Energy Independence Act to promote research and development projects associated with carbon capture and storage in the production of liquid transportation fuels, electricity, synthetic natural gas, chemical feedstock and for the disposition and recycling/reprocessing of nuclear waste from nuclear power plants.'' 
   It will fund LIHEAP for those who are not going to be able to afford their heating this winter.  
   Folks, this is not a perfect bill, but it's a damn good start, and it was put together by no interest groups, no corporations got involved, no environmental radical groups. None of them were at the table.     
   It was just Members of Congress who felt the needs of their districts and realized the plea of the people to give us available, affordable energy. We're the most powerful Nation. Why are we not doing that? Just recently, Russia bought a coal plant in Pennsylvania. You're going to find China buying energy plants in this country. They're building plants everywhere. They're preparing for their future while we've been sitting on our hands, bickering and bipartisanly fighting with each other. 
   I ask the Members of both conferences to support this act that will give America energy in the future that's affordable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. 
   America is in a crisis for affordable, available energy. Our folks back home want us to sit down and figure out how to have available, affordable energy. Four hundred Members of Congress, including me, who have been involved in this debate for years, this morning found out there is a 290-page bill that we are going to vote on today with no amendments. 
   That's not the process of how to get to a solution. That's the political process. This is a political process, not a process about solving America's energy crisis. 
   Mr. Markey's just sharing with us that we are holding back wind and solar and geothermal. That's not true. There is no Member of Congress that I know of that won't fund all of those. 
   The Peterson-Abercrombie bill funds every renewable that's on the books for 5 years. It funds all the conservation programs that both parties have thought of, and it funds environmental cleanups. It incentivizes all the forms of energy that will help us get to where we need to be. 
   The Pelosi bill, unfortunately, talks with one hand of opening up drilling. On the other hand, it locks it back up because of a 50-mile setback, and then States are supposed to open it up when Members of Congress don't have the courage to, with no reward of a royalty. No State legislature is going to open up the second 50 miles and get no royalties. 
   America doesn't want this political rhetoric. America wants us to sit down as Republicans and Democrats. They don't want a Republican bill or a Democrat bill. They want us to sit down and discuss energy into the night, day after day, until we get it right, and we fix and provide America available, affordable energy. 
   Folks, we can do that. We have lots of reserves. Twenty-eight years ago we started locking up our reserves and decided not to produce energy. We caused the shortage. We caused the high prices. We are the reason the oil companies have made huge profits. 
   When you lock up supply, the price triples. Whoever owns it gets rich. That's how it works, folks. We need to open up supply, bring prices down and give America energy to heat their homes and drive their cars so that they can afford to pay for them.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise with disappointment today. People in my district and the working people of this country are begging us to resolve this energy issue. They're struggling to drive their cars, and they don't have any idea how they're going to heat their homes and run their businesses with today's energy prices. They expect us to do something. 
   Speaker Pelosi's been telling the country that drilling's not the answer; it would take 10 years. Well, the Pelosi team drafted a bill. It will take 10 years, maybe 15, maybe 20, folks. This bill will not produce energy. It locks up 97 percent of the west coast forever. It locks up the most productive part of the gulf that we can produce quickly forever. 
   Folks, we need a bipartisan bill. Twenty-three Republicans and Democrats sat down and drafted a bill, 11 Democrats and 12 Republicans. We drafted the Peterson-Abercrombie bill that opens up all kinds of energy for America, funds all the renewables, and gives hope to the American people. 
   That's the kind of bill they don't want. They don't want a Republican bill. They don't want a Democrat bill. They want a bill that Members of this Congress sat down with no oil companies, no lobbyists. We sat down and drafted a simple bill--not 290 pages--one we could understand. We need to vote on a bipartisan energy bill that will give hope to the Americans that there is an economic future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I want to thank my friend from Nebraska for his leadership here tonight and for his sharing time with us. 
   I personally believe that energy is the Number 1 issue facing America's economic future. I don't think, I think that available, affordable energy is a greater threat to the American economy than terrorism is. That's my personal view. 
   Before we talk about natural gas, I want to look at what we're using. Now, these are 2004 figures, but they've changed very little. It takes the Energy Department several years to compile them. These are the figures that we made the last chart out of a few months ago. 
   Currently 40 percent of our energy is petroleum. Just about 22.9 or 23 percent is natural gas, and a similar figure is coal. Now that's 86 percent. 
   Then you get down here to nuclear, 8.2, and now you're up to 94 percent. So renewables are those figures on the left. And the largest, which surprises a lot of people, is biomass, which was 2.8, hydroelectric, 2.7, geothermal, 0.3, solar, 0.06, and wind, 0.01. Now, I think we need to look at that. 
   And then we look at the next chart, which is the Energy Department's estimates. Now, these are the people that deal with us every day. In 13 years, in 2020, these figures don't change much, according to their statistics. Now, I hope they're wrong because the energy bills that are coming at us do not deal with petroleum, do not deal with natural gas, certainly do not deal with coal and do not deal with nuclear, which provides 94 percent. And I don't believe they deal with hydroelectric. That's another 3 percent. And so we have about 4 percent that's in play. 
   And I think what we have to be concerned about, if we focus on that 4 percent, woody biomass, solar, wind, geothermal and hydrogen, can we take care of the needs of this country, because when you don't have emphasis on these, and you don't continue to drill new wells, and you don't continue to promote coal to liquids or coal to gas to furnish our mass amounts of energy needs, then these volumes go down, and that's where we've been at as a country. 
   We've had a policy not to produce American energy, oil, gas or coal. We are gaining 2 percent foreign dependence every year, so we're at 64 percent. We've been gaining. Since I have been in Congress it's been 2 percent a year, every year. And that's a trend that nobody thinks is appropriate or positive for America because it's foreign, unstable, often unfriendly countries with unstable governments. 
   Some new statistics that I'll just add to this that are a little concerning; 80-some percent of the oil and gas in the world is owned by countries that do not have democracies, unstable countries. They own the energy of the world. In fact, Exxon, our largest oil company, is 14th in the world in ownership of energy. There are 13 countries that own, starting with Saudi Arabia and Russia and Iran and Iraq, and you can tell that's not exactly our friends, on down the road, all of those types of countries that own the energy of the world, and we are totally dependent. 
   Now, I'm pleased that the House and the Senate are both going to be dealing with an energy bill, but I think it's important that we have some energy production in those bills. 
   Now, the natural gas issue is one that has, I think, is really driving us economically in the wrong direction. We use 20 some percent of our natural gas now to make electricity. The gentleman from Nebraska just mentioned that his State doesn't do that, but the country does that. The States of California and Florida, the big users of energy in this country, consume huge amounts of electricity produced by natural gas, and that's an increasing figure daily. 
   About 12 or 13 years ago we took away the moratorium. It used to be just used for peaking plants in the morning and the evening because people felt natural gas was to precious to use to make electricity. 
   Natural gas is the feedstock for hydrogen, which the Representative from Nebraska talked about is one of our future fuels. We currently make it out of natural gas. Ethanol, the big push on ethanol consumes huge amounts of natural gas in the production of ethanol, so we don't make ethanol without consuming huge amounts of natural gas. The same with biodiesel. It's the feedstock. 
   Now, here's where the rubber meets the road in America. Natural gas is an ingredient in almost everything that's manufactured, or it's used in large amounts to heat, treat and bend products. 
   Petrochemicals, all the petrochemical companies, 55 percent of their cost of producing their chemicals because they use natural gas as an ingredient, they use it as a fuel is natural gas. 
   Polymers and plastics, 45 to 50 percent of their cost is natural gas because they use it as an ingredient and they use it as a fuel. 
   Fertilizer, from 50 to 70 percent of the cost of making fertilizer to grow the corn to make the ethanol is made by natural gas. In the last 2 years, 50 percent of our fertilizer production has gone offshore. 
   Petrochemicals, polymers and plastics are moving offshore. Why? Because America has the highest natural gas prices in the world, and have had for 6 years. That was not true 6 years ago. South America, a buck and a quarter. Our average retail price last year was between 12 and $13. Like I said, we have consistently, for 6 years, had the very highest natural gas prices in the world. 
   To show you, Dow Chemical uses huge amounts of natural gas. In 2002, they spent $8 billion to buy natural gas. In 2006, they spent $22 billion, and of course those numbers just keep rising. 
   If we don't deal with the natural gas issue, America will not compete as a nation, because we use natural gas in producing almost all of our products, whether it's melting steel, melting aluminum.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. There's about 100 chemical plants in the world under construction, none in the United States. And that's a tragedy because those are some of the best working man jobs. When you bend steel, when you bend aluminum, when you heat treat products, when you dry grain, you use natural gas. I mean, natural gas heats 60 percent of our homes, heats about 70 percent of our businesses. 
   Now, if natural gas was affordable, it would be the natural next fuel for vehicles, because we could fuel, if it was affordable, we could fuel a third of our auto fleet and that would be much quicker than CAFE. And I'm not opposed to CAFE. But it would be much quicker than all the things they're talking about because it could displace 2.5 million barrels a day, just for short haul vehicles who don't go long distances. One of the problems with natural gas as a vehicle fuel is distance because you can't store, you can't have a big enough gas tank to run long distances on a tank of natural gas.  
   But we have, on the Outer Continental Shelf, that's from 3 miles to 200 miles offshore, every country in the world produces both gas and oil there. Now, they may have 20-mile distance out or 30-mile distance out. But they produce, after you pass 11 to 12-mile it's out of sight. And countries around the world, when I tell them we don't produce there, just look at us and they say, why? Norway, Sweden, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, all environmentally sensitive countries, they all produce there. We're the only known modern society that does not produce oil and gas. 
   Now, I have a proposal that opens it up for gas because we have not been able to pass it. I would support oil, but natural gas is more important to us because how it fuels our industry, how it heats our schools, how it heats our homes, how it heats our hospitals, how it plays such a role in our economy, how it's an ingredient in so many of our products, in fertilizers and petrochemicals and plastics. So we need natural gas. 
   So I put the priority, and we have a bill that says the first 20 miles remains locked up. The second 25 miles State option, State control, and the next 50 miles is open unless the States pass a bill to lock it up. They can do that. The second hundred miles is just open. That's the bill that I have proposed. And I think it's vital to the future of this country, because if we opened up the Outer Continental Shelf on the East and West Coast and the rest of the gulf we would have ample supply of natural gas for many, many years.     
   Now, we need to produce other kinds of fuel. I mean, what I think a lot of people are not aware of is there is an energy shortage in the world. In fact, right now OPEC controls the price. I believe the price ends the day at somewhere between $75, $76 for oil. Gas is about 7 bucks, which is the cheapest it has been, but this is the slowest time of year in the use of gas. This is gas that is going into storage that you add a couple, 3 bucks to, and then there are distribution costs, and it comes back out on a next year's average price. And this year the price of gas is higher than last year so far in storage. 
   So we are going to have a 25 to 30 percent increase in gas prices, and it appears we are going to have, because here we are with not one storm in the gulf, which always disrupts supply. Right at the moment, we don't have a large sending country in trouble with their government. So things are kind of calm, and we have $75 oil, and we are at the high usage time, right in the mid-summer. So now all we have to do is have a storm or two in the gulf, like we did 2 years ago, and have a country have some sort of disturbance or a government overthrown, and we have $85 or $90 oil, and we know what that is going to do to the American economy. In fact, I am not sure we are really sure what $3 gasoline, which is prevalent today, is going to do to the economy long term because we have had spikes for short periods of time. But now, in my view, $3 is the base price, and it is going up from there. It is just a matter of how much it goes up. 
   I think what is important for Americans and Members of Congress to understand is that we have to really get serious about energy policy for this country. I am for wind and I am for solar and I am for geothermal and I was part of the Hydrogen Caucus when I first came. I am for all of those. 
   But they are tiny fractions when you look at the amounts they produce. And we also know that wind has its opponents and solar has just had trouble getting off the ground. I mean, it just has trouble growing. I read an article today that said ethanol, the new fuel, we spent $5.1 billion last year, subsidizing that by paying the tax on it. So it doesn't come free. And it seems foolish to me that we as a country now want to buy our natural gas from foreign countries and bring it in ships and be once again dependent. 
   I have had that argument with a lot of leaders in the last few years that LNG could be part of the solution, but it is not the solution. And that has turned out true because countries like Spain and Japan outbid us because they will pay more for a tanker load of natural gas than we can afford to. So we don't often get it because it becomes a commodity once a ship is loaded. But I want to get across to Members of Congress and to the American people is that we want to be for the clean and green fuels, but I think natural gas is one of those. 
   Natural gas is one of the cleanest fuels we have. And if we had ample supply of it, we could be expanding the use of it, not just detracting the use of it. It could be our bridge until we figure out how to make cellulosic ethanol, until we figure out how to get hydrogen vehicles, until we figure out how to charge our cars up at night with electric and have batteries that will last and all these things we are working on, we need a bridge to get to them because what is going to happen if we allow ourselves to have $100 oil from foreign countries, unstable governments, who are totally going to own this country? 
   The major balance of payment, and I will just show you that in conclusion, is the last chart here. This is one on manufacturing decline as natural gas prices have risen. But here is the one on the balance of payment. The major portion of the balance of payment, a huge portion, is energy prices. And as energy prices go up and we continue to import, that figure is going to grow. We could almost cut our balance of payment in half if we stopped importing energy. 
   Now, we are not going to be able to do that but we could move a long ways. But we need cola liquids. We need to develop the hydrogens and the winds and solars and all of those. We need to do more nuclear. We need all of those because China is increasing their energy usage 15 to 20 percent a year, and they are just drying up the marketplace. They are just sucking it dry because they are, and many other countries, are developing a strong energy portfolio; so they have energy. The United States has done little to secure its economic future with clean, green, affordable energy. 
   And I hope when we finally pass bills here that we have some energy in them that will secure our economic future with clean, green, affordable energy and specifically natural gas.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. We have anywhere from a 50- to 100-year supply. There are huge amounts in the Midwest, but the Outer Continental Shelf has actually not been measured.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Not only do we prohibit usage but we prohibit the measurement. 
   Now, there was a lot of drilling off the coast of Florida a few years ago. We bought those leases back. That was very fertile gas. There is very fertile gas up in Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, New Jersey. The east coast is loaded with gas, and it is very rich, and it is where the population is. And when you produce in the ocean, it is out of sight. It is beyond the site line. The habitat for fisheries improve. They love to be around the rigs. They love to be around the 
   platforms. And, of course, the underground piping comes in the ground under the water. It is not even seen. It is clean, green fuel. And they talk about it harming a beach. I don't know how gas harms a beach. I have never seen dirty natural gas. It's clean. It doesn't stain anything. It isn't colorful. It's just a gas. So it has been somewhat amazing. We have lots of natural gas.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. When we started down that road, natural gas was less than $2 a thousand. And it has hit as high as $14 and $15 in peak periods. But Daniel Yergen, who wrote the book ``The Prize,'' spoke in the Senate shortly after that process started, and I happened to be there with Steve Largent. And he said if we don't open up supply, we are going to make natural gases so high that Americans will struggle to heat their homes, struggle to run their businesses, struggle to heat their hospitals. We are not going to make products in this country much longer that consume a lot of natural gas. 
   I predict if we don't deal with the natural gas issue, simple things like glass and bricks will be made in Trinidad, where gas is about a buck a thousand. That is not very far from here. Trinidad is in northern South America, probably a boat, a ship, a day away. It wouldn't take long to get to the east coast with a ship of bricks and glass. And that is a tragedy if we start importing those kinds of things that the American working man has made. 
   This is about jobs for working people. It is about the economy for the working people of this country. Energy punishes the poor and the middle class. The rich will go right along. The rich environmentalists who are against will live right on. They won't change their life-style. They will live in their huge homes and fancy cars and they will do their thing because money is not a problem. But the middle-class working people will not have a middle-class job anymore. They will have a poor man's job. And the poverty rate in this country will skyrocket.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Some of the best jobs in America are producing energy. When you buy Luke Oil gasoline down here, that is produced in Russia, and only the person selling it makes money in America. 
   Mr. Pearce can tell you how many people make money because he knows that business in the production of energy. He will give you some great information.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (OPPOSING EFFORTS BY NATURAL GAS EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH A CARTEL -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida and those cosponsoring this legislation. 
   I couldn't agree more that we must prevent or do everything we can to make sure there is not a cartel. There is some hard evidence though. Dow Chemical recently shared with me their natural gas cost. In 2002, they spent $8 billion for natural gas. In 2006, that same bill cost them $22 billion. And it is rising. It is the reason they are now investing $32 billion in Qatar and Saudi Arabia and Libya, because natural gas is dirt cheap there. New chemical plants are going to replace us. 
   Mill Hall Clay Products was in my district for 83 years making clay pipe. They went out of business this year, and the sole reason was natural gas cost prices. When it would reach a certain level, they no longer could be profitable, and they are history. 
   Natural gas, clean, green natural gas, is our bridge to the future, and we must have it affordable.     
   Currently, it is in high usage to make ethanol. We use a lot of it to make biodiesel. When the wind and solar, the sun doesn't shine, we turn on a natural gas power plant. Natural gas is our bridge to the future. We could displace a third of our auto fleet, short-haul vehicles with natural gas, and remove the need for 2.5 million barrels of oil a day. 
   But folks, it is great to urge that we don't have a cartel formed, but Russia is working hard at this. We just hope and pray that they are not successful because we know what they want to do; they want to control the price. 
   I had this debate with the President some time ago on Air Force One that LNG was going to be the answer to our future natural gas needs, and 2 years later we are not importing much more natural gas than then because we can't buy it. When a ship gets filled with natural gas, it is a commodity. Spain outbids us routinely. Japan outbids us routinely. Our ports, we have been trying to build ports and have not been able to get them permitted. They are only at 40-some percent of capacity. Why, because we can't buy it because of the demand in the world marketplace for it, countries who don't have any. 
   Our fortunate part is America can be self-sufficient on natural gas. We could not import one cmf if we chose to produce it. Canada currently furnishes about 15 percent of our gas. We get about 2 percent with LNG. The rest we produce ourselves, but we have locked up much of our mainland. We have locked up our Outer Continental Shelf. We can go out of sight where it isn't in sight. There has never been a natural gas well that has ever polluted a beach. And if it is out of sight, nobody knows it is there. 
   Since 1913, Canada has produced natural gas in our Great Lakes, and they sell that gas to us. We don't even know it is there. The ship moves in, they drill their well, and the underground guys go down and put the piping in. Then they sell the gas to us. If they are slant drilling, they are probably selling us our own gas. 
   Clean, green natural gas should never be a long-term problem for America. All we need is the will to produce it. Clean, green natural gas, it is the best  fuel we have. No NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, a third of the CO 
   2. The whole climate change issue, natural gas is the biggest, most significant change we can make. And we don't need to lose the Dow Chemicals in the future. We don't need to lose the Mill Hall Clay products in the future. We just have to get out of our minds that a gas well is not something that pollutes. It is a hole in the ground with a pipe in it that lets clean, green natural gas out. 
   We need to make sure that we never have a cartel setting our prices like we do in oil. Today the oil prices are in the $70s, because the cartel is in control. They have been in control for a couple of years now. They lost control for a while. They are back in control today, and they control the price of energy. We must not let that happen with natural gas. We have had the highest natural gas prices in the world for 6 years because it is not a world market. And we must change that so that we can compete. We will lose our chemical plants, our fertilizer plants, our polymer plants, our plastic plants. We will lose aluminum and steel that we have left. And I predict, because gas is only a buck and a quarter in Trinidad, just a short distance from here, one day on a ship, we will be making glass and bricks there and bringing them here, and the working people of America will not have a job because of high natural gas prices. 
   That is an issue that this Congress needs to deal with. It is important that we do not let a cartel form. We can't stop that, we can only sell, and we must continue to sell, but we can prevent it by producing the clean natural gas that is abundant in this country.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Americans are concerned, and they should be. We had $79 oil this week, $7 natural gas, the highest prices in the world, especially for natural gas. Oil prices are predicted to go to $100 this year with what's going on in the world. 
   America needs to use its resources. Canada, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Holland, Belgium, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia use their resources on the Outer Continental Shelf. This bill opens it up from 100 on out. It's the safest place, the least imprint. It's the safest place to produce energy in the world. 
   Everybody in the country laughs at us when I talk to them about why we don't produce there. If we want to have a petrochemical business left in America, a polymer, plastics, fertilizer, steel, aluminum, bricks and glass, if we want jobs for our working people, we need affordable oil. We need affordable natural gas. 
   We have to stop being 2 percent more dependent every year. Every year we're gaining 2 percent in dependence on foreign oil. This has to stop. 
   We need to open up the Outer Continental Shelf.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman of the committee for yielding me this time. 
   Currently, 3 percent of the grid is renewables. I wish there was a quick way we could turn the switch on and get to 15 in this short period of time. Such a mandate will raise power rates for many. A Federal RPS will undermine the existing programs in 25 States. Nowhere will this be more harmful than in Pennsylvania where we allow 20 different sources of energy to meet our 12 percent RPS. 
   Folks, wind and solar are our hope and dreams, but they are very, very small. And when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, we have a redundant source of energy for them, and that is natural gas, which has become the most expensive source of electricity today because we have been unwilling to produce it. 
   We will cause States that don't have what they need to pay much higher rates, and we will not have the growth and increase of renewable electricity that we want. We have 50 States. Incentivize all of them to go out and meet these standards, but don't do a Federal mandate. It will work some places; it will cause harm in other places. Let the 50 States determine.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this is a complex issue, and I wish we had more time to really debate it, but it is a very important issue because this language was in the energy bill because we had problems across this country around our centers where a lot of electricity is used. 
   New York is the biggest user of electricity, but if we do this, we're saying that we have enough. If surrounding States such as Pennsylvania, an energy exporting State, took the same attitude, New York would be in the dark. Indeed, more reasonable New Yorkers realize this as demonstrated by the following statement from Mr. Gil Quiniones, Chair of the New York Energy Policy Task Force: ``The designation of vitally needed transmission corridors will enhance the public welfare both in the Nation at large and in New York City as the Nation's most critical financial and commercial center.'' 
   Join me in defeating this amendment. This is scare tactics. These are very limited powers that are used already on gas transmission lines. They've not been abused, but when we have disagreements between States and we have local groups who are just anti everything in energy, we need the ability to get electric and gas to our cities so they can function.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to talk about the importance of the legislation we are considering. There's nothing more important to America's economy and security than affordable, available energy, and we are today looking at legislation that doesn't deal with that. 
   Here is our current use of energy: We are 40 percent dependent on petroleum. We are in world short supply at the moment. The oil companies are reporting they are most frightened today because of the lack of oil availability in the world than they have ever remembered. Natural gas, 23 percent. Coal, 23 percent. Nuclear, 8 percent. Hydroelectric, 2.7 percent. 
   None of these major forms of energy will be enhanced or helped. They will be harmed. The legislation coming from the Natural Resources Committee will give us less petroleum and increase our dependence on foreign supply from unstable parts of the world. 
   Natural gas? Nothing. But it will give us less natural gas and make us, again, foreign dependent on foreign, from Canada. 
   Nothing to help coal. 
   We need an energy bill that gives us energy so our renewables can grow in order to meet some of our future needs.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Small business is the future of America. One of the greatest threats to small business in this country is energy prices, the transportation of their goods and the heating of their factories and the use of clean green natural gas in the manufacturing process. It is 55 percent of the chemical business; it is 45 percent of the polymers and plastics business. They use it as an ingredient; they use it as a fuel. It is 70 percent of nitrogen fertilizer. And one-half of our corn is going to be grown this year with fertilizer from foreign countries because natural gas prices in America are the highest in the world. 
   The natural gas supply in this country is in crisis. Twelve years ago, we opened it up for an unlimited amount of producing electricity. Now 20-some percent of our electricity is made with natural gas. But we refuse as a country, we refuse as a Congress to open up the Outer Continental Shelf where we have an abundant supply. 
   How many countries do what we do? There is no one in the world that doesn't produce energy, both gas and oil, on their Outer Continental Shelf. We all talk about Brazil's energy independence. Yes, ethanol was a piece; but they opened up their Outer Continental Shelf. 
   There has never been a gas well that polluted a beach. There has never been a gas well that polluted anything. Clean green natural gas should be a part of this bill; one-third of the CO  
   2, no NO 
   X, no SO 
   X. It is a clean energy. And as a country, we refuse to use it. How blind can we be? 
   It is interesting in this bill, we talked about carbon in the last segment. The other two carbon free, we are doing nothing with hydro, we are doing nothing with nuclear, carbon free. I am for all these renewables, but they are a fraction. Twelve hundredths of 1 percent of our energy is wind; and if we double it, we are now 24/100ths of 1 percent. 
   Folks, I am for all of those, but clean green natural gas is our bridge to get to those. Open it up.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I find this amendment interesting as someone interested in natural gas and the use of it. I find it a little puzzling because clean green natural gas is America's cleanest fossil fuel. Yet we've made it very expensive because we've allowed it to be used unlimited on production of electricity. I think the last 98 percent of plants built to make electricity are using natural gas. But what we're saying with this amendment and what has been lobbied for in the industry is that we will say to gas distribution companies that sell to our homes and to our businesses, we'll urge you to conserve but we'll charge you enough more that the gas utility continues its current profit structure. 
   I find that a little troubling, personally. I think it might be wiser to open up the supply of natural gas, get the price down so we're not the highest in the world, so people can heat their homes and run their businesses without having natural gas prices be prohibitive and, thus, the companies would be actually selling more gas and we wouldn't have to go down the road of subsidizing their profits because they're selling less volume. 
   As a businessman all my life, I understand the dilemma they're in. As people conserve and when energy prices spike in the winter, people keep their homes at 56. Businesses turn their thermostats down. I went to stores last year in Pennsylvania where they were actually cold. And I knew people who lived in 56-degree houses. I'm not sure we ought to go down that road. I think we ought to produce abundant natural gas and allow the price to work, cheap natural gas. The volume would be there, but we're glad to accept the amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. As a retailer all my life, that's what a gas company is. They're a retailer. I sold food. They sell gas. And as their business decreases, their profits go down, but their pipeline system, their pumping stations and all of their costs remain the same. My hesitation is with the cleanest energy we have, why do we want to restrict the use of it, because there's no NO  
   X, no SO 
   X and a third of the CO 
   2. It seems like we ought to be more focused on making it affordable so that volumes remain constant and we don't have this problem.

   I'm from Pennsylvania. It's cold there. We have a lot of poor people, a lot of low-income people in my district, and weatherization is a huge program. I would just like to let the body know that in my Outer Continental Shelf natural gas bill, we set aside, I think, $12 billion to fund this program. If we open up the OCS for clean green natural gas, we will have an ongoing supply of $12 billion for helping with weatherization.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. While I do that, I think it's a very important issue as we make our schools energy efficient. 
   Energy efficient buildings have very little air exchange. And if you have any kind of a pollution factor in your house or in a school or in a building that is just airtight, it's going to concentrate very fast. And it's very important that we have this kind of a study. 
   But I want to say that we won't have that problem with this building that we're in right now. We won't have that problem with any of our office buildings because they all have single pane, the least energy efficient windows known in America, and we have lots of air exchange. In fact, it's probably what we ought to be doing to make our own buildings energy efficient, instead of going to expensive natural gas to heat them, which will go right out those energy open windows.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, tonight I'd like to share with the House what I think is the most important issue facing this country. Later this week we will have an energy bill, or a so-called energy bill, because the number one issue facing America, in my view, is available, affordable energy. 
   First, I'd like to look at my chart on my left here, and this is the energy as we utilized it in 2005. It has not changed much in 2006. It changed very little in 2007. 
   The number one form of energy that we use is oil, 40 percent. 
   The second item is natural gas, 23 percent. Now, natural gas is used to heat our homes, to heat our businesses. It's used by many people. Many people are not aware that it's used in making many goods. Petrochemicals use it as a fuel and use it as an ingredient. Fertilizer uses it as a fuel and as an ingredient and so does polymers and plastics. In fact, most of the man-made materials today have natural gas in them as an ingredient, and they also use natural gas as a fuel to make the product. Plus, we also now generate more than 20 percent of our electricity with natural gas. So natural gas is the one that's been growing in use but not in production. 
   Coal is an equal amount which we use a lot to generate electricity mostly, 23 percent, heat a few factories. Nuclear, again to generate electricity. Hydroelectric, again to generate electricity. 
   Biomass is the one that's been growing. Nobody talks much about it. But it's woody waste, it's used in the pellet industry for pellet stoves to heat our homes. It's one of the new uses of wood waste made out of saw dust. Also, biomass is used in power generation. It is used to top coal loads so that they bring the air standards down because it burns cleaner, and many factories are now using waste pallets and waste wood to heat their factories because it's a cheap fuel. 
   Geothermal is one that's growing slowly. It's usually with new construction, not old, because of the underground work that's needed to use geothermal to heat your home or business. 
   Wind and solar are the ones we hear a lot about. Hydrogen is not even on here, but hydrogen vehicles is another one I should mention. 
   But this shows you, and I guess the part that is worrisome is that all of our energy bill deals with the last four: biomass, geothermal, wind and solar, or hydrogen.     
   The numbers in them are so small. We are all for them. The energy bill also does some good things. It does deal with conservation, wiser use of all of our forms of energy, better CAFE standards, although I am not sure that's in the bill, although there is talk about that being there, use, getting more fuel efficient cars. 
   But there's a lot of things in this bill that are very alarming. I believe that our 66 percent dependence on foreign oil will increase under the proposed legislation, because this bill goes in the wrong direction. Today, oil reached $79 a barrel, closed at $78.77, record high. I talked to some energy people this evening at a dinner, and they would be surprised if it doesn't reach $100 this summer or this fall. 
   Everything is in place. There is a world shortage of oil. We are not producing as much as we should be, and the tremendous consumption by countries like China and India and all the developing nations are now using huge amounts of oil. They are roaming around the world, signing up contracts, while we sort of sit along the sidelines dealing with the lower four. 
   The Wall Street Journal yesterday reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries posted record revenues of 650 billion last year on high crude prices and increased oil production, 650 billion, many of those our dollars. 
   Another move to use energy as a political weapon, Russia announced today that it's cutting off Belarus off from its natural gas supply. At the same time, Russia is trying to annex the North Pole in a very controversial move, contravention of international law, to feed its energy lust.  
   Yesterday, it was announced that Venezuela has joined China, Norway, Canada and Spain to produce energy right off the Florida coast. 
   The Iranians and the Chinese are inking new energy production agreements with Venezuela. Dow Chemical just announced that it's going to build a $22 billion chemical facility in Saudi Arabia because natural gas supplies in this country are too tight, energy prices are too high. 
   What most people don't realize is that natural gas is not a world price. We had $78 oil today. The whole world does. We have had the highest natural gas prices in America of the whole world for 6 years, and that has endangered the financial stability of chemical companies and fertilizer companies and plastic and polymer companies and steel and aluminum and bricks and glass that use huge amounts of natural gas to make them. 
   Recently, the Business Roundtable, which represents 160 CEOs of the leading companies in America that use energy, 4.5 trillion in annual revenues, with 10 million employees, wrote in a letter recently, ``None of the House [energy] bills addresses the critical need to increase domestic supplies of petroleum liquids and natural gas. Energy security means having well diversified sources of energy--not putting all of our eggs in one basket. Alternative fuels will not eliminate the need for traditional energy resources and, without additional supply, the tight market conditions that have put pressure on prices are likely to persist. The result may well be greater reliance on imports,'' and there are many who predict that we have been increasing our dependence, 2 percent every year. Some think we will spurt up to 70 real quickly, because of the energy bill. 
   The result, the unnecessary and counterproductive impediments to oil and gas leasing, on Federal lands, contained in this bill, report by the Natural Resources Committee, will have an immediate negative effect on domestic production and should not be adopted by the House. 
   It will cut off 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas from the Colorado Roan. It will cut off 2 trillion barrels of oil shale from oil shale resources. It will cut off 18 percent in Federal on-shore production, because it is removing the redundant NEPAs. 
   Currently, we have off limits the Outer Continental Shelf, and this little spot in the middle here is the new Colorado Roan Plateau. It's a huge, clean natural gas field in Colorado that was set aside as the Naval Oil Shell Reserves in 1912 because of its rich energy resources. There is more natural gas there than was in the bill that was passed last year in the gulf. 
   Cutting off the Roan Plateau was not the subject of any hearings, markups, and was done at the 11th hour. It also cuts off 2 trillion barrels of oil shale from oil reserves in some of the similar areas there, 2 trillion barrels. Now, that's the largest oil reserve known left. Like coal oil shale may prove to be our key to hundreds of years of energy security. This bill throws the key away by neutering the current oil shale program. Meanwhile, China is developing its oil shale. 
   The NEPA program, NEPA studies, redundant NEPA study was legislation that I helped to get in the energy bill which says that redundant NEPAs are not necessary. Historically, groups who are trying to prevent drilling from happening would force producers into multiple NEPA studies, a NEPA study, an environmental impact statement. Many times before they were allowed to drill a well, they would have done three, four or five of them, each taking a year. 
   I had talked to people who had leased land, and 7 years later had not produced any oil. That will not serve America well. The bill we are going to be considering cuts off 10 billion barrels from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. This is an interesting one, cuts off interagency communication for oil and gas permitting. 
   Historically, all of the agencies, when they were permitting oil and gas, like Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, would all work together in their permitting process and would all work together collectively in enforcing them. This legislation says they must all deal with the person separately, which makes it much more difficult to produce energy. 
   I want to next bring up the next chart here. Total net U.S. petroleum imports. Prior to this energy bill, I believe it was called energy independence. Folks, the legislation we are going to consider this week will increase energy dependence. It will give us no independence. 
   This shows you the study path of dependence. Many of us predict this bill put another spike here because it locks up good reserves, and it takes away what opportunities we have. 
   It's vital to America that we produce fossil fuels. 
   In my view, we ought to be opening up the Outer Continental Shelf, and I will talk about that in a minute, which is, for natural gas, I have a bill to do that, and I will talk about it in a few minutes. But we also ought to have a program promoting coal to liquids, because the Germans fought us in the war when we blockaded them and prevented them from buying energy, any oil. They made their energy out of coal. Their processes are still known. 
   There are several processes that have been developed, but these processes need to be streamlined. We need to build some pilot plants. We need to make sure that in the future we are not growing our dependence to 70 and 80 percent on foreign countries. 
   Interestingly enough, the Air Force is doing their own work. They have been experimenting with coal to liquid. They have been experimenting with natural gas to 
   gas liquid, which would make natural gas prices even higher because there is not enough supply, because they don't want to be dependent in the Air Force. They use 2 1/2 billion gallons of jet fuel a year, and they want at least at least 60 percent of that to be from American products. They can't do that today. They are dependent on foreign oil. 
   The interesting thing we need to know, where does the foreign oil come from? Exxon is the 14th largest oil company in the world. The 13 larger are government-run oil companies. Most of the companies like Iran, Iraq, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the government owns the oil company, owns the oil, opens the refineries, owns the marketing strategy, and even countries like nearby Mexico. 
   We have all of these countries in the world. Most of the ones that are the big oil producers are not democracies. They are not particularly close friends of ours. There is much concern in the world today that 80 some percent of the known oil and gas reserves are opened by governments that are monopolies that own the whole shebang. They own it in the ground. They own the refineries. They own the marketing systems. 
   Unfortunately, the fear is that Venezuela is going down the same road that Mexico went. Mexico has huge reserves, but they have always been a government monopoly. They don't put money back into the oil fields, and so today they can't produce enough of their own. We actually export oil and gas both to Mexico when they ought to be exporting to us and to the rest of the world because they have huge reserves. 
   Because they are government run, they are corrupt. They steal from the oil reserves, money, and use it for other purposes and don't invest back. So their fields are so antiquated that they can't produce. There are many that are afraid today because in the last 3 or 4 years, three or four or five countries have taken over what were partly owned companies from the big oil companies, chased them out, taken over their equipment, taken over their refineries, taken over their operations, taken over their ownership, and they are now government-run monopolies. 
   That's unfortunate, because they are doing the same thing that Mexico and other countries have done. They are not putting their money back. They have kicked out the smartest people in the country on how to produce oil, how to do refineries, how to produce the energy we need, and so there is great concern around the world that, as they continue to do this, their ability to produce will decrease and decrease, and the oil supply will be shorter and shorter. 
   We sit here today with $78, $79 oil, $78.87, and we are storming the gulf away from probably $90 oil or any little blip in one of these big producing companies, and $100 oil. In fact, someone  was telling me today of a pipeline he was worried about that produces 2 million barrels a day, and he said that pipeline is too long, in a very dangerous situation in the world. If it was blown up, we would have $100 oil in a couple of days. 
   Should America be dependent on foreign, unstable countries, not democracies, not our friends, for the lifeblood of our country? I don't think so. 
   Let's bring the chart back up on energy here. I am for all of these renewables. I want all the wind we can get, all the solar we can get, all the ethanol and biodiesel we can get, geothermal. Why we aren't putting more hydroelectric in because we have dams all over this country that have never had hydroelectric hooked up to them. We should be expanding nuclear. 
   With the greatest coal reserves in the world, we should be force feeding coal to liquids and coal to gas mass. Now, some of the arguments I have had is, because of carbon sequestration, we can't do coal. Well, folks, we better do coal. We can work on the carbon sequestration as we refine the process of developing liquids and natural gas from coal. 
   Now, natural gas, I believe, is our road to the future, for the immediate future. We have huge reserves of natural gas, Outer Continental Shelf. Let's bring that world map back up here or the United States map back up here again. 
   We have huge reserves offshore. We only produce in the gulf, but we have huge reserves up and down the coast line. 
   Now, I have legislation that will open up the Outer Continental Shelf, and it's vital that we do that. It's vital that we produce, because we, every electric generating plant we have built recently is natural gas. So if we continue to have a hot summer, we will use a tremendous amount of electricity. In hot weather, they turn on the gas plants, peaker plants. Before, 12 years ago, we only used natural gas for peaking plants. That was high use in the morning and high use at night, but where they were not allowed to run during the day, only in emergency. 
   But then we took that restriction off, so now 98 percent of all the plants built in 12 years have been natural gas plants. They are cheaper, they are easier, but it's the most expensive electricity we are producing today. They are 22 percent of the volume, and they are 55 percent of the cost of electricity, because natural gas is so much higher than it used to be, because we have not produced natural gas in adequate numbers. But if we produced our offshore, if we continued to produce more in the West, we could bring natural gas prices down so we are not the highest in the world.     
   When Dow Chemical moved its big plant to Saudi Arabia that they are building right now, they didn't want to do that, but their natural gas bill went from $8 billion per year to $22 billion per year and continues to rise; $8 billion to $22 billion. Nobody talks about that. 
   Clean, green natural gas, it heats 50-some percent of our homes, 60-some percent of our businesses. It is used to make ethanol, it is used to make biodiesel, it is used to make hydrogen, and it could be fueling one-third of our vehicles. And if we did that, because you can burn natural gas in a gasoline engine. You have to use a different fuel system, but it is just a change. We know how to do that. But it has to be affordable, there has to be financial incentives there, and so we need to do that. 
   But the unfortunate part is America is just kind of going along like we have always had cheap energy. And I sometimes get angry at Congress and I get angry at the administration because energy has not been as high a priority as I think it should have been. But then 6 years ago, we had $2 natural gas and we had $10 oil; the world was awash in it. The only concern people had was we were importing too much of it from foreign countries and we weren't producing our own. But as cheap as it was, it didn't really matter. 
   But we are a long way from $2 natural gas and $10 oil. The average price of natural gas to the home last year was $12.50 per thousand and the current price of oil is almost $79, and expected to go higher. 
   So it seems to me that there would be a sense of urgency in this Congress and that legislation that we would be looking at this week would really deal with availability and affordability of energy. But, unfortunately, people keep saying that renewables must take over. Well, I wish they could. I am for them all, clean renewables. But clean, green natural gas can really bridge us until we have renewables playing a more significant role, until we have some new break-throughs. 
   My legislation to open up the Outer Continental Shelf will allow the first 25 miles to be locked up by law. Today, we are locked up for 200 miles. We are the only country in the world that I know of that has locked up the Outer Continental Shelf, and that is from 3 miles to 200 miles; that is considered our territory to produce. Everybody, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, these are pretty green countries, New Zealand, Australia. They all produce there. 
   Everybody talks about Brazil being energy independent. They are, because of ethanol. But it is not just ethanol. Ethanol was just a little piece of it. They also produced energy on their Outer Continental Shelf, and they don't now depend on anybody else for energy. 
   Unfortunately, we can't ever get there. We will always be dependent on foreign countries for energy. There is no way America can be self-sufficient, but we sure ought to be trying. We sure ought to be moving in the right direction instead of continuing to be more dependent. We are now 17 percent dependent on natural gas. Thank God for friendly Canada to the north. They produce about 15 percent, and we get about 2 percent of LNG. That is liquefied natural gas. That is another whole issue. I am not opposed to it. It is very expensive. You have to build new sending ports, you have to build huge sending ports, you have to build huge receiving ports that nobody wants; and there has been great resistance to that. And you have to build the biggest ships known to man to bring that natural gas here. 
   But, again, we are buying it from foreign, unstable, nondemocratic countries. Some say, it is okay for emergency, but don't we have enough of that? But clean, green natural gas, if we produced, opened up the Outer Continental Shelf, my bill, 25 miles remains closed; the second 25 miles, States' rights. They can open it if they choose to. The next 50 is open, but the States still have a say. If they don't want it produced, they can pass a law that their Governor signs that keeps them in the moratorium. And then the second 100 miles would be open. 
   Now, I would like to open it for oil because I think we should, but we haven't been able to pass clean, green natural gas. A natural gas well has never polluted a beach. A natural gas well has never polluted anything. It is a simple six-inch hole drilled in the ground with a steel casing put in behind it and the pipe is rigged up to allow natural gas to flow into a system. 
   Offshore, if you are past 25 miles, you will never see it. You only can see 11 to 12 miles. It will never be seen. You will never know it is there. And you can check with the people in the gulf, the best fishing in the gulf is where we produce gas and oil. The fish are attracted to the rigs. It helps make new reefs; it helps make barriers to protect them. It does not hurt aquatic life. In fact, it is probably the most environmentally friendly place to produce energy, and we as a country have said we are not going to do that. We are not going to produce energy there. In fact, we are not going to produce energy at all if we can help it. 
   The bill before us this week will restrict the production of energy in a whole lot of ways. I have already listed them. And that is very unfortunate for America, because there is a lot of incentives for renewables. But if you double wind from one-sixteenth of a percent, you now have one-eighth of a percent for energy. That doesn't change much. That doesn't really change anything. 
   And solar, we keep hoping for break-throughs, but it is even a smaller fraction. And geothermal is a big expense, and it is usually done with new construction. But in my country, I find out that when it gets below 10 degrees or 15 degrees into really hard, cold winter weather, it doesn't work well  enough and people start looking for other kinds of heat. 
   Let's have the chart here on my bill. The NEED Act is the bill we hope we can amend into the energy bill. It would open up the Outer Continental Shelf for gas only. And we do some things here that we think are important. States will get 37.5 percent. That will be up to 150 billion. That is with the known reserves. And we have never done modern seismographic out there, so most people who produce oil figure there is three times as much out there than we think because the old seismographic of 40 years ago wasn't very good and today we have much more sensitive seismic that will tell us exactly what's out there. 
   We are going to give 100 billion to the government for the Treasury; $32 billion will go into a fund for renewable energy that will help us promote the renewables of the future; $32 billion will go into carbon capture and sequestration research, because there are those who determined that we must capture carbon. I am not sold totally on that; I am still somewhat skeptic, but let's provide the money so we can capture the carbon and we can produce energy without putting carbon in the atmosphere if that is what they believe to be correct. 
   We put $20 billion to clean up the path of the Chesapeake Bay, the exact amount of money they say they need to clean up the Chesapeake Bay; $20 billion to restore the Great Lakes, exactly what they said they needed to restore the Great Lakes; $12 billion for the Everglade restoration; $12 billion for the Colorado River 
   basin restoration; $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay restoration; and $10 billion for LIHEAP and weatherization, which we have to fund because energy prices today are forcing people out of their homes. 
   I come from rural America. We have big old farmhouses, and people hate to leave their original farmhouses. Some of them, their parents and their grandparents were raised there. They like it there, they are comfortable there, it is a nice location. But they are hard to heat. They are big old plank houses, they are not built like houses today, and it takes a lot of energy to heat them. And people, with today's oil prices and natural gas prices, are forced out of their homes. That shouldn't be in America. 
   With the energy prices that are facing us this year, this winter, by the time Americans drive their vehicles with possibly $3.50, $4 gasoline, and very high gas and fuel oil to heat their homes, they will be choosing between being warm, having adequate food, and other staples of life. I know last winter, which was a very mild winter in my area in Pennsylvania, up until January and then it was very, very cold from January 15 on for about 3 months; but overall, it was considered a mild winter because the first half was very mild. I know people that kept their homes at 58 degrees. Seniors in America shouldn't have to live in a 58-degree house. That is not how it ought to be. They ought to be able to afford to heat their homes. 
   And the tragedy is if we were allowed to produce, if this Congress would stop locking up the Outer Continental Shelf, if they would open up the reserves in the Midwest which some of them are taking off in the energy bill, we could have adequate natural gas in this country; the price could be affordable; Americans could be warm; and, the very best jobs in America like petrochemical and polymers and plastic and fertilizer and glass and steel plants and bricks could be made in America, and middle-class working Americans could continue to have the jobs that have historically allowed them to live a quality of life and raise their families. 
   Natural gas and energy prices overall are going to change the American economy. We are right on the verge of how much this economy can absorb. I was talking to someone who has worked on this all their life. They said they are astounded that $70 oil has not stalled our economy. They are just holding their breath because they know it can't get much higher without stalling our economy and putting our economy into a recession and possibly a world recession. These kind of energy prices. 
   America has to get busy. China is building coal plants weekly, nuclear plants monthly, building the largest hydro dams in the world and cutting deals all over the world for gas and oil and coal. They are out there because they know, like so many other countries know, energy is scarce today, it is high priced, and they have to be about securing their future. 
   This Congress has been negligent year after year in dealing with energy, and here we are now facing an energy bill that is actually going to move us backwards. The Pelosi energy plan has no energy in it. In fact, it takes energy out of the supply stream we have today and will force dependence up on foreign unstable parts of the world, with false hopes that we can conserve. 
   And I am for conservation. I am for all of the better light bulbs and more efficient appliances and all the things and more efficient cars. All of those things. But they move the pendulum very slowly. New CAFE standards take 10 to 15 years for the new fleet to fully be here. All of these other appliance changes, it is only when a person buys a new appliance does it impact. And I know people who have refrigerators that are 15 and 20 years old, and until they replace that they are using an older, wasteful refrigerator. 
   Folks, we need to have energy as the number one issue facing this Congress, energy availability and affordability. We became the strongest Nation in the world because we were the first to discover oil, harness oil, and give us an energy source that started the Industrial Revolution. The whole transportation revolution came from this country because we produced energy. We are choosing today to not produce energy, and we will fritter away, we will become a second rate nation in a very few years if we continue the wrong energy policy. And if we pass the energy bill that we are going to be facing on Friday, I believe we will increase dependence quickly, we will actually cause Americans to be forced to move out of their homes in the near future, not be able to live in the homestead because they can't afford to heat it. 
   We will continue to force millions of jobs overseas as we have in the past. Chemical plants have been built overseas in the last few years; they will continue to be rebuilt overseas. They can't move quickly, or they would have already been gone. It is a $2 billion, $3 billion, and $4 billion investment to build a small chemical plant, and $10 billion and $20 billion to build a large one. Folks, they are in the process of doing that. 
   We now make 50 percent of our fertilizer offshore. In fact, the ethanol issue is an interesting one, because we are taking food stock, corn. And to grow the corn, we have to have lots of fertilizer. It takes a lot of fertilizer to grow corn. And 50 percent of the fertilizer that we are using to grow corn is coming from foreign imports. Does that make any sense? I don't think so. Because clean green natural gas can solve all those problems. 
   I look at natural gas as the clean fuel that bridges us to the future. No NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, a third of the CO 
   2 if you are worried about CO 
   2. And why the environmental groups are against clean green natural gas, I will never know, because some of the renewables are not nearly as clean as clean, green natural gas.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (AMERICA'S ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise once again on this House floor to talk about an issue that I think is the most important issue that this Congress should be dealing with and that this administration should be dealing with. 
   Six short years ago, we had $2 natural gas and $16 oil. Most of our lifetime we have had gas that was less than $2 per thousand and oil that was around $8, $9, or $10 a barrel. That is how America grew, cheap, affordable energy. Now, we have lots of other sources of energy, coal, hydro, wind, solar, renewables of all kinds, but the majority of our transportation fuel has always been oil. Four weeks ago, I rose to speak on this House floor. Oil was $82, and most of us were panicked. Can our economy handle $82 oil? 
   Just a few months ago, I met with an Assistant Secretary of State whose role is to deal with energy. He shared  with me that he and many of his colleagues felt that $70 to $75 oil would really put us in recession because the economy could not absorb those costs. It didn't. Then, we were at $82. Two weeks ago, we were at $90.92. Last week we were at $94.53. And, at one point it was 98-something. Today it is $91.92. Can America's economy continue to afford $90 to $100 oil? I think there are many who are very concerned. 
   I know that the poorest among us, the average American who spends every dollar they earn every week, and sometimes with the use of a credit card maybe a couple dollars they didn't earn that week hoping to catch up later. And with the winter heating season coming on, you would think this body and someone would be debating energy. Four weeks ago, there was no energy debate on this floor; three weeks ago, there was no energy debate on this floor; last week, there was no energy debate on this floor. And there is a little rumble that there could be an energy debate on this floor, but most people don't think so. 
   Record high heating oil prices; winter is coming. Record high diesel prices for our truckers who move our goods across this country; winter is coming. Gas prices are on the rise. We have a mortgage crisis, everybody is talking about it. Is the mortgage crisis equal on the impact on America that high energy prices will have? No. Is it important? Yes. No discussion about energy for America. 
   We passed a House bill some time ago. They passed a Senate bill some time ago. No conference committee has met. We have heard rumblings that a few staffs have met, but no sense of urgency. 
   I cannot understand for one minute why energy isn't the number one issue facing this Congress, available, affordable energy to maintain our economic base, people to heat their homes, people to drive to work, and to have a few dollars left for food.     
   Now, we've done a few things. The Speaker sometime a few months back made a declaration that we would stop heating a portion of the complex here with coal and we would use natural gas. And that was because of the concern of the carbon, the CO  
   2, the carbon footprint. 
   Now, we didn't do anything to put double pane glass in any of the windows in the Capitol or all the surrounding office buildings. They're all single pane. I'm not saying it was right or wrong to switch to natural gas. It costs the taxpayers another $3 to $4 million. But it didn't do anything to conserve energy. We could have put double pane glass on all the buildings in the complex and saved millions of dollars in energy for America. 
   Oh, we also mandated with recent legislation that all bulbs in the Capitol complex will be the new fluorescent bulb that screws in. I have some of those at home. My wife doesn't like them. I don't like them in a place where I read a lot. They're not quite as clear, bright, and some of them buzz, vibrate a little. 
   But the unfortunate part is we mandated them here; those are all made in China. No American jobs. And I have the largest incandescent light bulb plant left in my district in St. Mary's, Pennsylvania. 
   What are others doing about energy? Well, the one that's leading the world in the fight for energy is China. They're building a coal electric plant every 5 days. They're building a nuclear plant every month. They're building the largest hydro-dams in the world as we speak. They're buying up rights to oil and gas and other forms of energy all over the world. In fact, they've just developed a pact with Cuba. Less than 50 miles off the Florida coast, with Norway and Canada and a number of other partners, they're going to be producing oil and gas right off our coast, while we prohibit offshore drilling. 
   China and India, the two new giants that are our competition, are increasing their energy use between 15 and 20 percent annually, and they're out securing it. In fact, that's the real reason for the price run-up. 
   I have a chart here that shows, that I've been using for the last 6 to 8 months and no longer does it work. It doesn't go high enough; 90's up in here. So I'm going to take it down because really it's no longer applicable. 
   Now, here's what's happened in just a year. In 11 months we've gone from $58.31 to a high of $96.65 on the day this was used in a press conference last week. It actually hit 90-some later that day. But no energy around here about doing something about energy. I find it unbelievable. 
   What does America want Congress to do? They want available, affordable energy to heat their homes, to run their vehicles, and to power the places they work. Companies who make steel use a lot of energy. Companies who make aluminum use a lot of energy. Petrochemicals, polymers and plastics, 45 to 55 percent of the cost of all of them is energy. Fertilizer that we grow our corn and our wheat and our crops with, 70 percent of the cost is natural gas, energy. 
   And while we have these skyrocketing prices that have Americans afraid because this $90 oil is not $3.09 gasoline, which is the price at the pump where I buy, it will soon be $3.39, $3.49, $3.59. In some parts of the country it already is. 
   This spring we had $3.09 gasoline with $63 oil. How did that happen? 
   Well, oil companies don't set the price. We like to blame them, but they don't set the price. Wall Street sets the price. And there was a shortage of gasoline because Americans don't realize it, but we don't produce enough gasoline in America for Americans. 
   Twenty percent of our gasoline now comes from Europe. Europe has an excess of gasoline because they switched to diesel in their cars. Many of their cars and trucks are diesel so they have an excess capacity of gasoline, so they ship it over here in ships. 
   This spring they used more than usual, for some reason, and they didn't have enough to supply us, so we had a gasoline shortage in Europe and America, and the prices were extremely high. And so with $63 oil we had $3.09 gasoline. So you don't have to be a very good mathematician to know that $92, $95, $96 oil doesn't equate to $3.09 again. It'll be much higher. It's just a matter of a few days and weeks until that little extra gasoline that's in the marketplace from the summer gets utilized. 
   Well, what is Congress doing? 
   Let's take a look at not what should we be doing, but what are we doing. And we're not even meeting on this for some reason. Maybe that's good. Many of us stood on this House floor a few months back and debated this energy bill and tried to get amendments into this bill, but it was pretty well locked up. There were very few chances for amendment in the energy debate in Congress. But here's what it does. It locks up 9 trillion cubic feet of American natural gas. That's the Roan Plateau, a huge clean natural gas fill in Colorado that was set aside as the oil shale reserves in 1912, because of its rich energy resources. 
   And this legislation means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas will not be available to us. It's already went through the NEPA. That's the environmental assessments. It's passed all those. It's ready for lease. 
   This provision was not in the original bill, but it was stuck in at the last minute, in the dark of the night. Suddenly when the bill came to the floor, not from committee, but somewhere down the line, in Rules or somewhere else, they slipped this in and removed the best potential onshore gas for America from being able to be produced. 
   The next part here is, I was responsible in the 2005 energy act for taking away redundant NEPA studies. NEPA studies are an important part of our environmental assessment for everything we do. It's about a year-long process. But abuse of the NEPA studies was to the point of where people would lease oil and gas in America and 5, 6, 7 years later we're still not able to produce it because of NEPA study after NEPA study. They do a NEPA study for the project, then they do a NEPA study for the roads, then they do a NEPA study for the well layout, and then a NEPA study for every well. And this process is a year-long process, a paperwork process that wasn't about the environment. It's about stopping the production of energy successfully. So we took away the redundant waste, and they want to put them back. 
   The next one's probably the worst. There's huge reserves in the West called western oil shale. It's even  greater than in Canada's tar sands. This oil shale has up to 2 trillion barrels. Now, we need to figure out how to produce it environmentally in a sound fashion. There are companies preparing to do that. But this legislation would say no to shale oil. 
   When we have $100 oil and we're dependent on foreign unstable countries for 66 percent of our oil, increasing 2 percent a year, and if this bill passes here, it'll be 3 percent a year or 4, why would we lock up the shale oil in the West? It makes no sense to me. 
   National reserve in Alaska. Locking up another 10 billion barrels of oil. Making sense? No, it doesn't make sense. Alaska's a huge place. The Alaskans want to produce energy. We know how to produce energy cleanly today. But this bill that's been proposed in both the House and the Senate will remove. 
   It also breaches contracts, which I think will lose in the courts. 
   But the one down here that really makes no sense, and it's talking about taxing Big Oil. Big Oil produces a small percentage of our energy; 60, 70, 80 percent of our energy is produced by little companies. I have two refineries in my district, United Refinery in Warren, American Refiners in Bradford. This bill will force them to pay higher taxes than any other business in America. That will increase the price of energy, and when you make American production of energy more costly than offshore production of energy, you're going to get more foreign dependent. Does that make sense? I don't think so. 
   Now, we were talking earlier tonight about how many times they've spent that in the appropriations process. I thought it was four or five. Someone said three or four. But many, many bills have been funded with this tax. 
   Now, the next one does nothing for coal to liquids or coal to gas. Everybody knows I'm the big proponent of offshore, and I'm going to talk about it a little later. But there's huge potential in America of using coal in the traditional way, but also using coal to make liquids, jet fuel, gasoline, fuel oil, and coal to make gas. And some of the new processes, they want to make gas out of coal and then burn the cast to make electricity in a clean way. But to make that work, we've got to fund some of those and get them online, get the bugs out, help industry make this a productive way to use coal in a cleaner way for the environment. But there's great resistance in this Congress to do anything with coal because we're now in the carbon debate. 
   Now, I guess, the carbon argument is still out there. Many Americans believe CO  
   2 is a poisonous gas and it's causing global warming and it's a crisis. I think the crisis is available, affordable energy. And as we go coal to liquid or coal to gas, we can do it in a manner that deals with developing the process to make coal to liquids and coal to gas affordable and in a way that we capture the carbon and then use it in another form. That should all be part of the original projects. But, no, we're finding coal plants not permitted all over this country. They're closing the door on coal. And we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. In my view, they're really trying to eliminate coal as one of our energies. And as I'll show you later, that won't work. 
   And then at the bottom down here, there's a mandate that's part of this legislation in the House version. And it sounds good. And I wish it was doable. And later on some charts I'll show you why it's not, that electricity, 15 percent of electricity being produced by renewables, but not allowed to count hydro. And as I show my charts later, I'll come back to that. 
   But it doesn't appear in the next 30 years there's any way to do that yet. Twenty States have passed laws and Congress is wanting to pass one that will severely limit what can be counted, but forcing States to produce companies in the whole country to produce 15 percent of electricity from renewables, and if they don't accomplish that then they're going to be fined. And who's the fine going to be paid for? By the electric users. We're going to pay as we pay for more expensive electricity. But it'll still be generated the same old way. 
   Now, if it was doable, I would say let's take the carrot-stick approach. Let's put some inducements, some incentives for producing electricity with renewables. 
   Here's our current use of energy. And of course, petroleum, 40 percent; natural gas, 23 percent; coal, 23 percent. Now, natural gas has had the fastest growth because about 12 years ago we took away the prohibition of using natural gas to make electricity. We didn't used to allow them to do that, only in the morning and the evening when you have that extra surge, when we're cooking and washing and doing the home duties and the factories are running too. We need more electricity than we do any other time of the day, so we had gas peaking plants because you can turn them off and you can turn them on. 
   Seven or 8 percent of our electricity was natural gas. Now in a short period of time we're up to 23 percent, and that's why we have the highest natural gas prices in the world, which are driving major industries out of this country, and I'll talk about that a little more later. 
   Nuclear, 8 percent. We need all 35 plants that have asked for a permit to expand or build a new nuclear plant to be permitted and built in the next 20 years or this 8 percent figure will continue to shrink, because as electric use goes up, everything on here has to go up or that percentage will go down. We know hydro's going to go down because we sure aren't going to build another dam. In fact, they keep taking dams out. Biomass is the only one that's really shown some growth.     
   Biomass is woody waste, any kind of fiber, and what's really growing there is that wood waste used to be a throwaway item. Sawdust was something you just got rid of. Now it burns in factories to heat the factories. I come from a heavily wooded area, the best hardwood forest in America. We dry most of our wood now in the dry kilns with wood waste. And a million Americans are heating their homes with pellet stoves made out of dry sawdust. And they are trying to now the expand of the use of them into biomass stoves where any kind of waste material that can burn cleanly could be made into a pellet and can be burned like corn stoves. There are a lot of corn stoves now, but with the surge of ethanol, corn has become quite expensive and is no longer as viable a fuel as it was but it is still being used in biomass stoves and in corn stoves. 
   Geothermal, not really much growth. A good, efficient way to heat a home. It's costly in the beginning. I know people who have used geothermal, and when they build a new home, they go with geothermal because they are familiar with it. And it is a less costly way to heat your home, especially in milder climates, than traditional fuels. 
   Then we come to the hope of the future: wind and solar. Unfortunately for many, people think that the renewables here can trickle. They bring petroleum down, coal down, nuclear down. I wish that were true. But I will show you now the chart of what the Energy Department says about the future, and that's this chart in a different way because this chart is about history; this chart is about history and the future. The left half of this chart is history. There is a line here in the middle. This is use in the past; this is use in the future, projected. 
   Now, I don't totally agree with the Energy Department. I think natural gas will grow and I think coal will decrease for the reasons I just mentioned. The carbon issue is going to decrease coal until we find clean ways to use coal, and we are working on those. But there is great resistance for coal. I don't agree with it. And there is a lot of reluctance in nuclear. I don't agree with that either because we need it too. But I look for natural gas to grow and oil probably to just chug along. Now, $95, $100, $120 oil may decrease oil, but I don't know what we are going to replace it with because we are not doing coal to liquids, which could replace oil. We are not going to run our cars with nuclear. We are not going to run them with hydro. We could run a lot of them with natural gas. 
   Natural gas, in my view, is the fuel, the clean, green fuel, that's underestimated in this country. And we cannot ever be in control of our oil needs. We don't have enough. But natural gas we have lots of. And we will talk now about how we have locked it up. 
   First, I want to talk about what natural gas prices have done to manufacturing, manufacturing employment. As  gas prices have risen, manufacturing has decreased. Natural gas is the fuel that we use to run this country. And for the last number of years, we have had the highest natural gas prices in the world. 
   Here is how fast they have risen. And now we are back up between $7 and $8. During the winter, we will be back to $8 and $9. Now, that's from the well head; that's not the price people pay. So these figures are costs from out of the ground. But America's natural gas prices, historically we were down here under $2, and we were very competitive in the world. But in these years since this rise, we have not been competitive. And in China and India natural gas prices are half of ours. And South America, a buck something; Russia, less than a dollar. Our competition in the global marketplace have much cheaper natural gas prices. And that's a problem for America. Here's the reason why: 
   Now, there is also a chart I have. I don't have it with me, with some big circles in here, and these are areas where there are lots of gas and oil. But they are locked up. Why? We are the only country in the world that has chosen to lock up our gas and oil. The only country in the world, offshore and onshore. Even with $95 oil and $8 and $9 gas, we're locking it up. 
   Twenty-seven years ago, Congress, in its wisdom, prohibited the production of energy offshore in these areas. Canada produces, Great Britain produces, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Australia, New Zealand, all environmentally sensitive countries, they produce offshore. We talk about Brazil being energy independent because of ethanol. Ethanol was just a piece of it. They also went out offshore and produced oil and gas and became energy independent, and they don't have to buy this expensive energy from anybody. They have their own. 
   America could be self-sufficient on natural gas. We could fuel a third of our auto fleet, all short-haul vehicles, all short-haul trucks, all construction vehicles if it was affordable, more affordable than oil and gasoline. It is cleaner burning, no SO  
   2, no NO 
   X, a third of the CO 
   2, if that's giving you gray hair. But for some reason, here's what natural gas is used for. People just have no idea. And ladies, natural gas is the derivative of the skin softeners we all love. I have dry skin. I use skin softeners on my hands every day. I inherited that from my father. All of these products, natural gas is not only used to make them; it's an ingredient: polymers, plastics, tires, carpet. Look at these products. Insulation in our houses. Huge amounts of natural gas. Feedstocks, ethane, propane, butane to make steam, to make power. All of these are feedstocks. And if we go to our hydrogen society, which we are all hopeful in hydrogen, how do we make hydrogen? The only way we have portable to make it is from natural gas. 
   Natural gas should be the bridge to America's renewable future. Natural gas is the clean fuel. And for us to lock our supply of natural gas in this country up makes no public policy sense. Natural gas has never washed up on a shore. We had an oil spill in San Francisco. It wasn't an oil well; it was a ship. There are ships everywhere that could spill oil. Every moving ship in the waterways, on a lake, a river, a dam, or the ocean spill oil from their engines every day. But we won't drill for it and we won't drill for clean natural gas that doesn't have oil, that isn't oil. I think we should be producing both. But natural gas is the vital part of our future. 
   We have a bill that we now have 170-some sponsors for but have not been able to get it considered yet. Now, our bill is a bill that gives a lot of States rights. Our bill will say the first 25 miles, and I don't theoretically agree with it, but I have agreed with it to try to get it passed, the first 25 miles is closed, period. You only can see 11 or 12, so nobody is ever going to see a gas well. The next 25 miles it is up to the States. They choose whether they want to produce energy. Their legislature decides. If they want out under the moratorium, they can choose to be out. The second 50 mile is automatically open, but, again, States have a right to pass a bill and have it signed by their Governor to keep it locked up. So Congress could open it, but they can close it back up with just a State-passed legislation. Then the second 100 miles, the OCS, Outer Continental Shelf, is from 3 miles, which is now controlled by the States, to 200 miles. I'm giving the States total control of the first 25 and saying you can't drill. The second 25, you can drill if you have the wisdom to. And the second 50, you can drill unless 
   you have the foolish attitude that you don't want to produce natural gas. 
   This bill would bring in billions to producing States because of the royalties, $100 billion for the Treasury. Now, we have set-aside funds. We talk about renewable energy. This bill, the NEED Act, would put $32 billion in the coffers for energy research, clean, green energy research; $32 billion for carbon capture and sequestration research to teach us how to burn coal and other fuels and capture the carbon. This isn't talk. This is real money that would put $32 billion to research that. 
   And we have some spoils of the past that we need to clean up. They have been trying for a long time to get $20 billion to clean up Chesapeake Bay. This bill would provide it. There is $20 billion for Great Lakes restoration because when we first started this country, we used the Great Lakes as a depository for our waste of all kinds. Wrong. We don't do that anymore. This would give them the money they have been looking for for the Great Lakes group to clean up. And $12 billion for Everglades restoration. I saw a complaint the other day that this year's bill didn't give the Everglades as much as usual. This would give them mandatory spending right out of the energy bill. Also, $12 billion for the Colorado basin restoration, $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay cleanup, and $10 billion for LIHEAP and weatherization. You haven't heard any energy debates on this floor, but I'm going to tell you in a few weeks when people start paying high energy bills to heat their homes, you're going to hear a lot of LIHEAP debates on this bill where people are going to say $2 billion isn't enough, $3 billion isn't enough, $4 billion isn't enough. We need more money because people can't heat their homes. They can't heat their homes because Congress has locked up energy and caused energy prices to be unaffordable not only for homeowners but for the businesses that provide the jobs for the people. If America doesn't get a handle on energy prices, we won't have working people's jobs in this country. We won't have a petrochemical industry. We won't have a polymers and plastics industry. We won't do anything like making steel or aluminum or bending it or shaping it. It will all be done offshore where energy is much cheaper and labor is much cheaper and environmental standards don't exist. America cannot be the strong country that we grew up in if we don't have available, affordable energy. 
   I plead with this Congress, energy needs to be the number one issue facing this country. Affordable, available energy so we can run this country, so people can live their lives in a normal fashion and have jobs and we can compete. 
   I think America faces a challenge that it has never faced before. We have always been the big dog. We have always been the giant. We have always been able to handle competition. But we have people today that are building economic bases and they are building the energy support systems to run them. America is going to starve itself of affordable energy by choice because we locked up onshore, offshore major supplies of energy and we didn't allow the adequate trial on coal to liquids and coal to gas and we've had great resistance to nuclear and the undue hope that renewables are the answer.     
   I wish they were, but let's go back to that chart. 
   The first half is history. The second half is projection. I don't totally agree with it. Let's say renewable estimates are wrong. Let's say they're 100 percent wrong, and they're going to be twice as much. They still won't hardly be 10 or 11 percent of the energy needed for this country. And our energy growth is going up percentages every year. If we doubled this for renewables, if we tripled it, we would be lucky to keep up with the energy growth. We would still need all of this. And we have people in this Congress thinking we don't need oil; they won't support gas, they won't support coal, they won't support nuclear because we want this. 
   Yes, we want this, but how do we get this? How do we get that? When wind  and solar are just fractions, and geothermal are just fractions. They're good, they're good sources, they're clean, they're green, they're pure. 
   You know, we have a lot of groups in this country, I can just think of a few, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and the PIRGs and the League of Conservation Voters and the Environmental Defense Fund, and more. These organizations are opposed to all of these. They grade legislators badly if you support the use of them and the production of them. They would all rate me badly because I know we need this to run this country. If we could run it on these, I would be for it, but we can't. We need to try to grow these, we need to try to get into a hydrogen society, we need to try to do every kind of renewable there is; but at the same time, we must produce oil, natural gas, coal and nuclear to run this country because that's what has run it, and it's what will run it for the next 30 years, according to the Energy Department. 
   Let's say they're wrong. I think they're off on natural gas. I think the use of gas is going to explode because of the carbon debate, because the carbon debate is going to cause us to shut down coal, not permit new coal plants, not allow us to do coal-to-liquid or coal-to-gas, which would be a clean way to use coal; but they're not even going to let us experiment. 
   The administration is pushing cellulosic ethanol. That's good and fine, but I keep arguing with them, we need to be experimenting with clean coal technologies and liquids and gas from coals because we have it. Other countries have done it. We just need to know how to do it in a cost-effective way and then try to, if carbon is the big issue, secure the carbon. And if we passed the NEED Act, we would have the money to do it. 
   Energy availability and affordability will depend on whether America is a competitive Nation. If this Congress doesn't wake up out of its slumber, if it doesn't wake up and realize that affordable and available energy, and I understand why they're asleep. All of our lifetime there has been lots of energy, and it's been cheap, cheap, cheap. It's not cheap anymore, it's expensive and going to get more expensive. 
   Available, affordable energy will slowly shut this country's economic base down. And the working people of America that don't have white collar jobs, that go to work and make things, as we try to get back into the growth of nuclear, the new plants that are being designed, the bases of them, the big, huge cast bases will be shipped here in a ship from Japan because we no longer have a casting plant big enough to make them. 
   Much of the high-tech parts of our nuclear plants will be built in Germany because we haven't built them in a long time and we've lost our capacity. I say down the road, how do we defend our country? How do we build the jets and the planes, the tanks and the equipment, the sophisticated equipment? We're going to be buying the parts from foreign countries, who may not even be our friends, built by foreign people who aren't even in this country and Americans will not have the jobs. 
   Energy is one of the biggest job creators. When you produce energy, a lot of people make a living. When you buy it from Saudi Arabia, when you buy it from foreign countries, when you buy it from the Mideast, the only Americans who get a job are those who sell it, a retail job. I was a retailer, and I'm not saying that in any way to cast aspersions; but right now here in Washington, DC you can buy gasoline made in Russia. Not only produce the oil in Russia, but the gasoline was made in Russia, came here in a ship. Not many Americans get a job from that. But when you buy gasoline made from an American refiner and produced from American oil, a lot of people have made a living. 
   I hope the next time I rise on this floor there will have been some action from this body, there will have been some voice from the White House. I haven't heard much from the Secretary of Energy about the energy crisis. Every time I talk to any of the people in the Cabinet that advise the President, I talk to them about my views and they listen intently, but not much action; and no action from this Congress, zero action. 
   Available, affordable energy has the ability to shut the economic base of this country and take us down and make us a second-rate Nation. And the number of poor people in America will continue to grow. Working-men jobs for the people who work with their hands, who have made this country, they're the heart and soul of this country. I was the son of a seventh grade-educated steelworker. He was a darn good dad. He taught me to be honest, work hard, always do my best, and never quit and give up. And those principles he taught me I have lived with all my life. And I thank him today and my mother for teaching me to be honest and upright. But they were working people. Neither of them had graduated from high school. They worked with their hands. They were ambitious. 
   There are lots of Americans that need jobs to work with their hands, to make things, build things. And this country will no longer be a country that makes things and builds things and creates things. We're just becoming consumers as we export our jobs. And energy, available, affordable energy has exported more jobs from America than any other issue. I will debate that with anybody. And it will continue to export the good jobs we have. 
   Dow Chemical, the biggest employer and manufacturer of chemicals in the world, used to pay $8 billion a year for natural gas in 2002. In 2006, they paid $22 billion, and they came to Congress and begged. I had them at hearings, and they begged us. The President of Dow Chemical begged this Congress to take action on opening up energy supply for this country so he didn't have to go across the ponds in other countries to build his plants so he could compete. They make products for the whole world, and they can go to countries where energy is a third, a fourth, a fifth of what it costs here and labor is cheaper. And that's why they're going. They don't want to go. He said, I don't want to go. I'm loyal to America. And many companies are loyal. I talk to company CEOs that say they spend millions every year trying to cut energy use, but the energy costs just go up faster than their energy use. 
   Americans need to conserve. We all need to use less. We need to learn how to use less. We need to figure out how to quit wasting energy, and more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient homes. But folks, we need to have a Congress and an administration that puts energy at the front door of our future and says that we're going to do whatever it takes to compete in this global economy. We're going to provide energy for Americans. We're going to open up our reserves. We're 
   going to produce the oil we need, the gas we need. And we're going to use coal the clean way. 
   And, yes, we're going to expand nuclear. And, yes, we're going to even maybe build some dams and do some hydro. And, yes, we're going to do everything we can to promote renewables, all of those. And we're going to try to get into hydrogen. It will be decades, but hydrogen society, where we can make hydrogen. If we learn to make it out of water, we've got it made. But then we still have to learn how to transport it safely and how to utilize it, how to sell it, how to process it and distribute it. It takes years and decades to do that. In the meantime, we've got to continue with what we have, and it's nuclear, coal, natural gas and oil, and renewables. 
   We need to make energy one of the top issues in this Congress, not tomorrow, not the next day, but now. Not next year or two years from now; it may be too late. When we open up a new oil field, if we open up the Outer Continental Shelf, it's 10 years before you have any real production out there. If we start coal-to-liquid, coal-to-gas, it will be a decade before we would have real production. We need to be starting it now. We need to be figuring out how to speed up the process of nuclear to run this country. America needs a Congress committed to available, affordable energy. 
   And I'm going to conclude, you know who owns the oil in the world? You know who the biggest oil companies are? It's not Exxon. Exxon is the 14th largest oil company in the world. They're pretty big. But 13, unstable, nondemocratic governments are bigger oil companies. And they've kicked out Big Oil in the recent years, taken over their investments, captured their monies. And they're running the oil production in most parts of the world. Ninety  percent of the oil is owned by unstable governments. And any one of them that tips over, along with a Katrina-type storm in the gulf, can give us unaffordable energy overnight. We're vulnerable to a storm; we're vulnerable to unstable nondemocratic governments that don't even like us. 
   How can America go to sleep? How can this Congress go to sleep at night knowing that we are vulnerable to those we don't even trust with our energy future? 
   This Congress must have an energy policy soon, and it can't be the one I talked about first that takes energy off the table. It has to be one that puts energy on the table, yes, does conservation, does all of the things to conserve and use wiser, but produces the energy this country needs to compete. 
   We're in a global climate, we're in a global economy today, and America must figure out soon that everything we do in Congress must enable our companies to compete in the world; and affordable energy is one of the first things we ought to be doing.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (AMERICA'S ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Texas and my friend from Illinois. It's a pleasure to work with both of you. And I just wish the majority of Congress had a deeper interest in energy. 
   I guess I find it confounding that this is a chart I have been using all year and it doesn't work anymore. This was the rise. This is annualized by year. It doesn't have the spikes that happened in those years, but this is the annualized figure. And I just find it confounding that last week we were bouncing all over 98, almost 100 one day, and not a word spoken in here about energy. It wasn't a priority. It was not even a discussion on this floor, except for a few of us, in 5-minute speeches or hour speeches, like tonight, talking about it. But the committee is not meeting. The conference committee is not meeting. And I guess the question is how difficult does it have to get. Because here we are approaching the winter season. People have to heat their homes. And 58 percent of them use gas, I think 30 percent use electricity, and 9 percent use home heating oil, and then there are a few other mixtures in there. But nobody seems to be concerned.  
   I was a retailer for many years, supermarket operator, and I remember back in the 1970s and 1980s when we had the energy spikes that were really severe back then. And as a person in the food industry, you would think people would always have money for food. 1979 and 1980 were very difficult years in my business because people didn't have money to spend. 
   What we forget about is 50 percent or maybe 60 percent of Americans spend every dollar they make every week. They don't have any money in the drawer. They don't have any extra cash in the bank. They spend. And when energy prices spike like this, and especially in rural America where I come from, transportation costs are high in big rural areas. People have to travel to work, travel to church, travel to school, travel for everything. And then when you pay your transportation bill and then your home heating bill, in rural America, again, bigger old farmhouses, not a lot of new housing, not as energy efficient as the new modern housing, so they have high home heating bills. And when they spend an inordinate amount for home heating and for transportation, then they have less money. And my friend from Illinois was talking about it. I had tough springs. Usually in my business, I was lucky to break even through March. You had to make your profits the rest of the year. But in those years it was into May before I cracked into a profit because people didn't have money to buy basic fundamentals, food. I was in the food business. And that's what is going to happen in America this year. It could challenge the holiday season because it came this early. 
   I didn't expect $95 oil, and I'm going to tell you why. Everybody has told me that if we had a major storm in the gulf, and we have been very fortunate in America, we haven't had a major storm in the gulf in 2 years. The first time ever that we've gone that length of time. Everybody has told me this summer, when it was 75 or 80 and I asked what a major storm in the gulf would bring us, $100 oil. A couple weeks ago, I asked a gentleman what would a storm in the gulf bring us. He said $120 oil. Could we handle $120 oil? I'm not sure. I don't think we could handle $95 oil for a long period of time and keep the economy moving, because a great amount of our economy is you and I shopping, buying goods and services, and when we have so much money being consumed by energy, it has to come out of our budgets. And those who don't have any extra cash, credit cards will only give them so much, and then they are going to start cutting their spending. 
   I think the thing that's interesting is the prediction for America. We have finally gotten this on a chart that anybody could figure out. Usually you see charts and you have lines going up and down. This is energy usage in America up to now. This line in the middle to my left is the projection by the Energy Department of what energy we are going to consume in this country. It doesn't change much. 
   Now, I wish this nonhydro renewable line up here was just exploding, this red. That's what we are pinning our future on. Now, I'm for it. We are subsidizing. The people are saying we are holding it back. We're not holding it back. This is the projection of the Department of Energy of what renewables are going to grow. That's wind and solar. That's the mix. 
   Look at hydro. Because we are not building dams and because dams are still being removed, hydro decreases. Now, there is a little bit of growth in nuclear here, very little, if we build the 35 plants that are under permit process tonight. We need to build those new 35 nuclear plants just to keep electric generation at this percentage that it is. I think it's 8 percent, if my memory is correct. 
   Coal, now I happen to disagree with the Energy Department. They have coal growing. With the CO  
   2 debate, coal is going to diminish. And I think their projections were made before CO 
   2 and carbon became the issue, because I see coal plants being refused by States all over the country. There are permits being denied. And they don't show gas growing, and I disagree with the Department of Energy on this estimate, and they may be a little bit wrong on renewables. But if you double this line, that's a lot wrong. It still isn't very much, is it? Now, I look for gas, because every country that started dealing with carbon as a pollutant and started charging carbon taxes or penalties, natural gas is the big winner because it has a third of the carbon of the other fossil fuels and has no NO 
   X or no SO 
   X, nitric oxides or sulfur oxides; so I predict that it will come up here and coal will decrease. That's my opinion because, as my friend from Illinois has talked about, we ought to be building. I'm going to give the White House credit. They are pushing six cellulosic ethanol plants. I think that's good. That's pretty new technology. That's using woody waste or biomass of any kind to make ethanol, and I think that's good. But I think we ought to be building 10 coal to liquid plants and some coal to gas plants.
   Then we look down here at oil. Oil is going to be a major part of America. Now, we have heard lots of speeches on this floor that we are going to replace oil. I wish that were true. I wish that was possible. But what we have decided in America is we are not going to produce oil. We're going to restrict it. The government owns a lot of the oil in America. They have control of all offshore, and 80 percent of that has been locked up by three Presidents, and all the Congresses in the last 26 years have voted to literally not produce energy. In Brazil, who is energy independent and everybody says it's ethanol, well, ethanol is a piece of it. It's a nice piece of it. But they've opened up their Outer Continental Shelf, and I think they just found one of the biggest finds ever off South America just in the last week, and Brazil is producing offshore like we ought to be producing. 
   But oil is what scares me. Number one, we are not producing it, so we are part of causing the shortage in the world. Number two, we are gaining dependency on foreign, unstable governments, 2 percent a year. And I think if we pass the energy bill that I hear rumored about, it will probably be 3 percent a year. And I hear people say we are going to be energy dependent. Well, there is no way in our lifetime, probably my lifetime anyway, and some of you may be younger, that we can be energy independent. We can be less dependent. I would like us to be energy independent, but we can only be less dependent. But this one just keeps marching on. 
   And why is it $95? Well, we have countries like China who are producing energy all over the world. They are locking up oil and gas reserves in every part of the world. Every part of the world. They're going to be producing less than 50 miles off of Florida with Cuba, as are five or six other countries. In our waters, actually, they are going to be producing oil that we should be producing. But we have locked up those 200 miles offshore and cannot produce there. 
   So my biggest fear, and I will just ask the question, what if one unstable administering country topples? What does that do to the price of oil? What if we have a storm like Katrina? What does that do to the price of oil? What if terrorists struck a couple of refineries, some pipelines, some loading stations in foreign countries where we get a lot of our energy? What happens to the price of oil? Will China stop anytime soon purchasing and outbidding us? I predict in the near future you are going to see China announcing a major oil coup with a major supplier that has been part of our supply system. That's what they are doing. They are out there locking it up. 
   It's interesting in the summertime we get 20 percent of our gasoline from Europe. This spring we had $3.09 gasoline in my market, which we have $3.09 now, at $63 oil. We now have 90-some-dollar oil, and we still only have $3.09 gasoline because gasoline has not yet caught up with the oil price, plus at the end of the summer there was a surplus of gasoline. This spring when the driving season started, Europe was short of gas themselves, so they couldn't supply us with the gasoline they normally did. So there was a shortage in the market, and, of course, that runs the marketplace up. So $3.09 gasoline was abnormal, just as abnormal as $3.09 gasoline is in America today with $95 oil. We are probably looking at $3.49, $3.50 gasoline would sort of be the price if it was being used out of today's oil and with not a surplus of supply. 
   Here is a chart that tells what we use: 40 percent petroleum, 23 percent  natural gas. Now, this figure has grown a lot because 13 years ago we took away the prohibition of using natural gas to make electricity, and we went from 8 or 9 percent of our electricity made with natural gas. We only allowed it to be used for peak power in the morning and evening when we have to turn them on and off. And a gas generator is cheaper to build, doesn't take very long in comparison to other generators. But now we produce 23 percent, and that number is growing every day, and it will really grow. Coal, 23 percent; nuclear, 8 percent; hydroelectric, 2.7; biomass, 2.4; geothermal, .36; wind, .12; solar, .06. 
   Now, here is where our future lies, and the only one that is really growing is biomass. How is that growing? Well, we are using it to heat factories. Wood waste has now become a commodity. I'm from Pennsylvania, the hardwood capital of the world. We are now drying most of our wood with wood waste instead of using fuel oil or natural gas because it's cheaper. A million Americans will heat their homes this year with wood pellets. A lot of people don't know about a pellet stove, but a pellet stove is a new, modern, beautiful stove that you can heat your home and it's wood waste. That is a new consumer in the market. And also power plants that are burning coal will top them with wood waste so they can just slide under the air standards where the coal they are burning might just have a little too much emission in it. So they'll use 20, 30 percent wood waste, and they will be able to meet the EPA air quality standards. So woody biomass is the growing one. And now when we go into cellulosic ethanol, we are going to use wood waste again to make ethanol, cellulosic ethanol. 
   But let's say we really put our effort behind, and we are, solar. So let's say we double solar. Now, it is hard to double something in 10 years. But let's say we double it in 5 years. So we would be at .12. And if we double it again in another 5 years, we would be at .24, if my math is still good. And we take wind and we do the same. We could do that for a number of years, a couple decades. We'd still be struggling to get a percent of our energy from wind and solar.     
   And yet people seem to think, and I don't know why, but they seem to think it's ready to take over, it's ready to be helpful. But it's not ready to replace that big wide band I had on oil, it's not ready to replace that big wide band on coal. Nothing is. And hydroelectric is decreasing because we're taking dams out and it's becoming a smaller percentage. And nuclear will decrease to 7 percent if we don't open the new plants because, as electric use goes up, if nuclear doesn't go up with it, it will become a smaller figure. 
   So when you look at this chart, now I'm going to switch gears on you for just a minute, what do we hear? Here's what we hear is coming now: this is, I believe, the ``no energy bill.'' It locks up 9 trillion cubic feet in the Roan Plateau. The Roan Plateau is a huge, clean natural gas field in Colorado that was set aside as a naval oil shale reserve in 1912 because of its rich energy resources. This means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas in the OCS bill that was passed in Congress last year, that little piece in the gulf, will be put off limits. It has already been through NEPA, it's all ready to lease, it's ready to produce. Legislation that's coming before us is going to take it away. What makes sense about clean green natural gas? 
   Next, it locks up 18 percent of the Federal onshore production, America's natural gas. And that's because of policy changes and further NEPA studies, and making it more difficult to permit is going to slow down the production of both oil and gas production in America. 
   I was responsible for a small amendment, but a good amendment, in the energy bill in 2005. It took away redundant NEPA studies because NEPA studies take a year. I talked to people who had leased land and in 7 years have not drilled yet because they were still doing NEPA studies because they had to do one for every piece of the process, not a NEPA study, and then produce it with a NEPA study to delay. Locks up 2 trillion barrels of oil shale from the West oil shale. 
   Now, everybody talked about the tar sands as oil that we couldn't get. Canada has been persistent. They're now producing 1.5 million barrels a day. Much of that is coming into our States to be refined. In fact, they're trying to enlarge refineries in the northern tier, having a lot of problems. Lots of resistance about enlarging those refineries, but that's necessary to produce. But the tar sands are one of the fields that's growing in Canada that's available, and they tell me that shale oil has even greater reserves. 
   It's going to lock up 10 billion barrels in Alaska, the national petroleum reserve, breaches legitimate legal contracts that are out there that companies have signed to produce oil by trying to make them null and void with legislation. 
   And then the one that really is bad, $15 billion tax increase. I have two oil refineries in my district, one in Warren, Pennsylvania, American Refineries, and in Bradford, Pennsylvania the original Kendall refinery. They're going to pay, if this bill passes, a higher tax than any other business in Pennsylvania or in America. Does that make sense, that we're going to tax people who produce energy with a greater tax than those who produce steel or food or other products for a profit? I don't think it does. I know what it's about; it's about the hatred of oil companies. Well, Big Oil does not produce. 
   The other fact I want to share with you, 90 percent of the oil in the world today is not owned by an oil company. The 14th largest oil company in America today is Exxon. The other 13 are countries like Mexico, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia, all our good friends. Dictatorships, unstable governments, unfriendly governments, and they own about 90 percent of the oil. 
   And now what's worrisome, from what I'm told, is they're using this huge cash revenue for social purposes, and they're not putting the money back. So it could happen in the very near future that those countries could not produce enough oil to supply America. And that's why we have $95 oil, because we're not doing coal-to-liquid; we're not doing all the other things we ought to be doing. We're hoping that renewables can replace oil. I wish they could. 
   I think America, I think this Congress, I think this administration needs to take a very serious look at the economic viability of this country if we continue, if all we have coming at us is a bill that has, it shouldn't be no energy, it's less energy and more taxes. 
   I thank the gentleman for allowing me to share.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I disagreed with the IAs. I look for gas to get bigger and coal to get smaller because of the CO  
   2 issues. 
   Now, let's say they're wrong here, because I'm sure lots of people will disagree with them. Let's say they're 100 percent wrong. Right now, when you see hydro and nonhydro, you see hydro decreasing as much or more than nonhydro increases, so there is really no growth in renewables. Let's say they're 100 percent wrong. So instead of having 5 percent, we're 10 percent. It wouldn't even take up the growth need of America. So let's say they're wrong, and we're going to be twice that effective at renewables. I hope they're wrong, but it won't take care of the growth. We will still need this oil, we will still need this gas, we will still need this coal.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That's the electric map, and it shows, it's the same as this. But it does prove my point, that coal goes down and gas goes up; it gets bigger. But up here at the top, you have the same thing. There is almost no change because the growth in volume needed more than absorbs all these new renewables.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. One thing I want to mention, what has happened to these high energy prices? Dow Chemical paid $8 billion for natural gas in 2002, $22 billion in 2006, and they are now building plants all over the world because we can't afford America's energy. That is the message we need to realize. Many companies are doing that, and we need to prevent that.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Well, I guess I think the thing we need is we need an energy policy. We need to get serious about energy. Energy, in my view, is the number one challenge of America. I've said this in many speeches; I think it equals terrorism and the security of America. But if energy prices continue to skyrocket and we cannot compete in the global economy and the average American can't get a workingman's job, we are going to be a country in trouble. We are going to be a country that is not first rate. We are not going to be the leader of the world. 
   Energy availability and affordability should be the number one issue in the Congress. It is unlocking the OCS. It is unlocking the Midwest. It is wiser use of energy. It is using less for transportation, more efficiency. In fact, conserving in the next 5 years is probably all we can do, because everything we have talked about takes 5 to 10 years to produce fruit to bring it to market. So I think America's, I think that the real terror threat of this country is available, affordable energy.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it's a pleasure to join you this evening and talk about an issue that I think is vital to America's future. 
   We're in the beautiful time of year. My favorite time of year is the fall season, and it's arrived. We have now a week of fall behind us. The cool days and cold nights will soon be here all so quickly, and the home heating season will begin where Americans will struggle this year to keep their homes warm, and American factories and businesses and manufacturers will struggle to pay their very high energy bills to continue to compete in a global economy, manufacturing, processing and distributing their goods. 
   Home heating oil prices this year will be record highs with the $80 oil that's upon us and that has been with us for more than a week now. Home heating oil prices will have the largest increase, and those who heat with home heating oil will be under severe pressure to be warm affordably. Propane and natural gas prices are scheduled to go up again this year, propane a little more than natural gas, but both of them, and that's barring no storms in the gulf. 
   We've been very fortunate in the country. For a year and a half now, we have not had a major storm in the gulf, and why that's a problem is 40 percent of America's energy comes from the gulf. And when we have a major storm there like Katrina and Rita in the same year, there's huge disruptions in the ability to produce both gas and oil and refine it and process it and ship it around this country, and it will help prices to raise drastically. 
   I guess the question I ask tonight is, what is Congress doing? Is it a discussion? I don't know about you. I've listened to the last two Presidential debates, one Republican, one Democrat, and the press asks the question, but not one question while I was listening was asked about energy. I find that amazing because here we are with $80 oil. Is it a new floor? 
   My chart, which goes through 2006, has this up as high $60, but we're clear up here in the $80s. Most people were very concerned that $60 and $70 oil would put us into recession, but when you look at the constant increase in the last 5, 6 years of oil prices just skyrocketing and no stopping, and the scary part on oil is that historically in the world marketplace we had slush. I mean, we had extra oil. There were 10, 12, 15 million barrels of oil that were available to be produced daily if we needed them. I'm told today that we're lucky between 1 million and 2 million barrels a day is available if we have a crisis. 
   So, if we would have a storm in the gulf that could take a few million barrels off the market and you had one of our Third World countries that ship a lot of oil have a governmental problem or a terroristic attack one of their sending stations or their pipeline systems, then we could lose 4, 5, 6 million barrels of oil a day. You would see prices at $100 very quickly. $100 oil will have a severe crisis in this country. 
   We now have $7.50 gas. It's going up weekly now. The season is here. We're through the soft season, and much of the gas in the ground for this year's storage was put in at much higher prices than that. Then you have the storage costs and the distribution costs, and we're talking about a sizeable increase in natural gas prices this year. 
   As I was showing you the oil chart, oil prices continue to spike, and yet we hear nothing from Congress. 
   We don't hear questions and much discussion in the Presidential campaigns, and I find that confounding because energy, reasonable, affordable energy, is why America is what it is today. 
   Natural gas prices, you know for a long time natural gas prices were around $2 or less, and then we had spikes, and then we came back down. And now we are on the same path as oil. We're right up here about here now, $7.50. That's out-of-the-ground price. That's not the price you and I pay at home or the companies pay. Pipeline charges, storage charges, distribution costs, I mean it's clear up in here, $12, $13 gas when it gets to us as a consumer. 
   But the price out of the ground, this is the price out of the ground that we start at. We're up here. We will be soon approaching $8, and that will continue to rise as heating season comes and industry continues to use. 
   Well, why is this? Why is America having this constant skyrocketing prices in energy? Well, here's one of the reasons. 
   About 26 years ago, the President of the United States and two Presidents since and Congress both put moratoriums on producing offshore. That's called our Outer Continental Shelf. The States control the first three miles, and then the United States Government controls the next 197 miles to 200. 
   Now, the only place we've historically produced is right here. 40 percent  of our energy has come from this little area, and last year we opened another small area down here that will be helpful, but will certainly not solve our problem. 
   So America is the only country in the world that has locked up its best oil and gas reserves that cannot be produced. Countries like Canada don't do that. Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, all environmentally sensitive countries, they all produce out here. Everybody's given kudos to South America, to Brazil for being one of the first countries that is now energy independent, and everybody thinks it's their ethanol. Ethanol was a part of it, but they opened up their Outer Continental Shelf. They produce out here. 
   There's tremendous gas reserves around Florida. There's tremendous gas reserves up and down the coast and oil reserves. Now, there are those who are afraid. The last oil spill we had offshore was at Santa Barbara in 1969. That's a long time ago, and we've never had a natural gas spill and we never will because natural gas escapes into the air. 
   Now, we could also put some huge blocks in here of where we, the government, have locked up some of our best reserves in the West, and for some reason, we, being one of the largest users of energy in the world, have decided that we're not going to produce it. So we're very much the reason, because of those charts that I showed you previously are just going almost straight up. 
   Now, we do have energy bills in the House and the Senate, and they will be considered at some point in time. They're not scheduled yet. They were supposed to be on the floor now, but they've not been scheduled yet but we think they will be. The only problem is, as you see at the top of my chart, we call them the No Energy Bill because they don't produce energy. 
   They lock up 9 trillion cubic feet of America's natural gas. It cuts off production from the Rome plateau, a huge clean natural gas field in Colorado that was once set aside as the naval oil shale reserve in 1912 because of its rich energy resources. This means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas from the OCS bill passed last Congress in the gulf, the Rome plateau has already gone through NEPA, that's all the environmental assessments, and is ready to lease. This position was not in the original Resources Committee bill and was added without any public hearings or very much debate on the House floor. 
   It also locks up 18 percent of Federal onshore production because it requires redundant environmental studies. I authored an amendment in the 2005 energy bill that was very helpful. Those who were opposed to us producing energy in America, and there's lots of those, all the environmental groups that had decided that we shouldn't produce fossil fuels, that they're just not a part of our future, even though later I'll show you they almost have to be, this bill that we passed took away the redundant use of NEPA. NEPA's an environmental assessment that has to be done before we do much of anything. 
   What they did was this is akin to doing an environmental review for a parking lot with one car and then requiring a second environmental review for a second car in the lot. It makes companies who have leased land do an environmental assessment for the overall outlay or overlay of a proposal to where they're going to drill and produce. Then it does another environmental assessment for the roads they're going to build. Then it does another environmental assessment for every well they drill. These are many, many months long, sometimes yearlong proposals that have to be developed on how the environment's going to do. 
   So the use of redundant NEPAs was a way of just stalling and stopping production, and we were pleased when we got that legislation passed in 2005, because in the West there were people who had leased land for 6 and 7 years and never been able to produce it. So we were able to help them. 
   This bill locks up 2 trillion barrels of American oil from the Western oil shale. The bill stops the leasing program for oil shale reserves on Federal land that hold enough oil supply for the United States for 228 years. This is more oil than the entire world has used since oil was discovered at Drake Well in my home district nearly 150 years ago and over twice as much oil as the entire OPEC cartel holds. 
   Meanwhile, China's developing their shale oil. Now we're in the process of developing how to get that oil released. It's like similar to Canada's tar sand oil. They've worked at that for a decade or more, and today they're producing 1.3 million barrels of oil just above the American border.     
   A lot of that oil is coming down here to be refined, thank the good Lord and thank Canada. But they are at 1.3 million barrels, and they hope to be at 3 to 3.5 million barrels at some point in time, but they have developed the ability to release that oil from the tar sands. It has been known to be there, and that is very similar to our shale oil. 
   Are we learning how to do it? Are we continuing to start and get some pilot projects going? No. The legislation before us will take it off the charts. 
   Well, we go on down here, it locks up 10 billion barrels of oil from the National Petroleum Reserve. Again, that's in Alaska. This bill will make it much harder to produce energy from Alaska's national oil reserve that was set aside in 1923 for energy for this country. 
   It has only recently begun to be explored starting with leases issued by the Clinton administration. Under current law, the Department of Interior can extend the time of a lessee who might have begun to produce energy without fear of losing his lease. 
   Producing oil offshore is a complicated, expensive process. Sometimes if they have a lease of a certain period of time and they don't get their leasing done as quickly as they would like to, maybe for many reasons, caused by government, then they want to take away the right to renew that lease and extend it. Again, it would take that amount of oil, 10 million barrels, away from the marketplace. 
   Then we go down to breaking legitimate offshore energy contracts. We have contracts that were given for the deep water oil. We have companies that have spent $2 billion producing energy out in the deep water, I mean, way out there several, many miles deep, very expensive, very costly, and they have not yet made a profit. 
   But there are those who think they should be paying royalty, even though they are not making a profit, and want to, with legislation in those contracts, or prevent them from having contracts again. That's not exactly how the American economic system works, but there are many here in Congress who want to confiscate those leases, even though they were legitimately given by the Clinton administration. 
   It also inflicts a $15 million tax increase on American oil and gas companies. Why would we do that? 
   Well, there are those here who hate oil companies. A few years ago, Congress lowered the corporate tax rate for all manufacturers and processors, and that included oil producers and manufacturers. This no energy bill singles out the oil and gas industry, hiking their tax rate back up to 35 from 32 percent. So my refinery in Bradford, Pennsylvania in my district and my refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, United in Warren, Pennsylvania, will pay 3 percent more corporate taxes than all the manufacturers and processors around them. 
   Will that help us to have more energy in America? No. Will it make it more expensive to produce American energy? Yes. Does it make sense in the big, long-term of energy production for America? Of course it doesn't. 
   Now, the next one down here, all the legislation ignores alternative energy like coal-to-liquids. It seems like coal has been shut out by many. Coal cannot be a part of our future, according to many, but we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. 
   The future of coal is not just using it to make electricity by burning it, but making liquids from it. During World War II, Germany was blockaded. They didn't have oil, so they made oil out of coal, and the Fischer-Tropsch method was one of them. There are several others now, but we need to, in this country, in my opinion, we need to be force-feeding some coal plants that are making liquid fuels, diesel and gasoline and jet fuel, out of coal.  
   We also need to be making natural gas out of coal. We need to have those plants online, refining that process so it can be cost-effective, because these plants cost from $2- to $3 billion apiece for just a medium-sized plant, a very heavy capital investment. They need some incentives, some loan guarantees, some help, to get these plants up and running to make sure that that's an alternative. 
   Why do we want to do that? We need to have as much energy available to Americans as we can get, all kinds of energy. We will get into that in a moment. 
   The more alternatives we have and the better supply we have, the more affordable the price will be. Today, those first charts I showed you with the prices skyrocketing, it's because we have a shortage of almost every kind of energy. So we believe that it's very important that we have coal-to-liquid. 
   Also, on the last one here, we raise false expectations by mandating that we have 15 percent renewables used, that's called the renewable standard, to make electricity. Now, I wish we could make 15 percent of our electricity from renewables. We are currently, on an average, nationally, at 3. Some States and some plants are doing better than that, but they have resources and the ability in their area to do that. 
   Not every part of the country can do wind and can do solar. The sun doesn't shine often enough or the wind doesn't below regularly enough. Those are very specific areas where you can do that. And other places just don't have the renewable fuels that could be used. 
   We think the Federal standard of 15 percent will force companies into making electricity in very expensive ways and will skyrocket electric prices, especially in areas where you just don't have access to renewables. We believe the 2007 energy bills that are currently in the Senate and the House are no energy bills. 
   Now, there are some good conservation measures in there. There are some things in there that will stimulate renewables. But there is no energy there. It limits gas, it takes away oil, it has nothing for coal, and it makes it much more difficult to produce in existing fields. 
   Now, let's look at where we are at in the country today. Energy in America, these are 2005 charts, we still have them from the Energy Department but they haven't changed very much in the last year and a half. 
   Forty percent of our energy is petroleum. That's oil. Twenty-three percent is natural gas. Twenty-three percent is coal. Now, this has been a growing figure, because 12 years ago, we took the lid off and we allowed an unlimited amount of natural gas to be used to make electricity. We use to limit that, that it could only be used for peak power, and so a very small amount was used. But now a lot of natural gas is used for electricity. In fact, about 20 percent of our electric comes from natural gas. Nuclear has remained 8. The only reason it has remained 8 as electric use has went up is because we've squeezed more production out of our old plants than they were designed for. We have been upgrading them and working them overtime. 
   These plants are producing more electricity, but the bad news is that we need 35 new plants online by 2020 to stay at 8 percent. That's going to be a big job for America. So that means if we don't do that, we are going to have to substitute something else for the nuclear that's not going to grow maybe that fast. We have 35 companies with permits now, it takes 4 years to design them, 4 years to build them and with delays, that's at least a decade. 
   So if we don't have those online by 2020, then we will be looking at other ways to make more electricity that we are not making out of nuclear. Then we have hydroelectric. There is no growth here. This is a shrinking figure because actually we have the environmental groups that want to tear out the dams we have. They want nothing to do with damming up a waterway and using that to make electricity, so that's a figure that will continue to decline. 
   Now, biomass is the one that has been growing. That's wood waste. It's being used to make pellets to heat our homes. We have pellet stoves and pellet furnaces. That's the new fuel, so that's using waste wood, sawdust and trimmings that are ground up and made into pellets. 
   Now, biomass is also being used as topping the load on electric plants that are using coal. Because to meet air quality standards, if they use 80 percent coal and 20 percent wood waste, they can sometimes meet the air standards, depending on the coal they are burning that day. So wood waste is an add-on. Wood waste is going to be used down the road making ethanol, we believe. 
   But biomass is the one that's growing. We also, in the wooded areas, like my district is a big timber district, we're using wood waste to heat all of our dry kilns now that we use to dry our wood. We use to use natural gas and fuel oil for that. I shouldn't say all, but many. Because of the prices of natural gas and fuel oil, you can't hardly afford to use it anymore for that purpose. Many of the small factories where they process wood, they use the waste to heat the factory. So biomass is sort of finding its own market, especially in the areas where you have strong supplies of it. 
   Now, geothermal is a very good form of energy, but it's a costly investment. It's where you either drill into the water table, and then when you pump that up into your system, you take heat out of it in the wintertime, or you take coolness out of it in the summertime and send it back cooler or hotter. 
   Another way to do it is to put a big loop pipe system in your property. Then you get it below the frost line, where it stays at 54 degrees all the time, and you take heat out of it in the wintertime, and you take coolness out of it in the summertime. You will use a fair amount of electricity with that because there are a lot of pumps, but this has been a pretty affordable type of energy, and it's renewable. You use some amount of electricity, but not as much as you would in direct electric heat. 
   Now, wind and solar are the ones that we are putting an awful lot of pressure on, and everybody is talking about. Wind also has its opponents. We had a bill proposed this year by the Resources Committee that actually stated that if you found a dead bird or bat at the foot of a windmill, it was a criminal offense. Now, that language has been removed, but somebody believed that, and I also serve on a committee where one of the gentleman there raises the issue there all the time with the Fish and Wildlife Service, why they are not arresting windmill operators where they find endangered species birds or bats at the foot of the windmill, that that should be a criminal offense. I have heard that argument each year now for a number of years. It has its opponents. I am not one of them. But wind has limited application. When the wind doesn't blow, you have to have a redundant supply. That takes us back up to natural gas, because natural gas is the generation where you can turn the plant off and on quickly. That's why we historically used it for peak power in the morning and night, when we're running our factories and we are using a lot at home, that's when the greatest demand for electricity was and that's when we turned on the gas generators. When the wind doesn't blow, you turn on the gas generator. When the sun doesn't shine and you don't have solar coming, you turn on the gas generator. 
   Now, what I think the American people and too many Members of Congress don't understand is how small they are. Wind currently is 0.12 of a percent. Solar is 0.06 of a percent. Let's say we could double them every 3 years. This would be 0.24, and this would be 0.12. Let's say 3 more years we double it again, and then we would be 0.48 and 0.24. We are still a very small fraction and now we are already 6 years down the road. And, you know, to get to 1 percent would take decades. 
   So we have to realize, as good as these are, and as much as we want them to be a part of our energy supply, they are limited in the ability they can produce. So those are the facts sometimes that sort of get lost. 
   Now, another issue I want to mention is the new issue here, the issue that's getting a lot more attention here in this House and in the Senate is climate change. Climate change is the fear that the use of fossil fuels and putting CO  
   2 into the air is harming our environment and causing the surface of the Earth to warm. 
   Now, there are many scientists that don't agree with that. I know the sun  scientist from MIT doesn't agree with that. She has a pretty strong history where when the sun hits us directly, we warm for a decade or so. Then when the sun is hitting us a glancing blow, we cool. But there are those today that are convinced that it's CO  
   2. That's what we breathe out. We breathe out CO 
   2 and we breathe in the oxygen. The plants take in CO 
   2 and they process oxygen that we breathe. It's that even exchange. But there are those who feel that we have too much CO 
   2 in the air and are really wanting to treat CO 
   2 as a pollutant, and they are really somewhat being successful with that, which I think is going to be harmful. 
   Now, I am not saying we shouldn't be observing it, I am not saying we shouldn't be working on how to sequester carbon as we use fuels, that we shouldn't be working on all those things, but I look for us to put on measures that will raise energy prices up to 30 percent or more because of having to deal with the carbon issue. The carbon issue makes it very difficult for coal to participate, and that's what we own the most of. And it makes it very difficult for petroleum. That's what we don't have a lot of but we use a lot of for our transportation system. 
   Then when that happens, we will be putting great pressure on natural gas, because it has no NO  
   X or SOx, very clean burning, and it has a third of the CO 
   2 of any other fossil fuel. It will move to gas if we force companies to measure how much CO 
   2 they are putting into the air, and it will decimate certain industries. We probably won't make lime and cement in this country. I guess what worries me is when we don't manufacture anything in America. 
   The current natural gas prices have caused us to lose 50 percent of the fertilizer industry in the last 2 years. The petrochemical industry is in the process of building all their new plants offshore, where natural gas is a fraction. That's another point I want to make is most Americans are not aware that our natural gas prices are the highest in the world. 
   How is that? Well, it's not a world price. When oil has been $80, and that's a scary figure to me, and nobody is talking about it now. It's just kind of like, well, it's $80, but natural gas prices, when we have $80 oil the whole world has $80 oil, so competitively it keeps us even. 
   But when natural gas prices are two, three, four, five times higher here than in other countries, it gives those countries a huge advantage. I have been promoting that we must, as a first priority, open up natural gas. 
   Before I go to that, I just want to mention, here is the chart that shows us our oil imports as we continue to become dependent on foreign, unstable countries.     
   And we're up here right now. This is of course old data. And we're up here right now at 66, and we're going up 2 percent a year and we'll soon be at 70 percent. 
   Now, is that bad? Well, a decade or so ago, when oil was much cheaper, you know, over in the 30, 20 range, and back here when it was below 20, and I remember when it was back here at 10. Now, these are the average prices per year. So during this period of time we've had $10 oil a number of times. But then in the year average, so this chart is the annual average price, so it doesn't show the $10 level. But when oil was 20 and $30 a barrel, it was much more affordable. And a lot of people said, well, we should be using their oil and saving ours. Well, we did that. Well, when you get up here to where you're at $80 oil, it seems to me that that's pretty concerning. And how do we compete as a country when we have $80 oil ongoingly and could have spikes from that? 
   Now, we believe that, I want to go back to this chart here. We believe it's time to open up the OCS. And our proposal opens it up for natural gas only. It's a bill that we now have 165 cosponsors of. It's called the NEED Act. And it also sets aside funds for a lot of very good purposes. But it would open up both of our coastlines and the rest of the gulf for natural gas production only. 
   Now, the States currently control 3 miles. We're prepared to give them, with this legislation, 50 miles. And they could open that if they chose to, but they would have to pass a law asking for it to be open. The next 50 miles would be open automatically, but they have the right, within 12 months, to pass a bill to say they don't want to produce. So we have States' rights for up to 100 miles, where now they just have it out to 3 miles. Then the second hundred miles would just be purely open. 
   So we believe that making natural gas available and stabilizing natural gas prices, we can preserve the petrochemical industry in this country, we can preserve the polymers and plastic industry in this country, we can keep what steel and aluminum manufacturing and bending and shaping companies we have left. 
   I predict that if we don't stabilize natural gas prices for home heating, for business heating, and for production of products, we will be making bricks and glass in nearby South America where gas is a buck and a quarter, when our average retail price will be 11 or $12. Those companies will go there and save millions of dollars in energy costs, and they can ship those bulky products like bricks and glass to us in a boat in a day or two. Not very far down here to South America. 
   We have enough competition with China and India. Their natural gas prices are way lower than ours, maybe a third of ours, and so they have not only the cheap labor advantage, we're giving them an energy advantage. 
   And I guess the part that I've struggled with in this Congress, Mr. Speaker, is it seems like Americans are just immune to the impacts of high energy prices. Now, this winter, as I started, when we start heating our homes, we will feel pain. The poorest among us will struggle to heat their homes this winter, especially when they live in older housing that's not as tight, doesn't have the new windows. 
   I found it interesting this year, I'll just step on a sidebar here for a minute. The Speaker of the House wanted us to have a less carbon imprint for the Capitol, and so she's mandated that we switch from using less coal to heat the Capitol complex and more natural gas. Well, that costs us an extra $3 million because gas is much more expensive, and it sets a precedent out there to all of our local governments and State governments and all the other departments of government that they ought to do the same. And I see universities doing it now, switching to clean natural gas, spending more money. 
   But what we didn't do is this building and all the buildings we work in still have single-pane windows that let the heat out or the cold in. It would seem to me that the first thing we should have done was to put modern windows in our buildings to keep the heat in and keep the cold out, because there's a huge difference between a single-pane window and a triple-pane window, whether it keeps the heat in and the cold out or the cool in in the summer time and the heat out. So windows should have been our first measure. But no, we're putting in the little curly-cue light bulbs in all our offices now, by mandate, by law. I'm not opposed to them. I have some in my house. But they unfortunately are all made in China. They're not made in this country. And so that's another part; we are mandating China products to light our facilities around here. And we're now forcing natural gas to be used instead of coal, which will cost us more but will send a precedent around the world. And if everybody, if all the governments do that, all the agencies do that, all the educational facilities do that, we'll put tremendous pressure on natural gas. 
   Now, our natural gas bills, I explained that and I'll just explain it again. The first 50 miles will be controlled by the State, only produced there if they pass a bill and ask to be opened up. The second 50 miles will be open, but the States have a right to close it with legislation if they can pass it and their Governor signs it, the second hundred miles would be open for natural gas only, not oil. 
   Now, we also have some things that we think are pretty important in this bill. And as you look there, we're going to give $150 billion of the royalties to the States. That's an incentive. So as they produce in all the coastal States, they will then have the ability to have some of those monies for their reserves, and we think that's important. 
   Then we have $100 billion for the government. The Federal Government will  get $100 billion utilizing the resource on the Outer Continental Shelf over a period of years. And we're going to have $32 billion set aside for energy research and production, real money, not a few $100 million, but billions of dollars to do the essential research and develop the renewables that can help us in the future. And $32 billion set aside in a fund for carbon capture and sequestration research. That's what we're talking about today. Not talking about it. We would get affordable energy for Americans to heat our homes and run our businesses, and we'd get $32 billion over a period of time to figure out how to deal with the CO  
   2 issue, if that's our number one problem. 
   Now, I think affordable energy is a far bigger problem than CO  
   2. I know the pain that's going to be felt in this country for the home heating costs and the small business costs, but the job losses as we, and we have the potential of losing millions of jobs in America, more going to foreign countries because of our energy prices. That's the concern, because when the working man loses his chance to make a living, how does he afford to heat his home? How does he afford to have a home? 
   Now, we have some areas that have been wanting cleanup money for a long time, and the first one here is the Chesapeake Bay. They've wanted $20 billion, and their proposal says they need $19 billion to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, and the State's put a little bit of money, the Feds put in a little every year, but it's kind of trickling in. This would provide them over a period of time the money they need to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Great Lakes, the need, their studies have all shown, their organization's the same. They need $20 billion to clean up the Great Lakes. Well, this bill 
   would provide them with the $20 billion to clean up the Great Lakes. 
   Then the Everglades. You know, we've been putting money in the Everglades every year. Well, this would give them $12 billion for Everglade restoration. 
   We've been talking about the Colorado River Basin restoration. Well, this would give them $12 billion for restoring the Colorado River Basin. 
   And the San Francisco Bay restoration. This would give them $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay. 
   Now, the issue that I always find confounding here, every year we give more and more money for LIHEAP and weatherization, and rightfully so, because the reason America has the highest energy costs in the world is Congress and the administrations that have been running our government, both parties, we have not, either party, adequately went after energy. I think my party is more on the right track than the other party, but neither party has done what we need, and that's why we're in trouble today. 
   And then when we're in trouble and it costs so much to heat our homes, we have to help the poor. We also have to save energy by helping the poor weatherize their homes, because they don't have the money to spend to save money. So we put $10 billion into LIHEAP and weatherization to help Americans to heat their homes. 
   I'm going to go back to the first chart here. World oil prices. Here we are, as I started, we're now clear up here, clear up off the chart, $80. All week long, in fact, it's been as high as $83. Have we heard much about it on television? No. Hardly mentioned. Do we hear about it in the Presidential debates? No. Has it been any special meetings here in Congress? No. Has there been any discussion in the last few weeks about the energy bills that are languishing to be considered and need to be conferenced? No. It's like it doesn't matter. 
   Mr. Speaker, it does matter. $80 oil. I've talked to experts in Federal agencies that have dealt with energy all their life. They told me in a private meeting that they thought $60 to $70 oil for a long period of time, or for, you know, a decent period of time would stall our economy. And then we hit $70 oil for quite a while, and then it got up around $75, and it still hasn't stalled our economy. And they said they know we're getting close to that price point. They don't know where it's at, but they don't think it's far away. And folks, when that happens, it takes a long time to come back, because here's the problem. 
   As we go back to the big chart that I had, I want to put it back up here. The problem that we have with energy, to open up the Outer Continental Shelf to get gas, and then maybe at some point oil on out, it's 10 years from the day you pass a bill till you have any quantity of energy. If we do new nuclear, from the day you put some new incentives in or figure out some ways to entice companies to invest or government helps invest, you're 10 years away from production. Everything we're doing, and we don't know when. We hope it's soon, but we don't know when wind and solar will be a real mark on the chart, will be percentages of our energy portfolio. There are people who think we are right up there. They've been saying that for a decade. And nobody's holding them back. They're highly subsidized. 
   I haven't talked about ethanol. Ethanol is the one that's happening with petroleum. You know, we now use 6.3 billion gallons of ethanol this year. There's almost as many plants in production being built as there are in production, that in a year or two will double our ethanol. And that's from corn. The price of corn has gotten high. Now, our food prices are rising, and the cost of making ethanol's very high. It's almost an energy swap. I'm not against it because it's American made, but there is some danger in putting too much of your portfolio when you're using food to make your fuel. 
   And the cost, what do we use to make ethanol? Natural gas. Huge amounts of natural gas. If we can break the hydrogen link, what do we use to make hydrogen? We use natural gas. Biodiesel, we use natural gas and soybeans. Ethanol, natural gas and corn. Natural gas is the one, the only one that gives us hope. It can be a bridge. Natural gas could replace a third of our auto fleet and really cut back our need for oil. But there's no push to do that. It would burn cleaner. The only problem with natural gas in vehicles is you can't drive as far. You can't have a big tank. But all your short-haul vehicles, all your taxicabs, all your small engines, all your local tractors, a lot of your construction vehicles that are nearby and can be fueled up every night, they could all be on natural gas. That's an exchange of carburetion. Our current engines will burn natural gas. And so natural gas, if it was more affordable, if we got out on the Outer Continental Shelf and produced it and we had lots of it, it's our hope till renewables grow to where they can really help us. 
   My concern is there's no sense of urgency here. Congress does not have a sense of urgency. The White House does not have a sense of urgency. Where do we get our oil? Eighty percent of the oil today is owned by governments, not companies, Third World countries, very few democratic governments, dictators, unstable governments, they not only own the oil, they're producing it. And when government produces, it's never efficient. It's like Mexico.     
   Mexico is loaded with energy. We actually export some gas and oil to Mexico because they just can't get out of their own way. Their government is so inefficient and so ineffective, they can't get it out of the ground and get it refined. They actually buy some from us. 
   The most energy we buy from any one country is Canada. Thank God, to the north of us, if Canada really produces gas and oil and they are reaching into the new fields with the oil sands and so forth, they're moving. They are an environmentally sensitive country, but they are moving forward with their energy production. And, fortunately, we benefit from that. 
   But to the south of us, 80 percent of the oil is owned by unstable countries. They not only own it, they're producing it, they're refining it, and they're marketing it. And what they are doing that is very troublesome is they are skimming off the profits, instead of putting it back into the business, and using it for all their social programs and for people to live wealthy life-styles, and their energy patches are often a mess. Many of them have kicked out Big Oil. Big Oil has been chased out of country after country. Their investments have been captured. I could name a whole lot of them, Nigeria, El Salvador, Russia. Country after country has nationalized their energy, chased the big boys out that actually had the expertise, and  are now running their own refineries. We have 80 percent of our oil coming from countries that are not run like a business. And they are not democracies. They are not efficient. And so the supply of petroleum could decrease quickly if two or three of those countries get in any kind of trouble or would have any kind of an explosion in their major pipelines or refineries or sending stations. 
   Terrorism is a threat to energy. Terrorists could put this country in serious straits with little explosives in the right places. It's a scary world. 
   I guess the part that bothers me tonight is as we approach this season, this heating season for America, Congress ought to have on its agenda that we are going to provide affordable energy for Americans by producing adequate amounts of energy so we can bring the prices down. 
   Prices aren't set by big oil companies. Everyone blames them. Prices are set by the stock market. And every day they bid on what the price of natural gas is going to be, what the price of oil is going to be, what the price of fuel oil is going to be, what the price of kerosene is going to be. Those are all set by traders on the market. And if it shows there's a little shortage, they run the price up, and that helps add to the price. Fear of a shortage. 
   Well, we know there is an upcoming shortage of oil and gas in America. And we also know that we are doing very little. China is building a coal power plant every 5 days. They are building a nuclear plant every month. They are building the largest hydrodams known in America. They are buying up oil and gas reserves from countries whom we have historically purchased from. And I'm not going to be surprised when we pick up the paper one of these days and we read where one of the major countries that America has been buying a lot of oil from, that China has bought their whole supply. They are going to be producing oil 50 miles off the Florida coast in companionship with Cuba. 
   Mr. Speaker, America needs to wake Congress up. We need to wake Congress up. We need to wake this administration up. We need to have a sense of urgency that America produces the energy we need. We are still 86 percent fossil fuel, 8 percent nuclear, and 6 percent renewables, and biomass and hydroelectric are more than 5. And that leaves geothermal, wind, and solar, less than 1 percent, and 83 percent of that is geothermal. 
   America needs to understand the concern that is out there about having available, affordable energy. We have always taken it for granted. It is no longer going to just happen. America needs to be debating an energy policy that will bring oil and gas prices down; will take advantage of using clean coal technology, coal to liquids, coal to gas; expanding the use of clean nuclear; no CO  
   2; looking harder at hydroelectric; continuing to grow biomass, geothermal, wind and solar, ethanol and biodiesel as fast as we can. We can't do it quick enough, Mr. Speaker. America needs to put the pedal to the metal. We need to produce energy for Americans so they can afford to heat their homes and we can afford to run our businesses so Americans can have jobs to support their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (THE ENERGY FUTURE OF AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about an issue that's not talked about enough in Washington, and on a warm sunny afternoon, where it's not real hot, it's not cold, not a lot of energy's being used. Not a lot of Americans are talking about energy, but it should be on the minds of Americans. 
   I was disappointed last night as we listened collectively to the Presidential debate. Now, the candidates don't get to talk about what they want to talk about unless they squeeze it in on the side. They get to answer the questions; and last night, not one question was asked about the energy future of America. 
   We've been a very successful Nation. We've been the leader of the world because we have had cheap, affordable energy. That has all changed. We now have expensive energy, and we have short supplies on every hand. 
   When I talk to the biggest employers in America, when I talk to the people that I know understand this country and the manufacture of goods and the process of goods and trade around the world, I say, should energy be a top issue? And they said, it is for us. To remain an employer in America, energy is our number one challenge. 
   Just to give you an example, Dow Chemical, the largest chemical company in the world, located in America, thousands of good jobs in America, their costs of energy went from $8 billion on natural gas alone in 5 years to $22 billion. That's almost tripling the costs of their major use of energy, natural gas. 
   Now, we have some energy bills moving, and we would hope that they would increase supply because when you increase supply, you decrease prices. A lot of us have struggled to understand the energy markets, but this is how I understand it in basic terms. They are not set by energy companies. They're set by Wall Street traders who look at availability of that form of energy, and they run the price up or down by the hour. 
   In the last few days, oil prices have been rising a dollar-something per day, and I checked about 1 o'clock and oil was approaching $77 a barrel, almost the highest price ever, and had been increasing hourly all week. So the price of energy is not set by the sellers of energy. It's set by the Wall Street traders on their view of the availability and the affordability. 
   Now, the bills before us, we'll look at them a little bit, I find somewhat disappointing. They cut off production from the Roan Plateau, a huge clean natural gas field in Colorado that was set aside as the Naval Oil Shale Reserve in 1976 because of its energy-rich resources. This means that nine trillion feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas in the OCS bill that was passed last year, will be put off limits. 
   The Roan Plateau had already gone through all the NEPA studies. Now, those are yearlong studies that say whether it's environmentally appropriate to produce it. They passed that test. 
   This provision was not in the original Resources Committee bill and had been added at the request, we think, of leadership because it wasn't in the original bill. This bill will make it harder to produce energy from Alaska's natural petroleum reserve which was set aside in 1923 to help America meet our energy needs in the long term. Additions of tens of trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and millions and millions of barrels of oil in Alaska's natural petroleum reserve which would have increased the likelihood of the construction of the gas pipeline that could bring 4 to 6 billion cubic feet of clean green natural gas from Alaska every day has not yet been built. 
   The bill effectively repeals language that I put in the energy bill in 2005 that took out redundant NEPAs. NEPA is a comprehensive, complicated study that you have to go through to make your environmental assessments. 
   Now, what was happening in the West, where a lot of our energy is, NEPA studies were being used redundantly. In other words, you have a study for your original plot. You have a study for the road. Each of these studies takes a year. You have a study for each well location. You have a study for everything you were going to do. And so I had people who said they had leased land 6 and 7 years prior and still hadn't been able to drill a hole in the ground and produce the energy for America. 
   So we did a simple amendment that said you do a NEPA, you do it on all of those things collectively and you go ahead and proceed. Well, the bill we have moving now takes away those redundant NEPAs and allows them to go back to multiple NEPAs. The provision alone adds red tape that will stop 18 percent of the future on-shore natural gas production and oil and hurt those least able to pay their energy bill. 
   The bill doubles the time it takes to get government approval for offshore  energy projects at a time when China is drilling within 50 miles of our shore, along with Cuba. 
   Now, also, we have portfolio standards in the bill that says 15 percent of renewable energy must be a part of all electric production. Now, that's a great goal. I don't have any quarrel with the goal. But we mandated it by 2020, and some States with their natural resources can meet that, some can't. 
   We also, with the limit of what can be renewable energy, I know we already had the Pennsylvania law which used more items in their renewable portfolio package, and so the Federal one-size-fits-all mandate, we should have had a carrot approach, where we put a carrot out there, where we encourage, we assist, we help. But this mandate will make it very difficult for States who do not have the right sources of energy available to them because it will make it very difficult for them to produce electricity and meet that mandate.     
   We have an interesting issue in every appropriations bill this year that's a mandate that CFL light bulbs be used in every building. Now that sounds good. Those are highly energy-efficient light bulbs, the little ones my wife and I fight about because I bought them and put them in, and she takes them out because they buzz and make noise and don't give quite the quality of light we are used to with our incandescent bulbs. We have had that discussion ongoing, but we have mandated them in government buildings. 
   The sad part of the story is they are all made in China. We do not produce one in America. 
   The Senate had severe changes in CAFE standards in their bill, which I think would be part of the discussion when we have a conference committee, if we have a conference committee on energy. Many Members of the House, bipartisanly, are concerned that the mandates in the Senate bill will be harmful to the American auto industry. 
   That's another issue, that we need to have more fuel-efficient cars. Nobody argues, we need to. I think we may have been a little too easy on the auto industry in America, because it seems like every time we have an energy spike, they are never ready for it, and they lose a piece of the market share. Because Americans have chosen to purchase cars that were not fuel efficient, energy prices would go up, and we would buy more fuel-efficient cars, and energy prices would come down, and we would go back to buying high gas users again. 
   We need to have a more fuel-efficient auto available to us, and we need to use our energy as wisely and conservatively as possible. But hopefully, in the end, we will have a CAFE standard that will not disadvantage the American automakers. 
   Now, one that bothered me the most, I guess, was the $15 billion to $16 billion tax increase on energy production. Now, I know what that's about; it's about the hatred of the big oil companies and their big profits. 
   Well, someone said to me one day, well, how come they have made such profits? Big oil companies over the years purchase the ability and the rights to oil all over the world, including in our country. They purchase those rights, assuming that $25 or $30 would be the price they would receive for their oil. 
   Well, we don't have $25 or $30 oil anymore, and when you sell $75 oil and you were going to be profitable at $30 oil, you are going to make a lot of money. Why do we have high oil prices and energy prices in America? Because this government and this administration have not opened up energy supply. 
   When you don't open up energy supply and you help create a world shortage, you force prices up. It's the traders in Wall Street, again, who determine adequacy of natural gas or oil or other commodities to the marketplace. 
   Now, in oil, it gets quite confusing because you will have an oil price set by Wall Street and you will have a gasoline price that sometimes doesn't make any sense. This spring we had gasoline prices higher than they should have been, as a result of 60-some dollar oil, but it was because there was a shortage of gasoline in the world. Fifteen percent of our gasoline now comes from Europe, and when Europe didn't have the gasoline for us, we had a shortage on gasoline. So our gasoline market went higher than it normally would have. 
   So it's interesting that these Wall Street players run up the price because there is a shortage in the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Yes. The issue should be, the number one issue in the Presidential debate, how do we secure adequate affordable energy for America to compete in the global economy? 
   See, we have never had to compete before, but we have countries like China and India that are stocking up on energy, all kinds of energy, acquiring all kinds of access to energy, building all kinds of power plants and hydrodams and acquiring oil and gas rights around the world, and we are sort of here sitting on our hands saying we can do it with renewables. 
   Now, I am for all the renewables, all we can get of them, but they are growing very slowly, and there has not been the willingness in this Congress and in this administration to say how do we acquire adequate energy supply.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (THE ENERGY FUTURE OF AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That's absolutely correct. We produce about 83 percent of our own natural gas. We import a lot from Canada and about 2 percent of LNG, which is liquefied natural gas, from the same area as we get our oil from. 
   Natural gas is not a world price, and a lot of Members of Congress and a lot of people in America don't understand that. Oil is a world price. The gasoline prices can vary. That's a portion of the oil. If you have an excess of gasoline in your country or in Europe, their price drops; if you have a shortage, their price goes up the same as ours. They operate off of the Wall Street market, and their markets.

   No, you are absolutely right. We as a country do not have an energy supply plan. We just are kind of riding along, I guess, hoping things will get better, but we do not have a plan. The gentleman from Hawaii is absolutely correct.  
</TEXT>
</DOC>
<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (THE ENERGY FUTURE OF AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - September 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Absolutely. I have not talked to a CEO of a major corporation employer in America who either produces energy or uses a lot of energy like Dow Chemical, U.S. Steel, Pittsburgh, PPG, all the big users of energy, and I said to them, I believe that available, affordable energy equals terrorism and a challenge to America's future. They said, you are absolutely right. Every one of them. 
   I have never had a person in that kind of a position or people that have understood this issue and have worked on it all their life and understand it who didn't agree with that. But for some reason, they don't say it publicly. I have been one of the few, and my friend from Hawaii has been one of the few who have been willing to say, hey, clean, green, natural gas can be our renewable, our bridge to the future. We need to realize that we must produce it, more of it. 
   We will take a moment here and look at American energy production. We currently are 40 percent oil, 23 percent natural gas, 23 percent coal, 8 percent nuclear, 2.7 percent hydroelectric, 2.4 percent biomass, and that's woody waste materials, geothermal, wind and solar. I guess the thing that's concerning is this is where all of our emphasis is, and ethanol. 
   I haven't talked about ethanol, but one of the other things that's in the bills is a mandate of 35 billion barrels of ethanol, and we are currently producing 7 billion barrels, mostly from corn. 
   Now, corn has been controversial because corn has gotten expensive, $1.80 corn per bushel is now $3.50 a bushel, has been as high as $4 a bushel. I am not opposed to it. The manufacturing of ethanol, 95 percent of the plants that produce ethanol use a huge amount of natural gas. 
   In fact, ethanol is sort of a swap. Some say it's a winner by a little bit. There are those who say it actually takes more energy to make ethanol, but it's American, it has given our farmers a market for grain. But using the food supply has its long-term problems. If we would become huge ethanol producers much more than today and would have a short corn crop for a bad season, food prices have already increased measurably because hog farmers and beef farmers and poultry farmers now are paying much more for their feed to feed their animals because of corn prices, and also organizations that feed the poor around the world have always used American corn because it was so cheap and are now having to pay twice as much for it as they did before. 
   So using food for fuel is not, I am saying, bad, but it has its challenges. And the other problem with ethanol is that it's corrosive and cannot be put in our pipeline system. And the cheap way to move energy around the country is in pipelines. We can't use ethanol in the pipeline; we have to blend it on surface and either bring it in tankers blended or blend it at the station. 
   Now, ethanol has its limitations. We will kind of move into the next portion here and talk a little bit about ethanol and cellulosic ethanol. The amount of importation of oil, every year our dependence on foreign, unstable countries for petroleum increases about 2 percent. Every year, that's just constant. It just keeps going up. 
   The energy bill we have before us will put another spike out here because it's going to tax energy production. It's going to make major energy fields off limits, and so we will have to do more imports. So with the energy bills that are before us, we are going in the wrong direction as far as energy production. 
   Now, let me get the other chart there on foreign dependence, or the deficit, the trade deficit, huge percentage, $293 billion is the importation of oil. 
   Now, anything we can do to lessen dependence on foreign and the purchase of foreign oil helps the trade balance for America. It's a major portion. In fact, it's about a third of our trade imbalance. When the price goes up, this number expands very quickly. 
   We are at $76, almost $77 oil today. We have not had a major storm in the gulf. A major storm in the gulf can raise prices $10 to $20 a barrel in a day or two. Here is what happened when Katrina hit. That was Katrina. We have not had a storm in the gulf since Katrina. 
   When a major storm hits the gulf, why does it increase prices? It shuts down refineries, it shuts down pipelines, it shuts down the rigs. We stop producing for months because we have to go back in and repair the system that produces it, the pipeline systems, the cleaning systems, the refineries. All that has to be rebuilt because those storms are immense. 
   Last year was the first year in a long time we had a major storm in the gulf. This year we seem to be in a major series of storms right now. We have been lucky. The last two have been south of our gulf. There is one coming now that may hit the East Coast. 
   But when they hit the gulf with $75 oil, we could easily have $90 oil. That means gasoline pump prices of $3.50, $3.75. Also at the current time, here is where America is in trouble. We are dependent on no storms in the gulf for a stable price, or a high price, stable price without further spikes, and we are dependent on no country in the world that ships our oil, most of them are unstable governments, not having a governmental collapse or a takeover or a military coup where we lose millions of barrels of oil per day. 
   We have to pray, I guess, that we have good weather, that it doesn't interrupt the gulf and that we don't have a major country producing oil topple its local government. 
   Here is the problem. This is a picture of America. We produce a fair amount of energy in the middle. We could produce more, and we talked about some of that earlier, but we are the only country in the world that doesn't produce immense amounts of oil and gas offshore.     
   Every country in the world: Canada, Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand, Australia. I mean, these are all green countries. These are countries with records of being environmentally sensitive. 
   Offshore is from 3 miles to 200 miles. That's controlled. The States control the first 3 miles. The next 197 miles is controlled by the Federal Government. We've had it locked up for 26 years. We've said, we don't need that. I disagree with that. 
   Now, we will have argument that, oh, we can't have clean beaches. All those countries have clean beaches. Oil and gas production today is not the threat to the environment it was many years ago. In fact, the last major oil spill offshore was in Santa Barbara in 1966, I believe. That's a long time ago. 
   And everybody talks about the ship, I can't think of the name of it now, the Valdez up in Alaska. That was a ship. In fact, everybody who knows offshore says that we're more in danger with ships hauling oil, which they do every day, than we are from producing it. 
   Now, what's been interesting here is I have promoted and many of my colleagues have promoted the production of clean green natural gas. They say, well, that will pollute our beaches. Well, there has never been a gas well that's ever polluted a beach. 
   In fact, 11 miles is the sight line, and if you go 25 miles offshore, nobody will ever see it, even from a tall building. It's out of sight. And clean green natural gas, it's a gas, and it bubbles into the air naturally from fissures in the ocean floor every day. And even on land, natural gas finds its way out of the reserves, through pressure and works its way. 
   In fact, I come from the original oil patch, Titusville, Pennsylvania, first oil well drilled by Colonel Drake. It was 68 feet deep. They drilled there, actually it was a dug well because they didn't have the drilling; I guess they couldn't get a driller to come in so they actually dug the well and lined the side with stone like you do a water well, and caught oil at 68 feet. Because oil had been oozing up out of the ground and that stream called Oil Creek had oil on it before we ever drilled an oil well because it naturally oozed out of the ground because that gas sand was very close to the surface,  and so they produced it there. And so I've been around it all my life. 
   And it's interesting that we've also had the argument on this floor and across the country that you just can't drill for natural gas. So we've been promoting just natural gas, hoping, because natural gas is our biggest need. Natural gas is what we heat 60 percent of our homes with, 70 percent of our businesses, and is a major ingredient in the production of fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer, 70 percent of the cost of making it is natural gas, and we have tripled the price in a very short period of time. 
   Petrochemicals, every chemical you buy at the hardware store, every chemical you buy at the grocery store is made with natural gas as an ingredient, 55 percent of the cost of petrochemicals, on average. So petrochemical companies in America are in trouble because we're paying more to make them than other countries. 
   Polymers and plastics, 45 percent of the cost of producing polymers and plastics is natural gas because it's used to heat and it's also used as an ingredient. 
   We all know that making steel and bending steel is a huge cost, and most of it's done with heating by natural gas. The furnaces are run by natural gas. So our steel industry has paid a tremendous price with natural gas, and will continue to pay a tremendous price. 
   In fact, the president of U.S. Steel told me a year or so ago, John, if you don't get a handle on natural gas prices, we won't have a steel industry in America. PPG Industries said the same: if you don't get a handle and stop this escalation of natural gas prices, we won't be in America. 
   And I'm sorry to say that if we don't get a handle on natural gas prices and stop the next peaks, where gas gets just unaffordable, we will be buying bricks and glass from South America, which has natural gas prices a fraction of ours, like $1.25 a thousand, when we are currently at about seven and many times on a winter's average it's about 12 to 13 when you pay retail price. 
   So Russia, China, India, all of our competitors have natural gas prices that are a fraction of ours. And so we believe that we need to produce clean green natural gas offshore. 
   And I'm pleased that a friend of mine from Virginia Beach, from Virginia, Thelma Drake, has come to join us on the floor; and we'd welcome her comments.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. As we look at the chart that we have in front of us, it's called the NEED Act: $150 billion will go to producing States, with an incentive for them; $100 billion will go in the U.S. Treasury, $32 billion for renewable energy research. Now, that's real money for renewable energy research: $32 billion for carbon capture and sequestration research, which is the big issue of the day, unfortunately, getting more play than energy availability and affordability. And I'm going to say this: if carbon sequestration is a bigger issue in this Congress than energy availability and affordability, this country will not compete. We have to have available, affordable energy. And the advantage of clean natural gas is it has a fraction of the carbon of the other fossil fuels. It's the clean green fuel. It's about a third of the carbon of all the other fuels. So clean green natural gas. But it has to become affordable and stably priced.  
   For the Chesapeake Bay, $20 billion, $20 billion for the Great Lakes restoration, $12 billion for the Everglades, $12 billion for the Colorado River, $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay, and $10 billion with LIHEAP and weatherization. Weatherization of course is an important component there because it helps poor people make their homes energy efficient. 
   We're joined by the lady from Tennessee. We're delighted to have you with us today.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Reclaiming my time, it's interesting. Here I have a chart in front of me that I have not seen before but I found very interesting today. Twenty percent of our electricity now is produced by natural gas, and that has been the big user of natural gas that has really forced natural gas prices up because we changed that about 12 years ago. Prior to that you were not allowed to use natural gas to make electricity, only for peak power in the morning and evening when you have this surge. A gas generator you can turn off and on, but a coal plant you can't. A nuclear plant you can't. 
   But here is the current cost of electricity: Nuclear electricity costs $13.54 a megawatt hour. Coal costs $20.80 a megawatt hour. Natural gas, $49.51 a megawatt hour. Nonhydro, which would be wind and solar, costs $68 a megawatt hour. And the reason for that is that we all wish that wind and solar would produce a lot more energy than they do, but the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine, and when it doesn't shine and it doesn't blow, you have to have another system that you've paid for like a gas generator that you can turn on or turn off as the wind blows or doesn't blow and the sun shines or doesn't shine, because we have not yet been able in batteries to store this energy, or in some sort of a heat tank, to where we use it later. We have researched with billions of dollars and we will continue to research, but those are very expensive forms of electricity.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Yes. The cost for nuclear is $13.54, and there is a new nuclear. Coal, $20.80; natural gas, $49.51; and nonhydro, $68. Now, we need them all for the portfolio, but we have to have affordable, available energy or Americans won't have jobs. In my view, energy costs are the biggest job killer in America and have been this decade. We blame it on other things, but the cost of energy since it has spiked has stayed there, and we now are at a high plateau where future spikes are coming. We just need a storm, we just need a country to topple, and we'll have $100 oil. And we know $100 oil would be $4 or more for gasoline. We understand that. 
   I yield to the gentlewoman.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for her comments and for coming down and sharing today. 
   I think the number one issue we need in America is to have a strategy to open up the Outer Continental Shelf for natural gas first, and, further on out, hopefully down the road, oil, because we need both. 
   Natural gas, though, is a clean, green fuel that is low in carbon emissions. It's not a nitrous oxide problem. It's not a sulfuric acid problem. It's a clean, green fuel. And why we have not utilized it as the bridge I find hard to understand. We have had a presidential moratorium and a congressional moratorium for 26 years. The only country in the world to do that. 
   We talk a lot about Brazil's ethanol. Ethanol is part of their portfolio, but Brazil also opened up their Outer Continental Shelf and are now producing lots of natural gas and lots of oil offshore, so they are energy self-sufficient, with ethanol being a piece of it. 
   Now, they make their ethanol out of sugarcane, which is far less costly because we have a two-step process. We have to change the starch in corn to a sugar and then we change it to alcohol, which is the fuel. So we have a dual process, and it takes twice as much energy to do that. The production of ethanol is a high-energy consumer, probably as much energy as we produce, but it is trading foreign imports for American made, so I support it. 
   Now, the push at the White House has been for cellulosic ethanol, which I am in support of too, but it is still, unfortunately, in the test tube. The President was here on the floor talking about it last February, and a few days later I was told that he asked to go see a plant and, unfortunately, there wasn't one. He had to go to two laboratories to where it is being studied. And cellulosic ethanol will be made out of any plant life that is decaying. It could be garbage from our garbage stream. It could be grass like switch grass and other kinds of grass. It could be cornstocks or peapod waste or any kind of waste stream from our food supply, or it could be cellulose from wood, any kind of woody waste. And you then make alcohol as you ferment that. Now, hopefully, that is going to be more cost-effective and will not be competing with our food supply. And I commend the President for producing that, but I think we need to do a number of things. 
   First, we need to expand the conservation wise use of energy. If Americans were told up front where we are with energy availability and affordability, I think each and every American will do something to conserve and more wisely use energy. But I don't think Americans have been adequately informed. I think the press have been very negligent. But, of course, Congress and the White House have been negligent about talking about this issue. The press certainly have not had it on their agenda and have not often asked it in the presidential debates, and we hope that will change. We mustn't waste energy. 
   Recently here in the House we had an initiative that the Capitol complex would be less heated by coal and more by gas, and that was a carbon statement. That bothered me a little because if everybody in the country, if every government does that, all Federal agencies do that, State governments do that, universities, and some universities have already done that, if they all switch from coal to gas, we are going to put more pressure on natural gas and increase the shortage of natural gas and increase the price. What disappointed me was that was the first initiative to have a wiser energy use for Congress and the complex we house, all the buildings we work in. But every window in all of these buildings is still a single-pane, leaky window. Not one energy-efficient window has been put in. It seems like we ought to keep the heat in and the cold out before we change fuels. 
   We need to assist companies and individuals who use a lot of energy with using energy more wisely. That is a government educational process. We need to open up the OCS. We need to open up the Outer Continental Shelf for the production of energy, specifically natural gas. We need to open up more of Alaska and more of the West for oil production. 
   The President has funded six pilot plants for cellulosic ethanol. I have been urging them to fund six pilot plants that take coal and make liquid fuels. That is a German process. When we blockaded Germany during World War II, they made their fuel out of coal. The fissure tropes process, several other processes that have been developed in this country, there are ways to do that. You can make natural gas out of coal. But for some reason, there has been a reluctance in this Congress and a reluctance in this administration to use coal, our most abundant fuel, for liquids and for natural gas, thus lessening our dependence on foreign, unstable countries. 
   We need to figure how we speed up nuclear energy. Nuclear energy is safe. France is, I think, approaching 80 percent nuclear energy for their country, the production of electricity. We had a process here that took, I think, 10 years for a permit. We downsized that in the energy bill to 4 years to permit and 4 years to build, so we now have an 8-year process to build a nuclear plant.     
   One of the problems we're having is that many of the components that are needed in the energy plant have to be bought from foreign countries because in America we don't make the castings to make a nuclear power plant any longer. We're buying those from Japan. I'm told a lot of the other portions are coming from Germany. We no longer have the technology in-house. I find that scary. 
   We must expand the use of clean coal technology. We have the fluidized bed process that we use in Pennsylvania to burn waste coal, the dirtiest, nastiest coal, and burns it cleanly. And if you burn good coal with the fluidized bed process, and if you incentivize the building of new plants to replace the old plants, but it's almost impossible in America to permit a new coal plant. We have put coal off limits. So we're not going to use it for liquids, we're not going to use it to make gas and we're not going to use it to make electricity. And we're not going to open up the Outer Continental Shelf for oil. 
   Folks, we cannot conserve our way out of the energy crisis in America. We need to conserve. We need to use energy very wisely. But if we don't have an energy plan for available, affordable energy for America, I will guarantee you that within a decade, we will not be the superpower of the world; we will not be a front-runner nation. We will be a second-rate nation. 
   We have huge competitors today. America has never had Chinas and Indias nipping at their heels taking away business every day. Those companies have energy plants. They're building nuclear plants. They're building hydro plants, dams. They're building coal-to-liquid plants. They're doing it all. They're acquiring rights to oil fields that have historically been ours. They have a plan for energy availability and affordability. 
   Yes, Americans must conserve and use energy wisely. But Congress and this White House must have an energy policy that says we're going to have available, affordable energy. And in my view, at the front of the pack should be clean green natural gas. And our bill, the NEED Act, opens up the Outer Continental Shelf after 50 miles. We give the States control of the first 50. The second 50 will be open to natural gas only. And the States will have the right, with their legislature passing a bill to say they don't want it open. The second 100 miles will be open for natural gas only. That gives the States control of the first 100 miles for clean green natural gas. We think we ought to be producing more than that, but we're struggling to get clean green natural gas. 
   So we say offshore should be our first initiative. We should have coal-to-liquid plants being built online so we can  refine that process. We need to be promoting more nuclear. We need to have all the renewables that we can produce; but, unfortunately, there are only a little bit over a percentage today. And many people are holding that out as the answer. I wish that was the answer; I would be all for it. But those that are telling us that we can conserve and renewables will be our energy portfolio are not being honest with the American public. 
   Just to show you, just a few months ago a bill was introduced in this body that said, if a bird or a bat is found at the foot of a windmill, it would be a criminal act. And that same day I think the Wind Association, and God bless them, I'm for them, but they stated that we would be at 20 percent of the energy portfolio in a very short time, I think in 10 years. I wish that was true, but it's not true. We can't get there that quick. The wind only blows a portion of the time, and we have not been able to store the energy and keep it and use it later. It only blows part of the time. We have to have a redundant source, clean green natural gas, and a complete portfolio for America so we can have jobs in America, so Americans can heat their homes, run their businesses, and compete in the world economy. We can compete with anybody if we're given a fair shake; but we must have available, affordable energy if America is going to continue to be a leader of the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Does the energy bill help Americans who are struggling to heat their homes and drive their cars? For affordable energy, the answer is no. 
   Despite claims to the American public that they will put policies in place to achieve energy independence, the Democrats' energy bill will not produce a single BTU of energy. 
   To achieve energy independence, we must replace imported energy with our domestic resources. Unfortunately, the Pelosi bill will make us more dependent on foreign energy, not less. 
   The Democrat bill relies on much-needed conservation through increased CAFE standards 13 years from now, which will change the fleet, and the production of 15 percent of our electricity from renewables, hardly enough to replace the 13 million barrels of oil we import every day. 
   If we want to achieve energy security and reduce our dependence on foreign energy, we must increase domestic production of oil and gas in America's energy-rich areas. 
   As American families and small businesses continue to tighten their belts to cope with soaring energy costs, Congress should be doing everything in their power to relieve this unnecessary burden. Yet today the House is taking a step in the opposite direction, increasing our dependence on energy from foreign, unstable countries.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I stand ready to support every renewable form of energy that we can produce. We can't do it fast enough. But a year ago we had $55 oil. Today we have $100 oil, and I'm not going to blame the Democrats like you blamed Mr. Bush. We are all guilty. Congress is the reason we have hundred dollar oil. And I think the Bush administration could have been a lot more aggressive in its energy policies, but the 2005 act had a lot of things in it that your side fought that are reaping benefits today. 
   But hundred dollar oil is because this Congress has decided we are not going to produce oil and gas anymore, clean natural gas. We are not going to do coal to liquids, coal to gas. We are going to do just renewable. 
   Let's look at the chart. 
   At the top, the orange, the buff, the yellow, yellow is nuclear, coal, this is our energy use today, and this is a projection on the right-hand side, on the right-hand side of where it's going to be by 2030 according to the Energy Department. 
   If we double wind and solar in the next 5 years, it will be less than 3 quarters of 1 percent of our energy use in America. We have to double it. We have to quadruple it before it really makes a measurement difference. 
   Oil companies make huge profits when they own the rights to oil and Congress locks up the ability to harvest them in America and forces us to go offshore to buy them. We have been gaining 2 percent a year since I have been here. This will be the 12th year. Every year dependence grows 2 percent because Congress has locked up supply. We have to go over there to buy it, foreign unstable countries. 
   And when you own it and we lock it up and the market goes high and crazy, Wall Street does that. Oil companies don't set the price; Wall Street does. I have been trying to produce clean natural gas. I haven't been able to get a majority for that. Clean and natural gas. I haven't been able to get a majority for that. And that's the one that's vital to the manufacturers of America because it is not a world price, and we have the highest prices in the world.  
   However, what hope does this bill actually give to young families with home heating costs? Nothing. What hope does this bill bring to poor folks living in rural and urban America who struggle to drive to work, to school, to the doctor's office, to do their shopping? It doesn't do anything. What hope does this bill give to independent truckers who are struggling to pay their fuel oil bill, soon approaching $4, if they try to make a profit with their independent trucks? It doesn't do anything. What does this bill do for rural and suburban seniors who keep their thermostat at 58 degrees last winter and this winter so they can cut their fuel costs? It doesn't do anything. 
   What does this bill do to prevent the tragedy that happened in my district last year when an elderly gentleman tried to warm, on a sub-zero night, by putting coal in a wood stove and he burned in a fire? This bill would not have saved his life.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I find the testimony from the gentleman from New York interesting. He mentioned pellet stoves, one of the new future heat. 800,000 Americans now heat their homes with a pellet stove. There's 30 or 40 pellet mills sprung up around the country but with no government incentive. 
   Now, we ought to be incentivizing people to be able to heat their homes with woody biomass. Woody biomass has been the fastest growing energy but without government incentives. We need to be incentivizing that. 
   He also mentioned cellulosic ethanol, which is from woody biomass or garbage or sweetgrass. That's in the laboratory. We're all for that. But it's in the laboratory. There is no refinery producing that kind of energy today at any scale at all. In fact, we have not yet designed the first refinery. It's future. 
   The only thing in all of the bills he mentioned that produced energy was we stopped using 70,000 barrels a day in the Strategic Reserve, and that's when we use 21 million barrels a day for the country, we save 70,000. That's the only production that's been passed. 
   As we look to my left, we have a chart that shows offshore locked up. Oil and gas out there proficient. Lots of it. Locked up. Well, if we want to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, there's a way to do that. The NEED Act, H.R. 2784, my bill does that by producing offshore, putting a part of the royalties. We have 32 billion for carbon capture, 32 billion for renewable energy, 100 billion for the treasury, 150 billion for producing States, 20 billion for the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Now, these are at old gas prices. This is gas. Natural gas was $12.50 when I left my office. Last year at this time it was $6.50. That's the gas we were putting in the ground for next winter. Americans are going to get whacked this winter because we're putting gas at almost twice the value in the ground for winter storage than we did last year.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman from Utah, my good friend, for his wise words on innovation. I think we are going to be forced into innovation. That is good. But I will have to say the current prices of driving a vehicle and heating a home this year in my rural district are going to be prohibitive for some people being able to handle it. 
   Their budgets are not prepared for the prices. Because as we have felt the oil prices, natural gas only increased marginally last year, but today the price for natural gas out of the ground is $12 and 40-some cents. Last year at this time, it was between $6 and $7. We are approaching a doubling of natural gas prices. 
   At this time of the year, we don't use a lot of natural gas because we are not cooling much and we are not heating hardly anything. So we have surplus. We are using it for industrial purposes, which is big, and to generate electricity and to run our plants, but we are not using it at the home as much. So this is the time of year we normally put it in the ground. 
   Last year, we were putting $6 and $7 gas in the ground. This year, it's currently, in the last few months, $11, now $12 gas, and seems to be going up a few pennies every day. So we don't know where that is headed. But the fear is we have a storm in the Gulf, which always interrupts supply, we could have $15, $16 
   gas, and that would make home heating almost impossible next winter. 
   Just to share with you, as he was talking about innovation and change, I come from Titusville, Pennsylvania. I live in the little town of Pleasantville, Pennsylvania, 5 miles from there. But I was born 1 mile from Drakes Well, the first oil well in the world. It was drilled in 1859. And I vividly remember as a young boy, down the Oil Creek Valley, a stream called Oil Creek because it always had oil on it because the way oil perked its way out of the ground naturally. So there was oil on that stream. 
   And when we had the rush of oil, those hills were naked. There was no vegetation. The trees were gone. But today, it's almost like a virgin, beautiful oak-cherry forest. And the streams there, Oil Creek naturally produces both trout and bass, which is not very common. And the brooky trout streams flow into it all the way down. It's a beautiful, pristine area. And nobody did anything. They just left nature purify it. So oil is not the horrible thing. It's a hydrocarbon. It went back to dirt. The trees grew and the streams are pure and wildlife is very abundant. 
   Now I guess what we want to talk about is production. How did we get to $125 to $135 oil and how did we get to this tremendous price on natural gas? Many years ago, we had a legislative moratorium to lock up the Outer Continental Shelf. Now back then natural gas was $2, oil was $10, and many argued that we shouldn't use ours, we ought to use theirs. Whether that was a wise argument or not, I won't say, but they have won and it has been locked up ever since. 
   In the early nineties, President Bush I put a Presidential moratorium on top of the legislative moratorium. Now what is a moratorium. The Continental Shelf is from 3 miles offshore. The States control the first 3 miles. Then the Federal Government, we the taxpayers, own the next 200 miles. That is considered our Continental Shelf. And most every country in the world, in fact, every country in the world produces there. Canada produces right above Maine. Canada produces right above the State of Washington, Great Britain produces on their continental shelf; Norway, Sweden, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia. It's just common practice. In fact, everybody gives Brazil great credit for being energy independent, and they give credit for ethanol. Well, ethanol is 15 percent of their energy use. The rest of it, they opened up their Outer Continental Shelf, had a big find out there, and they are now self-sufficient. They don't have to buy from anybody. Wouldn't it be great if America would be self-sufficient? 
   I think we have a lot more oil than was anticipated in this country. I know we have a lot of natural gas. We are currently importing 17 percent of our natural gas. We wouldn't even have to do that. We get 15 percent from Canada and we get 2 percent from LNG, which is from foreign countries similar to where we buy oil. 
   So we have locked ours up. Now what does that do? Well, we have locked it up and so we have taken our supply off the market. Now what is this Congress doing to react to that? Two or three weeks ago, we passed a bill, very thoughtful bill. We said, We are going to figure out a way to bring OPEC into court. We are going to bring OPEC to court. We are going to force them to produce for energy so we have more petroleum. Currently, we import 66 percent of our petroleum, about half from that area of the world and about half from Canada and Mexico. So we are going to force them because they are not producing enough. I think Saudi Arabia produces 12 million, I think another one, 7 million; another one, 6 million; another one, 5 million. But someone has determined that is not enough so we are going to have to bring them into court. 
   Now how you take someone to court for not producing enough oil when we've locked up our Outer Continental Shelf, we've locked up most of Alaska, we've locked up most of the Midwest, now how a country can think that we can sue our neighbors for not selling us enough oil when we have refused to produce our own doesn't make a lot of sense to me. 
   My taxpayers back home laugh at that when they hear the debate, but it's not funny. But we actually passed a bill to do that, as if it would make a difference. And I don't know what court we would bring it into. 
   Let's look at our energy use today. We are about 40 percent petroleum, 23 percent natural gas, 23 percent coal, 8 percent nuclear, 2.7 hydro, 2.4 biomass. And this is the one people have not paid a lot of attention to. This is woody biomass. This one has grown measurably in the last few years. Eight hundred thousand Americans use a wood pellet stove today to heat their homes, and that is sawdust compressed. All our dry kilns in the country where we dry our wood uses wood sawdust to heat those rather than buy propane or fuel oil. A lot of factories in the rural areas are using wood waste also.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That's one of the problems. Wood waste has great potential. I also have a company in my district that has built a wonderful wood waste boiler. It burns cleaner that natural gas and will burn even green wood, and it burns it cleanly. But the Democrats passed a bill that prohibits wood waste from public land from being utilized. We are not allowed to produce, which makes no public sense.  
   I don't know who got the theory that letting every tree grow makes sense. When you thin a forest, it grows much faster, which takes CO  
   2 out of the air. The biggest place to get rid of carbon in the air is plant life for us. And tree growth. Because you lock the carbon up. The log we cut down is carbon. We take it and put a roof on our house or floor in our house or windows in our house or furniture in our house. That is carbon.     
   You lock the carbon up. So we have taken it out of the air. Well, by not pruning the forest, your forest becomes like a jungle. It grows very slow, and it dies naturally, which turns to CO  
   2. As it dies naturally, it turns to CO 
   2 and emits into the air, just the same as we do when we breathe and when we burn something. So nature itself puts CO 
   2 back in the air. 
   But biomass is kind of a sleeper. I think it can do a lot. And if we could unlock the National Forests, if we could start marketing an appropriate amount from the National Forests. You know, 40 percent of America is owned by the government. I don't think people realize that. Almost 50 percent of America is owned by some level of government, when you include counties and State governments. 
   My State owns about 5 million acres in Pennsylvania. Most States don't have that much forest land. But the whole northern part of Pennsylvania is heavily owned, some by the Federal Government, much by the State, and a lot of that is not marketed adequately either. But when you market a forest adequately, when you prune it adequate, it is sort of like a garden. You prune the old out and you leave the young grow, and it is very healthy for the environment. It is much better for wildlife, and it is certainly better for clean air. 
   Geothermal, a good form of energy, but it is expensive installation. Wind, solar. 
   Now, here is the problem we face. How did we get here? I am going to tell you who I blame. I blame Congress. But who influenced Congress? Congress has pressure. Well, there is an organization. I made this statement the other day that Hugo Chavez and the Shah of Iran don't need lobbyists to keep us as a customer. The Democrats and the environmentalists continue to lock up domestic reserves, and that forces us to send billions of dollars over there to buy their oil. 
   Now, the Sierra Club is number one. They are against oil shale development, they are against coal liquefaction, they are against offshore energy production that I talked about a minute ago. 
   You have got Greenpeace. They want to phase out all fossil fuels. That means from here up, 86 percent of what we are using today has to go away. That is Greenpeace. 
   Environmental Defense says power plant smokestacks are public health energy number one. Folks, that is 51 percent of our electricity. 
   League of Conservation Voters. Coal to liquids. Most of us believe that coal to liquids or coal to gas is our future because we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. And when we learn how to do it, if carbon is the issue, I think we can could learn how to sequester the carbon, right along with the ability to make liquids from coal. Then we wouldn't be buying oil from other countries. We would be using the liquids made from our coal. 
   Defenders of Wilderness. It says every coastal State is put in harm's way when oil rigs go up in our coastal waters. Well, you know, folks, every country in America produces energy out there and has the rigs out there. 
   Next Wednesday, we are going to offer this Congress the first real chance we have for production. We are going to be offering offshore production. We are going to have legislation, an amendment to the Interior Committee, that will remove this. In the Interior Committee every year there is legislation that locks up, that says we cannot spend a dollar to lease the Outer Continental Shelf. That is 200 miles offshore. 
   We are going to remove that from 50 miles out. Now, 50 miles is giving a big cushion. A lot of countries do 20. Some do 25. Most don't do 50. We are going to give 50. Eleven miles is sight, so after 11 miles, it is four times the sight line, more than that, so there will be nothing anybody can see. And every person in the energy business, MMS, that is the minerals and mine management people who manage this program, said that the most environmentally sensitive way to produce energy is offshore. It improves the fishing. It doesn't hurt it. You are not disturbing wildlife. You are not disturbing anything. So offshore energy is our most environmentally friendly way to harvest energy and use it. 
   So we are going to give this Congress a chance next Wednesday, not the whole Congress, but just the Interior Subcommittee, to remove that moratorium. Then we will have to maintain it in full committee if we win and then maintain it on the floor, and then we will have to deal with the Senate, which is always our tremendous challenge. 
   So as we go down these, we have these groups, Natural Resource Defense, coal mining. They are opposed to coal mining. They want coal. That is 50 percent of our electric grid. 
   Center for Biological Diversity. Oil and gas drilling on public lands has devastating effects. 
   Folks, it is a new era. You talked about technology. We have new technology. We know how to do it right. You drill a 6 inch hole in the ground. With gas, you just let gas out. With oil, you pump out oil. It does not have to be an environmental disaster. 
   Then Friends of the Earth, the other one, the eighth one, liquid coal is dirty and a costly fuel. 
   Folks, these eight groups, Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Environmental Defense, League of Conservation Voters, Defenders of Wilderness, Natural Resource Defense Council, Center for Biological Diversity, and Friends of the Earth, those are the people you need to thank for the energy of America being locked up. It is their influence on Congress that has prevented us from a providing energy for America. They are wrong, folks. They need to lose that argument. We need to show them that we can produce energy. 
   Now, as far as the world is concerned, you know, when it was $2 for gas and $10 for oil, maybe they were right. We should use their's. I remember that argument. Folks, at $125 to $130 a barrel, at $12.50 for natural gas, I think it is time to use ours. 
   What is the other benefit of using ours? When we produce American energy, the landowner makes money, whether it is the government or a private person. The promoter of the well makes money. The pipeline guy makes money. The driller makes money. The hydrofracking people make money. The processing station, whether it is gas or the refineries for oil, make money. Millions of dollars of wealth are created. Billions of dollars of wealth created. Hundreds of thousands of people have wonderful jobs and can maintain a family and home. So producing our own energy will put a lot of Americans to work, especially in rural America where I live. 
   Now, they claim, and when you hear all the talk, it is the bottom three that are ready to take over, with geothermal, wind and solar. If we double wind and solar in the next 5 years, we are less than three-quarters of one percent of our energy. We are all for wind. We are all for solar. We are all for geothermal. I led the Hydrogen Caucus 10 years ago. But, folks, we are not there yet. 
   Now, what can keep us going? Here is what the Energy Department has in their chart. From this middle line towards me is history. That is where we have been. From that middle line out is where the Energy Department thinks we are going to be. 
   To listen to many people, you would think we are ready. We have been holding back wind and we have been holding back solar and we have been holding back geothermal. We have been holding back hydrogen. We have been holding back electric cars. Folks, nobody is holding anything back. It has to compete. We have spent billions on every one of the new energies. But their projection is that not much is going to change. 
   I don't quite agree with their chart, because I look for coal to decrease. This administration has not been friendly to coal. This Congress has not been friendly to coal. There have been 50 coal plants turned down in the last 6 months in this country. They will all become natural gas plants. And when you have a power plant and you switch to natural gas, this is going to widen.  
   Really, that is one of the reasons that we have expensive natural gas in America. Twelve years ago, we didn't use natural gas to make electricity. Only 8 percent of our electricity was made with natural gas. Today, 23 percent of our electricity is made with natural gas, and it has put tremendous pressure on natural gas. 
   Clean, green natural gas is the fuel that we use to make ethanol, it is the fuel we will use to make hydrogen. It is the fuel we will use as the bridge. A third of our auto fleet could be on clean, green natural gas if it was less expensive. 
   So I look at natural gas as the savior for us to get us to the new generations of fuels. But in the meantime, we are going to need a lot of oil. We are going to need coal. We are going to need nuclear. The energy bill in 05 gave incentives. It took 10 years to get a permit for a nuclear plant. We now force that to be done in 4. So they say 4 years to build one. So I say with delays and problems, we can build a nuclear plant in 10 years. There are 50 on the drawing board and there are three or four ready to go, and that is because of the 05 Energy Act. But we need all of those 50 on line by 2030 to remain 20 percent of the grid, because electric use is going up so fast. 
   Folks, the energy problem in America is because of the environmental groups we have decided to stop producing fossil fuels, forcing us to be 66 percent dependent on foreign and forcing us to cause part of the world shortage of petroleum and gas because we don't produce. So I find it very frustrating that here we are today with the highest prices. 
   One more thing on natural gas. Natural gas is the one fuel that is not a world price. Neither is coal. When oil is $120 a barrel, it is that all around the world. But we have had the highest natural gas prices in America for 8 years. 
   What does that do to us? That affects the petrochemical companies, the polymers and the plastic companies and the fertilizer companies that use huge amounts. They use it as an ingredient. Polymers and plastic, 45 percent of the cost of making it is natural gas. Fifty-five percent of the cost of petrochemical is natural gas. From 50 to 70 percent of fertilizer cost is natural gas. 
   Half of our fertilizer plants have left in the last 3 years. We have lost 300,000 polymer plastic jobs in the last 3 years. A great percentage of the petrochemical industry has moved offshore. 
   Just to show you, our largest chemical company is Dow Chemical. They spoke out the other day about natural gas prices. In 02, they spent $8 billion to purchase natural gas. This year, they will spend $32 billion for natural gas. That is a 400 percent increase. 
   Now, here are the numbers that are scary. In 02, 60 percent of their revenue and jobs were in America. Today, 34 percent of their revenue and jobs are in America. Where are they? They are in foreign countries, where natural gas is a fraction of what it is here. 
   Many of the plants I have mentioned, polymers, plastic, steel, aluminum, those plants are moving everywhere because of energy prices. They are building every kind of a plant you can think of down in South America in a place called Trinidad, about a day-and-a-half by ship to here. My prediction is if we don't deal with natural gas prices, bricks and glass, heavy bulky commodities will be produced in Trinidad and be on our shores within a day-and-a-half. 
   Folks, that is not the America I believe in. If America is going to compete, we have to get gas prices under control. We have to get oil prices under control. We have to have energy that is affordable for Americans to heat their homes. We have to have energy prices that are affordable so companies will want to be here and produce the jobs here. I believe for the first time in the history of America we have to fight to compete with our competitors like China and India. They are huge. They are growing fast. They are building their own energy future. 
   China will be producing oil 50 miles off the coast of Cuba and 50 miles off the Florida coast, while we prohibit it. Does that make sense? I don't think so. They are going to be working. China, Canada and Spain will all have contracts to produce energy in waters that should be ours, off our coast, because we don't produce there and because it is an equal distance from Cuba. 
   It is time for this Congress, it is time for this administration, to lead. Recently the President has spoken out three times on offshore. He has never supported offshore production. But he said we should be offshore and onshore producing more energy. 
   I wrote him a letter 2 weeks ago and put a release out today that says the following: ``Mr. President, I commend you for speaking about offshore production of energy. But it seems like if you would lead by removing the presidential moratorium, that is yours, and urging Congress to remove their moratorium so we can start the process.'' It will take years to get out there. We have to get in a 5-year plan, we have to do the leases, we have to do the environmental impact statements, and then they have to go out and build the platforms and the pipelines and drill. It takes a long time. 
   Every day we wait we endanger the economic future of America. I think we are almost past the point. We need energy production in America today. Not next year. Today. We need to unlock what this Congress and three presidents have locked up. We need to produce our energy. We need to conserve. We need to use the innovation that my friend talked about a little bit ago. 
   We need it to do everything we can to produce every form of energy that is available. We need wind, we need solar, and we need to use less. We need to use it more wisely. But, folks, the day is today. We cannot solve this problem with just conservation. We have to produce energy. 
   I believe if we opened up the Outer Continental Shelf, we would take what we call the fear factor out of the market and we would get Wall Street out of the marketplace and we could drop energy prices 20 to 25 percent. The only other thing you and I can do is to use less and find alternatives. Folks, it is a crisis in America. 
   I want to thank my friend from Utah and my friend from California who have joined us for the opportunity to share some time with them today.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY PRICES -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, let the record show that on Wednesday, May 21, oil hit $137 a barrel and closed at about $134. Natural gas has pushed by $11.50 per thousand and is approaching $12. 
   Yes, this chart I have shows the growth in energy costs. Price of oil continues to skyrocket. I guess the part that's surprising is, as a 12-year Member of this body, that it's not a crisis here. This Congress is not treating energy prices as if it was a crisis. 
   I was looking at my notes before I came down from an October time when I came down to the floor, and we talked then, as we were kind of climbing through the eighties, and that day we had hit $94 a barrel. And we all shuddered that we might be approaching $100, and here we are a few months later, not only past $100, but at $134 and actually hit $137 today. 
   Do we have a bipartisan task force by the House and Senate that would look at how we deal with this energy crisis and how we deal with these high prices that American consumers are struggling with? The answer is no. Do we have a special House committee looking for solutions? The answer is no. 
   Yesterday, the House had a bill. It was defined and named to cut costs, cut gas costs. Will it? Well, the first part of the bill dealt with trying to figure out a legal way that we can sue the OPEC countries for not producing enough oil. Now, Saudi Arabia alone produces 12 million barrels a day, and many of the other countries, 10, 9, 7, but we think they should produce more. 
   It's interesting, on this floor a few months ago, when we had some energy bills pass that didn't have any energy in them, we claimed that it was a new era. The era of oil was over. We were moving into the fields, the new fields, and energy dependence on foreign countries would disappear. 
   I've been in Congress 12 years. We've increased dependency almost 2 percent a year every year I've been here, and we're on a pattern that by 2015, if we don't change, we'll be 85 percent dependent on foreign, mostly dictatorship, unstable countries, not always friendly to us. 
   I think that's a serious crisis for the American people. It's a serious crisis for American businesses to compete. It's a serious crisis to our defense of this country. 
   I wish our governmental leaders, White House and legislative included, were half as interested in energy prices as our military was. Because when I talk to the leaders of the Air Force specifically, who use a huge amount of our energy flying our planes, they want 60 percent of their energy to be non-foreign, and they're working judiciously to do other fuels from coal and fuels from gas and trying to have other non-oil fuels because in oil we're just becoming majorly foreign dependent. 
   Today, the Senate determined that when they return after the May recess, they're going to deal in the week or two period with climate change. They're going to deal with carbon taxes because they think that a one-and-a-half percentage degree in temperature increase in this country, in this world, is a greater threat to our future than energy prices that most Americans can't afford, and most businesses can't compete in the global economy if they continue. 
   But the Senate is not talking about energy. They're talking about a climate bill and a carbon tax which will increase energy prices 25 to 30 percent. Much of America today hit $4 in gasoline. That means if the Senate acts as they say they're going to, a carbon tax  could easily, everybody agrees, could increase energy prices 20 to 30 percent. So 25 percent of $4 is another dollar so we would go to $5 gasoline. And only God knows what oil prices will be by the time they accomplish that. 
   Does America need to be in an energy crisis? I think not. We made a decision several decades ago, in fact 27 years ago, a very foolish decision. We locked up offshore production of energy on both coasts and in much of the gulf. Every country in the world, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, all green countries, all environmentally sensitive countries, they all produce offshore. They have different set-asides, some 20 miles, some 30 miles, some 15 miles. Eleven miles is the sight line. Once it's past 11 miles, nobody can see it. All those countries, every country produces. 
   Canada, thank God for Canada. We import more energy from Canada than anybody else, our friend to the north. They produce both oil and gas right off the coast of Maine, just above it, and right above the coast of Washington. And since 1913, they've been producing natural gas only in the Great Lakes, and today they're selling it to us. We get 15 percent of our natural gas from Canada, 2 percent from LNG, and the rest we produce ourselves. We could be totally self-sufficient in natural gas. 
   Now, a young lady said to me recently, she said, Mr. Peterson, I make $320 a week. I lost my other job so I have to travel a fair distance now to work. I'm now paying $130 a week to drive to work. She says, I don't know how I can continue to raise my two children and make ends meet. 
   What she didn't know was that the small house she has, her current natural gas bill, on a monthly basis, $175--she pays balanced billing--what she doesn't know is that the $12 gas or $11.70 today we're putting in the ground now compares to $6.50 gas we were putting in the ground--and you may say, what do you mean putting in the ground? Well, we have great storage caverns, much of them in my district in Pennsylvania, where we store natural gas in old salt caverns, and then we use it in the wintertime because we can't produce, we can't pump enough out of the ground in the heating season when we use tremendous amounts of natural gas. So we're putting it in the ground in storage today. 
   Now, one of the major storage companies told me last week at a luncheon, they're very concerned; they have not had their storage this low in a long time, and they're very concerned because they've been unable to buy as much LNG as they want.     
   And they're very concerned. I said, why are you putting $11.50 gas in the ground? Why don't you wait until the price comes down? They said, we're afraid the price isn't going to come down. Because usually in the spring of the season, when we're not heating our homes and we're not running a lot of air conditioning, we use the least natural gas of any other time of the year. So that's when we have ample supply, the price comes down, it gets reasonable, and that's when we put it in storage for next winter. 
   Later year at this time, it was $6.50, later in the summer it was $5 something. And last year we had a moderate increase in natural gas prices, about 7, 8, 9, 10 percent, depending on what part of the country you were in. That was moderate. Well, those who heated with home heating oil and propane had huge increases last year. And the sad story for Americans is those who heat with propane and home heating fuel are going to have enormous increases this year on top of last year's increases. And those who heat with natural gas are going to have a major increase. We don't know how much yet. 
   For the first time in 2 years we have not had a storm in the Gulf, the last two summers. That's historic. We always have storms in the Gulf, hurricanes, that disrupt oil and gas supply. And when it disrupts that supply, we never replace it, so it just takes it out of the system. And whenever we have a major storm in the Gulf--when Katrina hit, gas went from, like, $4 or $5 to $14. And that year we had a huge increase in natural gas prices because that's what we had to pay. 
   Now, the LNG issue I mentioned, you know, I had a debate with the White House some time ago, and they felt that LNG was our answer to natural gas. I argued then, 3 years ago, and I argue now, it's not the answer. It's a little piece of the solution. Now, what is LNG? That's liquefied natural gas, we buy it from foreign countries a long ways from here. Gas is cheaper in those countries. They liquefy it. They fill these huge tankers and they come here, and then we build controversial unloading stations. They're really not unsafe, but people perceive them to be. And we were in a flurry to build more receiving stations. We found out we really haven't needed them, we're hardly using half of the capacity we have today. Why? Because we can't buy it. 
   When a tanker with LNG gets loaded in one of these foreign countries, countries like Japan, who don't have any gas of their own, little countries like Spain, and on and on the list goes, they outbid us. Sometimes a tanker load of gas will be coming to the States, and they will get a higher price offered and they actually turn around and go to that country. In fact, in the heating season, when we need it, we can't buy it on a bet. 
   So LNG has not been the silver bullet that many thought. And the Secretary of Energy went around the world trying to entice LNG for this country. And I argued that LNG is helpful, but it's not a silver bullet, it shouldn't be our solution because, folks, between major gas areas in the Midwest and in the Pennsylvania Appalachian region, recent find, offshore we have an abundant volume of natural gas. 
   And natural gas is the clean, green fuel. And if it was more affordable, we could be using it in our auto fleets because autos can run on natural gas with a couple thousand dollar exchange of carbonation and storage tanks and so forth, maybe $2,000 or $3,000 a vehicle. We could run all of our school buses, short haul, all of our city buses, the Washington City. Many of them are on natural gas. State College in my district has been an all natural gas district for a number of years now. All of their bus system--it's the third largest bus system in Pennsylvania--they're all on clean, green natural gas. 
   Natural gas should be our bridge fuel. But at $12 now, and if we have a storm in the Gulf, it would be 15 or more, those prices, it's not our solution. But it could be our solution if we would open up the OCS, if we would open up Alaska, if we would open up much of the Midwest and start producing our own clean natural gas. 
   I have found it astounding that there is resistance to producing energy in America. What's really happened in America, and I'll just go a little bit more on natural gas here. Here is the natural gas prices. The blue line is what commercial pays--they pay a little less than households because they use high volume--and the red line is where residents are. And folks, this is today's price at the retail. In the fall, it's going to be off of this chart. There is going to be a huge increase, I predict, and everybody agrees. We will have to make a new chart because this chart won't work. Natural gas prices. 
   Now, is that problematic? Yeah, it's problematic, because not only do we use natural gas to heat our homes and to run our businesses, we use it as an ingredient. Fertilizer, about 70 to 90 percent of the cost of making it is natural gas because that's what we make it out of. The corn we're growing for ethanol uses natural gas to make the fertilizer to grow the corn. If we go to a hydrogen vehicle, we will use a natural gas. 
   The ethanol we use in vehicles today, the biofuels, biodiesel, those plants consume huge amounts of natural gas. One was just proposed in a southern State, and their projected natural gas costs for the first year was $3.5 million and they were looking for a cheaper fuel. Natural gas is the major ingredient in petrochemicals, polymers, plastics. We use it to bend steel, melt steel. We use it to treat all kinds of products. We use it to cook. We use it to bake. We use it in many, many commercial ways. 
   And natural gas prices are making American businesses noncompetitive. Dow Chemical, in 2002, a petrochemical company, the biggest in the world, American company, a good company, they used $8 billion of natural gas in 2002. Then we had the big spike in gas prices. In 2006, their gas bill went to $22 billion. And I don't know what it is  today, certainly much higher. They started building their plants. These are the best blue-collar jobs left in America, petrochemical plants, fertilizer plants, polymer and plastic plants, plants that heat, treat steel and bend metal and shape things. They all use natural gas as their fuel. 
   And they are being endangered because natural gas is not a world price. Nobody in the world pays this price but us. It's cheaper in Canada, a little bit. They're high because of us, because they're kind of hooked at the hip. It's cheaper in Mexico. At the wholesale side, it's $1 something in Trinidad, South America. In Russia, it's just barely over one dollar. 
   Many parts of the world--all parts of the world, in those countries, China and India, our competitors, their natural gas prices are probably a third of ours. That puts our companies at a huge disadvantage, not just labor disadvantage, not just because of other high costs in this country, energy costs have driven more jobs out of America than any other issue, not that they wanted to leave, they just can't afford to stay. 
   Now, with energy prices today, I talked about the young lady and her job, driving to work and her home, we're going to have seniors--you know, just the other day I had a gentleman tell me he put a new furnace in his mother's home. But when he went to visit her last winter, she had her temperature at 58 because she felt that was all she could afford. And he said, John, what do I do? I don't want my mother living at 58 degrees, I want her to be warm. So he's looking at some sort of heater in the one room where she sits in the evening so she can be toasty warm, maybe a pellet stove or a gas stove or something that keeps that room warm but the furnace down, not heating the whole house. 
   I went into a hardware store 2 weeks ago and they had their coats on. It was chilly in there. It was a frosty morning, we had frost that morning. And I said, it's kind of chilly in here. And he said, well, with energy prices today, in the spring and the fall I shut my furnaces off. We're a lumber yard, we're a hardware store, people come in here dressed for the outside temperature, and so we just dress for the outside temperature in our work. It saves me $800 a month in the spring and the fall, that's 4 months, so that's $3,200 that I don't have a gas bill--that I would pay in a gas bill, $800. Now, in the winter I pay a lot more than that, but it's cold then and you have to have heat, pipes will freeze, people won't come in your store if they can see their breath. 
   Folks, I don't think we have any idea what we're doing to the economic future of America, what we're doing to the quality of life of the average hardworking poor American. Now, those who are middle class will complain and groan and they'll pay because they have the money. 
   But below the middle class and the working class and the poor in this country, when they pay their driving bill--and rural people, I represent rural, we don't have mass transit; we drive to school, we drive to work, we drive to church, we drive to the doctor, we drive to the mall, we drive everywhere. And in rural areas, when the economy shifts and you lose your job at a plant, you don't move away, you go 50 miles down the road and you get a job and then you drive to work every day. I had a lady tell me today, my gas bill per week now is $180 a week. And now when she gets her heating bill next winter, will she have enough money to raise her family, heat her home, and drive her car? Many won't. 
   The current energy prices have the potential of stalling this economy. I had a person who has been dealing with energy all his life. He is a government official. He told me about 9 months ago that he thought $75 oil would put us in a recession and stall the economy of this country, and in time, the world. Now he said we bounced through that. We were just by that, and we were in the $80s then. He said, my people and I may have been wrong, but there is a price that our economy cannot absorb these energy prices. And folks, $134 oil? I mean, it's almost like we're talking fantasy. 
   How did we get here? How did we get to this situation? Well, here's some of the things--back to natural gas for a minute. In all of these products, natural gas is used in making them--steam, power, and all of these blocks. Huge amounts of natural gas. Even the skin creams that you ladies like to keep your skin soft, that's a direct ingredient of natural gas. The feedstock for making skin softeners is natural gas. 
   Well, here's where we are in energy use. Let's try to figure out how we got here. You can see the big part of our energy is oil. And now, 66.5 percent of our oil comes from foreign countries. Natural gas is the next largest, and coal--well, I guess coal would be the next, but let's go to natural gas. We're 83 percent self-sufficient. We get 2 percent in fraction from LNG and about 15 percent from Canada, our good friend in the north who drills offshore where we won't. 
   Now, coal basically is used in this country to make electricity, and about 50 percent of our electricity in this country is made from coal. Now, nuclear has been 20 percent of the energy in our electric system, not our energy overall, but our electric system. And of course the beige line here is hydro, and that's getting smaller because we're taking dams out. The environmentalists don't want dams. All the environmental community, they don't want dams in our rivers, and a lot of them have been tore out. And we're not adding hydro anywhere, so it's a declining factor. 
   Now, as you look at renewables, this is scary. Renewables are wind and solar and geothermal and woody biomass. And the only one of those that actually had real measurable growth in volume is woody biomass. A little growth in wind and a little growth in solar, but the big one that has really grown measurably is woody biomass. How did that happen? Well, we have between 800,000 and 1 million Americans heating their homes with pellet stoves. That's a fuel made out of waste sawdust, a good use of biomass. We use it to heat factories. Most of the dry kilns, where you dry your lumber, that used to be heated with fuel oil and natural gas are now heated with wood waste. Many factories that are in the wood business are all heated with wood waste boilers. 
   I have a company in my district now that builds very efficient wood waste boilers that actually burn wood waste cleaner than natural gas; it's an amazing ceramic-lined boiler. We recently placed those in a hospital in my district, that boiler, and that hospital is going to save 70 percent on their energy bill. And they're going to be using waste sawdust and wood chips. They can even burn green wood chips, like if a tree trimmer comes through and trims the trees and grinds it up--and they usually find places to dump that--they can now blow that into a tractor trailer and use it for fuel, cardboard waste, paper waste. This hospital is going to burn all its cardboard, all its paper, all its clean fuel, and buy sawdust and wood chips. They are going to save 70 percent on their energy bill. 
   Woody biomass is finding a market of its own. Now, there have been a lot of windmills added, and they are going to be a lot more added. But the numbers are still, you know--I keep reading articles. I read one recently that in just a few years 100 percent of electricity could be from wind. Folks, that's just not accurate. I read an article last week that in a few years we'll have 20 percent of our electricity. Now, one of the problems, you know, the grid failed in Texas recently because they have some successful windmills. But there are two times of the day when we need a lot of energy, that's in the morning and evening, peak power. That's when we're running our homes and our factories simultaneously. We're running washers and dryers and we're running hot water and we're cooking and we're doing things, so we're using a lot of energy in the factory and at home. Those are called peaks.     
   Well, from 4 to 6 o'clock, if you just watch the weather, and I've watched it, you can have a very windy day, and between 4 and 6, for some reason, the wind calms down. There's not much breeze. So wind farms don't produce a lot of energy sometimes on a nonwindy afternoon from 4 to 6 when you need it. So what happens when it doesn't blow and it doesn't turn? You have to turn on a gas generator. For every wind and solar generator, we have to have a gas backup. Now, gas is 23 percent. Gas is now 23 percent of our electric generation. Just a decade ago, it was less  than 7. We only allowed it to be peak power. We didn't allow electricity to be made from natural gas. We thought it was too clean and perfect to fuel and there were too many other uses for it, but we've changed. Now we are at 23 percent. And on a hot summer day when you have 100 degree temperatures across America and air conditioning is just sucking up all the electricity we can produce and our grid is struggling to stay up, every power plant that only comes on when it's peak is running 24/7 when we have hot summer weather. Now, that's changed things. We have never taken gas out of storage in the summertime until last year. Last year we had 2 weeks, 2 different weeks, when it was hot enough that we were producing enough electricity with natural gas that we fully had a negative flow of gas out of our storage areas for winter instead of in. 
   Folks, if we were to have a terrible storm in the this year, and everybody says we're going to, and we went 2 years without it, and we would have a very hot summer where we would use a lot of peak power and a lot of natural gas for electric generation, we could be looking at unbelievable natural gas prices this fall. 
   Now, I know the news I'm giving you is all bad news. But, folks, it's because this Congress and three Presidents have chosen not to produce fossil fuels. 
   Now, I'm for every renewable source there is. I'm for hydrogen. I have been pushing hydrogen my whole time in Congress. We hope it becomes a fuel of the future. I'm for wind and solar. I'm for cellulosic ethanol because it's vital because I don't think we can get to where they want to be with biofuels with soybeans and corn. I don't think we can grow enough of it. I've been stunned that we haven't opened up a lot more farmland, but we haven't. Last year we grew 20 million more acres of corn, and corn prices went from 3 something a bushel to $6.40 and $6.50 at one point. It's just under $6 now. We doubled and tripled grain prices. Food prices are skyrocketing because we used 20 percent of our corn last year to make biofuels, and this year we're projecting to use a third of our corn, and this year we are not growing 20 million acres more; I think we are only growing 8 million acres more or we're growing 8 million acres less. Somewhere in there that number is correct. But we're not going to grow as much corn, and they're concerned now with the wet weather in the West that we are not going to get all the corn we need planted. 
   Now, when you use grain long term and food long term for energy source, what happens when you have a bad crop year? You're not going to have food to eat and you're not going to have warmth. That's why cellulosic ethanol is so important. 
   Now, cellulosic ethanol can be made out of switchgrass, it can be made out of garbage, and it can be made out of wood waste. Where I come from, we have lots of wood waste, and I think that will be of use. But I think the one that has the most potential if in the laboratory--and these are all ``ifs.'' But yet we have a mandate by 2030 that we have to have 36.5 billion gallons per year of ethanol, the first 15 made from corn and the next 20 made from cellulosic. This is a mandate, by law. This is a process where we have not yet proven we can make it cost effectively. 
   Folks, we are in a crisis in this country because we have chosen not to drill for gas, not to drill for oil, no new fields. We have people come up here and talk about all the unused permits, all the land that's been leased and not drilled. Folks, if it's drillable and there's money there to be made, it will be drilled. And they all talk about big oil, but 80 percent of our energy is produced by small companies, people that are in our own States. Big oil are the named marketers, but energy is basically produced by independents. But we keep talking about these terrible oil companies and they're the problem. 
   I think Exxon answered the question well. They were talking about their profits the other day, and they said, Folks, we would reinvest in America if offshore was open, if Alaska was open, if the Midwest was open, but you forced us to go to foreign countries. Now we have foreign countries nationalizing their oil patches and their oil refineries and their oil production systems, and big oil is being gradually pushed out, and oftentimes their investments have been captured. Sometimes they have been paid for, sometimes not. And big oil is prepared to produce here if we open up. 
   Folks, we need to open up oil and gas reserves in this country. We need to have six or eight coal-to-liquid plants so we're not dependent on oil forever because we are the Saudi Arabia of coal. We need to figure out how to have more nuclear plants. The 2005 bill streamlined the process, and there are about 50 nuclear plants in the permit process, and there are 3 or 4 about ready to be built. We need all 50 of them by 2030 to maintain 20 percent of the electric grid. Not an increase. Hydro will continue to decrease. 
   This is a chart put out by EIA of the Energy Department. I disagree with them. We have had 60 coal plants turned down, clean coal, not dirty coal, clean coal, turned down by States because of the fear of the carbon issue. All of those will be built in gas plants, and when they are all built in gas plants, you will see this blue narrow and you will see the greens widen. Natural gas is where we will be going. It's the only place we can go. It's the clean, green fuel. But, folks, for it to be affordable, we need to produce a whole lot more of it. 
   It's never polluted a beach. It's never caused pollution in this country. It's the cleanest fuel, no NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, a third of the CO 
   2. It's almost the perfect fuel. It's cleaner than biofuels. But for some reason, three Presidents and Congress for 27 years have locked up not only our shorelines but much of the middle of this country and the part of Alaska that was set aside for energy production, 2,000 acres on a 70 million acre plot to produce energy. With modern drilling they drill multiple wells on the same site, and they go many directions. You don't have nearly as many sites. 
   Folks, America needs energy. We need energy we can afford to pay. The working people of this country not only are not going to be able to afford to heat their homes and drive their cars, but many of them will lose their jobs because these energy prices, as I showed you earlier, $14 gas, America is the only place that someone pays $14 for gas. Every other part of the world is cheaper. Oil prices are the same everywhere. It's a world price. But for 8 years the Dow Chemicals, the manufacturers, the fertilizer companies have paid the highest prices in the world for natural gas and have been asked to compete with the rest of the world. 
   Energy is a crisis in America, but Congress treats it like it's not a crisis. We do goofy things like trying to sue OPEC, and we know we don't have standing to sue other countries. They don't come under our court system. We're trying to wiggle our laws around so we can sue them. That's a waste of time. We need to produce energy. 
   Also, I have a natural gas bill, the Outer Continental Shelf. In my bill it's natural gas only, offshore. We use the royalties for renewable research. We use royalties to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. We use royalties to clean up the Great Lakes, San Francisco Bay, the Everglades. Folks, if we would produce energy offshore, we can allocate the royalties to fund the renewables. 
   Today we were arguing over and fighting over the extensions for the tax incentives for wind and solar and geothermal and all the renewables. We extended them for 1 year. Our investment companies are going to spend a billion dollars on wind and solar when in a year from now, there may not be that incentive there that makes it work. 
   Folks, this Congress has failed us. This Congress continues to fail us. This Congress needs an energy policy. This White House needs an energy policy. And the people running for President of this United States need to prove to the Americans before they elect them that they have an energy policy that they're going to bring to this country to provide us with the gas and the oil and the renewables and clean energies and it's going to be affordable for Americans to live their lives, run their farms, run their businesses. 
   Folks, I've listened to hours and hours of presidential debates. Energy was seldom mentioned, and it's certainly not been a platform of the current candidates. We need a person running for President, Americans need to demand of those running for President, ``How are you going to produce?''  
   We have those who talk about green collar jobs. I'm for green collar jobs. But let me tell you, if we don't bring affordable energy to America, the blue collar jobs won't be here. They'll be gone, and we don't know how many of the green collar jobs. We need them both. 
   I'm for plants to build windmills. I'm for plants to build solar. And when we learn how to store wind and solar so that we can make it during the night when we don't need it and use it in the daytime when we need it, then it will work. But until we do that, it's on the margins. If we double wind and solar in 5 years, it will be less than 1 percent of our energy. I hope we can do that, but that's still not very much energy. 
   But the American public have been led to believe that we are holding renewables back, that we're not for these energy-efficient cars. There are incentives, folks, of thousands of dollars to buy energy-efficient cars. There are incentives to do wind and solar. Unfortunately, they're not long term. Those who are investing are gambling because we just renewed them a little bit at a time. We just renewed them for a year. Folks, we need to renew them for 5 to 10 years. We need to have it out there, and then if it isn't working, we stop doing that. 
   But, folks, there are those who say we need to conserve, and we do, and we will at these prices. But let me tell you that in a later speech sometime I'm going to show you the American people are using far less energy in America per capita today than we did a few years ago. We've done more than people give us credit for. We have more efficient appliances and more efficient engines and things than we had many years ago. We have done better than any other country in overall energy conservation. Folks, we haven't done enough, but I want to tell you $4 gasoline or $5 gasoline and $14 gas to heat our homes are going to force us to do a lot of things. 
   But America doesn't have to be in this situation. Yes, we need the new kind of fuels, renewable fuels. But until they are ready, we can't decide, as a Congress and a White House, that we're not going to produce. 
   Let me just tell you who some of the perpetrators are. The environmental groups of America own this Congress. Sierra Club rails against shale oil production. Over a trillion barrels of shale oil in the West. We can't do that. 
   Green Peace says we must phase out fossil fuels. Folks, how do we do that? Ninety-six percent of our energy is fossil fuels. How do we stop that? That's what we're doing. We're phasing them out before we have the replacement. 
   The Environmental Defense Fund: ``Power plants and smokestacks are our public health enemy number one, and we must do away with them.'' That's our jobs, our factories, folks.     
   League of Conservation Voters; coal to liquids, wrong direction. Well, should we do coal to liquids or should we do more foreign dependence on the Mid East? That is our choice. 
   Defenders of Wilderness; every coastal State is in harm's way when an oil rig goes up. Folks, that is not true. We haven't had an oil spill since 1969. We have never had a gas spill. When a gas well lets gas out, it goes in the air. Dissipates. Natural Resource Defense Council; coal mining destroys land. Coal plant emissions cripple and kill. We have clean coal technologies with much cleaner emissions than we have ever had, but we are turning them down and not building them. We are using old dirty coal plants because they can't build the new ones. That's our environmental policy. 
   Center for Biological Diversity; oil and gas drilling on public land has a devastating impact. Does it have to? It can be done right. Friends of the Earth; liquid coal is dirty and costly. Liquid coal doesn't have to be dirty and costly. We have ways of doing it. 
   North Africa, or South Africa, I guess, is leading the way with liquid coal. That is making gasoline and diesel out of coal. And we have lots of it. We need to be working at it and learning how to do it cleanly so we are not dependent. Folks, we are 66 percent dependent on foreign unstable countries. We have no control over prices. A storm in the gulf and we have another major spurt in energy prices. 
   One of our sending countries, and here's who we get our energy from. We produce 33.7 percent of our own oil, we import 66.3 percent of our oil. Canada provides 12 percent of our oil; Mexico, 9.3; non-OPEC nations, 8.9; Ecuador, 1.3; Saudi Arabia, 9.6 percent; Venezuela, 7.5. Our friend, Venezuela, 7.5 percent of our oil comes from there. Nigeria, a stable country, questionable, 7.2; Angola 3.3 percent; Iraq 3.2; Algeria, 3.1; Kuwait, 1.2; other OPEC is .06. That is our oil. That's where we get our oil from. 
   Folks, we don't have to be dependent on it. America is rich in resources. Natural gas should be our bridge. Clean vehicles on natural gas. Natural gas should be the fuel of the future, and our industries shouldn't have to pay the highest price in the world for natural gas so they are forced to leave here. Americans shouldn't be forced to live in homes that are cold in the wintertime because they can't afford to heat them. People should be able to afford to drive to work. 
   Folks, it's a crisis in America. It should be a crisis in this Congress. Today, the White House again spoke about we need to produce more energy. Tomorrow I am going to write the President a letter. You know, if he means that, he needs to lift the Outer Continental Shelf moratorium, because we don't have one moratorium, we have a legislative one by Congress for 27 years and we have had a Presidential one for 27 years, and he can lift it in a moment. That is how it was put there. 
   Bush I put it there for 5 years until we assessed the Outer Continental Shelf, what was there. We have never assessed that. We have never allowed seismographic out there. Then Clinton came in and extended it to 2012, and also vetoed the Alaskan bill, ANWR, which would be producing major oil for us today. He vetoed that. Bush II has ignored it and refused to talk about the OCS. 
   Folks, we have three Presidents and a Congress with a 27-year history of not producing affordable available energy in America, and we are the only country in the world to lock up the Outer Continental Shelf, we are the only country in the world that has locked up most of our internal resources. 
   Congress and Presidents have been our problem. Congress needs to get the message that it's time to stop being our problem, and we need to have a President that leads us to energy, affordable available energy for America.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I rise to support the Secure Rural Schools Act. My district in Pennsylvania is affected by this and many districts in the west are affected by this Act. 
   Over the years, timber harvesting and other mineral resources harvesting provided a huge resource for local governments, and, specifically, schools. 
   When those who chose not to continue the wise management of our forest by allowing the mature trees to be harvested, America's most renewable resource, we had school districts and governments in tremendous financial crisis. Several years ago, Congress had the wisdom to pass the Secure Rural Schools Act that helped stabilize the ability to educate our young people and give them the chances of an adequate, good education, because these rural communities did not have the infrastructure, because most of the property and land and resources was owned by the Federal Government. This Act has helped in immense ways, and this chance, this amendment, will continue that funding.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, today natural gas opened at $12.65 per 1,000 Btus. That is an almost 100 percent increase from this time a year ago. 
   Natural gas is the clean, green fuel that powers our manufacturing economy, accounts for 23 percent of the energy consumed in America and heats 52 million of our homes. Yet as prices continue to skyrocket and companies move offshore because America has the highest natural gas prices in the world, this Congress has done absolutely nothing to increase production. 
   Tomorrow, I will offer an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill that will lift the congressional moratorium on offshore production from 50 to 200 miles, which happens to be the safest and most environmentally friendly place to produce energy. There is no need to beg the Saudis for more oil and Canada for more natural gas. 
   We have vast reserves here in America. We need to produce American energy with an American labor force and give Americans energy they can afford.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I'm delighted today that we're talking about energy. I think it's vital because I want to tell you something; if we don't get a lid on energy prices in America, there will be no level of government with a budget that will balance. The cost to heat our schools, the cost to heat our hospitals, the cost to do everything is going to explode. The cost to move goods and services is exploding. And it's about time, Americans. 
   I had a young lady say to me last week, she said, Mr. Peterson, I make $320 a week. I used to spend $90 to drive to work, now I'm spending $140. How do I pay my bills? What she doesn't know is she heats her home with natural gas, and the natural gas that we're putting in the ground today for next winter's heating is $11.50. Last year, it was running between $6.50 and $7. She's looking at a 50 percent increase in home heating costs next year, which she cannot meet. 
   Folks, the average working American is struggling to pay their bills because of energy costs. Our State governments, our county governments and our hospitals and our schools are going to take money away from the classroom to heat those facilities. If this Congress does not address the energy issue, we're going to collapse the economic viability of this country. 
   Energy runs this country. We've had $2 gas and $10 oil most of our lifetime, with a few spikes in the seventies, eighties and nineties. Folks, we have $125 oil, $11.50 gas. We have not had a storm in the gulf in 2 years that always causes spike prices. We've not had a major country that supplies oil to us all tip over or have a coup that took away the government and took away that supply of oil.  
   I'm predicting that countries like China, who are amassing energy all around the world, we'll read one of these days where they have purchased all the oil and gas that one of the major contributing countries can produce for the next decade and we won't get any of it. 
   Folks, if we have a storm in the gulf this summer like they're predicting, and they're predicting them, if we have any kind of terrorist attack on a supply system, $125 oil will seem cheap to us. I'm not sure this economy can handle $125 oil. 
   I am for every renewable there is, but let's look at the Energy Department's prediction: Oil, gas, coal, nuclear, renewables, hydro and non-hydro, that's their prediction. We've spent $30 billion for renewables. Folks, if we double wind and solar--and I wish we could double it every year--but if we double it, we will still be less than three-quarters of 1 percent of our energy needs. 
   Where is the renewable coming? The renewable that's grown the fastest is wood waste. With pellet stoves heating hundreds of homes, with factories heating their factories with wood waste, wood waste has been the fastest growing energy renewable. 
   Folks, America better get serious. And we'd better open our Outer Continental Shelf, we'd better do ANWR, we'd better do the Midwest. Coal-to-liquid, coal-to-gas, wind, solar, we need it all, folks. America is in an energy crisis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about the energy issue also. There are some good things in this bill for our farmers. I especially think the dairy provision was well done. Dairy is very important to Pennsylvania. 
   I was in the food business 26 years of my life. I know how people struggle with their family budgets. But let me tell you, the farmers are reeling with fertilizer costs. Why are fertilizer costs doubling and tripling year after year? And why is 50 percent of our fertilizer now being imported? Because of natural gas costs. Ninety percent of the cost of ammonia fertilizer is natural gas, clean, green natural gas. This Congress refuses to produce natural gas in this country. There has never been a gas well that polluted a beach. Look at this chart. Off-limits. Off-limits. Off-limits. There should be another one in the middle. There should be one up here in Alaska. 
   We have said that we are not going to produce fossil fuel. Natural gas is a fossil fuel. We are not going to produce oil. 
   Our farmers need relief. They need affordable energy to drive their tractors, to dry their grain after they harvest it, and to buy their fertilizer. 
   Folks, this country's economic future, not just farming, but our ability to manufacture, our ability to heat our homes this winter--right today, we are putting $11.50 natural gas in the ground for next winter's use. Last year at this time, it was $6.50 to $7. Do the math. That's a 40 to 50 percent increase in natural gas costs. 
   We have lost half of the fertilizer factories in America. That's why our farmers are now using foreign fertilizer. That's why it is costing them 300, 400 and 500 percent more than it did just several years ago. Folks, we have to produce energy in America if we are going to farm and have affordable food, if we are going to manufacture products and if we are going to have an economy that competes in the global economy. 
   We are not in a sole economy any more. We are in a global economy. We have to compete. 
   In America, we pay $125 for oil. Everybody does. But we have had the highest natural gas prices in the world for 8 years. And the margin is increasing because we refuse to produce energy for America. All of these other debates are going to be academic. We won't have factories. We won't have successful farmers. We'll be buying foreign fertilizer to grow products in this country. We'll be buying foreign tractors to produce our farms. We'll be driving foreign cars because we won't have a manufacturing base left. 
   Clean, green natural gas is the answer. 
   And we need to open up. And we need to drill for oil, too. There has never been a natural gas well that has harmed us economically and environmentally. Clean, green natural gas.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. This has all happened without a storm in the gulf, which always escalates prices, without any country having a major coup or problem, or without any terroristic attack on the system. I don't think anybody dreamed that we would have $135 to $140 oil at this time of the year. We are in the middle of June. We're not even into the heat of the driving season yet, and here we are with $13, I mean, we're within a few pennies of the peak of natural gas prices after Katrina. 
   Dow Chemical made a statement just a week or so ago that in 2002 it cost them $8 billion for natural gas to run their company. It now costs them $8 billion a quarter. 
   Here's what's happened. They used to be 60 percent onshore. Those were great American jobs. They're now 34 percent onshore. 
   In South America natural gas is a buck and a half. In Russia it's barely over a buck. I mean, there's cheap gas all over the world. If you're making petrochemicals, polymers, plastics, fertilizer, if you're melting steel, melting aluminum, I want to tell you, if this Congress does not change its view on offshore, shale oil and ANWR in the very near future, bricks and glass will be made in Trinidad, South America. They will be shipped here in a day and a half in a boat, and there will not be a blue collar job left in America, because natural gas is the mother's milk of manufacturing and processing.     
   They use it as an ingredient. Even the skin creams that our women love to soften, that's a derivative of natural gas. Natural gas is one of the most unique--chemists say we should never burn it. It's too valuable. But we are now using a lot of it for electric generation; 23 to 24 percent of our generation is now natural gas. And that is as we cease to permit coal plants around the country, they're all going to be natural gas plants. If the Senate continues its foolishness with carbon taxes and CO  
   2s, that's all going to push the business to a natural gas which only emits one-third of the CO 
   2 of other fossil fuels. But we're not preparing. We need to. 
   Today we had a committee meeting scheduled, and my chart here shows--it's interesting the Democrat talking points say that 80 percent of available resources are available to the American companies. That's not true. Eighty-five percent of our offshore is not available, period. The whole west coast is not available. The whole east coast is not available. About a third of the gulf is not available. That's where the prime oil and gas is in this country. They have it locked up. They want it locked up. They like these high prices because it's forcing Americans to change to other fuels. That is true. 
   But let me tell you, I'm not sure how long the American economy can handle $130 oil and $13 natural gas without collapsing. And once this economy collapses and the world economy goes into a recession, we're going to be a decade digging ourselves out of the hole. There will never be money to balance the budget. There will never be money for heat and helping people winterize their homes. This country is on the verge of losing its economic base. 
   Cheap energy. I was born one mile from Drakes Well, the first oil well. It changed the world. The whole manufacturing process of the world began in this country because of cheap energy. We've had $10 oil and $2 natural gas most of our lifetime. We had a spike in the 1970s, we had a spike in the 1980s, and a spike in the 1990s. We went to renewables. We tried to do other things, but it always came back to cheap gas and cheap oil. Nothing could compete. 
   Well, folks, there's a philosophy around here that if we don't produce fossil fuels, we're going to produce something else. I'm saying ``what.'' What are we going to produce? If we double wind and solar--and I'm for that in the next 5 years--but that doubling something in 5 years is ambitious. We're still less than one percent of our energy needs. 
   I mean, there is no renewable. The renewable that has been the most generous to us and the most growth is woody biomass. Nobody talks about woody biomass. Hasn't had any incentive. No tax incentives. There's a million Americans this year probably going to help heat their homes with a wood pellet stove. Burning sawdust pellets. That's biomass. Many companies  in my district--I come from the finest hardwood forest in America, northern Pennsylvania. Lots of mills. Lots of factories. The sawdust now is a byproduct. They heat their factories with it. Some of the coal plants use 20 percent wood waste because it allows them to sneak under the air standards if the coal is just a little dirtier than it should be. So it has found its marketplace. 
   And the cellulosic ethanol that we're betting on. We have a mandate of 36.5 million gallons of--or 36.5 billion gallons of ethanol annually by 2030. The first 15 to be corn, and we know what's happened there where we're now at $7.86 corn as the market closed today. It was $1.80 just a short time ago. We're competing food with fuel. I didn't protest it. I had my concerns. But $8 corn is not something you can afford to burn.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That is true. But I want to make a point there. I'm not against ethanol. After the 15 million they want to go to--or billion gallons, they want to go to cellulosic. 
   But we have to remember we have a mandate on cellulosic ethanol that still is in the laboratory. We do not yet have the design of a successful cellulosic ethanol plant that we know will be productive that will compete. So that's pushing. 
   I wish we were pushing coal to liquids and coal to gas with the same fervor because we know Fisher Tropes and two or three other messes, we could make gasoline, we could make fuel oil, we could make jet fuel out of coal. But no. There has not been much pushing for that. 
   I am encouraged that the President came out for offshore, but that's a big move. We've been pushing him a long time. He didn't come out quite as strong as I had hoped. He said he would lift the Presidential moratoria if we lifted the congressional moratoria. I think he should have lifted his first and said, I'm lifting the Presidential. You lift. But he didn't. But I want to give him credit for going there. 
   I want to give candidate McCain credit. He's come out. Offshore. That was not his normal position. And someone said, Well, he's a flip-flopper. Well, folks, when you see the light, when you see the facts--you know, just a few years ago the argument was we should use theirs. It was cheap. We shouldn't be using ours. Well, that's not true any more. At $135 a barrel and $13 a thousand for gas, it's time to use ours. 
   We enrich Americans. I mean, for us not to create the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of jobs in the production of energy in this country and put Americans to work producing our energy, we could be self-sufficient in natural gas, we could have reasonable natural gas prices. Natural gas could actually fuel a third of our auto fleet. All of our short-hauled vehicles, all of our construction vehicles, all of the little vehicles running around at the airport, all of those could be on clean green natural gas. No NO  
   X, no SO 
   X, and a third of the CO 
   2. It could be compressed gas or it could be propane. Either one. They all can run--that's known technology. Why we're not going down that road, I don't know.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. It's hard for me to understand because natural gas burns cleaner than gasoline. And as we were talking, somewhere between 10 and 50 percent of our gasoline now comes from Europe. How does Europe have extra? Well, they've switched to 
   diesel. They have diesel cars. They have extra capacity. 
   A year ago in the spring we had very high gasoline prices. Not this spring but last spring. And remember they were higher than they were in the fall when oil was much higher. I think oil was $60-some a barrel and we had $3 gas and everybody wondered why. Well, in the spring when we start switching and using more gasoline, Europe was short themselves. They had used more gasoline. They didn't have the surplus they normally supplied us, so they couldn't supply our needs. 
   So when you don't have enough, the market goes up. We didn't have enough gasoline in the world market, and so we paid higher gasoline prices last spring with $63 oil than we did last fall with $85 and $90 oil. Didn't make any sense, but that is the marketplace because Europe could not give us. But we're dependent on Europe. 
   But back to natural gas. It just amazes me because here is what scares me: $13 natural gas is not a world price. That's an American price. We have the highest natural gas prices in the world. So many Members of Congress can't seem to understand that that it's not a world commodity. It's country by country. 
   And so when you have the highest prices for natural gas and your company, like Dow Chemical uses $8 billion a quarter. That's $32 billion a year. You have got to produce your products where it's cheaper, and when it's a fraction of our cost--it's not like a half or a third--it's a fraction, sometimes, in some of those countries. 
   So we're going to lose all of the industries. We won't melt steel in this country. We won't bend products. We will be cooking products in other countries because you use a lot of gas for heat. Anything that uses a lot of natural gas, if we don't get that under control--and the silly part of that is, we could be self-sufficient in our total lifetime. There is no shortage of natural gas, onshore and offshore, and this country tried to lock up their own plateau. 
   In the last appropriations bill they locked up the shale oil in the west, sneaked it in the bill. Of course, the prohibition of drilling offshore is not legislation. It's stuck in the Interior bill. I was here 5 or 6 years before I knew it was there, and when I started talking about it, most Members of Congress didn't know it because it started 28 years ago. We have a vote every year. You know, today that vote was canceled. I'm not quite sure why.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. In the first subcommittee last Wednesday we had six Republicans ``yes'' and nine Democrats ``no.'' Now, it's not totally been a partisan issue. This was the first time they locked up their vote. 
   This new administration here, the Speaker and her team, have been very good at locking up votes. You have to admire them. They can get people to vote against their districts, vote against what they believe. But they've decided they're not going to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   Now, we were interested today whether they would still lock them up, whether they could hold them because in 2006 we passed a major offshore bill. We had 40-some Democrat votes. There are a lot of Democrats here who realize energy's important, and to produce your own is not some evil thing. With 67 percent dependency on oil, and half of that comes from unstable, unfriendly countries who gave us our tariffs, it would seem to me that everybody could agree let's eliminate at least half of our foreign dependence; let's stop feeding our enemy; let's stop allowing giving them the cash to buy up our Chrysler building, buy up our companies, buy up our industries. You know, industries in this country are getting purchased by foreign countries, and most of them are people who have our oil money. 
   I don't think this is the America that Americans want. But I want to tell you  something. I have faith in the American people. There's a debate going on right now. I have been on four different talk shows today. I have been on probably five or six radio shows today. Lots of print media yesterday. I did 15 different discussions. The American people are angry. 
   Newt Gingrich came out with a poll: 73 percent of Americans want offshore production. Rasmussen came out with a poll Monday: 63 percent in their poll. It's going up daily because this is a discussion going on in this country, and they're mad. They're mad as hell. And they ought to be mad because we are locking--this Congress for 28 years has locked up America's resources that every other country uses. 
   There is no country in the world--Norway, Sweden, are they environmentally friendly countries? You bet they are. New Zealand, Australia, are they environmentally-sensitive countries? You bet. They all produce offshore. 
   Offshore is not a threat to our beaches, it's not a threat to our shorelines. It's a savior. It's where our cities are, it's where our population is, it's where our refineries are, where our gas lines are. 
   You know, in New York City in zero weather, sometimes we will pay two and three times the American price for natural gas in zero weather because they can't get enough there. The price when the world is paying 10, they'll pay 25 or 30 for a few days at a time because if we had offshore production, we could feed them their--these cities wouldn't be paying these outrageous prices when cold weather comes. 
   Last year for the first time--because we use so much for electricity now--last year for the first time in the history of this country, in two summer months when it was really hot, we made so much electricity with natural gas because in a real hot week, all of the peaking plants run all day long. They run all day long because that's the only way to keep the grid up. We actually drew down gas out of the reserve. 
   See, at this time of the year we don't use all of our gas so we put it in reserve. We're putting $13 gas in the ground for next winter. Add storage costs, add pipeline charges, and a profit for the gas-distribution company, you're talking about pretty expensive gas. Last year we were putting $6.50 and $7 gas in the ground this time of year. 
   Americans do not know what is coming. The industrial users are already paying 70 percent more this year because it passes through quicker to them. But in my State, PUC, every 90 days they adjust the price. This fall Americans are going to get hit with another bullet. It's going to be expensive home heating. And we should be doing something about it.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. If the gentleman would yield, the other success story we all hear about is Brazil. Doesn't everybody say Brazil is independent because of ethanol?

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Fifteen percent of our natural gas comes from them, and they are our largest supplier of oil by far. 
   Right off the Washington coast they produce. They have produced since 1913 in Lake Erie and sell us the gas. They drill gas only in Lake Erie every summer. They don't do it in the winter, but they do it every summer and sell us the gas. And we aren't even allowed to drill under the lakes horizontally. 
   It makes no sense what we're doing in this country. Yesterday, I read an article that we ought to be partnering with Russia because they have so much resources and we need to be better friends with them. I'd rather help Mexico because they have great resources but aren't very good at producing them. They're not very efficient at producing energy. But they have a lot of gas and a lot of oil. 
   If we had a North American game plan, where Mexico, the United States, and Canada, and Alaska, where we said let's produce our own energy, we could get there. I don't think we can be self-sufficient on our own, I mean that sincerely. I don't see it ever will in our lifetime, but we could be self-sufficient in North America, and we could say to OPEC: ``So long, see ya.''

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Well, we're so far behind the curve right now, we were talking to Minerals and Mines Management today. Many of our rigs went to Russia to drill because there's so much more activity there. The big owners go where the action is, and they're being paid bonuses to go to North Africa to drill. We don't have as many rigs in the gulf. Thirty percent of our rigs are gone. Our infrastructure has dwindled because we've not opened up. 
   Now, the issue of can we be self-dependent, we would have to open up everything. It would take years to get the rigs here. We'd have to do coal-to-liquids, coal-to-gas. I mean, it would take a long time.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Twenty percent of our grid is nuclear. We need 45 new plants by 2030 online to stay 20 percent of the grid, not grow. See, everything's shrinking. Hydro is becoming a smaller piece because we're not building dams. Everything's shrinking. 
   Nuclear stayed even because all of our nuclear plants today are producing beyond their design capacity. We have enhanced their ability to make energy. I mean, America on nuclear needs to get on to what France has been doing, the reprocessing and reuse the fuel we have instead of storing it, where we use it, and when you get down to the end, you have very little fuel. 
   But this country made a decision legislatively, we're not going to reprocess, we're not going to go down that road. So we've made a lot of bad decisions. 
   And I say, how did this happen? Eight years ago, natural gas was $2; oil was $10. The argument was, do we use theirs or do we use ours? Just 10 years ago. In fact, we hit that a couple times 6 or 7 years ago. We had some real cheap energy just for a few months there. We got so complacent.

   It starts out with the Sierra Club. You know what their Web page says? They're against oil shale development. We're not doing it. They're against coal liquefaction. We're not doing it. They're against offshore energy production. We're not doing it. They're winning. 
   Greenpeace: Phase out fossil fuels. We're trying to do it and we don't have a replacement. That's really what's going on. We've caused the world shortage. 
   Environmental Defense: Must eliminate power plant smokestacks, enemy number one. 
   League of Conservation Voters: Coal-to-liquid, wrong direction, can't do that. We're not doing it. 
   Defenders of Wilderness: Every coastal State is put in harm's way when oil rigs go up. That's offshore. They're opposed. And they're winning.

Well, it's interesting, we have the talking points of the Democrats that they have 68 million acres under lease; there are--some are saying 5,500 leases, some are saying 10,000 leases: That's enough, they're not producing. I had one of them challenge me in a debate today that he wanted me to join on a bill with him to force the oil companies to drill where they are. Folks, if it's not productive, if they've drilled 10 dry holes, they're not going to drill anymore. And in some of those deep water leases, it's 7 or 8 years before you get to productivity.

   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. That's right. We need to get out into the fertile fields where we'll drill less holes in the ground, but we'll get massive prime production where you get into a fertile field that's got great gas pressure and great oil pressure and we'll get huge volumes. 
   We've been deprived. In fact, on the Outer Continental Shelf, we're showing here, we've not even allowed seismographic in the last 35 years. We don't even have a modern measurement out there. We had old seismographic, what we're measured by; but new seismographic is like taking a black and white TV with a new modern flat screen TV. There's not much comparison, is there? No. Well, we've prevented that. 
   I mean, I guess what's scary is that while we're talking about this issue, you know what's going on in the Senate? They're talking about climate change. They just voted down, thank God. And Mr. Markey's committee here has a new climate change bill. If we go down the carbon tax road, we're going to add another 20 or 30 percent to energy prices. Nobody disputes that. That's insanity. I mean, available affordable energy for America is the number one issue facing this country, and anybody who isn't for that doesn't get with the American people. They understand this. 
   Let me say this: If we don't deal with this issue in this Congress, the middle class in America will be destroyed. We don't have more years, we're years behind. The middle class in America will disappear because by the time they heat their homes and fuel their vehicles, they're not going to have money. I have a neighbor lady who makes $300 and something a week. She pays $175 a month annual gas bill to heat her home. She has two kids, $100 a month to buy groceries. She said, if my gas bill doubles, I don't have any food money. She's going to have to get a second job and still try to raise two teen-age kids with a second job to pay. Folks, that's not what America is about. Last year, we had seniors in my district keep their houses at 58 degrees because they couldn't afford to keep them warm. That's not the America we should be providing. 
   If we don't deal with energy prices, the middle-class, blue-collar jobs are all going to disappear. The middle class is going to disappear. And we're going to have a country like so many other parts of the world where we have the rich and the poor. And the government is going to have to subsidize the poor because they can't afford energy. 
   It's a crisis in America. In fact, I think we're 4 or 5 years beyond when we should have started. I don't quite know how we catch up. Every day we delay, every month we delay, the American people are going to pay a bigger price. This is not the America my father gave me in my inheritance. I want to return our young people with hope, with affordable energy. 
   Eight years ago energy was cheap; it's never going to be cheap again. It's up to this Congress to do what's necessary and provide energy for America. And all those talking points that the Sierra Club have given the Democrats don't cut it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, it's a delight to come to the House tonight and talk about an issue that I believe is vital to America's economic future, vital to the strength of our families, of our communities: energy. 
   I want to congratulate the leadership of the House. Next week is going to be energy week. We are going to be having bills coming from the Resources Committee, the Ways and Means Committee. I think, tonight, tomorrow, we will be dealing with some energy issues in the farm bill, because I personally believe available, affordable energy is the number one challenge facing America. 
   Now, from what I have seen in the committee structure, and I am hoping when we get to the floor we will have amendments, and we will have more discussion, but there are some concerns. I know that the bills coming to the floor remove incentives to produce domestic energy. That's energy produced in America or offshore. I know there is increases in taxes on domestic energy production. That's extra taxes on those who will produce, process energy here in America. But I see no incentives to produce the basic fossil fuels, oil, gas, nuclear, coal, or some that I think are potentially helpful, coal to liquids and coal to gas. 
   I have a chart on my left here that shows us the current use of energy, 23 percent clean, green natural gas; 23 percent coal, mostly for power generation. Down here, we have 40 percent petroleum, and a large portion of that is our transportation system, but it's used in other ways too. Then we have nuclear energy in the kind of a light, grayish blue color over here. 
   Now, the ones we really have all the hope for are here in the 6 percent; that's our renewables. Now you will hear everybody promoting renewables, and we should. But let's look at what amount we today have from renewables, and how we can grow them. We are going to have lots of incentives, and we have had lots of incentives. The 2005 bill had incentives for all renewables. 
   Solar is .06 of a percent of our energy supply today; .06, that's not even 1/10 of 1 percent. Now the one that surprised a lot of people is biomass, 2.4 percent. A lot of that's woody waste, it's the pellet stove industry, it's waste being burned in boilers to heat factories, to dry wood. Lots of places where they have wood waste, they put in wood-burning boilers. It's also been used to top coal-burning boilers so they can meet air quality standards, because wood burns cleaner than coal. 
   Then we have geothermal. We know geothermal is using ground heat, ground temperature, water temperature; but it's .36 of a percent. Then we have hydroelectric that's 2.7. That's a figure that's declining because we have actually taken dams out in this country. 
   Then we have wind, which we hear a lot about today, but it's .12 of a percent of our energy portfolio. 
   I guess my concern is that we have a growing need of energy in America, somewhere, 2, 2.5 percent a year; and we all know that we must conserve. We must use energy more wisely. This chart shows you that. 
   But it appears to me that all the hope, and all the faith, and all the incentives are going to be out here. We should have them out there. 
   But if we don't produce more natural gas, if we don't produce more oil, and if we don't at least develop coal to liquids or coal to gas, then the growth in the renewables will not even meet the demand in the growth in energy use in the country, so it's very concerning. 
   Now, I believe the one that we really miss out on is natural gas. Natural gas heats 57 percent of our homes. It heats probably 70 percent of our businesses. It's used in huge amounts to make electricity. I think 20 percent of our natural gas is now used to make electricity, and natural gas is a major ingredient in making ethanol. 
   We currently have 116 ethanol plants, and we have 78 under construction, and seven that are under expansion. Up to 95 percent of these plants, we use clean, green, natural gas to run their boilers to make ethanol. So that is very vital to us that we have adequate amounts of clean, green natural gas. 
   It's interesting that hydrogen is one that's not a percentage, but it's one that we talked about in hydrogen vehicles, but the hydrogen we make today is made from what? Natural gas. 
   Biodiesel, not on the chart, but another item that's starting to perk out there. We use, again, a lot of natural gas to make biodiesel. 
   Now, the problem we have had in America is we use a lot of natural gas, and here's the reason why: about 12 years ago we took away the prohibition of making electricity with natural gas. When this happened, we started to have a shortage. As the use of natural gas goes up, and we are not supplying more natural gas, we are getting huge price increases. Just 6 years ago, natural gas was less than $2 a thousand. Last year the average price to homeowners was about $12.50 a thousand, huge increases. 
   Now, this has been monumental to business. Dow Chemical, chemical companies use huge amounts of natural gas; 55 percent of the cost of making chemicals in America is natural gas. They use it as an ingredient; they use it as a fuel. Dow Chemical's gas bill in 2002 was $8 billion, a lot of money. In 2006, it was $22 billion, and today it's rising. 
   The problem we have is we have continued to make ethanol, all our chemical plants, fertilizer plants, fertilizer, 50 to 70 percent of the cost of making nitrogen fertilizer, natural gas. Natural gas is an ingredient. All the ladies who like skin softeners, a major ingredient in skin softeners is natural gas. 
   Natural gas is in our carpets. It's in our drapes. It's in many of our clothes. It's in plastic products; 45 to 50 percent of polymers in plastic cost is natural gas. 
   All the good industries we have left in this country use huge amounts of natural gas. For the last 6 years, we have had the highest prices in the world on natural gas because we have refused to open up new fields. We have refused to reach offshore. We have made it difficult in many parts of the West to produce natural gas. 
   We look at it as something evil to drill a 6-inch hole in the ground, put a steel pipe in and let gas out. Yet it's what fuels the country. America is great because we always had cheap affordable energy up until 6 years ago. 
   Another factor many Americans don't know, and too many Members of Congress don't know is that natural gas is not a world price, when, currently, oil is $75, $77 a barrel, pretty painful for our economy, but it's pretty painful for all our competitors around the world too. But for 6 years, America has had the highest natural gas prices in the world. That's something we need to do something about. 
   We can see a chart here of what it's done to manufacturing. We have lost more jobs in America because 
   of natural gas prices. As natural gas prices have risen, manufacturing price jobs have dropped because the fertilizer industry in the last 2 years, 40 percent of manufacturing went offshore. They are hanging on with a string. If we don't  bring natural gas prices down in the world average price, our farmers will be using foreign fertilizer to grow corn to make ethanol. Doesn't sound like a winner to me. 
   But it's vital, because one more chart here on trade, that a huge percentage of the trade deficit in this country is because of energy. We're buying our energy, our oil, 66 percent of our oil today comes from foreign, unstable, unfriendly countries. I find that a worry. 
   The bills we have coming up next week deal not with increasing domestic production, because when you decrease domestic production, you increase foreign imports. Now, everybody says we should be independent, energy independent. It's an impossibility on oil. I wish it wasn't. 
   Natural gas, we have reserves offshore, we have reserves onshore. We could be total supplying all of our own natural gas. We currently supply 80 some percent of ours, about 16 percent from Canada and a couple of percent LNG. But on oil, we have been gaining 2 percent a year in the last 10 years, every year, of foreign dependence. That's because we are buying this huge amount of energy from foreign countries, not our friends, and currently OPEC is in charge. 
   OPEC has been controlling prices the last year again. For a while, they didn't have control. They are back in control. As we look at where we buy our oil, Canada is one of our biggest suppliers, but they are really the only friendly one that we are really close friends with, and it's the one that we could be comfortable with. 
   The rest of the countries aren't even stable governments and could topple tomorrow. We currently have $75, $76, $77, I am not sure where it is today, but it was bouncing around there, and that's with no storms in the gulf and with no country that's in trouble at the moment. If we have one of the big exporting countries in trouble, and a couple of storms in the gulf like we did 2 years ago, we could be at $85, $90 and we could be approaching $3.50 and $4 gasoline. We all know the devastation that will have on us. 
   I have legislation I want to brief you on before I run out of time, I know I am getting short, but I have legislation called the NEED Act. It's about opening up the Outer Continental Shelf. It's 3 miles to 200 miles offshore where we have energy. Every country in the world produces on their Outer Continental Shelf but America, every country in the world, Canada, Norway, Sweden, all those green countries. They all produce energy offshore. 
   We have chosen to lock our Outer Continental Shelf up. It's a terrible mistake. It's the last environmentally hazardous way to produce gas and oil. My bill is gas only. It gives States control of the first 50 miles. The first 25 are locked up; the second 25 are open, if they want them open. The second 50 miles is open unless they have legislation, and they can even close it; and the last 100 miles is open automatically. 
   It would open up great reserves so we could have access to natural gas so we could stabilize prices in this country, so we could have energy to heat our homes, affordable energy to heat our business, energy to maintain the employment base in America that we are losing. If we don't stabilize natural gas prices, we are going to lose the petrochemical business. Dow Chemical just committed $32 billion to Saudi Arabia where gas is $1.25, where ours runs $10 or $12. 
   Folks, we have to bring natural gas prices down so we can maintain what's left of the fertilizer industry, polymer and plastics industry. The steelmakers tell me they can't stand any more high prices, aluminum makers. 
   My prediction, if we don't deal with the natural gas crisis in America, Americans will not be able to heat their homes affordably. Small businesses will not be able to stay in business if they use any amounts of energy, and we will be shipping all of these great jobs that made our country strong and to give our jobs to the working middle-class people of America, we are just going to be giving those away to other countries. 
   I predict the big bulky items, even like bricks and glass, will be made in nearby Trinidad, which is an island north of South America, only one day away in a ship where gas prices are only 90 cents. 
   I believe it's vital that as we approach the energy issue next week, that we talk about production, that we talk about how we continue to have adequate energy in America, and how we specifically have adequate natural gas to maintain the industries we have left. If we have an energy bill that only makes it more difficult to produce domestic industry, if we have an energy bill that only makes it more expensive to produce and if you tax, the production of oil and gas, if you tax the production of any kind of energy, if you tax that, you raise the price, you raise the price to consumers, because they pay it, we end up paying it as consumers. So it's vital. 
   In my view, it's vital that we have an energy bill next week and we have an open debate and we have lots of chance for amendments, we get to talk about it. What would coal liquids do? 
   I think the President has proposed cellulosic ethanol. Now, it's a good idea. That's making ethanol out of cellulose instead of corn, but the problem is, it's still in the laboratory. It's close to being able to come out of the laboratory, and, therefore, is funding six plants, futuristic. I am for that. 
   We ought to be doing the same to coal liquids. The Germans have made liquids and gas out of coal in World War II when they had embargoes and couldn't get oil. So we ought to be streamlining that process and having it ready. We ought to be juicing up our nuclear. We need all of the 35 nuclear plants that are under permit process today to be built by 2030 to just maintain 20 percent of our electric grid to remain nuclear, no growth. 
   The growth in the need of oil and gas continues, as our economy continues, and the problem we have today that we didn't have a few years ago. Just 6 years ago, gas was $2 a thousand, oil was $10 a barrel, just 6 years ago.     
   And today there is a shortage of oil in the world, and we have competitors like China and India that are consuming energy at a much faster growth than we are. They are increasing their energy use 15 to 20 percent a year. They are buying up reserves all over the world. They are building coal plants, coal-to-liquid plants. They are building nuclear plants. They are building the biggest hydro dams in the world. They are preparing for their economic future. 
   In America, because we have never had an energy shortage like this, we have had little shortages for months and years or part of a year in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s when there were world crises, but the current prices, as high as they are, are a floor on which we are going to have spikes. When we have spikes and we have $100 oil, Americans are going to struggle. They are going to struggle to heat their homes, they are going to struggle to drive their cars, especially the poor Americans, and the companies that use a lot of energy are going to struggle to make products and compete in the global marketplace. 
   I think it is vital next week that this Congress deals with energy openly. I want all the renewables to be promoted and incentivized and, yes, even subsidized. But when they are fractions of a percent, you can double them or triple them in 5 years, and they are still a fraction. They will not meet the needs of our society in the next couple decades. 
   We have to have fossil fuels. Some people hate fossil fuels. We need to use them as clean as we can. We need to use them as wisely as we can. We are going to have to conserve, because I want to tell you, the next spike in energy crisis, the Americans are going to be conserving because they are not going to have the money to pay for it. They are going to have to cut down their travel, they are going to have to keep their houses cold, and that is not how Americans should live. 
   This Congress should not be restricting access of the Outer Continental Shelf. We should not be restricting access to the vast reserves that are in this broad country. We know how to produce energy today. We ought to be forcing forward coal-to-liquids. We ought to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   And those who scream about the oil companies making huge profits, it is my opinion that the oil companies  have made huge profits because of Congress and the administration. When you restrict supply, then you increase price. And so when oil companies and gas companies invested in reserves and did that with the hopes that they would be worth $30 a barrel, and they became worth $75 a barrel, they are going to make a lot of money. If you had a monopoly on any issue or any item, and you expected to sell it for $10 a profit, and then the supply gets short and you can sell it for $30, you are going to make a lot more money. That is just basic economics. 
   So the reason oil companies have made a lot of money is they invested in oil, they invested in gas reserves assuming that their prices were going to be far less. And when our government decided that we weren't going to produce it domestically, we were going to depend on foreign countries because foreign worked cheap; it didn't really matter even 6 years ago. There was a lot of concern about our growing dependence on foreign energy, but it didn't matter. It was cheap, $2 for gas, $10 for oil. Nothing competes with that. There is no reason to go in any other direction. 
   But that is all behind us, and it is all behind us because there is actually shortness of energy in this country and in the world. And so we are huge competitors. China will surpass us in energy use very soon. India is using huge amounts. All the developing countries, as they develop their auto fleets and their manufacturing bases, they are all using huge amounts that they didn't before. They lived very simple lives. So as the world progresses, the need for energy will grow. 
   And America seems to me to be the country that is doing the least to prepare for its energy future. And its energy future is available, affordable energy, and we should have lots of gas, lots of coal, lots of oil, all the renewables we can get, expansion of nuclear. We need to be looking down every road, every new way of producing energy we can, and the cleanest and greenest we can have it. And we should be conserving it as much as we can and not wasting it. 
   But, folks, we are in trouble. As a country, we are facing serious problems, because energy that is affordable and available may not be with us in just the short months and years ahead. Two storms in the gulf this summer, one or two of the sending countries that export oil have a problem in their government. It happens all the time. 
   Eighty percent of the energy of gas and oil in the world is owned, controlled, marketed by countries that are not democracies, not our friends, and they own the oil company. Exxon is the 14th largest oil company in the world. The 13 larger are monopoly oil companies owned by the government, and those are who we are going to depend on. 
   America needs to secure its energy future. It needs to produce adequate amounts of gas, oil, coal, and all the renewables we can. We need to have an energy policy. And I hope next week we can debate all these facts. Natural gas is the clean green fuel that can be the bridge, help us with ethanol, help us with hydrogen, help us with biodiesel, and even a third of our auto fleet can be fueled with natural gas. We would save 2 1/2 million barrels of oil a day. America needs to prepare for its energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (ENERGY CRISIS IN AMERICA -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the House on an issue that I think should be a very high priority in this Congress. 
   On October 25, 2007, our world oil prices hit $92 a barrel and closed at $90. This is our chart from 1986. These are annual average prices. I can't analyze this year's price; we don't show the little spikes that happen throughout the year. But folks, we're clear up here, off the chart. 
   Two weeks ago, I stood at this microphone with shock and dismay that we had over $80 oil, had set record prices 2 weeks ago. Now, this would be understandable if we had had a storm in the gulf as we normally do every summer, but we have been protected for the last 2 years. We have not had a storm in the gulf that disrupted supply. We get 40 percent of our energy from the gulf. So whenever we have problems in the gulf we have oil spikes because oil and gas are deprived from the system for weeks, months at a time until all repairs are made, and so we lose a lot of our energy. 
   But this year and last year, we've had no disruptive storms in the gulf. We've not had a terrorist act that has blown up a refinery, a pipeline, or somehow impeded supply. We have not had a dictatorship. I don't think a lot of people realize that the vast majority of oil produced today, in fact 90 percent of the oil in the world, is produced by government-run dictatorships who own the oil, produce the oil, market the oil, skim off the profits for their social programs, and actually run their own oil companies. 
   It's kind of surprising to the world, but Exxon is now the 14th largest oil company in the world, our largest. But they are only 14th in the world. The other 13 are countries, dictatorships, some of them very unstable ones. Now, we haven't had one of them tip over, but here we are at $90 oil. 
   Six years ago, we got as low as $16, just 6 years ago. Now, it doesn't show it on here because these are average prices, but it got as low as $16. And we had $2 natural gas. 
   The question I have is, When will the House of Representatives of this Congress think that energy should be a priority issue for Americans? 
   What's really concerning is, as we look at $90 oil, we have somewhere slightly under $3 gasoline at the pump today. Now, that's not going to last because there is a lot of gasoline, there is a little extra gasoline in the market place, and this is the slowest time of year for gasoline usage, so the price is below the normal trend. 
   I talked to a refinery in Warren, Pennsylvania, today in my district and I said, where would, normally, gasoline prices be with $90 oil? If it stays there, now it has to stay there a while until the system becomes $90 oil because it's not $90 oil yet in the system. He said it will be about $3.29 or $3.30 gasoline. What does that do to the American homeowner, the American family trying to raise their children and go to work, go to school and travel, $3.29 to $3.30 gasoline? 
   We're going to have record-setting home heating oil prices this year for both natural gas, and particularly home heating oil. We already have record-setting prices for fuel oil for trucks, record-setting prices. 
   Now, the Senate passed a bill some months ago and the House passed a bill some months ago. And we heard a lot of chatter here a few moments ago about conferencing on the appropriations bill; and that's appropriate, but this week, last week, the week before, I have not heard any mention of conferencing on an energy bill for America. I don't know why they're not getting together. I guess it's just not a priority. 
   You now, why do we have record-setting oil prices? Because for three administrations in a row and 26 years of congressional rule we have locked up America's best oil and gas reserves. Then we can go up here to Alaska, and there are even larger spots up there locked up. 
   Now, I remember the arguments decades ago when gas was $2 a thousand and oil was $10 a barrel. People said, yes, we should use their cheaper energy and we should save ours. Should we be saving ours when it's $90 a barrel? 
   I don't know if you watched ``60 Minutes'' 2 weeks ago and watched Dubai build cities, build islands, build immense properties with our cash. That part of the world is enriched. They're buying our debt, they're buying our facilities, they're buying our buildings, they're buying our infrastructure because they have so much cash because $90 oil will enrich them far greater than they were enriched at $50 and $60 oil. 
   When is America going to realize, when is this Congress going to realize that high energy prices, the only way to fight them is to increase supply of all of our energy sources. They are market driven on Wall Street. Every day they're trading them on Wall Street. And when there's a shortage in the world, the prices go up. When there's a storm in the gulf, prices go up. When something happens in a country that produces two or three million barrels a day, prices go up because there is going to be a shortage. 
   Now, these are not caused by weather. These are caused by congressional action, not inaction, action. We have locked this up. This outer area is known as the Outer Continental Shelf. Should we produce there? It appears Congress thinks we shouldn't. Does Canada produce there? Yes. Does Norway produce there? Yes. Does Sweden produce there? Yes. Does Australia and New Zealand? Yes. Does Denmark? Yes. Do South American countries produce there? Yes. Is there another country in the world that doesn't produce on the Outer Continental Shelf? No. 
   America is the only Nation who has decided to lock up its energy resources. And maybe they were right when it was $2 for gas and $10 for oil, and we'll use theirs while it's cheap; but it's not cheap anymore. 
   I met recently with someone from the Department of State on energy, and they shared with me their concern that $75 oil would put this country, and maybe the world, into a recession. It didn't. But energy is such a part of our overall economy, overall lives, that when it reaches a certain point, it will put us into a recession. Every recession we've had goes to energy spikes, in the seventies, in the eighties and in the nineties. Energy prices have an immense impact on the economic future of our country, yet we sat here today, a body that's not even talking, Congress is not even talking about the energy crisis. 
   In fact, I guess they don't think it's a crisis. I thought it was a crisis for a number of years and I've been speaking out for a number of years, and I'm going to keep speaking out until this body decides that energy is something we need to deal with. 
   Now, why is energy so high? Well, what people don't realize, I was talking to a gentleman today from a world oil company, Statoil in Norway, stopped into my office just to talk. And he said the world is astounded by the amount of energy being used by China and India, the two largest populations in the world, as their economies are almost exploding with their population. Those two countries are moving forward with tremendous growth in their economies. Their energy use is growing between 15 and 20 percent per year. And their thirst for oil and gas and all other energy sources are causing the world's shortage. 
   We've never had competitors before. America has always been the big dog in the world marketplace. We've always been the big dog in the energy market. China will soon pass us in energy usage, and India is climbing fast. 
   And then you have all of developing South America. The developing world starts to use energy when they go from life on a desert, or nomad on a desert, to where they're living a life like we live. They use energy. They use electricity. They use heat. They use fuel in a vehicle. That's happening all over the world. So the demand for energy continues.     
   It is interesting. China has just made a deal with Cuba. They are going to be drilling 45 miles off the Florida coast and we can't drill within 200 miles. Does that make sense? Cuba and China will be producing oil 45 miles. Cuba is cutting deals with Canada, with Norway, and a number of other countries, I think maybe Russia, I am not sure on that one, but I know with China, where they are going to be producing oil actually within our 200-mile limit. They are  going to be producing oil where we can be producing oil, but we have chosen not to. We have chosen. 
   What does America want Congress to do? I think Americans want us to deal with the energy issue. They want available, affordable energy so they can heat their homes, they can drive to work and school, and they can live a decent life. 
   What does this Congress have on the table to deal with energy? Let's take a look. 
   These are some of the things that are in the energy bills that will be looked at in the House and the Senate. Does it produce more energy? No. We call it the ``no energy bill.'' It locks up 9 trillion cubic feet of American natural gas. The Roan Plateau. Why? I don't know. It is prepared. It is ready to be produced. It is ready to take to market. But, no, this Congress is going to say, ``That is off limits, too.'' This bill cuts off production from the Roan Plateau, a huge, clean natural gas field in Colorado that was set aside as a naval oil shale reserve in 1912 because of its rich energy resource. This means that 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, more than all the natural gas from the bill passed last year in the Gulf, off limits. It has already gone through the NEPA process. That is the Environmental Impact Statement, and they passed them. It is ready for lease sale. This provision was not in the original Natural Resources Committee bill but was added without hearings, without any input, any debate and very little discussion in Congress. 
   The next one, this one requires the redundant environmental studies to place a second well on existing oil and gas drilling pads. It really locks up 18 percent of the Federal onshore production of American natural gas. It guts the category exclusion provision from the Energy Policy Act of 2005, a provision I authored and I understand it. What it did was, NEPA is an act we have that you have to go through an environmental assessment to do anything. It takes almost a year to do this environmental assessment. I had people tell me in the West who had leased land, 5, 6 and 7 years ago and hadn't drilled a well yet because they were doing their fifth, six and seventh NEPA. They had to do a NEPA on the original plan. Then they had to do a NEPA where they were going to build the roads. Then they had to do a NEPA on every well site. Every time they turned a corner they had to do another NEPA, and they hadn't gotten a well drilled. It was being utilized to thwart energy production because they believed we shouldn't produce energy. So we took away the redundant NEPAs, and now they want to put them back. 
   Now, this one is really interesting. It locks up 2 trillion barrels of American oil from the western oil shale. What is western oil shale? This is an oil shale reserve in the West that some say has enough oil to supply us for several hundred years. We have to refine the process of removing it from the shale rock that it is in. It is somewhat similar to what the Canadians have done with tar sands. They have been talking about tar sands in Canada since I was a kid as being a great oil reserve. They have worked at it to where now they are getting about 1 1/2 million barrels a day. Their goal is soon to have, in some period of time, to have 4 million barrels a day. We are going to be the benefactor because we buy most of it, because we import a lot of oil. Thankfully, Canada produces a lot more than we do. They have worked at the tar sands with process to release that oil from those tar sands. It takes a lot of energy to do it. It takes a lot of natural gas to do it. They are fortunate. They have a lot of natural gas there, too, and they produce theirs. We don't produce ours. But we are going to lock up the shale oil. We are going to stop the production of it. We are going to stop the experiments of trying to get that shale oil so Americans can have some of their own oil and not have to pay foreign countries $90 a barrel for it. 
   Do you know what is scary about $90 oil? That is without a storm in the Gulf. It is without a dictatorship tipping over. It is without terrorist attacks. If any one of those happened tomorrow, if we have a storm in the Gulf, I had two energy experts tell me this morning, I said, ``What will oil be?'' They said, ``$120 a barrel if a major storm hits the Gulf that disrupts our refineries and disrupts our oil supply.'' 
   Folks, we are already in trouble. We better pray that we don't have a storm. We better pray that dictatorships stay stable. I don't know about you, but I am not comfortable with that. I am not comfortable with this process we are in. It also locks up 10 billion barrels of oil from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Why? Many of those oil reserves up there are tundra. They are frozen ground. There is little life. But we are saying we are not going to produce it. They want to produce it. The Alaskans beg to produce it. But Congress says ``no.'' Legal offshore contracts are being thwarted. We have legislation moving because of contracts that had royalty incentives in them that they think are too low. Now, whether they are or not, Congress doesn't have the right to change legal contracts. The Clinton administration signed them. They are law. They are a contract. But that is part of our legislation. 
   This one is really crazy. There are a lot of Members of Congress that hate the oil companies. I won't say that I am in love with them. But a $15 billion tax increase on the American oil and gas industry. When we tax the production of energy on our shores, that means we are less competitive and we are more likely to buy energy offshore. 
   And we will get to that chart in a minute. We are tremendously dependent on foreign energy. For us to tax, what they are doing was when we had the corporate tax cut for employers to grow in this country, we had a 4 percent cut. They are taking that away. The manufacturer right down the street will pay 4 percent less tax than the guy who produces energy right up the street. I don't think that makes sense, because when you increase the taxation on energy, the users pay it. The gasoline price goes up. The fuel oil price goes up. The natural gas price goes up. We are taxing ourselves. And it seems to me $90 oil is enough. Why do we want to tax it? 
   While they are trying to get at big oil, I have American Refinery, a little 10,000-barrel refinery in Bradford. It used to be Kendall Refining. They now pay the higher priced taxes. That was a company that we put together a few years ago. The State government helped them. When Kendall left us and we had a refinery and the Kendall brand got sold off to another company, and American Refinery, a smaller company came in and bought it, I used to say it was put together with chewing gum and rubber bands. But it worked. We now have 400, 500 employees there. They are a growing company. They have developed another brand. They are entrepreneurs. They are doing good. And we are going to make them pay higher taxes. 
   United Refinery in Warren, not big oil. But they provided the gasoline for most of New York State and Pennsylvania. They are going to pay 4 percent more now in income taxes. And who pays it? We do by raising the cost of energy. 
   Now this one down here I find frightening. There is nothing in the Democrats' bill about coal to liquid or coal to gas. It would seem like when we had 70 and $80 oil, that was enough incentive that we ought to start figuring out how we make liquid energy out of coal. Not burn it; turn it into gas. There are processes to do that. In World War II, Germany fought us because we barricaded them. We didn't allow them to have oil shipments. They had to make their own energy. The Germans are pretty smart people. They figured out how to make it out of coal, the Fischer-Tropsch method and several other methods. Penn State has just developed a process to make jet fuel out of coal. Instead of us incentivizing and promoting energy from coal and liquids and gas so we learn how to do it so we get it streamlined, so we make it compete with oil, so we would be less dependent on 90 or $100 oil. No, we are not going to do that because coal has CO  
   2. We can't do anything that puts carbon in the air.
   I said to some I was arguing with recently, well, let's start eight plants, and we will give them a dual role. We will say, ``We want you to streamline the Fischer-Tropsch process and you streamline this process, and let's get it going. Your secondary mission will be to sequester the carbon and figure out how to deal with it. Let's practice. Let's get to work at it.'' No, we can't do that. Coal is out.  
   I see coal electric plants all over this country being turned down for permits. That is going to have a huge impact on electric prices because nuclear and coal are the cheapest electric prices we have. Coal to liquid should be something, and coal to gas should be things that we are incentivizing. 
   Now, the interesting one down here at the bottom, raises false expectations by mandating unrealistic 15 percent RPS. Now, what is RPS? It is renewable portfolio. It says that companies making electricity in America have to use 15 percent, they have to produce 15 percent of it from renewables. I am for that. But when you mandate it by law, and it is not achievable, what happens? They are going to pay penalties. Who is going to pay the penalties? The electric users. Or they are going to cheat. Currently we make 3 percent of our electricity from renewables, 3 percent. And we are going to mandate 15 percent. 
   Now, Pennsylvania has a mandate. But they were smart. They have waste coal. They use the cleanest process they know. But that is being included in their standards, renewable standards, using the waste coal where we clean up the environment when we get rid of that runoff from the coal piles. So Pennsylvania was smart. They are using it. Now, some States will be able to do it more so than others. But some States, if you have a lot of wind farms, the only States that come to mind with real sizable wind farms that produce any amount of wind energy is north Texas and North Dakota. They will be able to do some wind. Solar is still on the margins everywhere. We are hoping and praying solar becomes a bigger factor. But we are going to say that we have to produce 15 percent of electricity from renewables. I wish that was simple. But it is not. 
   Let's look for a moment at where our energy use is. Currently, 40 percent of our energy is petroleum. And 66 percent of that comes from foreign countries. A lot of them unstable dictatorships. Natural gas is now 23 percent and fast growing. Coal is 23 percent, and I say will soon be shrinking because Federal policies, Federal regulators and EPA are making it very difficult to permit a new coal plant. There are many Members of Congress who don't want new coal plants, even though they are using the newest, cleanest methods. 
   Nuclear is at 8 percent and shrinking because the amount of electricity is growing, but nuclear has been studied. Now, there are 35 plants starting the process of permitting. The 2005 act speeded up the process.     
   It used to take 10 years to get a permit. They have told them they have to do that in 4 years, then it takes another 4 to 5 years to build the plant. For a new nuclear plant to begin producing electricity, you're probably going to be looking at a minimum of 10 years. There's one, I think, that has a complete application in; the rest are in the process. Now there are 35 that are in the process, and we need them all permitted by 2030 and built and producing electricity to keep nuclear at 8 percent of our grid, just to keep status quo. That means we are going to have to have more of something else. And if we don't meet that goal, we are going to have to have more of something else to replace nuclear. 
   Hydroelectric is 2.7 percent of our overall energy power. Nuclear is actually 20 percent of the grid, but 8 percent of overall. Hydroelectric is 2.7 percent. Again, a figure that is dropping because as energy use rises and it remains static, and there are many Members of Congress who want most of our dams in place torn down. When they tear a dam out, we lose hydroelectric power because they don't believe we should have ever built dams. 
   Now, the only energy field portfolio that is showing pretty steady growth is biomass. That surprises a lot of people. That is wood waste. This year more and more Americans will heat their homes with pellet stoves. Pellet stoves are saw dust, wood waste pressed into a pellet, put in a nice heating unit in your home. They can be put in fireplaces. More and more Americans, many use wood stoves, but they are now using pellet stoves. People who can't cut wood or don't have access to wood, and that is biomass, wood waste. 
   There are many companies in the wooded areas where there's a timber industry that heats their factories with wood waste because they have it. They take the old trash wood and they grind it up and they burn it. We have dry kilns in the timber industry. We used to run them all with natural gas. Now they can't afford to. They are putting in wood waste boilers. 
   In fact, I had a friend a couple of years ago when I saw gas prices rising, I said to him, How do you dry your wood? I knew they had two plants. They said, Well, we use natural gas. I said, Had you ever thought of putting wood waste? He said, No, why would we do that? I said, Well, natural gas is going to get pretty expensive. 
   Well, they had a little meeting about it and decided not to do it. A couple of months later they called me and said, How did you know gas prices were going up? I said, Well, I just knew it. They said, We got our new contract and our prices quadrupled and we can't afford to dry wood with gas anymore. But it took them a year to buy the equipment to put in a biomass burner. 
   There are many coal power plants who are topping off their load with wood waste so they get under the EPA standards, because wood burns a lot cleaner than many fuels. So the new hope for biomass is cellulosic ethanol. Now, that is still in the test tube. This administration is pushing six new plants. Even though it's still in the test tube, there are those who think they are close to the process. 
   Now, geothermal is one that we have high hopes for. That is where you use groundwater temperature. You either pump water out of an aquifer and put it back after you take heat out of it, or take coal out of it; or you put in a big loop system and fill it with water and use the ground to cool and warm the water after you have used it. 
   Now, wind and solar are the ones we have tremendous hope for. Windmills are being talked about everywhere. Solar. What a lot of Americans don't realize is they are not ready to take over. We have a growth curve in the use of energy. 
   These renewables at the bottom people think can supply our future needs, and we don't need to drill and we don't need to use gas and we don't need to use coal. And most of them don't want nuclear either. This is what we have to use. I wish it was growing at the rate that it would fill the bill. I wish it was ready to take over. It's not. We are incentivizing, we are supporting, we are subsidizing; but it has to become where it will pay for itself somewhere down the road. Though it's growing, when you multiply wind by two, it takes years to double it; solar by two, it's still a very small part. 
   Let's just talk about where we get our oil, once again. We are actually higher than 60. We are up here at 66, because this is a 2-year-old chart. We are up here at 66. We are increasing dependence on foreign oil 2 percent a year. Now, if we pass the Democrat plan, I predict our only option, if we pass this plan and take gas off the table and oil off the table, we will increase 3 percent a year in the future. 
   Foreign dependence, unstable dictatorships: 90 percent of the world's oil is owned, produced and marketed by a government-owned oil company, a dictator. 
   Our best friend ought to be Canada. We buy more oil from Canada than anybody, and we buy most of the 17 percent of our natural gas. We import I think about 15 percent of it comes from Canada. So we should be saying: Thank you, Canada. 
   But when it comes to oil dependence, and I hear people on the House floor talk all the time oil independence, we have got to be independent, there is no way in the next decade America could even conceive of being oil independent. Anybody who says that doesn't know the numbers, doesn't know the facts. At the same time, they say you can't drill out here and drill off the coast and you can't drill in the Midwest and Alaska, but we want to be energy independent, wind, solar and geothermal. I wish they were right, but they are not. 
   These are just the facts, folk. These aren't opinions; these are just the facts. Here's the supply of natural gas. Natural gas is becoming the choice fuel because we use it to make ethanol, we use it to make fertilizer to grow the corn to make ethanol, we use it to make hydrogen, we use it to make most of our products. I will show you that chart in a minute. 
   Natural gas is the one that is going to have tremendous pressure upon it.  It's the one that heats 58 percent of our homes. It's the fuel we ought to be the most concerned about. Why? It's not as bad price-wise today as oil. But when oil is $90 a barrel, the whole world pays that, and so all our competitors that we compete with in the global marketplace pay that. But we have one of the highest prices for natural gas of anyplace in the world. 
   On this chart, there is $1.85, $4.90, $1.65, and $7.20 is about our price. Russia, $1.50. But Trinidad is the one I am worried about. They are building every kind of manufacturing plant known to man in Trinidad. That is a very short shipping distance from the United States. If we think China is tough competition, wait until Trinidad starts making our bricks and our glass and our bulk commodities, because their natural gas prices are a fraction. 
   You know, I want the American working people to have a job. When we look at the next chart, we will see why natural gas is the one we should be most concerned about. Most people don't realize that natural gas is the feedstock for all these products. I don't mean that it is just the energy we use to make them. It is part of the ingredient. 
   I mentioned fertilizer a little bit ago. The fertilizer we grow corn with, one part of it is 70 percent natural gas. There is another one, I can't remember the name, some sort of ammonia, it is 90 percent natural gas. Natural gas is what we make it out of. So farmers are paying huge prices for energy, and in the last 2 years, 50 percent of our fertilizer business has gone offshore, and I find that very troubling. Whether it is household products, skin softeners are a derivative of natural gas, shampoos, pipe, clothing, plastic products, plastic bottles. All these products. Tires have natural gas to make them and natural gas as an ingredient. 
   It is the mother's milk of manufacturing in the world, and we are paying the highest prices for it of anybody in the world, and that puts American manufacturers and processors at a disadvantage. When oil is $90, the whole world pays, unless they have their own. If they are buying oil, they pay it. But natural gas, there is not a world marketplace because you can't just ship it around. 
   We buy about 2 percent of our natural gas, liquefied natural gas, called LNG, that comes in large tankers. Unfortunately, it comes from the same parts of the world where we buy our oil: foreign, unstable dictatorships. 
   Folks, energy for America, affordable energy for America should be the number one issue in this Congress. It should be the number one issue on the White House's agenda. It should be the number one issue in the Senate's agenda. Affordable energy for America. 
   Why should it be in crisis mode? Any of the things we have talked about, whether we are opening up the Continental Shelf, whether we are opening up land in the Midwest, wherever we are going to produce energy, whether we are going to do coal to liquids, whether we are going to do nuclear, all of those initiatives take 8 to 10 years before we have the energy to run America. 
   The longer we wait, the more trouble we are going to be in, because what is going to happen, it is my opinion, that Congress thinks little about America as a country that has to learn how to compete in the new global economy. The debate on being in the global economy is over. We are a global economy. We trade with everybody. We have to compete. There are developing countries everywhere, and we have to sharpen our tools, we have to sharpen our competitiveness, we have to help our manufacturers stay alive in this country. 
   The first thing we ought to do is give them decent energy prices, less litigation, better tax laws. You tax jobs because that is what you tax when you tax business. A lot of people say, we are just taxing business. Well, businesses are jobs. I was talking to a gentleman, a Member of the House the other day, I was talking about a cost to business we were debating about, and he said, they have got lots of money; they can pay for that. 
   I said, sir, they have choices. Do they grow this plant here, or do they grow this plant over here where costs are less? 
   They are going to grow that plant and their production where costs are less. It is a competitive world. They have to compete with competitors. And Congress needs to make priority number one helping American job makers, help American businesses compete. And that means affordable energy, legal reforms, tax cuts for business, regulatory reform to be fair to business, help our companies make sure they have the skilled workers they need with technology education, which we are terrible at in this country. We are a failure. We are one of the worst, teaching the working people the new skills they need. 
   It used to be 50 percent of Americans had to show up at a plant and within 6 weeks they knew their job and had a good job for the rest of their life. Not true today. Today you need to have skills, a set of skills that are certified with some sort of a 1-year or 2-year certificate that says, yes, he or she has this ability and she can provide this company with the skills they need to compete in the global marketplace. 
   America is being challenged, my friends. We are being challenged by fast-growing nations who have plans on action. On the energy side, China is opening a coal plant every 5 days. They are opening a new nuclear plant every month. They are building the biggest hydro-dams in the world. They are locking up oil and gas supplies all around the world. And we sit here and do not have a plan of action. 
   The 2005 energy bill had a lot of good pieces in it, and I want to congratulate all of those that created it and got it passed. It took like 4 years to pass it because this Congress didn't want to deal with energy. But, folks, it is not enough. It was just the starter. It was just the primer. 
   We are now challenged with a world shortage of energy. America must figure out how to have their own. Now, I agree, we have to conserve more. We have to use it more wisely. We have to teach Americans how to be careful and not waste energy. And we need to help small businesses be energy efficient, like big businesses. 
   Big businesses are cutting their energy bills. I have been told by many of them, they say we cut our energy bills 20 percent the last 4 years. But you know what? Energy costs us more, because energy prices are going up faster now.     
   And they were discouraged because they had worked so hard. Big business has the ability to figure out the cheapest way to do it, but many Americans don't understand and we need as a government to provide the technology and the education so that people know how to use energy wisely and purchase energy-efficient appliances and energy-efficient cars. We need to conserve. 
   But folks, we also need to have affordable energy to run this country. Folks, America is at the crossroads. Today it is $90 oil. Two weeks ago I was here, it was $80 oil. I didn't expect this. I predicted that energy prices would rise steadily this fall. I didn't think they would spike. We haven't had a storm in the Gulf which we were afraid of, we haven't had a country topple, which can cause 2 or 3 million barrels a day to come out of the system. We haven't had a terrorist attack which interrupted oil supply. 
   But in spite of that, we have fast-rising oil prices. If we couple that with any of the three I just mentioned, we have $100-$120 oil. I can guarantee you this country cannot afford $100 a barrel for oil and stay competitive and have a thriving economic base. We will go into the tank. We will be in a recession, and this Congress needs to take this issue seriously. 
   You know what bothers me in the Presidential debate, and I listened to two Presidential debates. The press asks the questions, and so I blame the press. The press doesn't take this issue seriously. The press doesn't understand this issue very well. If they did, they would be asking every Presidential candidate in every forum: What is your energy policy for affordable, available energy for America? 
   I haven't committed to a Presidential candidate yet because I don't see a candidate that has a good, well thought-out energy policy for America. That will be the issue the next President has to deal with because the Congress in the last decade, we have not adequately dealt with energy's availability and affordability for America.  
   Without a crisis, without a storm in the Gulf, we have $90 a barrel oil, and it hit $92 today. I am going to conclude my comments this evening with America needs a bona fide energy plan. We need to open up the Outer Continental Shelf where we are energy rich. 
   My legislation opens it up for natural gas, and I hope we can get it considered. I will conclude with that chart. Our bill says that the first 25 miles remain locked up, and you can only see for 11 to 12 miles, so nobody will even see it. It will not hurt the shoreline. It won't be unsightly. The second 25 miles are options of the State. If they want to open it, they can. The second 50 miles are open automatically for natural gas, but the States still have the right to close it if they choose to. By passing a law with the Governor's signature, they can keep it closed for the first 100 miles. The second 100 miles it is open. That is a pretty soft bill. That is not what I would like to do, but that is what I hope to coax this Congress into doing so we do something for natural gas. 
   We will give $150 billion in royalties to the States, $100 billion for the treasury, $32 billion for renewable energy. That's real money to help renewables; not promises, real money; $32 billion for carbon capture sequestration research, and that can come from the payments of royalties; $20 billion to clean up the Chesapeake Bay, exactly what they have been needing; $20 billion to clean up the Great Lakes restoration, exactly what they have been needing; $12 billion for the Everglades; $12 billion for the Colorado River basin; $12 billion for the San Francisco Bay restoration; and $10 billion to help the poorest of Americans winterize their homes and pay their heating bills in the wintertime. 
   Folks, the NEED Act is the act Congress needs to pass. We have 160-some cosponsors. It is bipartisan. The gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. Abercrombie) is my co-partner on this bill. It is the bill that America needs to have in its energy package, but neither the House nor Senate are talking about it. 
   On top of natural gas and offshore, we need to have a plan for nuclear, the expansion of nuclear in America. We need to have a plan where we are moving forward with coal to liquids and coal to gas. We need to have a plan where we push wind and solar and all renewables. And yes, we should look at many dams we have that are not harnessed, harnessing them for hydro. There are many dams in America that could be harnessed for hydro. 
   And yes, we need to do ethanol and biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol. Landfill gas should never be flared. It should all be plugged into the energy pipeline. We need to get serious about not wasting energy in America, conserving energy in America, and producing energy for Americans that is affordable and available so this winter they can afford to heat their homes, they can afford to run their businesses, and the jobs will not be pushed offshore. 
   High energy prices have pushed more jobs offshore than any other fact that this Congress talks about. And energy has the potential of pushing almost every manufacturing and processing job that is left in America offshore if we don't deal with the energy issue. Energy is a crisis for the future economic viability of America. 
   I challenge this Congress, both bodies and the White House, to get serious about it. Affordable, available energy for America, we could do no more. That's the least we can do to make sure Americans have the quality of life that they should have, they have a right to, and they deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (OUR CONSTITUENTS' NUMBER ONE CONCERN IS THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL -- (House of Representatives - June 04, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentlelady from Colorado and gentlelady from Virginia and the gentleman from Tennessee for the right to join them this evening for an issue that I think is very much on the mind of every American. 
   I can't talk to a neighbor, a friend, anywhere but what they're talking about energy prices. And it's interesting that it's not being talked about in this House in a productive way. 
   In fact, 2 weeks ago we passed a bill that attempts to give us the right to get OPEC into our courts to force them to produce more energy, accusing them of not producing enough energy. Now, I don't know how a government who has locked up so much of its own supply--and I'll show you here on this chart--both coasts are off-limits to oil and gas production and a portion of the gulf. And out in the middle part of the country, millions and millions of acres are locked up.     
   And of course up here in ANWR, that part of Alaska that was set aside by President Carter for energy production, has been locked up. And we passed a bill in the Clinton administration, and he vetoed it. That was 10 years ago. They said it would take 10 years to get production here, but today we would have that energy if it had happened.  
   Folks, while we lock this up, we pass a bill trying to get us the ability to bring OPEC countries into a court somewhere to force them to produce. Now, people back home kind of laughed at me and they said, well, how do we force a country to produce when we won't produce our own? How do you rationalize that? But it sounds good if you don't look at the facts, I guess. But here we are, and now the Senate, this week, is working on carbon taxes, which will increase energy prices another 20 to 30 percent. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, and Americans, listen to the carbon tax debate. It will tax energy further and raise the cost of fossil fuels, hoping, I guess, we won't use them so that we will be forced--and we will get into the renewables in a little bit. But it seems interesting to me that, at a time when every American that I talk to has one thing on their mind, affordable energy, and Congress is the reason. I'm here to say tonight, this body and three Presidents are the reason. 
   This moratorium on our Outer Continental Shelf, that's from three miles offshore owned by the States to 200 miles that's owned by the Federal Government and us, the taxpayers, we own that. We're the only country in the world that's locked it up. It was locked up 28 years ago by President Bush I for 5 years to study and see where the best was and see if we had some sensitive areas we needed to protect. President Clinton came in, just extended it to 2012 and said they wouldn't explore out there. And then the current President has not supported raising this moratorium. In fact, I wrote him a letter 2 weeks ago, a man I love dearly, but disagree with very much on lack of energy leadership because he understands the energy issue--at least he should, he's from an energy family. But he has spoken three times recently in public about opening up onshore and offshore. So we sent him a letter saying, Mr. President, it seems like if you're serious about opening up offshore, that you would lift the presidential moratorium--because we actually have two moratoriums. We have a presidential decree that's been through three Presidents that says you can't produce out there. We have legislation that Congress passes every year in the Interior bill that says the Federal Government cannot spend one dollar to lease offshore leasing on either coast in the Gulf. Eighty-five percent. 
   This is where most of the world produces a lot of their energy, these great resources. It's the most environmentally sensitive place. Fishing in the Gulf is better where we produce oil than where we don't produce oil. And when we had the terrible storms in Katrina a few years ago, the fishermen were saying--some of the rigs were really damaged, and the platforms, so they said, you're not going to take them away, are you? They said, no, we're going to repair them and use them. Because that's where the best fishing is. 
   Now, with those terrible storms, the Minerals and Mines Management said we had no measurable spillage. Actually, we have more spillage on our ocean shores from ships and sporting boats than we have from drilling anywhere. We have not had an offshore incident since 1969 in Santa Barbara. Our technology today is tremendously improved. There is no viable reason that we're not producing energy offshore. 
   Now, I'll be offering an amendment next Wednesday, the 11th of June, in the Interior Appropriations bill that will open up and remove these moratoriums from 50 miles out for both gas and oil. That will allow us to produce. Now, it's not something that's just going to happen overnight, it still would have to be, once it's opened up and signed by the President, it would have to be part of the 5-year plan. 
   What's interesting is we know there's huge reserves out here, but has never been measured by modern seismographic and modern techniques that we use today. And it's like taking an old black and white picture tube, television, and comparing it to one of our beautiful flat screen TVs today of what you can see. Today they can know what's there, what type of energy is there, how deep it is, and how difficult it will be to produce it. But we, by law, this Congress has prohibited anybody from exploring out there, even to look at what's out there. Does that make sense? Of course it makes no sense. 
   Let's look for a moment at our energy use. This is the interesting part. We are 40 percent petroleum, 23 percent natural gas, 23 percent coal, 8 percent nuclear. Now, that's 94 percent of America's energy. That's fossil fuel, except nuclear. 
   Then you have the renewables. And, you know, I'm for wind and I'm for solar and I'm for geothermal and I'm for cellulosic ethanol and all of those good things, but we have to look at how small they are. I said to a gentleman on the plane this morning flying in, I said, if we double wind and solar in the next 5 years, how much of our energy do you think--oh, 10 percent? I said, less than three-quarters of 1 percent. Because when you get down here, the only one that's really grown a lot recently is woody biomass. 
   Now, we have almost a million Americans now, just under a million Americans heats their homes with pellet stoves; that's saw dust pressed into a pellet, and they use it to heat their home. We're heating factories today with saw dust and wood chips. I have a hospital in my district that just put in a new wood boiler that has saved 70 percent on their energy bill by burning sawdust and wood chips and their own cardboard and their own paper. So that's been the one that's been growing. Geothermal has been just constant at a very small fraction. 
   Wind and solar are fractions; these are fractions. Now, if we double them, they're still fractions. And I'm for them. But I guess the false hope has been--and I want to share with you who I think is really at fault. 
   Now, Congress is at fault, but who has influenced Congress? Well, there is a group called the Sierra Club. And here is what is on their web page. They're against the oil shale development that's been talked about out west, where we think there's huge reserves. They're against coal liquefaction because we're the Saudi Arabia of coal and we think liquefied coal or coal-to-gas could get us away from the--66 percent of our petroleum now comes from foreign unstable governments. And that's where all our money is going, folks. We're enriching that part of the world who helped furnish us with 9/11. 
   They're against offshore energy production. Back to the map I had up here. The Sierra Club will lead the fight. I debated a Sierra Club member on NPR last week on a California radio station, and they said we'll be leading the fight to stop Congressman Peterson's bill from being passed. 
   Green Peace; you know what they want to do? They want to phase these out. And that's what a lot of Congress wants to do. They say, we can't use fossil fuels anymore. Well, okay, I'll buy that. I would like to be fueling our country down here. I will do anything and everything to fund these. And those who say we haven't spent billions on research in wind and solar are not being honest with you, we're spending billions annually to subsidize those. 
   So Green Peace wants to phase these out; can't do this anymore. But that's really what we're doing, that's why we have high energy prices; we're phasing out fossil fuels before we have a replacement. We've decided we're not going to produce fossil fuels. Because if we don't produce them--I've talked to Members here on the floor. Well, John, if we continue to produce fossil fuels and they're affordable, Americans will not use renewables. I said, but if you phase out fossil fuels before we have the renewables, we're going to have awfully high energy prices. 
   Now, we were arguing that when oil was $30 and $40 a barrel. I don't think any of us dreamed we would see $135 oil this year. I thought we might hit $100 oil this fall. That was my prediction. I did not dream ..... 
   Now, what's interesting that's happening now, oil I think was $122 when it closed today; that's not cheap, but it's better than $135. But natural gas prices, creeping, creeping, creeping. And natural gas is the fuel that I think is the bridge fuel. 
   Here's what natural gas prices have been doing. Natural gas prices are spiking again. This chart was made on the retail price. Today, natural gas was $12.40 out of the ground. And now what's ironic about that, this is a time of year when you don't use a lot of natural gas because you're minimizing heating and you're minimizing cooling. You're kind of at the period where we depend on natural temperatures. So we use much less natural gas at this time  of year. So this is when natural gas prices dive. And we put that cheap gas in the ground and we use it next winter because in the winter time, when we're heating the country, we can't produce enough gas for that period of time, so we store it. And my district has many caverns, salt caverns where we store gas for the northeast. 
   So we're now putting $12.40 gas in the ground for next winter. Last year at this time we were putting $6.50 and $7 gas in the ground. So the American public yet do not realize that we've had--they're paying very high prices for home heating oil, they're paying very high prices for gasoline and diesel, and they're paying very high prices for home heating oil and propane. But natural gas didn't increase much last year; it was kind of a soft year on natural gas prices. But this year, only the good Lord knows how expensive it's going to be because it appears, for some reason, it's going up like a quarter a day; so that's every four days you're up a dollar. I don't know what's causing it, it's increased use. 
   We have said no to about 50 coal plants that were designed to be built to replace old coal plants in the last 6 months in this country. States have rejected them because of the carbon issue now, or the fear of the carbon issue. So those will all be natural gas plants. 
   Now, up until about 12 years ago we didn't use natural gas to make electricity, and so we made about 8 percent of our electricity with natural gas. And that was peak power in the morning and the evening because you can turn a gas generator off and on, the rest you can't. Now that we use it unlimitedly, we're at 23 percent of our electric is being produced with natural gas. And it's a huge strain on the natural gas system. 
   Now, natural gas should never be a problem in America. We can't probably produce all the oil we need; we can do a lot better than we're doing. But there's no reason America can't have lots of natural gas. We have reserves onshore, offshore, but unfortunately most of them are owned by government entities and they're locked up. Congress has locked them up. Congress has said we're not going to produce. And these environmental groups--let me go back through them. Green Peace; phase out fossil fuels. Environmental Defense; they're against power plant smokestacks are public health enemy number one, so you can't have a power plant. League of Conservation Voters; coal to liquids, the wrong direction. They're going to fight it. Defenders of Wilderness; every coastal State is put in harm's way when oil rigs go up on our coastal waters. 
   Folks, I showed you the chart earlier about every country in the world, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, they all produce offshore, cleanly. The new technology, they turn the wells off when there are storms at the base. There has not been a major spill. And there has never been a gas spill that spoiled a beach. Gas is a clean fuel. 
   And in my view, if we had abundant reasonable natural gas, we could fuel a third of our cars with natural gas. In the cities, our buses, all our short-haul vehicles, our construction vehicles, could all be on clean, green natural gas. But the price is so high today, there is no incentive to do that. 
   To conclude here, here is the Energy Department's charts. The middle is now. This is history. This is what they project for our usage in the future. 
   Now, not long ago there were commercials on television by oil companies that led me to believe that renewables were ready to take over, they were ready to fuel this country, all we had to do was release them. Well, this is what the Energy Department thinks. Not much changed. Now, I don't quite agree with some of these. I think natural gas will increase measurably out here because the carbon issue is going to restrict coal. It may prevent us from doing coal-to-liquid. And it shouldn't happen, but it's actually happening. Coal plants are being turned down--clean coal technology plants are being turned down by environmental agencies to replace all dirty coal plants that we would like to replace because of the carbon issue. 
   So I look for gas to be--if we do a carbon tax, every country that has done a carbon tax, everybody has to go to natural gas because it's a third of the carbon when you burn it of any other fossil fuel. It's the cleanest fuel, it's almost the perfect fuel. But folks, we need oil, we need gas, we need coal, we need nuclear. We need all the renewables and hydros. And we need to grow them all as fast as we can. But our environmental groups want to eliminate all of the below and run the country on above. And it actually goes clear up to here, because they're not for nuclear. The environmental groups are not for nuclear, they're not for coal, they're not for gas, they're not for oil. But folks, that's how we run the world. 
   And with today's clean technology, there is no argument why we can't have affordable energy in America.     
   But it is the will of this Congress to open up. I hope next Wednesday on the Interior Subcommittee that we can be successful with our amendment that would open up the Outer Continental Shelf, from 50 miles out, to oil and gas production. Now, that won't change anything, but I just asked some oil company executives, who I don't talk to often but who were at a hearing, if we opened up the Outer Continental Shelf in its entirety, both coasts, and we opened up ANWR, what would that do to energy prices? He said, well, it would take the fear factor out because here is the problem we have in America. 
   Historically, there was capacity in the world of about 10 million gallons a day of oil that could be pumped if we needed it, from eight to ten. That has been historic. Recently, as China and India have increased their usage and as many of the countries--Mexico, Chavez, Nigeria, Russia, and all of them--have nationalized their oil companies and are now run by the government, they are not being run as efficiently, and they're not producing as much, so production has actually slipped in many of those countries. 
   We are down now to where there is about a 1.2-million-extra-barrel-a-day capacity in the world to meet the world demand. So, if you have a storm and when Exxon was arguing with Chavez over producing, the price went up. When we had the oil refinery a short time ago that was only a 78,000-barrel refinery, the price went up. Why? Because that is going to take some supply off the market. There is no slush. So, if you have any one of these countries--these dictatorships--topple and instead of producing 7 million barrels a day they would produce 5, there wouldn't be enough oil. So the fear factor allows Wall Street to play on those fears and run those prices up. If you took the fear factor out, the oil companies told me, it would probably reduce prices at least 20 to 25 percent. That's just theory. That's their thought. Take the fear factor because there is not enough oil in the marketplace. 
   What has happened and no matter what we do is China's growth in energy use and India's growth in energy use is 15 to 20 percent a year because, as they build a home and buy their first vehicles, they are now in the energy business. Where they used to have a donkey and a hut, they now have a house. Millions of people all over the world are joining our way of life, and to join our way of life, they need heat in their homes; they need a vehicle that needs fuel, and they're part of the energy business. Those are the developing countries in South America, in India, in China, in Malaysia. It's happening everywhere. We are soon going to be the second biggest user of energy because China is about ready to go by us. 
   I believe, if America continues to refuse to deal with energy and bring available energy to America, we will not compete in the new global economy. We are in an economy today where we have never had competitors like China and India before. We have never had this kind of pressure on us. We have to compete. 
   I want to make one final point on natural gas. Natural gas is not a world price. We have had one of the highest prices of any country in the world of natural gas now for 8 years. That is why half the fertilizer industry has left this country; they use huge amounts of natural gas. I'll just share with you some data here that's scary. 
   Dow Chemical announced a 20 percent price increase, but it's what you look at behind that that's scary. In 2002, their natural gas bill was $8 billion. In 2008, it was $32 billion. That's  four times. In 2002, 60 percent of their revenues came from American plants. Just a few years later, it was only 34 percent of their revenues. Why? They had to move offshore to compete in the global economy. Over half the fertilizer companies have left America in the last 3 years because of natural gas prices. The increase in the cost of natural gas has caused plastic resin prices to rise to record levels. It has put American-based plastic facilities--and my district is full of plastic plants--at a severe competitive disadvantage, says Josh Young of the American Plastics Council. As a result, the factories are closing or are moving offshore. They are leaving Americans jobless. Over the past 5 years, the plastic industry has lost nearly 4,000 jobs in Florida, which refused to allow us to drill, and more than 300,000 jobs nationwide just in the plastics industry. Petrochemicals have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, fertilizer thousands of jobs and steel makers, aluminum makers and glass that use huge amounts. 
   My prediction is that bulk commodities like glass and bricks, that should always be made close to home, will soon be made in Trinidad where gas is $1.50 instead of $12 coming out of the ground. We will make our bricks and glass in Trinidad, South America. It will come here in about a day and a half on a ship. 
   That's not the America I dream for. Available, affordable energy is available to us if this Congress will do what is right: Open up offshore, do coal to liquids, expand the use of nuclear, continue to subsidize the renewables and to incentivize the renewables. I think we also need to incentivize Americans. I mean Americans are conserving. They have to conserve, but we need to incentivize Americans with tax breaks that would help them write off any measurable improvement they made in their homes and in their lifestyles, whether it's heating their homes with more modern appliances or whether it's better insulation or better windows or better doors, so we can conserve the use of energy. 
   As was talked about here on the floor earlier, there is education. My school districts are getting hammered with energy costs. The hospitals are getting hammered with energy costs as are your agencies that give free aid to the people. I mean every social agency is getting hammered with energy costs. 
   I talked to a church person tonight who said they weren't sure they were going to be able to keep their church open next winter. The energy bills last year have made it almost prohibitive to keep their church open in the colder months in the winter. They are going to have to find a place to meet somewhere else. 
   Folks, this is a self-induced problem by this Congress and by three Presidents. In our Presidential debate, the number one issue ought to be who has the best plan for available, affordable energy for America.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (CONGRATULATING ZIPPO ON THEIR 75TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is a cause for celebration in the Fifth District of Pennsylvania today. This year marks the 75th anniversary of an American icon, Zippo lighters. In 1932 George Blaisdell developed the first Zippo lighter in a garage in Bradford, Pennsylvania. 
   Today, though most products are disposable or available with limited warranties, the Zippo lighter is still backed by its famous lifetime guarantee: ``It works or we fix it for free.'' A motto of a company that truly believes in its great product. 
   In almost 75 years and nearly 450 million lighters later, where last year alone 50,000 lighters a day were produced in Bradford, Pennsylvania, Zippo lighters are a legacy of good business, and almost 70 percent of them are exported all around the world. 
   Today George Duke, Mr. Blaisdell's grandson, owns the company and is chairman of the board. Gregory Booth is Zippo's president and CEO. I know them both and appreciate their resolve to keep Zippo lighters manufactured in America and, more importantly, in Bradford, Pennsylvania. 
   I commend them for their devotion to the people of Bradford and congratulate Zippo and the Zippo family for 75 years of great business.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the situation we are facing in Iraq right now is serious. The resolution we are debating here tonight, unfortunately, is not. 
   Everyone agrees the situation on the ground is unacceptable. To make it right, we need leadership, resources, and resolve. What we don't need is 36 hours of time trading speeches on a nonbinding measure, a measure that imparts no new policy, offers no new alternatives, and commands no real effect. 
   Most of the speeches I have heard this week are about the war. On that subject, there is plenty of room for disagreement. But the resolution before us isn't about the war, it is about a specific tactical question: the number of troops we need to deploy to finish the job. 
   I can't think of a group that is less qualified to make strategic and tactical decisions on the ground than 535 Members of Congress, sitting 6,000 miles away on Capitol Hill. Congress shouldn't be in the business of micromanaging war tactics. 
   Should we debate the war in Iraq? Certainly. Can we disagree about its goals and purpose? Absolutely. But decisions on the ground need to be determined by our military commanders on the scene, and not public opinion polls. 
   Of course, the other responsibility of Congress is, when it comes to wars, the power to fund them. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I take that responsibility seriously. But if my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and in the full House think the war is a lost cause, if they think that sending more troops to help secure Iraq is the wrong strategy, they shouldn't hesitate to cut off the funding for the operation. I wouldn't support that measure, but at least it would be a measure of genuine intent, not a two-paragraph statement on military tactics we have on the floor this week. 
   Mistakes have been made. But this is a mission that is consistent with our vital interest and worthy of our support. I don't believe President Bush has prosecuted this war flawlessly, and, frankly, I don't believe he has always particularly been well advised. But this strategy of reinforcement is not always supported by the President, it is supported by the military and the political leadership of Iraq. 
   People have to understand something. We are facing an enemy like no other we have faced before, an ideological enemy driven by hate, not reason; an enemy for whom there can be no rest until the freedoms and values that define our civilization are destroyed. 
   Victory is the only outcome that can be accepted. But the resolution we are debating on the floor this week was not written with ultimate victory in mind; it was written in expectation of defeat. And, unlike some of my colleagues, I am not willing to concede to defeat. 
   So many families have sacrificed so that we can be successful in Iraq, and they are willing to sacrifice even more. To cut support for them now would be unforgiveable. 
   You know, Mr. Speaker, watching the debate on the floor this week, my thoughts keep going back to the Loudon family who live in my district. 
   Their son Christopher, a member of his college ROTC program, was deployed to Iraq after graduation and came home this fall in a flag-draped coffin.  
   Their son Nicholas is a West Point graduate I nominated to the Academy, who served with his brother in Iraq, and he is heading back to Iraq this weekend for another tour of duty. 
   Their son Jonathan, their youngest, and another one of my Academy nominees, is going to West Point this fall. The Loudon family had great concern over whether to send their third and youngest son to West Point. In the end, they were swayed by their son's commitment to serve his country and their shared belief that his mission is one worth fighting for. 
   If the Loudons can remain strong and committed in the face of the most difficult circumstances any family can endure, why can't Congress? 
   I have gotten other calls from families in my district. One mother called this week to tell me that her son, a young man named Nathan Stone whom I nominated to West Point in 2001, is currently serving in south Baghdad, sweeping the city, going door to door, risking his life so the Iraqis can live their lives with a basic security. And do you know what he told his mother to relate to me? He told her that they are making a difference, they are seeing progress. They need help, they need these troops, and they will be excited when they get them. 
   If First Lieutenant Stone believes that these additional troops are vital to him completing his mission in Baghdad, that tells me a lot. And if the Loudons can send their youngest son to West Point knowing that he may some day be called into service himself, that tells me all I need to know. 
   Mr. Speaker, no one likes war. No one wants our troops to be in Iraq one minute longer than they have to be to ensure the mission is accomplished. Reasonable people may disagree on strategy, but this resolution is not about alternative viewpoints. There are no different courses offered, no suggestions, and no responsibility taken. 
   I stand with the Loudon family and Lieutenant Stone, and vote opposed to this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2537, BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a deep concern. We, as a country, will be a second-rate nation in the next decade if we don't have an energy policy. America needs an energy policy. We need to have a plan of how we're going to have available, affordable fuel for everybody to run our companies, to heat our homes, to drive our cars. 
   We don't have an energy policy, folks. We have a policy where we've locked up our resources and we're going to let the rest of the world produce. Our dependence on foreign oil has increased 2 percent a year every year for 20 years.     
   We are on that path of maybe going to 3 percent a year. Because when we don't produce, they do and we pay. We have the rest of the world consuming greater and greater amounts of energy making us now bid for our energy. 
   I find it interesting. They like to say it's the six big American oil companies, or I guess it's five, that are the cause of our energy prices. The fact is, this Congress and the last three administrations are the reason we have high energy prices. This Congress locked up. This map right here shows we're the only country in the world that's locked up the outer continental shelf, the best and safest place to produce energy. Every country in the world produces there. Cuba will soon be producing energy 50-some miles off our coasts where we prohibit. 
   We need to have an energy policy. We need to open up our midwest. We need to open up our offshore. I have the bill. I heard talk in here a little bit ago about how we are going to savage the beaches. My bill opens up for natural gas only. The first 25 miles are locked up. The second 25 miles are only open if States choose to. The second 50 miles are open; States can still close it with the legislation. And the second hundred miles are open. 
   I ask for some Member of this Congress to show me a natural gas well that has ever polluted a beach. Natural gas bubbles up under the ground all over the country from gas pressure in the earth. Natural gas comes out of the ground naturally, and if we put a 6-inch hole in the ground, it comes out in a commercial way that we can heat our homes. 
   America has had the highest natural gas prices in the world. Natural gas is not a world price. Oil is a world price. Natural gas is not a world price. For 7 years now, soon going on 8, we've had the highest natural gas prices in the world, and our fertilizer companies are leaving because they use so much of it. Our petrochemical manufacturers are leaving, our polymers and plastic companies are leaving. People who have bend metal, treat metal, cook food are going to do it in other places where natural gas is a fraction than it is here. Clean, green natural gas is what America ought to be running on until we have viable renewable. 
   I met with wind people this morning. I'm for all the wind we can get. But if we double wind and solar, which so many people are counting on, in the next 5 years we will be less than three-quarters of 1 percent of our energy needs. 
   I find it unexplainable that we have the highest fuel prices for trucks and cars, the highest heating home costs on record, and this Congress doesn't even talk about it. We don't have a plan. We are doing stimulus packages because energy is taking the life out of our economy. 
   We're going to need to do a stimulus package every 6 months, because as soon as we inject another $220 billion in, the energy policies of this country are going to suck it right back out because Americans are going to spend more and more. We have $3.40 gasoline, soon to be $4, and if we have a storm in the gulf this summer, we will be looking at $5 gasoline. $5 gasoline will sink our economy. 
   We must have an energy policy.

<DOCNO>Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PETERSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Chairman, on April 10, 2008, let the record show, oil is $110 and rising, natural gas is $10.56 and rising, gasoline and diesel prices at record levels in all our communities. 
   Folks back home are scared. They want us to help them. An amendment I will offer later will help, the NEED Act, to this bill because it will provide the ability to produce clean, green natural gas on out, out of sight, offshore. It will provide $20 billion to clean up the Chesapeake Bay and the beaches there, $20 billion to clean up the Great Lakes, $12 billion for San Francisco Bay clean-up, energy efficiency and renewables, $32 billion, carbon capture, the famous discussion in the Senate now, $32 billion. And it'll be mandated spending. The appropriators can't screw it up. 
   America's economic future is in trouble. Energy prices will prevent people from having a job, having an economy and being able to afford their vacations and go to the beautiful beaches that we have. 
   I think Roy Ennis says it best, chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality. Energy is the master resource, the foundation of everything else. Abundant, reliable, affordable electricity, natural gas and transportation fuels make our jobs, health and living standards possible. Energy is the great equalizer, the creator of economic opportunity and environmental justice. Push energy prices up, everybody suffers. When energy costs get too much, industry lays people off or just leaves. Jobs, income and tax revenues vanish. Government social programs wither. Town and leadership migrate to other cities, other countries. Social ills multiply. That's why I say the fight over energy is the critical civil rights battle of our era. Your utility bills, the price you pay at the pump, your job security are in danger, and not just because of the Middle East oil wars or competition from China and India. Our rights are being endangered because of what's happening right here at home. 
   This Congress is the cause of high energy prices. There's no action here to fix the ills of the past. We're locking up our energy supply. It's not even to be debated. It's not even a priority. 
   Congress is the reason America doesn't compete energywise. And, folks, in a period of time, we won't compete in the global economic economy, and we will not have jobs and a future for this country. We have the potential of being a second-rate nation because we, as Congress, have caused the energy crisis and are refusing to fix it.
