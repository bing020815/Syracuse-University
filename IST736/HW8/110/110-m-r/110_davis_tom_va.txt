<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (RECOGNIZING COMMENCEMENT OF RAMADAN AND COMMENDING MUSLIMS FOR THEIR FAITH -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 635.  
   As our Founding Fathers recognized, the strength of this great Nation derives from the tolerance we espouse. America builds strength from its diversity. I am proud to be a part of a country where every person may practice their religious beliefs without fear. At a time when religious differences are igniting conflicts throughout the world, America serves as a beacon of hope that religious tolerance is not only achievable, but only serves to make a country stronger and more viable. 
   The Islamic faith follows the lunar calendar. During the ninth month of the lunar calendar, called ``Ramadan,'' the Arabic term for intense heat and scorched earth, Muslims throughout the world celebrate the revelation of the Quran. In 2007, the month of Ramadan lasts from September 13 to October 12. This sacred month is observed with prayers, fasting, and charity. 
   I believe we could all use a time of peace and reflection. Ramadan embodies these principles, and I applaud our Muslim friends and neighbors for their sincere religious beliefs. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 800, the Employee Free Choice Act. 
   Today we are considering legislation to strip away a fundamental right for American workers: the secret ballot. 
   Secret ballot elections have long protected workers from intimidation, coercion, and retribution. The National Labor Relations Act of 1947 set in statute a system that gave workers the option of voting by secret ballot when deciding the question of union organization in their workplace. 
   Why, 50 years later, is there a compelling need to do away with the secret ballot system? How is it that a worker will only be given a ``free choice'' by making his or her preference known to all? 
   This isn't about protecting workers; this is about flagging union membership and declining dues. Unions only represent 12 percent of the workforce--only 7 percent in the private sector. Union bosses know they don't fare as well in secret ballot elections as they do in card check elections, so they want to do away with them. 
   Only two months after they regained the majority, the Democrats are here to do the bidding of their union backers. There is no other reason for this debate today. 
   Consider the following letter sent to Mexican officials in 2001. This letter states:   
   . . . the secret ballot is absolutely necessary in order to ensure that workers are not intimidated into voting for a union they might not otherwise choose . . . we feel that the increased use of the secret ballot in union recognition elections will help bring real democracy to the Mexican workplace.  
   This letter was signed by 16 of my Democratic colleagues, including the sponsor of today's bill. Perhaps they have had the benefit of reflection. 
   Madam Chairman, this legislation isn't about helping the working man and woman; it isn't about fairness or discrimination. It is about political payback, it is legislative tribute to the union bosses that still control the Democratic Party. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this amendment barring funding in this bill to be used to designate any area as a ``national interest electric transmission corridor,'' or a NIET. NIET designation and the corresponding authority that has been given to FERC blatantly usurps States rights to designate and site transmission lines in accordance with what is best for its citizenry. There is a well-established successful history of States executing this authority, and there is no real reason to take it away. 
   I understand there needs to be a holistic approach to our energy policy, but absent clear and definitive reasons to grant this authority to FERC, why are we allowing this Federal entity to circumvent State siting decisions, State comprehensive energy plans, and State efforts to promote energy efficiency and independence? It is clear more analysis and consideration is needed. 
   This amendment would not strike this provision forever. Rather, it would allow us more time to have debate, oversight, and public comment on the issue. When this provision was passed in the last Congress by the Senate and signed into law, it was a small piece of a broad energy overhaul. It received no debate on this floor and no vote in this body. Now, with the prospect of towering transmission lines running through 214 counties in 11 States across our Nation, and that is just the first chapter, we must take a time out to reexamine this provision. 
   What will you tell your constituents when these towering lines are denied by your State regulators, but mandated by FERC? You had your vote today and you need to vote for this amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Vote ``yes'' to allow us to give needed consideration to the broad ramifications of proposed NIET corridors and ensure that the rights of States are not unduly trampled.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 295. 
   This resolution recognizes the tremendous alliance that the United States shares with the Republic of Korea. Korea has been one of this country's strongest allies, both in the international war on terror, as well as in expanding free trade. Korea stands as a shining example of democracy in action. 
   In the 11th Congressional District of Virginia, I represent a growing and vigorous Korean American population. Korean Americans thrive in areas such as business, medicine, law, art and athletics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Korean Americans own and operate over 130,000 businesses and employ over 333,000 individuals. These are prime examples of their importance in the United States and to the growth of our economy. It is clear to me that the strong alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea can be seen everyday in the neighborhoods and workplaces right here in the Washington, D.C. area. 
   The Republic of Korea's strong belief in upholding individual rights and liberties serves as an example for the entire Korean peninsula, as well as beyond. Korea's 2,300 troops deployed in Iraq and 200 troops deployed in Afghanistan indicate not only Korea's support of our efforts in ending terrorism abroad, but also illustrate Korea's strong commitment to spreading democracy throughout the world. Indeed, Korea has been one of our most ardent and unfailing allies abroad. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, today, we take up the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2007. This legislation would modernize, clarify, and expand the laws protecting Federal employees who blow the whistle on waste, fraud, and mismanagement in the Federal Government. 
   At the outset, I think it is important to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Platts). Throughout this process, Mr. Platts has been an unwavering advocate for Federal employees. This bill would not exist today in this form if not for his steady leadership. 
   Almost immediately following the 1994 changes in the Whistleblower Protection Act, it became clear that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals would continue to create loopholes where no loopholes were intended and dilute protections for whistleblowers Congress clearly intended to protect. 
   This bill we are considering today develops a new regime governing whistleblower protections and offers fresh solutions to the continuing problem of employee retaliation. I am proud this legislation would allow Federal employees and contractor personnel to pursue their claims in the Federal district court, to be heard before a jury of their peers, if no action is taken by the Merit Systems Protection Board within 180 days. 
   Under current law, cases filed by employees who believe they have been retaliated against for blowing a whistle can sometimes end up languishing before the MSPB for years before a final decision is issued. H.R. 985 would change the process and allow Federal employees to reach resolution on this issue one way or the other. 
   I am disappointed, however, the Rules Committee did not make in order my amendment to remove from the bill language which would provide for an ``all circuits'' review of whistleblower claims. 
   My amendment would have tried to maintain the uniformity in the consideration of whistleblower cases in the Federal courts by keeping in place the current requirement that all whistleblower appeals go through the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than opening up appeals to all circuits. 
   Without my amendment, Federal employee whistleblowers could end up possessing a different set of rights and protections based on where they file their claim. For example, a Border Patrol agent in Texas could be protected by a different set of whistleblower protections than a Border Patrol agent in Maine. 
   I think the underlying legislation already provides sufficient reforms to the whistleblower protection laws by revising the statute under which the Federal Circuit reviews whistleblower claims. Going further in this legislation, removing the requirement that all appeals must go through one Federal appeals court, is going to, in the long term, be counterproductive to our policies governing Federal employment. 
   I am also interested in the amendment dealing with national security whistleblowers Mr. Hoekstra filed at Rules, but was not made in order. While I supported the language Mr. Hoekstra's amendment sought to strike, I understand many members from the intelligence-related committees and officials in the intelligence community have concerns which I believe need to be addressed before this bill moves on to the Senate. 
   One additional concern I would like to mention is with section 13 of the bill. Section 13 would open a whole new area of personnel conflicts to whistleblower protections. This new language, added to the bill this year, would make influencing federally funded scientific research a prohibited personnel practice by specifically identifying the dissemination of false or misleading scientific or medical or technical information as an ``abuse of an authority'' that is actionable in Federal court. 
   Rather than acknowledging the natural and perfectly healthy tension that exists between science and policymaking, this section would submit the ``science versus ethics'' issue to the Federal courts to be litigated as a personnel issue. 
   Unlike many on the Democratic side of the aisle who believe only scientific findings should serve as the foundation for public policy and decisionmaking, I believe science is just one cog in the policy decisionmaking process. Science must be balanced against factors such as the morals of our society and the ethics of individual policymakers, as well as countless other policy considerations. As I have said before, I don't believe we should turn the tension between science and policymaking into a personnel matter that gets litigated by the courts. 
   In closing, I believe the underlying legislation makes a number of important positive contributions to Federal whistleblower policy, and I support this bill. 
   While I believe we can still make a few refinements to the bill to make it better, I applaud Mr. Platts' and Mr. Waxman's efforts to move this bill forward. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of our time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would amend the section of the bill dealing with the so-called ``politicization of science'' to say that Federal researchers and scientists are permitted to publicize the results of their federally funded research without any input from the agency paying their salaries and employing them. 
   First of all, I think it is inappropriate to shoehorn the debate about public policy influencing science into a bill about protecting whistleblowers. That is why I intend to support Mr. Sali's upcoming amendment to strike entirely the section which gives rise to this amendment. 
   Second, this amendment would make worse the provision in the underlying bill which would turn the natural tension between science and public policy into a personnel issue to be litigated in the courts. 
   The whistleblower laws protecting Federal employees are intended to protect individuals retaliated against for exposing waste, fraud, or abuse in government. This amendment has nothing to do with waste, fraud, or abuse, it actually has to do with one person's opinion. 
   Instead, this amendment would give an individual Federal researcher who conducts research using taxpayer dollars the full discretion as to how and where to publicize his or her research, prohibiting the agency who financed the research and for whom the researcher works from even getting involved in that process. 
   If a Federal researcher conducts a study using Federal money and decides he or she wants to present the research at a meeting in, say, Cuba, Iran, the Federal Government can wind up in court if it attempts to prevent the researcher from presenting the findings in that country. 
   Or if a Federal researcher conducts a study using Federal money on a classified national security matter involving, let's say, satellite technology, the Federal Government would be legally barred from having any say in how and to whom that information gets disseminated. 
   It is an overreach. This amendment protects one individual's right to determine how best to use taxpayer dollars instead of the collective judgment of elected and appointed policymakers. And to add insult to injury, the underlying bill would require taxpayers to pay the attorneys' fees of the individual should the researcher sue the government for trying to get involved. 
   To make matters worse, there is nothing in this amendment that would bar the Federal researcher from touting the fact that his or her work was ``Federal research,'' giving it the pretense of being research endorsed by the American public. It is a slippery slope to scientific chaos where the taxpayer foots the bill for conflicting, misleading, and possibly even poorly done work. There are no protections for the public or taxpayers for this amendment. 
   We have held a number of hearings in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee under the leadership of Chairman Waxman to investigate the possibility of ``politicization'' of science, and I understand the problem this amendment is attempting to address. I don't think, however, this is the way to do it. This is possibly a deal killer in terms of how this bill comes together in getting support from this side of the aisle. 
   This amendment is bad public policy, and it is bad for national security. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I don't think there is a Member of this House that doesn't sympathize with what the gentleman from Michigan is trying to do. 
   The difficulty is the way this amendment is drafted. It is a huge overreach. It allows anybody who is doing research under the auspices of the Federal Government to then publish it without any kind of overview from their superiors, who sometimes have competing reports and deliberations as they reach a public policy decision. 
   This is bad law. It allows attorneys' fees in the case where somebody is denied that opportunity. 
   This kind of overreach amendment is not about whistleblowing at all; it is a politicization of science from the other perspective. I urge Members to defeat this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I oppose this amendment. This amendment would raise the threshold by which agencies must prove they would have taken disciplinary action against an employee notwithstanding the employee's whistleblower claim. 
   Current law requires agencies to prove this by clear and convincing evidence. This amendment raises the threshold and requires agencies to prove that such action was highly probable or reasonably certain. 
   There may be a real issue here which must be addressed, but after working on this bill for years now yesterday was the first time that this issue was brought to our attention. 
   On its face, I am concerned this amendment would raise an already high threshold imposed upon agencies trying to prove they are placing an employee on administrative leave because, for example, the employee sexually harassed another employee and not because the employee is a whistleblower. The current clear and convincing evidence standard seems a sufficient burden of proof to impose upon agencies. 
   I am also concerned we may be establishing a dangerous precedent by further defining in one isolated statute what the term ``clear and convincing evidence'' means. Does the U.S. Code typically define standards of proof such as ``clear and convincing'' and ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' or are these terms of art defined in case law? And does this new definition of ``highly probable'' or ``reasonably certain'' actually solve the problem or does it make it even more confusing for courts and litigants? 
   Mr. Chairman, there may be a valid issue here worth investigating. It is entirely possible that the Office of Special Counsel, the Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts are getting this wrong, but we should review this proposed change and vet it through the committee process before amending the Whistleblower Protection Act. 
   The good news is we have an opportunity to address these questions. The authorizations for both the Office of Special Counsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board expire this year, and the committee can and should carefully review the issue as we consider these reauthorizations. 
   I think my concern on this, if there is a pending sexual harassment claim against an employee, and they all of the sudden turn out and become a whistleblower, that then in the sexual harassment claim we have a higher standard, and for the litigant, the person that has been harassed in that case, they have a higher burden of proof than they would notwithstanding the whistleblower claim. I do not think that is fair to the person who is being harassed in this case, and I do not see a need for it. 
   So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment today and allow the committee in regular order to consider carefully and foil this problem identified by my good friend and colleague Mr. Platts. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania and, once again, thank him for his leadership on this issue. I support this amendment. 
   This amendment will extend additional whistleblower protections against reprisal to employees who cooperate with their agency Inspector General or in some other official grievance or investigative process. 
   Unfortunately, courts have misread the intent of the Whistleblower Protection Act and have arbitrarily reclassified certain whistleblowing activity as an exercise of appeal right. These rights are covered under a different section of title V of the U.S. Code. 
   By reclassifying these activities as exercises of appeal right, the courts have deprived employees of whistleblowing protection for their same disclosure showing significant misconduct if presented in a grievance or litigation instead of, for example, in a television interview. 
   It could occur when an employee faces reprisal as one associated with a whistleblower when testifying in an IG investigation or Office of Special Counsel investigation. 
   It strikes me these are precisely the forums Congress intended the whistleblower to take. These are, in essence, whistleblowers who are operating within the existing chain of command. They have used the chain of command, not gone outside the system, but they are not afforded the same protection as those who do. 
   These are the forums where we can actually make a difference to policymakers. This amendment ends the inequity by clarifying that an otherwise protected disclosure cannot be disqualified because of the forum where it is communicated. 
   I support this amendment. I congratulate my friend for offering it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1591. This is not an Emergency War Supplemental; it is the Partisan Repayment Act. Indeed, this legislation is less about supplying the troops than feeding the base. 
   There is desperate need for a new Iraq policy, and we should be using this opportunity to have a serious discussion. It is unseemly, even embarrassing, to use pork to buy support for bad policy on a bill as important as this one. It makes us look as trifling and greedy as our enemies claim. The well-being of our men and women in uniform is in the balance, as is the future of the Middle East. If ever there was a time to win on the strength of one's ideas, this is it. 
   I share the concerns of my colleagues regarding the progress of the war, and I believe there is value in setting benchmarks. Ours should not be an open-ended, unquestioning commitment to the Iraqis. They do need to assume more responsibility for their own affairs. It is not the job of our troops to referee partisan quarrels, nor is it our job to baby-sit the Iraqi government. 
   It is foolish, however, to make such milestones public. It is even more foolish to announce a date for withdrawal. Doing so gives the enemy too much information and too many options. 
   It is also foolish to codify deadlines. Who's to say the Iraqi government won't make a good faith effort to accomplish the tasks required of them? It would be wise to allow them flexibility, not give them a drop-dead date. We ourselves are working under a continuing resolution because we could not pass more than two appropriations bills last year. Our 5-day workweeks are often 4 days long--who are we to set a deadline in statute? 
   There is a pressing need to formulate a new policy for Iraq. I am disappointed the Democrats have yet to allow a serious debate on this, the most important issue facing the Congress today. Rather, we have wasted time with a non-binding resolution regarding tactics--not even strategy. Now we send the Iraqis a laundry list of errands and a pre-determined result. 
   Success in Iraq will require a broad based policy shift. The Iraq Study Group report includes 79 recommendations covering all facets of public policy--military, diplomatic, economic, and social. This report should form the basis of a productive discussion. Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership has opted for a hodge-podge of sound bites masquerading as serious legislation. They have stifled debate rather than encouraged it by refusing to allow any amendments. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is but the first act in the play. Our own servicemen and women do need the funding this bill would provide. I am confident once we get beyond this charade we will be able to craft responsible legislation to give it to them.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I've traveled a long road with the District of Columbia Access Act--from March 1, 1999, when it was introduced, until the present day. 
   That road took us through the predecessor subcommittee I chaired at the time, to the full Government Reform Committee, to the House and Senate floor, and then to the White House, where then-President Clinton signed the measure on November 12, 1999. 
   In all of its legislative approvals the College Access Act--also known as the Tuition Assistance Grant Program--was passed unanimously, by voice vote. President Clinton had included sufficient money in his budget submission that year, and a statement of administration policy endorsed the approach we had taken in authorizing use of those funds. 
   I am deeply proud of our hard, bipartisan effort in enacting this measure and in reauthorizing it 2 years ago. 
   My thanks to ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who was ranking member of the District of Columbia Subcommittee in 1999, and who has worked tirelessly to enhance this legislation ever since. 
   I would also like to thank my then-counterpart in the Senate, GEORGE VOINOVICH, for his continuing support, and Senators WARNER and DURBIN for working with us to improve this legislation. 
   I'm also grateful to my namesake Chairman DANNY DAVIS, chairman of the subcommittee, for holding a hearing on this bill March 22, ranking subcommittee member KENNY MARCHANT for his support, and Chairman WAXMAN for marking this bill up so expeditiously. 
   The 5-year reauthorizing legislation before us today will enable District residents to continue to attend colleges and universities at in-State rates. President Bush, in his budget submission for fiscal year 2008, has included sufficient funds to make this happen. 
   Then-Mayor Anthony Williams and now D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty have both strongly supported this law as being very important for District high school graduates. The Tuition Assistance Program has doubled the total number of District students attending college since 1999-2000, the school year before the program started. We have incentivized getting a college education. 
   This law is a classic ``leveling of the playing field.'' No city or county in the country is required to supplement in-State rates with local funds, and neither should the taxpayers in the Nation's capital be saddled with this burden. Neither should the city be penalized for its own success in administering this program. 
   Back on March 4, 1999, when I first introduced this bill, I went to nearby Eastern High School with Ms. NORTON. I was deeply moved by the reaction of the students. I will never forget how so many took our hands, looked into our eyes, and thanked us for introducing the original bill. 
   I'm proud of all we have been able to do in the Nation's capital since 1995, when the city was literally bankrupt. Economic development, public safety, the real estate market, and so many other aspects of city life have changed for the better. 
   But nothing has given me more satisfaction than working to improve educational opportunity. Fighting for equal educational opportunity is one of the reasons I entered public life. 
   We need a healthy city to have a healthy Washington region. 
   Reauthorizing this law, which has expanded higher educational choices, is a strong part of our vision for the future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 117. 
   Mr. Speaker, 400 hundred years ago a group of entrepreneurs from the Virginia Company landed on Jamestown Island with the intent of establishing a colony to find gold and a water route to the Orient. This landing spot became the first permanent English colony in America and later became the capital of Virginia for 92 years. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask today that we take a moment to focus on the courage of those who lived there. 
   In a strange land, yet not the land they sought, in an unhealthy place plagued by disease, fire and the elements, they banded together to make a life. 
   And that life was not an easy one. By the end of 1607, after a particularly harsh winter, only 60 of the original 214 settlers remained alive. If Captain John Smith hadn't contrived to get food for the Indians, the American dream might well have died on those swampy shores. 
   Suffering and hard work were not strangers to the colonists. By 1614, the settlers had a cash crop--tobacco--and they worked hard to see that it sustained the colony. 
   To ensure order, they formed the House of Burgesses, the first representative assembly in America. Soon, every farmer in Virginia was granted 40 acres of land on which to farm tobacco. 
   Still, they had little beyond that which they could get for themselves or the local Indians. It is hard today to fathom the courage of those who struggled against all to make the colony and their families a success. 
   Today, 400 years later, we honor not just those brave people but the native Americans they encountered and the Africans who became indentured servants soon thereafter. 
   I encourage all Americans to take a cue from the Queen of England and make the pilgrimage to Jamestown during this historic year. 
   I encourage them to observe first-hand the hardships endured, the friendships forged, the commitment to something more than survival--the courage to leave behind far more comfortable lives in England and take the chance of a lifetime. 
   These were the first Americans in many senses. They were the first to form a government, the first to be willing to push past tradition and comfort for adventure, for fairness, for democracy. That's why I am I proud to urge passage of H. Con. Res. 117.

   Despite historical records documenting the existence of these tribes dating back to the 1600s and formal recognition by the Commonwealth in the 1980s, their efforts to receive Federal recognition have been ongoing for decades. 
   While documents normally required by the Bureau of Indian Affairs are missing or have been altered, this was not the fault or result of tribal action. In 1997, Virginia passed legislation to correct these historical records and in 1999 passed a resolution urging Congress to grant these tribes Federal recognition. 
   This inequity should stand no longer. The Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Eastern Division of the Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe Inc., the Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe deserve to be on equal footing with other tribes in the United States. They would benefit greatly from the ability to compete for educational programs, grants and other federal services. 
   Mr. Speaker, this has gone on long enough.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this bill, not because I oppose punishing war profiteers or punishing corruption in contracting. I think these are critical, important laudable goals. 
   I oppose this bill because creating a new law ``involving a contract or the provision of goods or services to the United States'' is a matter which must be considered in relation to the existing Federal acquisition systems, which this bill is not. Any attempt to legislate without considering the current system can have disastrous, albeit unintended, consequences which in this case include serious criminal penalties. 
   As others have said today, we all agree that fraud against the United States undermines national security and there must be severe penalties for it. And of course we all agree corruption of any kind is unacceptable. Our committee in the last Congress held several hearings on contracting in Iraq and the difficulties that were faced there. And if the current law is inadequate to punish wrongdoers for these offenses, Congress should act. 
   But taking up this bill in this way at this time proves to me that some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are caring about passing a bill so that they can take political potshots at contractors. Hundreds of contractors' lives have been lost over in Iraq, and I think the widows and the mothers of these sons and daughters who have been killed in Iraq would be, I think, chagrined to hear their sons referred to as profiteers. In many cases the contractors are more in harm's way than our troops. They don't get the body armor. Many of them don't operate in the Green Zone or on bases. This is, in fact, a substitute, a proxy, if you will, because the majority can't put together a plan to end the war in Iraq so we go after contracting in Iraq. I think there are some things we could do, but I don't think this bill is the appropriate way to get through it. The words in this case don't make sense. It's not good law. What you care about is contractor bashing, consequences be damned. 
   It is hard to get good companies to do business in Iraq. It is dangerous, it is expensive, it has all kinds of contingencies, and a lot of the best companies say we don't want to have anything to do with. 
   The relationship between the government and the contractor is an arms-length business one, with many laws outlining how this relationship should proceed. Adding additional language to the criminal code regarding certain aspects of this relationship will have unintended consequences which have to be considered before moving this legislation forward. 
   For example, the bill makes it a crime to materially overvalue a good or service. Under the Truth in Negotiation Act, a detailed process is already set out in which to address claims of defective pricing in Federal contracts. To those who don't know this government contract lingo, this might sound like fraudulent behavior. 
   But defective pricing occurs when a company's contract price is significantly increased because the company submitted pricing data that was not accurate, complete and current. That's 10 U.S.C. 2306(a). In these cases, the government is generally entitled to a price reduction to remedy any overcharge by the submission of defective pricing data. 
   The government takes seriously overpayments based on defective pricing and aggressively pursues contractors found to have engaged in these practices, in some cases including debarment. A contractor's liability can extend beyond the repayment of any overcharges, and under current law, can include fraud claims against the contractor. 
   But under H.R. 400, would an overzealous prosecutor be able to go after a company with a defective pricing claim against it as materially overvaluing a good or service? Maybe. Maybe not. But we, on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee with jurisdiction over Federal procurement should have the opportunity to consider this language and its impact on the Federal acquisition system. 
   The interrelationship of procurement law and the criminal law can be complicated. We have to be careful not to criminalize procurement management matters just because you can. Careful study is required to separate criminal behavior from management issues. 
   I see other problems as well. Allowing a Federal prosecutor to enter post hoc determinations on whether a contract provides appropriate value to the government would have a chilling effect on a contracting officer's decisionmaking. 
   Contractors would be discouraged from providing innovative solutions to government problems for fear that their solutions would subject them to charges of material overvaluation if the solution didn't work out as planned. 
   Competition would be discouraged, which is the cornerstone of getting the best price and value because prospective contractors could be subjected to harsh penalties at the whim of a prosecutor who probably doesn't understand the acquisition system. 
   In fixed price contracts, the price which the government buys would likely increase because contractors would have to include the possibility of these penalties in their pricing, costing the taxpayers money. 
   In commercial contracts the market dictates what is a fair value, not a post hoc prosecutor's determination whether the government got appropriate value from the contract. 
   I support strong penalties for war profiteering. I support strong penalties for corruption. I do not support H.R. 400 because I don't believe it has been given appropriate consideration by this House and numerous unintended consequences.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I think the key here is that this legislation is needed. You have defective pricing legislation. You have Qui Tam actions. You have the Procurement Integrity Act. The language in this bill that concerns me is not the fact that its intent to defraud; that's in a lot of legislation. It's materially overvalues any good. And I can't find any precedent for that in the federal acquisition regulations. I can't find any precedent in terms of what this means and how a prosecutor could take this from materially overvaluing any good. That is a very subjective measurement. There are a lot of unintended consequences. And I suspect this bill will pass today, although not with my vote. But I hope we can improve it if we're going to make this actual law.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (EXTENDING DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COLLEGE ACCESS ACT OF 1999 -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1124, legislation I introduced earlier this year to extend the District of Columbia Tuition Assistance Program through 2012. 
   This past May, the House approved the bill overwhelmingly and sent it to the Senate. Last month, after adding an amendment to exclude families who make more than $1 million a year from participating in the program, the Senate passed the bill 96-0. The amended legislation is now pending before the House. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Prior to the creation of this program in 1999, residents of the Nation's capital did not have the luxury afforded to high school graduates everywhere else in the country, the chance to attend public colleges and universities at in-State tuition rates. This program levels the playing field by allowing District graduates to attend public colleges and universities at in-State tuition rates. 
   The success of the Tuition Assistance Program is overwhelming and indisputable. College enrollment of public high school graduates in the District has doubled in the 7 years since the program was created from 30 percent to 60 percent, with 5,300 District graduates currently participating in the program. Few, if any other, federally funded initiatives can claim this level of success. 
   The program has always received broad bipartisan support. Both Houses of Congress unanimously passed authorizing legislation for the program in 1999, and again in 2005. And the President has always supported full funding for the program in his annual budget request to Congress. 
   The proven success of the program and the District's unique status make our choice simple. Congress should continue to support this legislation to provide higher education opportunities to high school graduates in the Nation's capital. I can't tell you how many parents told me, ``We would have moved to the suburbs if the program didn't exist.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support a level playing field for high school graduates in the District. It's the right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do. 
   I would also, at this point, like to thank, on the Republican staff, Mason Allinger, Howard Denes and David Marin for their hard work in bringing it to this moment.  
   I've traveled a long road with the District of Columbia Access Act, from March 1, 1999, when it was introduced, until the present day. 
   That road took us through the predecessor subcommittee that I chaired at the time, to the full Government Reform Committee, to the House and Senate floor, and then to the White House, where then-President Clinton signed the measure on November 12, 1999. 
   In all of its legislative approvals the College Access Act, now known as the Tuition Assistance Grant Program, was passed unanimously, by voice vote. President Clinton had included sufficient money in his Budget Submission that year, and a Statement of Administration Policy endorsed the approach we had taken in authorizing use of those funds. 
   I am deeply proud of our hard, bipartisan effort in enacting this measure and in re-authorizing it 2 years ago. 
   My thanks to ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON, who was ranking member of the District of Columbia Subcommittee in 1999, and who has worked tirelessly to enhance this legislation ever since. 
   I would also like to thank my then-counterpart in the Senate, GEORGE VOINOVICH, for his continuing support, and Senators WARNER and DURBIN, for working with us to improve this legislation. 
   The 5-year re-authorizing legislation before you today will enable District residents to continue to attend colleges and universities at in-state rates. President Bush, in his Budget Submission for fiscal year 2008, has included sufficient funds to make this happen. 
   Then-Mayor Anthony Williams, and now D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, have both strongly supported this law as being very important for District high school graduates. As documented to this subcommittee, the graduation rate for public school students in the city has doubled since this law went into effect. We have incentivized staying in school. 
   This law is a classic ``leveling of the playing field''. No city or county in the country is required to supplement its in-state rate with local funds, and neither should the taxpayers in the Nation's capital be saddled with this burden. Neither should the city be penalized for its own success in administering this program. 
   Back on March 4, 1999, when I introduced this bill, I went to nearby Eastern High School with Ms. NORTON. I was deeply moved by the reaction of the students. I will never forget how so many took our hands, looked into our eyes, and thanked us for introducing the original bill. 
   I'm proud of all we have been able to do in the Nation's capital since 1995, when the city was literally bankrupt. Economic development, public safety, the real estate market, and so many other aspects of city life have changed for the better. 
   But nothing has given me more satisfaction than working to improve educational opportunity. Fighting for equal educational opportunity is one of the reasons I entered public life. 
   We need a healthy city to have a healthy Washington region. 
   Re-authorizing this law, which has expanded higher educational choices, is an enormous leap forward. 
   It is a strong part of our vision for the future.  
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Let me thank my colleague from Illinois for helping to shepherd this through today, and of course my friend from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) who has been there from the beginning. This legislation at the very beginning had some tough sledding moving it through both Houses of the Congress. And also our thanks to Don Graham, who is really the father of this. The idea originated with him and he brought it to our attention early on in our congressional careers, and we are able to move it forward. But he brought a lot of bipartisan support from the business community to bear. 
   I urge adoption of the bill. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant, community leader and family man. It is fitting that H.R. 3518 requests the designation of the post office in Cantonment, Florida, as the Charles H. Hendrix Post Office. Mr. Hendrix retired from the postal service after 37 years of service. Starting his career as a mail carrier and ultimately serving as the post master of the Cantonment post office, he was the type of employee that exemplifies loyalty and dedication. 
   A life-long resident of Molino, Florida, Mr. Hendrix over the years served his community in many ways. He was a member of the Highland Baptist Church his entire life, where he served as Sunday School superintendent. He was church treasurer and chairman of the board of deacons at the time of his death. He was also a member of the Cantonment Rotary Club since 1962. 
   He served one year as president and was an active member of the club service committee. He was also a charter member of the Molino Volunteer Fire Department, where he served as fire chief, assistant fire chief, and later as secretary of the fire department's board of directors, once again showing his dedication and service to others in the community. 
   Because of Mr. Hendrix's service to the community, he is remembered with appreciation as a man of great integrity and willingness to help others. It is for these reasons that we name the Cantonment, Florida post office for Charles Harold Hendrix. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Jo Ann Davis, who has served this body with dignity and honor and dedication since her election in 2000. 
   I first met Jo Ann when she was running for the House of Delegates in 1997 and quickly became impressed with her strong work ethic. Her congressional district, like mine, is the home of many current and retired Federal employees. So when I became chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, it was an easy decision to ask her to oversee the Civil Service Subcommittee. 
   She took on the responsibilities of subcommittee Chair with great diligence and energy. Through her efforts, we made important strides in helping the Federal Government recruit and retain quality employees. With her help, we improved Federal student loan repayment programs and expanded dental and vision benefits. Jo Ann was a strong supporter of legislation allowing retired Federal employees to deduct health care premiums from pretax dollars, moving this important legislation through her subcommittee. She was also a reliable ally in the annual fight for pay parity for civilian Federal employees. 
   Her district borders mine; we both represent portions of Prince William County. We have worked closely on a number of local issues. With her passing, Northern Virginia and the Commonwealth have lost a strong advocate. 
   I salute Jo Ann Davis for her courageous fight against cancer. Her passing reminds us all that we need to fight this horrible affliction. 
   My heartfelt condolences go out to her husband, Chuck and to her sons, Christopher and Charles. I hope they find solace in knowing she did so much to represent the people of Virginia.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to pay tribute to a remarkable soldier, and another true American hero, Chief Warrant Officer Aaron Weaver, who at the age of 32 paid the ultimate price while in defense of his country. 
   On January 8, 2004, he was on his way to have his blood work tested for cancer when the Black Hawk he was riding was shot down, killing all on board. As was noted before, Aaron was a testicular cancer survivor. He was still being treated when his unit was called to active duty in Iraq. He could have stayed at Fort Bragg, but that wasn't like him. His father said, He wanted to go to Iraq. When you're in a close group like that, you don't want your friends to leave you behind. 
   As an Army Ranger, Weaver survived the October 1993 battle of Mogadishu in Somalia that was recounted in the book and film ``Black Hawk Down.'' His heroism in saving a friend's life was also featured in that documentary on the battle. Not only was Chief Warrant Officer Weaver a fighter, he was a husband, a father, and a son. He was proud to serve his Nation. And with gratitude for his bravery and sacrifice to his country, I would urge all members to join me in supporting H.R. 3530. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York for introducing this bill. 
   Martha Coffin Wright was the quintessential women's rights pioneer long before most women entertained the notion. She, along with her sister, Lucretia, spent their entire lives fighting for basic rights for women. She had a strong, independent mother who served as a powerful role model. In 1848, Mrs. Wright decided, along with others, to hold a convention in Seneca Falls to discuss the need for substantial women's rights. The significance of that first convention was recognized by Congress in 1980 when Women's Rights National Historical Park was created. The bronze statue to Mrs. Wright at the park shows that at the time of the convention she was 6 months pregnant while she participated in the convention.     
   This was particularly remarkable at a time in history when women didn't often go in public as an activist, much less when they were pregnant. 
   After the Seneca Falls Convention, Mrs. Wright served as president and in other leadership positions in many other women's rights conventions. Martha Wright was also a fervent abolitionist, and her home in Auburn, New York, was a station on the Underground Railroad. She often allowed fugitive slaves to sleep in her kitchen. 
   Martha Coffin Wright was truly a woman whose significant accomplishments and contributions to both women's rights and civil rights set her apart as a leader and pioneer. Because of these, I rise today to recognize Martha Coffin Wright on the 200th anniversary of her birth and induction into the National Women's Hall of fame.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 181, a resolution I was proud to cosponsor with my colleague Congressman Ortiz, which recognizes and commends the many thousands of volunteers who provide support to the families of deployed military personnel, including those serving in the National Guard and Reserve. 
   We make significant resources available to families and children of members of the Armed Forces who reside on or near military installations. But resources for families and children of National Guard and Reserve members are often difficult to access. Of the 1.2 million young sons and daughters of members of the Armed Forces, approximately 153,000 are children of those serving in the National Guard and Reserve. 
   These children also need help when parents deploy. The heroic work of these volunteers stresses the importance of maintaining childhood routines during times of stress and sacrifice. Grants supporting extra-curricular activities, including tutoring, sports, art, camping and other educational opportunities that might be missing when a parent is gone, keep families active and linked to their communities. The help and support provided by these organizations tells military families, particularly the children, that they have not been left behind, but that we all recognize the personal sacrifices they are making when their family serves in the military. 
   It's gratifying that many private non-profit organizations have been created by caring and thoughtful Americans to help fill this gap for Guard and Reserve children. This resolution recognizes and honors their work. 
   One outstanding example is an organization called Our Military Kids, Inc, created by Linda Davidson and Gail Krusel of McLean, Virginia. It is a small corporation that has continued to expand nationally, providing assistance and grants to the children of deployed or severely-injured parents in over 35 states this year. The positive effect they have had on children of the National Guard and Reserve cannot be overstated. 
   I salute the people behind Our Military Kids, Inc., and other organizations that have dedicated time, effort and money to assist our nation's military children. I ask my colleagues to stand up and join us in this resolution honoring their commitment and patriotic servIce.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2, and in support of the Republican motion to recommit. 
   Americans deserve a decent minimum wage, but we cannot simply ignore the fact that somebody has to pay for it. In many cases, small businesses are the ones who must bear these costs. 
   The Democratic bill we consider today gives absolutely no consideration to small businesses at all. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, providing two-thirds of  new job creation. They cannot, however, simply create money out of thin air. A small business might have been struggling to pay health care premiums for its workers. With this resolution, they may well now be unable to do so. 
   My Democratic colleagues frequently voice their strong support for small businesses. I don't understand why they cannot then acknowledge that this could be a burden and offer some help in the form of tax incentives. 
   My vote for this motion to recommit and against the underlying bill is intended to send a message to the other body that a minimum wage increase is only half of the equation. I am confident the other body will work in more of a spirit of compromise and recognize the concerns I mention here today. Indeed, I look forward to considering legislation that does contain common sense provisions that will protect our small businesses' competitiveness. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to recommit to and if necessary against final passage.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, it is often said that if opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. With this bill, we are doing just that. 
   Using the materials at hand today, we can open a portal to full democratic participation that for too long has remained locked. The circumstances are right, the stars are aligned, and the proposal is sound. 
   Four years ago, we saw a confluence of events that set the stage for the compromise we have before us today. Two injustices met to create this opportunity to correct both. On the one hand, a long-ignored historical anomaly denies the citizens of the District of Columbia voting representation in the House of Representatives. On the other hand, a more recent problem with the census denies the citizens of Utah the additional House vote that a true count would have yielded. 
   As it happens, one jurisdiction is predominantly Democratic, the other predominantly Republican. The circumstances opened the way to a politically neutral solution to both problems. 
   Throughout our Nation's history, it has been just this kind of win-win compromise that, however rooted in the fleeting circumstances of the day, provide enduring solutions to seemingly intractable problems. 
   Each of us swears to uphold the Constitution, its letter and spirit. That living document is at its heart the most fundamental right of citizens in a democracy. All the citizens. So we rely on the plenary power found in the District clause to restore the full right of citizenship to our disenfranchised countrymen and women. 
   After researching every possible avenue to right these wrongs and give the citizens of the District of Columbia and Utah, the next State that is eligible for a vote under the formula, the representation to which they are entitled, we concluded the approach before us today is both constitutionally sound and politically viable. 
   The former is our sworn duty. The latter is a practical imperative. 
   In 4 years, I have found no evidence that any Member of this body seriously plans to attempt retrocession or campaign for a constitutional amendment. There is a good reason for that: they are politically not viable. Most Members, including me, don't waste their time tilting at windmills. 
   By now, every Member is aware of the constitutional arguments. I ask that you think carefully about what you hear today. Every first-year law student in this country learns that you can't just read the Constitution once over literally to figure out what it means. But that is what the other side's arguments are. That is where it stops, and that is where it starts. 
   Those opposing this bill ignore 200 years of case law and clear instruction from the Court that this is a congressional matter and requires a congressional solution. Under their literal reading of the Constitution, District residents would have no right to a jury trial under the sixth amendment because you have to be a State to have that right. 
   D.C. residents would have no right to sue people from outside D.C. in the Federal courts; only people from States have that right under Article III, section 2. 
   The full faith and credit clause would not apply to D.C. because that only applies to States under a literal reading of the Constitution. 
   And the Federal Government would not be allowed to impose Federal taxes on the District. The Constitution says direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States. Article I, section 2, clause 3. 
   But in each of these cases, the Supreme Court has held that Congress can consider the District a State for purposes of applying these fundamental provisions. If Congress has the authority to do so regarding these lesser rights and duty, there should be no question we have the same authority to protect the most sacred right of every American: to live and participate in a representative Republic. 
   It should also be pointed out that Congress granted voting representation in 1790 when it accepted the land that would become the Federal city. It then removed those rights, by statute, 10 years later. Those facts are undisputed. No amendment to the Constitution was considered necessary then. And those opposing the bill today will not explain, only assert, the claimed need for a constitutional amendment to reverse a decision that was made through enactment of a statute. 
   This problem should be solved. A lot of people today will talk about the Framers and tell us that the Framers intended for the Federal city to have no direct representation. 
   Do you really believe that if the capital had stayed in New York, the city would have been disenfranchised? Do you believe that if the capital had stayed in Philadelphia, the city would have been disenfranchised? Of course not, and neither should the people of Washington, D.C. 
   What we know is men and women who fought and died to create this country were willing to die for people who might disagree with them politically. D.C. residents are paying Federal taxes. They are fighting and dying in the Middle East to bring democracy to that part of the world. 
   This is no mere legal or political science exercise. It's a crisis. Your fellow Americans are being denied the full rights and benefits of representative government. We have before us this unique moment in our history, the opportunity to fulfill the promise of the Constitution and make our democracy whole again.     
   I hope we hear opportunity knocking, and I hope we hear the faint, but unmistakable whisper of conscience and of history, urging us all to seize the moment with courage and humility.  
   Rights and Wrong 
   Historic legislation giving the people of the District a vote in their national government is being debated in the House of Representatives. Prospects for its passage have never been better. The Democrats who control the House have kept a promise to move the bill forward, but the disenfranchisement of American citizens shouldn't be about partisan politics. It should be about what is right and wrong. 
   Indeed, the legislation working its way through the House sprang from he sense of injustice of a Republican House member from suburban Virginia. Rep. Thomas M. Davis III believes it is grotesque that D.C. residents are denied congressional representation. he came up with an ingenious way to get politics out of the equation. Two seats would be added to Congress--one for the mostly Democratic District and the other for heavily Republican Utah. The bill is on a fast track thanks to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved the measure yesterday, with every Democrat and six Republicans voting for it. The Judiciary Committee now takes it up, and a battle is expected. 
   It's hard to make a case for depriving people of a voice in Congress when they pay federal taxes, serve on federal juries and send family members off to war. It's also pretty embarrassing that the Untied States, while preaching democracy to the rest of the world, remains the only democratic country where people in the capital city are without representation. So opponents of D.C. voting rights have latched onto the only argument they can make with a straight face--that the bill is unconstitutional. 
   Former judges and constitutional scholars such as Kenneth Starr, Patricia Wald and Viet Dinh, not to mention the American Bar Association, believe the bill is constitutional. They argue that Congress has repeatedly treated the District as if it were a state and that this treatment has been upheld. For his part, Mr. Davis has delved into history to make a compelling argument that the lack of a vote was never the aim of the Founding Fathers but rather an ``undemocratic accident.'' 
   We concede that serious people hold the contrary view. No court has ever weighed in on the D.C. Voting Rights Act, so the constitutional question is open. That, though, is an issue for the courts to decide, in the event of a legal challenge. It should not be an excuse for Congress to continue to deny a basic right to more than half a million people.   
   D.C. Due Voting Rights  
   How's this for irony: Headlines recently proclaimed that the White House was opposed to giving the vote to the more than 600,000 residents of our nation's capital, who, incidentally, are paying federal income taxes to send members of their families to Iraq and Afghanistan so as to guarantee the right to vote for the residents of those nations' capitals. 
   Even as the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives was passing the bill, cosponsored by Reps. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., and Tom Davis, R-Va., a spokesman for President Bush was saying the bill is unconstitutional without showing a modicum of sympathy or even a modest understanding of this irony.  
   The White House spokesman is putting the president in the position of outspoken opposition to expanding the democratic ideal here in the nation's capital, while simultaneously the White House argues the president has the constitutional authority to defend freedom and extend democratic rights to the people of Baghdad and Kabul. 
   I wrote last May: ``Throughout our nation's history, District of Columbia citizens have given the full measure of their allegiance to the United States. They have fought in and died in every war in which the United States was engaged, they have paid billions in taxes, and they have provided labor and resources to the U.S. economy and government. Yet for 200 years, District residents have been bystanders in the governance of their nation.'' 
   With regard to the constitutional arguments, one of the leading conservative lights in the House of Representatives, Mike Pence of Indiana, recently wrote, ``Opponents of D.C. voting understandably cite the plain language of Article I that the House of Representatives be comprised of representatives elected by `the people of the several states.' If this were the only reference to the powers associated with the federal city, it would be most persuasive, but it is not. Article I, Section 8, Cl. 17 provides, `The Congress shall have power ..... to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever' over the District of Columbia.'' 
   Pence courageously and wisely voted yes against White House wishes and, sadly, those of the GOP leadership. 
   In 1984, Justice Antonin Scalia observed that the Seat of Government Clause of the Constitution gives Congress ``extraordinary and plenary'' power over our nation's capital. Scalia added that this provision of the Constitution ``enables Congress to do many things in the District of Columbia which it has no authority to do in the 50 states ..... There has never been any rule of law that Congress must treat people in the District of Columbia exactly the same as people are treated in various states.'' United States v. Cohen, 733 F.2d 128, 140 (D.C. Cir. 1984). 
   Chief Justice John Marshall acknowledged in the early 19th century that ``It is extraordinary that the courts of the United States, which are open to aliens, and to the citizens of every state in the union, should be closed upon (district citizens).'' But, he explained, ``This is a subject for legislative, not for judicial consideration.'' 
   Marshall thereby laid out the blueprint by which Congress, rather than the courts, could treat the District as a state under the Constitution for the purposes of enfranchisement. 
   Neither I, nor Tom Davis nor Mike Pence, is arguing for the District of Columbia to become a state. Indeed, from the inception of our nation the founders believed the House of Representatives was the House of the people. I believe passionately that the architects of the American Constitution left us the tools to ensure that all American people should have a voice and vote in the ``people's house.'' 
   I'm troubled by people in the White House who show compassion for the people of Baghdad and Kabul, as they should, but can't find it in their hearts to show anything but indifference to the cries for justice in the nation's capital. 
   What these presidential advisers are doing is rigidly interpreting the Constitution in such a way as to make the Party of Lincoln into a party that condemns the people of our nation's capital, including four of my 17 grandchildren, from ever participating in the great issues of the day as debated and decided in the House of Representatives. 
   Indeed, this is taxation without representation. 
   Republicans have historically supported civil, human and voting rights, including the passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. We have a great history of bipartisan support for civil rights, but it was our presidential candidate in 1964 who refused to take a stand for civil and social justice for African-Americans. 
   My question is, does this president want to continue the legacy of Lincoln, Grant and Eisenhower, or that of Barry Goldwater in 1964?   
   More Than Words 
   National Democratic party leaders are on record with their unequivocal endorsement of the District's bid for full voting rights in the House of Representatives. Support is always welcome, but what's needed is action. It's time for the Democrats who control Congress to act on legislation to end the disenfranchisement of citizens living in the nation's capital. 
   The Democratic National Committee voted last weekend to support the measure, promising a grass-roots lobbying campaign. It's a welcome boost for a bill that has languished too long. Sponsored by Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-VA.) and the District's nonvoting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), the measure would add two seats to the House--one for the heavily Democratic District and the other for largely Republican Utah. The bill enjoyed widespread bipartisan support in the past Congress but was never scheduled for a floor vote, to what should be the everlasting embarrassment of the Republican leadership. 
   Democrats are in a position to push the bill for approval, but internal party squabbling has slowed its movement. Some Democrats balked at doing anything for Utah until they were convinced that the District seat wouldn't have a chance unless balanced against Utah, which probably would get an extra seat anyway after the next census reapportionment. In recent days, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) has raised the concern that the bill would give Utah an extra electoral college vote in the 2008 presidential election and could hurt Democrats in a close race. The question is whether Democrats will allow that highly remote and partisan concern to stand in the way of their claimed support for fair representation for District residents. 
   Party insiders are confident that the disagreements will be ironed out, and they stress that, unlike the Republican leadership, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) are genuinely committed to voting rights for the District. We have no reason to doubt that. But the strength of the bill crafted by Mr. Davis and Ms. Norton is that it takes into account the self-interest of both parties while weighing the needs of the people of the District and Utah. Tinkering with that formula could doom the bill, and no matter how good the intentions of lawmakers, the District deserves results.   
   Sensible Compromise on D.C. Voting 
   ``Taxation without representation'' has been a bedrock excuse for American political dissent since Boston Tea Party days. 
   Which brings us to the perennial crack in the teacup--the 600,000 residents of the District of Columbia, many of whom are required to pay taxes but none of whom gets to elect a voting member of Congress. 
   Now, Reps. Tom Davis, R-Va., and Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting representative to Congress, have teamed to sponsor an innovative plan thought to have the best shot in years of closing the gap between principle and practice.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Let me just say to my colleagues, I think the gun ban in the District is ridiculous, and I would join with my colleagues in overturning it. The problem is this motion doesn't do that. Instead of bringing this motion back to the floor forthwith for a vote up or down to continue this resolution and send it to the Senate with the gun ban, it sends it back to the committee; is that correct, Mr. Smith? It does not send it back to the floor, this sends it to committee. So essentially this vote doesn't go anywhere. You can get your vote on gun rights, but it kills the bill, and that is the intention of this. And it is put there to put Members in a difficult situation. If you want to get a vote on District voter rights, you have to vote against this. 
   I would hope that we can have a free vote on the District gun ban later on. The courts have overturned it. I don't think it is a good law. But this doesn't overturn it because this kills the bill, and with it kills the amendment. 
   I would urge my colleagues to reject it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Let me just say, a strict reading of the Constitution, if you look just at its face, if you read that, D.C. residents wouldn't have a right to a jury trial because that is only to residents of States. D.C. residents would have no right to sue non-D.C. residents in Federal courts under diversity jurisdiction, which is reserved to residents of States. The full faith and credit clause wouldn't apply to D.C. under the Constitution, because that only applies to States. But Congress, under the District clause, has allowed the District to be treated as a State for those purposes. 
   The previous speaker says, well, if they can do this, why can't they be treated as a State for other purposes? The city argued under the gun ban that they weren't a State because Congress hadn't specifically said they were a  State, but the District clause is all-inclusive and gives Congress the power to determine what the rights are. We have that right. It is not an inherent right to vote in the House of Representatives, but we have that right under the District clause. 
   The difference between the House and the Senate in the constitutional reading is the Senate represents States. Individuals represent States, and each State gets two Senators. And the District of Columbia is clearly not a State. But the House of Representatives is of the people among the several States, a different wording. In fact, at the time the Constitution was created, the people in the District were among the several States, and, in fact, the residents of what are now the District voted for Congress the first 12 years of the Republic. 
   But this is not a right that goes to the District of Columbia. This is a right that goes to the people of the District of Columbia, and Congress has the right to determine whether they have it or not. This was taken up in 1800 when the anti-Federalists won the Presidency by one electoral vote, if you remember, and in a lame duck session this was debated, and, as usually happens, they punted it to the succeeding Congresses. 
   I think the constitutionality of this thing is very, very clear that, under the District clause, we have the ability in Congress to determine if they get a vote in the House or not. And I just want to set the record straight on that. All of these other rights, jury trial, right to sue, full faith and credit, even the Federal Government would not be allowed to impose Federal taxes in the District under a strict reading of the Constitution. But under law and under the District clause, we have expanded it to the District. I just think the record should reflect that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   We have Republicans quoting liberal professors and Democrats quoting conservative professors in support of where they are. At the end of the day I believe that if the District were a Republican enclave, our side would be getting up screaming for voting rights and the other side would be saying, no, the Constitution is strict. We are trying to take the politics out of this. 
   In the last Congress, both committees with jurisdiction under Republican chairmen cleared this bill for the floor and the Republican leadership denied it an opportunity to come to the floor. We could have had a full and open debate at that point. I think it would have been helpful to the process. Now the Democrats are in control and they are bringing this up, not for a full and open debate, unfortunately, but under a closed rule. We should have an open rule on this. At the time when we are spending billions of dollars and sacrificing thousands of lives to bring democracy to Baghdad, to Afghanistan and around the world, shouldn't we look right next door to our friends and neighbors here in the Nation's capital and give them the essence of democracy, the right to vote here on the floor of the House of Representatives? I think we should. 
   There are different views as to how we should do this. The former chairman of the Judiciary Committee says it's constitutional, but doesn't like the at-large aspect of the Utah seat but we are not able to debate that on the floor today. My friend from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) who has long been a champion of voting rights here has a different mechanism under which this could be established. 
   I wish we could have a full and open debate on this. I think it would be helpful to the process. And I am really torn. Because on the one hand our side doesn't want the bill to come up at all, and the other side wants this to come up under very closed rules where we can't have full and open debate. I look forward to a spirited colloquy as we move through this. I am going to support the bill in its final form, of course, as it moves through because I think this is something that is long overdue for citizens of the Nation's capital and with a long line of legal precedents which treats the District of Columbia like a State when Congress says it can be treated like a State. Things like the right to trial by jury, paying Federal taxes, other issues that apply only to States under the Constitution but which under the District clause to the Constitution when we apply it to the District, it is treated like a State. 
   And once again, looking at such conservative jurists as Ken Starr, Viet Dinh who wrote the PATRIOT Act for the Bush administration testified under oath as to its constitutionality. This shouldn't ultimately be locked up in this. This should be about basic voting rights for the capital of the Free World.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, with so many distractions in our lives today, it is important to take a step back to acknowledge the central role that families play in the development of our Nation's youth. This resolution celebrates those aspects found in a positive family atmosphere which promotes healthy and well-adjusted young men and women. 
   It is true that the children are our future, and the strength of our country has been and will continue to be built on families providing educational, social, ethical and moral guidance to our children. 
   The devotion of time is one of the most important things we can do to help maintain a positive family environment. And while it may be difficult to find time in our hectic schedules, things as simple as playing with educational toys, reading together or visiting an age-appropriate museum will stimulate a child's curiosity that will be beneficial throughout their lives. 
   Also, something as easy as slowing down enough to take the time to listen to one another, maybe by having dinner as a family whenever possible is a time tested way to nurture a child through family participation during their formative years. 
   Young people are increasingly exposed to the stress and pressures of our modern society. In order to combat these negative influences, we must take it upon ourselves, as a society, to expose young people to loving and supporting families whenever possible. As an example, doing a community service project as a family is one of the many ways to teach children that to build a community and to thrive as a society, we should all share in assisting one another. 
   National Children and Families Day provides us an opportunity to recognize our responsibility to create family environments that nurture the next generation and to promote a positive environment for families across America. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Con. Res. 62.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3221, a 786-page energy bill introduced by the Speaker this week, contains a major restructuring of our Nation's energy policies. I come to the floor today to talk about the specific title of the bill, title VI, which promotes energy efficiency by our Federal Government. That is the jurisdiction which our Government Reform Committee wrote. 
   Title VI of H.R. 3221 is known as the Carbon Neutral Government Act. It was marked up by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee as H.R. 2635 in June. After exhaustive discussions and negotiations with Chairman Waxman and his able staff, the committee approved the legislation by a voice vote. The committee put in a lot of work, and I very much appreciate the chairman's efforts to reach out and compromise with us. 
   The provisions in the Carbon Neutral Government title represent a bold effort to put the Federal Government in the forefront and in a leadership position with regard to mitigating the buildup of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. 
   I agree with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that the Federal Government must be proactive and take an aggressive leadership role in mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. To that end, the legislation would establish ambitious goals for the government's use of renewable fuels, energy efficient automobiles, and energy-efficient buildings, ``green'' buildings. 
   More specifically, this legislation would mandate that the Federal Government's greenhouse gas emissions be  reduced to zero by the year 2050. The Federal Government is the largest energy consumer in the world and is currently responsible for emitting 100 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Meeting this goal of zero net emissions will be a significant step in the direction of minimizing greenhouse gas emissions and correspondingly reducing our impact on climate change. 
   Moreover, I concur with Chairman Waxman and others that setting and meeting these ambitious standards will accelerate the pace of development and adoption of technologies that will be critical to addressing climate change in the U.S. and worldwide. 
   That being said, we still have some reservations about the specific provisions in the bill. 
   There is a provision in title VI of the bill with the seemingly nebulous title of ``judicial review,'' more popularly referred to as the ``citizen enforcement provision.'' This provision would allow individuals to sue Federal agencies for failing to comply with carbon reduction goals called for in the legislation. To make matters worse, the provision allows plaintiffs to collect potentially millions of dollars in damages and attorneys' fees regardless of whether they can demonstrate any actual harm to themselves. 
   I appreciate the gentleman from California's working with us on this language and putting appropriate caps, and that makes the legislation amenable to myself. We have other Members who still have concerns. 
   Another concern I have in this legislation sets the government up to fail. 
   I mentioned earlier that title VI contains many laudable goals with respect to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by the Federal Government. But while eliminating all greenhouse gas emissions by the Federal Government in a few decades sounds great, in reality, this goal is going to be very difficult to achieve. 
   As this bill moves forward, I trust we will be able to move away from the rhetoric. We need to identify realistic goals that our Federal Government can meet and achieve and look for ways that we can achieve it. 
   Which raises a final concern: If you set unrealistic goals and then arm potential plaintiffs nationwide with the power to sue the government for failing to meet these goals, agencies will have little choice but to divert scarce resources away from their critical agency missions in order to ensure adequate funding to support the carbon emissions requirement. 
   While the majority included a provision at our request stating that agency plans on reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be ``consistent with the agency's primary mission,'' I am concerned that we need some work to ensure that agencies continue to place primary importance on their underlying responsibilities to serve the American people. 
   As great a threat as global warming is, the Federal Government also needs to carefully balance taxpayer dollars on reducing emissions at the expense of shortchanging other priorities such as health care, education, and national defense. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have limited my remarks to discuss only title VI of this legislation, the Carbon Neutral Government Act, and I again want to congratulate Chairman Waxman for working with us on this provision. I believe this legislation could go far in terms of striking the balance between making the Federal Government ``greener'' and devoting limited resources toward providing needed resources to the American public. But as we work our way through the legislative process, we want to continue to be engaged and address some of the concerns that we have identified. 
   I do have more serious concerns about other provisions in the broader energy bill put forward by the majority and, unfortunately, therefore, regret that I may not be able to support the energy bill before us today, depending on the outcome of some of the amendments. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3. We are all aware of the potential embryonic stem cells hold for mankind. It could very well be that these cells prove to be the Rosetta stone of medical research--allowing us to break the code on some of the worst afflictions: Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, juvenile diabetes. 
   We must acknowledge, however, that there is much we don't know about embryonic stem cells, and we are mistaken if we believe great cures are right around the corner. But we will never know either the true potential--or the dangers of stem cell related treatments if our scientists are overly constrained. 
   I understand the concerns of those who question the ethics of embryonic stem cell research, and agree that we must not throw caution to the wind at the hint of miraculous cures. Indeed, left unconstrained, this type of research could lead to dangerous outcomes. 
   That is a key reason why I support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. It provides essential ethical guidelines to which federally funded researchers must adhere. It would be far preferable to have the Federal Government setting standards in this field rather than a hodge-podge of states and private entities. In fact, I believe that the National Institute of Health's rigorous ethical guidelines would prove to be more protective of human life than individual states or private entities. Remember, embryonic stem cell research is not illegal, and individual states have already moved forward on their own. It is crucial that the Federal Government lead the way. 
   I supported President Bush when he announced his plan to allow federally funded research on 60 pre-existing stem cell lines. But we now know that only 21 stem cell lines are available for research. These 21 have significant shortcomings that make them of dubious value. 
   Federally funded U.S. researchers are at a technological disadvantage as they lack access to newer stem cell lines. This is causing concern that some of the top stem cell biologists will move into non-federally funded research, or even move overseas. We should not allow this to happen.  
   There are a great many difficult questions that attend this debate. However, I can not look in the eyes of a couple whose child is suffering from a debilitating disease and tell them that I am doing everything possible to stop their child's suffering without supporting this legislation. 
   I believe expanded Federal funding of embryonic research is the right course to take--a view shared by increasing numbers in both parties. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. 
   I believe this bill is an important step in making the United States a leader in all facets of the stem cell issue--both scientifically and ethically.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 152. 
   When the 1947 U.N. Partition Plan created two separate states in Palestine--one Jewish, and one Arab--it was a milestone in world history. Jerusalem was from this point on to be an international city--neither Jewish nor Arab, but shared by the two cultures. 
   However, the excitement over this groundbreaking compromise was short-lived. Although Israel accepted the plan, the Arab world refused to sign on, and soon after attacked Israel, plunging the region into Arab-Israeli War of 1948. The result of this war was a division of Jerusalem in two, with one half being controlled by Israel and one half controlled by Jordan. 
   In 1967, during the Six Day War, Israel retook control of the Jordanian half of Jerusalem. On June 7, 1967, a cease fire occurred, and Israel took full control over the entire city of Jerusalem. One year later, Israel declared a new holiday--Jerusalem Day--to commemorate the reunification of the city.  
   This year, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the reunification, Israel held its Jerusalem Day with the slogan ``Something Special for Everyone.'' I commend Israel and all of the inhabitants of Jerusalem for embodying the inclusiveness of the phrase ``Something Special for Everyone.'' 
   I encourage my colleagues to support the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (CALLING ON THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA TO STOP GENOCIDE AND VIOLENCE IN DARFUR, SUDAN -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 422. 
   This resolution aims at encouraging the People's Republic of China to use its influence as one of Sudan's chief purchasers of oil to place pressure on the Sudanese government to improve the conditions for the people in the Darfur region and allow humanitarian organizations to enter the region and assist the people of Darfur. 
   The underlying basis for the conflict in the Darfur region is difficult to define. Some scholars describe it as a conflict between Arab and African cultures, although this is a simplistic  view. Whatever the foundation of the conflict, the Nile Valley region (the area around the Darfur region in Sudan), has had cultural conflicts dating as far back as the fourteenth century. 
   The current conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan places the Sudanese military and the Janjaweed militia against rebel groups, including the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. The Sudanese government, while denying its support for the Janjaweed militia, has nonetheless provided funding and weapons to the Janjaweed. 
   Because of this military conflict, humanitarian aid groups have been unable to reach most parts of the Darfur region. Further, journalists have been prevented from entering the region by the Sudanese government, thus ensuring that many of the atrocities occurring in Darfur go unreported. 
   U.N. officials have estimated that over 400,000 Darfur residents have died since the conflict began, many due to starvation. Further estimates put the number of residents displaced from their homes at over 2 million. 
   It is important that the United States look to any means available to quell the atrocious acts occurring in Darfur. As a leading arms dealer to the country of Sudan, The People's Republic of China is uniquely situated to encourage the Sudanese government to accept the decisions of the United Nations with regard to helping the inhabitants of the Darfur region. 
   As China readies itself for the spotlight on the world stage at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, it is important that China, along with the rest of the world, step up its influence on the Sudanese government and ensure that the atrocities and human rights violations taking place in the Darfur region are put to an end. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Ms. LINDA T. S&#193;NCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in support of ending the genocide and violence in Darfur, Sudan. 
   For far too long, the international community has paid inadequate attention and devoted insufficient resources to stopping the crisis in Darfur. Although the problems of Sudan lay a long way from our homes, we have learned from the Holocaust in Europe, as well as ethnic cleansing in Yugoslavia and genocide in Rwanda, that an assault on humanity anywhere is an assault on humanity everywhere. We cannot continue to ignore this genocide without diminishing our own humanity. 
   As a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am committed to bringing security and relief to the people of Darfur. I have led efforts to encourage state, local, and university divestment of funds from companies that conduct business operations in Sudan. And now I join my colleagues in urging China to do the same. 
   Given its economic interests throughout the region, China has a unique ability to positively influence the Government of Sudan to abandon its genocidal policies and to accept the United Nations' peacekeeping mission. To be accepted as a responsible player at the world's diplomatic table, China must end all military and economic assistance to the government of Sudan until Sudan stops overt and covert support for attacks on civilians and engages in meaningful peace negotiations. 
   All members of the international community share a moral obligation to end to the human suffering in Darfur. The situation is dire, but I am confident that we can all do our part to help stop this genocide and bring peace and stability to millions of innocent men, woman, and children. 
   Calling on the People's Republic of China to use its influence to help stop the genocide in Sudan is the right thing to do. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H. Res. 422.

   This resolution calls on the government of Iran to release Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, who is being held captive in Evin prison, despite the Ministry of Intelligence offering no evidence of wrongdoing. 
   Dr. Esfandiari is a respected member of academia, holding the position of director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, having previously taught Persian language and literature at Princeton University. 
   While visiting her ailing 93-year-old mother in Iran, Dr. Esfandiari was held up at knifepoint; her travel documents and luggage were taken in the process. It was while attempting to procure subsequent documents that Dr. Esfandiari was taken into custody by the Ministry of Intelligence in Iran. 
   Dr. Esfandiari is not the only American taken prisoner in Iran under the guise of being a ``spy.'' With U.S. and Iranian diplomatic relations resuming again after 25 years, it is important that the United States remain vigilant in opposing these unconscionable tactics employed by the Iranian Government toward United States citizens abroad. 
   This resolution is a strong first step in standing up for the safety of all American citizens traveling abroad. No American should ever be deprived of their liberty simply because they crossed the safe haven of U.S. borders. 
   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (OFFERING HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO THE VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES REGARDING THE HORRIFIC VIOLENCE AT VIRGINIA TECH AND TO STUDENTS, FACULTY, ADMINISTRATION AND STAFF AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED -- (House of Representatives - April 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sadness that I address this Chamber today. As the parent of four children in college, I share the horror and the rage, the grief and the sorrow of the larger Virginia community. 
   I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this resolution expressing our sorrow and offering condolences over the tragic events that took place Monday at Virginia Tech. Our hearts, our prayers and our thoughts go out to the families of those who lost lives, the injured and their families, and all those affected by this terrible tragedy, including the family of the troubled young man who perpetrated this crime.     
   The coming together of communities, the reaching over the fences to lend a hand of support at this hour of need has been touching. From the Washington Nationals wearing Virginia Tech caps last night, to the community groups that gathered spontaneously across the Commonwealth to share their sorrow, the picture of the Commonwealth today is one we can, as usual, take great pride in. Yesterday I traveled with my colleagues to Blacksburg for the convocation, and last evening over 500 Korean Americans assembled at the Fairfax County Government Center to express their outrage, to offer their prayers, to start the healing process that follows such tragic events. 
   Mr. Speaker, we Virginians are known for looking out for each other and this has been no different. The outpouring of love, sympathy and caring for each other has been astonishing. The pictures of students comforting each other, of students and teachers helping each other search for answers in these dark hours has been particularly moving. All of us around the Commonwealth must come together to find the strength to move forward. We're family. We've been deeply wounded. That's what families do when they're hurt. They look to each other for strength, for inspiration and for meaning. Mr. Speaker, we hurt for the victims and we honor their lives. That's what families do. We close ranks and lend each other support in our darkest hours. Benjamin Franklin said more than 200 years ago that those things that hurt instruct. Let us learn from this. Let us hurt. It's good for the soul. It helps us to heal. It is, sadly, the only way to move forward. 
   Again, I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, in this debate, our first care should be for the safety and morale of the men and women serving in the American Armed Forces. Whatever the way forward, nothing said here should be heard by friend or foe as disrespect for the work and sacrifice of those who willingly fight our battles in a very dangerous world. 
   It took the United States and coalition forces less than 3 weeks to topple  a brutal Iraqi regime that had held an iron grip on power for almost 30 years. Since then, they have battled a growing insurgency and rampant sectarian violence with professionalism and bravery. Of all the instruments of national power we could and should be discussing today, diplomacy, economic policy, intelligence and warfare, our military is the only one that has performed predictably, consistently, and well. 
   Still, knowing what we know today, after almost four years of attempted nation-building on the shifting sands of Iraq, the plan to put 21,000 more Americans in harm's way there has to be viewed with a cold-eyed skepticism born of that hard experience. Putting American troops between feuding Sunni and Shia in the middle of Baghdad, in my judgment, is a mistake. This is the appropriate place for Iraqis, not Americans. 
   The Iraq Study Group concluded that, ``Sustained increases in U.S. troop levels would not solve the fundamental cause of violence in Iraq, which is the absence of national reconciliation.'' They quoted a U.S. general who said that if the Iraqi Government does not make political progress, ``all the troops in the world will not provide security.'' I agree. 
   Like many Members, Republicans and Democrats, I voted for the resolution authorizing President Bush to use force in Iraq, just as I supported President Clinton's decision to take military action against the former Yugoslavia. Four years ago, we were trying to persuade Saddam Hussein to comply with the United Nations resolutions on disarmament and weapons inspections. Only a credible threat of force could possibly convince him that it was finally in his interest to respect the lawful demands of the international community. 
   Voting to support the President strengthened his hand in the diplomatic effort to get the Iraqi regime to comply peacefully. Saddam Hussein chose not to comply, and when diplomacy fails, and military action becomes necessary, politics should stop at the water's edge and every American should stand behind the Commander in Chief. 
   But no grant of authority is a blank check. Today, naive notions about a quick or tidy victory in Iraq have given way to far grittier options on how best to achieve our strategic goals in that nation, in the region, and in the global struggle against Islamic extremism. 
   We want the President to succeed, but we are disappointed our hopes and good intentions for Iraq remain unrealized. Many are frustrated by the mistakes and missed opportunities that plagued this noble but star-crossed effort. Poor planning for occupation and reconstruction of a devastated nation, and missteps by the Coalition Provisional Authority, allowed the insurgency and long-simmering factional hatreds to erupt and to take root. 
   At this point, it seems clear to many that only Iraqi interests, not ours, can be advanced on the streets of Baghdad. U.S. and coalition forces were tasked as protectors of Iraq's hard-won sovereignty, not referees in unchecked sectarian vendettas. From here, the surge looks much more like the status quo on steroids than a serious alternative policy to reach a realistic goal. Some way must be found to cut the Gordian knot that ties us to an Iraq strategy that says we can neither win nor leave. 
   Moreover, so long as American troops are the ones on the ground, taking the fire and being objects for sectarian terrorist hatred, other stakeholders who have more at stake in the region than we will refuse to step forward. 
   But whatever else it might accomplish, this resolution still does not do enough to illuminate a new, sustainable strategy in Iraq. It offers us few alternatives, and I am disappointed in that. The profound and complex issues central to our international position today cannot be reduced to simplistic political statements. We took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, not just strike poses on how that duty applies to the key questions before us as a Nation. In the end, these are purely political statements, when the debate we really need to have is about the most apolitical subject of all: national security in a time of global peril. 
   Today, the House sends a purely symbolic message to the President. It is a message that will also be heard by our troops, by the Iraqi Government, by the Iraqi people who have relied on us, and by our enemies who are hoping we will quit the fight soon. It does not say enough. We should be debating the elements of an effective policy to stem the tide of jihadism infecting growing swaths of the globe. This resolution says only what some Members are against, nothing about what we are for. 
   The Iraq Study Group report put forth 79 specific recommendations, many focused on the need for far greater engagement of regional powers, friends and foes in taking realistic steps to stabilize Iraq. I joined my colleague, Frank Wolf, in supporting creation of the Iraq Study Group, and I wish he and others were allowed to offer those recommendations for discussion by the House. Those are the debates and the votes I had hoped to participate in today. 
   The lack of substantive alternatives before us, particularly on the question of adequate funding for deployed troops, betrays the majority's empty, conflicted positions on Iraq: against the President, but for nothing. The Senate majority attempted to straddle the same contradictions recently, confirming without dissent the new commanding general for Iraq, while at the same time claiming to be against the very same mission they know he has been ordered to undertake. 
   On the genuine questions of security and strategy in Iraq, we cannot remain, as Winston Churchill admonished, ``decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all-powerful to be impotent.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we must decide, and I have decided, to support this resolution because it is the only option that has been made in order by the majority today to engage the House in formulation of Iraq policy, but once troops are committed by the Commander in Chief and we are engaging the enemy, symbolic gestures like this must confront the more complex realities of how to support those forces in the safe and speedy completion of their mission.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I again want to thank Mr. Cooper for introducing this legislation and working with us as it moved its way through the subcommittee and committee process; Mr. Towns for his leadership; and the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Waxman, for his leadership as well. 
   Today, we take up H.R. 928, the Improving Government Accountability Act of 2007. This legislation is intended to enhance the independence of Inspectors General throughout the government to improve their ability to monitor and oversee executive branch operations. 
   Since the enactment of the Inspector General Act of 1978, Inspectors General throughout the government have played an integral role in identifying waste and mismanagement in government. IGs have also been instrumental in aiding Congress and the executive branch to make government more efficient and effective. 
   We all agree IGs should operate independently, free from political interference. After all, both agency heads and Congress often rely on IG reports to provide frank assessments of the effectiveness of Federal programs. 
   However, Inspectors General should also be part of an agency's management structure, part of a team, albeit with some independence, rather than a ``fourth branch'' of the Federal Government. If we separate the IGs from the day-to-day operations of the agencies they oversee, IGs will cease to perform a constructive, integrated role and instead will become Monday morning quarterbacks with their function solely second-guessing decisions made by agencies. 
   Many of the provisions in H.R. 928 will help to enhance the effectiveness of the IGs in overseeing Federal agencies and programs. I am concerned that certain provisions of the legislation go further than I would like in isolating IGs, removing them from the agency decision-making process. 
   For example, during committee consideration of the legislation, I offered an amendment to exempt smaller agency IGs from the ``for cause'' removal provision in the bill, thereby reserving the ``for cause'' removal threshold only for Cabinet-level agency IGs. The purpose of this amendment, which was adopted, I might add, with the help of my friends on the other side, was to strike an appropriate balance between the need to ensure independence of our Inspectors General while at the same time preserving the President's authority over employers and officers of the executive branch. 
   I also have concerns with a provision that's in the current bill authorizing IGs to independently submit their budget requests to Congress outside of the traditional Federal budget process. My concerns with this new authority pertain more to the logistical nightmare this creates rather than any particular objection to increased IG independence. After all, having 60 separate budgets for individual offices accompanying the President's annual budget submission to Congress will only add unnecessary confusion to the already confusing Federal budget process. So when Members get the President's budget, under the way the law is currently written, they get the Federal budget submitted by the President and then 60 separate requests from IGs. 
   Now, I intend to offer an amendment, which I am hopeful the other side will accept, which goes at least part of the way toward addressing the legitimate concerns raised by the administration but getting to the points that the author of this bill wanted to get as well. 
   In closing, I believe the underlying legislation improves the laws governing our IGs. I think some additional changes need to be made as it moves forward, but I very much appreciate Mr. Cooper's efforts on this bill and his initiative in trying to identify these problems as we move through. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, let me talk, first of all, about what the legislation does. It establishes a 7-year term of office for the over 60 Inspectors General in the Federal Government. This gives them continuity from administration to administration, so they're not political lackeys, they are professionals. It limits the President's authority to remove a Senate-confirmed IG, and that's about half of them, except on certain grounds; for example, permanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, conviction of a felony, or conduct involving moral turpitude. That gives the IGs independence from pressure from the appointing administration. 
   At the smaller agencies, a different standard applies. There, an IG can be removed, but it will require 30-day advance notification to Congress before an agency head removes the agency's IG. 
   The legislation also authorizes IGs to submit their budget requests to Congress independent of the President's budget submission. This is something that I'm going to have an amendment on later that I think will clarify it. 
   This also codifies an executive order establishing the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency. This is a coordinating council of Federal IGs, as well as an integrity committee to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by IGs. And unfortunately, we see that; these people are human beings as well. 
   It increases the salary of IGs and prohibits IGs from receiving bonuses. It enhances IG power by granting limited personnel authority, expanded subpoena authority, and increased ability to deputize IG agents. 
   It strengthens the GAO's authority to conduct investigations, for sworn testimony it requires congressional notification of agency noncooperation, and it expands IG ability to pursue false claims and recoup losses resulting from fraud. 
   Now, the administration has issued a negative statement of policy on this for two reasons. One, they don't like the limitation on the President's authority to remove executive branch officials. On that, I think we have gone overboard, working together, both parties, to try to put reasonable limitations, but at the same time maintaining a higher level of independence for IGs than you will find at other levels. And I think institutionally, as Members of this House, the changes in this bill I think are worth supporting, I would oppose the administration in that. The second concern is the independent submission of the IG's budget to Congress, and we are offering an amendment to try to clarify that, which I will speak on later. 
   Once again, this legislation was introduced by Representative Jim Cooper from Tennessee in February. It was approved by our committee by a voice vote in August. In addition to a substitute offered by Representative Cooper, which made a number of technical changes, the committee did adopt an amendment offered by me to limit the application of removal for cause in a way that I think we are all comfortable with. 
   So, again, I want to thank the players who have brought this to this stage. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. If the gentleman has no further speakers, I will take a minute and sum up and yield back. 
   Let me just say again, I want to thank the author of this legislation. I want to thank Mr. Towns for moving this through subcommittee and Chairman Waxman. I just want to note, for IGs to work successfully, they need to work with their agencies. I think however we write the law, the President that appoints and the Senate that confirms, we need to look for more accountants. 
   Frankly, we have seen a surge of people coming out of the U.S. Attorney's offices, and they make this more adversarial than it needs to be. A good IG is going to work with their agency to identify waste, fraud and abuse, not enter into a gotcha mentality. For government to work, you need them all working together. You need an independent IG, there is no question about that. But the person in that office ought to be right there with the agency head making sure that things work. That doesn't always happen. I don't think we can write any law that makes that happen. That is going to depend on the goodwill of the people, the agency heads and the IGs working together. But I think this legislation goes a long way toward establishing that independence, giving the IG the authority that they need. But the rest is going to be up to the appointing President and the confirming Senate to get the right people in these jobs, professionals who want to be a part of government and making it work efficiently for the taxpayer.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, as currently drafted, the Improving Government Accountability Act would authorize Inspectors General throughout the government, and more than 60 of these offices exist, to directly submit their budget requests to Congress. By doing so, this legislation would circumvent the long-standing process under which Presidents submit to the Congress a budget proposal on behalf of the executive branch. 
   While I understand the sponsor's intent in authorizing independent budget submissions by IGs, I have concerns with the way the authority is currently constructed. Our concerns pertain more to the logistical nightmare than any particular objection to increased IG independence. 
   First of all, according to the Congressional Research Service, no other offices or agencies within the executive  branch currently are authorized by statute to independently submit their budgets to Congress. H.R. 928 would not simply make an exception for one uniquely situated office, it would make an exception for all of the more than 60 IG offices currently in government. In other words, the President's annual budget would be accompanied by 60 separate IG budgets. This is inefficient; it is disorganized and unproductive. 
   Second, I am concerned that by authorizing IGs to submit their budgets independently to Congress, we are encouraging them to submit their wish lists to Congress rather than submitting budgets that take into account the limited resources that are available to agencies. 
   It doesn't take an active imagination to envision the increased government spending that this would cause. After all, if an IG submits its wish list to Congress, will Members of Congress have the stomach to appropriate an amount less than an IG requests? If we do, we could be painted as antioversight, a label none of us are interested in. 
   Because of these concerns, I have filed an amendment proposing an alternative approach to the budget issue. This amendment would authorize Inspectors General to notify Congress if the budget request submitted by the agency head would substantially inhibit the IG's ability to perform his or her duties. The President would be required to include in his budget submission the original amount requested by each IG. 
   This approach would give additional information to Congress, which is the intent, I think, of the legislation. It also encourages IGs to speak out if their agencies try to stifle the IG's independence by reducing the IG's budget request. But it would stop short of authorizing all 60 IGs to separately submit their own budget request to Congress outside of the traditional Federal budget process. 
   I think this amendment is a reasonable compromise which carefully balances the need for IG independence with the need for streamlined budget authority. We have enough problems enacting the Federal budget every year; we don't need to create 60 new ones. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would require agencies to include links on their Web pages to their IG's Web page. In addition, this amendment would require IGs to make public reports and audits conducted by the Inspector General immediately available on their Web sites, and it would require links for individuals interested in reporting waste, fraud and abuse. 
   To the extent any of this is not currently being done by agencies and IGs, I am fully supportive of Congress requiring such information to be made available in order to increase the transparency of Federal Government operations. We are prepared to support the amendment.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit would require all agency Inspectors General to report annually to Congress and to the President whether the IG believes an abolishment, reorganization, consolidation or transfer of existing Federal programs and agencies is necessary to reduce Federal expenditures, increase efficiency of government operations, eliminate overlap and duplication in Federal programs and offices, abolish agencies or programs which no longer serve an important governmental purpose, or identify reductions in amounts of discretionary budget authority or direct spending which can be dedicated to Federal deficit reduction. 
   The IGs would be required to accompany those reports with proposed legislation in order to encourage Congress to act on those recommendations. 
   This legislation is borne out of frustration. How many more times are we going to hear about redundancy in Federal programs without doing anything about it? We have the IGs. We have made them more independent as a result of this. Let's utilize that expertise for suggestions in how we can reduce waste, fraud and abuse in government. 
   How many more times are we going to have to hear about the 70 programs located throughout 13 Federal agencies providing substance abuse prevention services for our youth? The over 90 early childhood programs scattered among 11 Federal agencies and 20 offices? The 40 different programs in the Federal Government having job training as their main purpose? The 86 teacher training programs in nine Federal agencies? The 50 different Federal homeless assistance programs administered by eight different agencies? The more than 17 Federal agencies monitoring and enforcing over 400 U.S. trade agreements? The 17 Federal Departments and agencies operating a total of 515 Federal research and development laboratories? Or the eight different Federal agencies administering 17 different programs just in the area of rural water and wastewater systems, each with its own set of regulations? 
   After all, the primary reason all these Federal programs exist in the first place is because Congress has this bad habit of haphazardly establishing new programs to achieve short-term solutions whenever a problem arises. 
   In fact, Paul Volcker, Donna Shalala and Frank Carlucci all testified before our committee in 2003 about a National Commission on Public Service report that they had recently released. The report concluded that, over the years, the ad hoc layering of agencies, Departments, and programs greatly complicated management, expanded the influence of powerful interests and diminished coherent policy direction. The Federal Government today is a layered jumble of organizations with muddled public missions. 
   Congress is as much to blame for this problem as anyone else. Admitting we have a problem is the first step in recovery. I am here to help our colleagues understand we have a problem. The extent of overlap and duplication in government is an issue the Committee on Government Reform has spent years investigating. Our hearings have focused on a range of Federal program areas, from child welfare programs to intelligence operations to Federal food safety oversight. 
   This motion to report forthwith, so it doesn't kill the bill, it reports right back, would provide a tool which could assist the Congress and the President in identifying ways to streamline government operations and make them as efficient and effective as possible. The motion to recommit should appeal to all Members who believe there are inefficiencies in the Federal Government requiring attention. All after, Congress never has and never will be a management body. We need the assistance, and this legislation does it, of independent, outside observers to tell us what programs we created years ago are not an efficient or effective use of taxpayer funds. 
   We have given the Inspectors General here authority and independence to call the balls and strikes and to make government more efficient. Let's utilize that. Let's help us make government more efficient. Let's support the motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 121. I want to thank Mr. Honda, the chief sponsor for this legislation, Chairman Lantos, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Mr. Faleomavaega and others who have helped bring this to the floor. 
   This resolution is long overdue. I'm a proud cosponsor of this resolution because it is time for these women to tell their story to the world. It is time for the world to know how horribly humans can treat other humans in times of war and conflict, and it is time for the Government of Japan to own up to the wrongs that it committed toward these women. 
   During World War II, between 100,000 and 200,000 women were abducted from their homes in Japan and occupied lands, including Korea and China and the Philippines, and forced into the sex trade for the benefit of the Japanese Army. To deny this tragedy is to allow it to happen again. We prevent history from repeating itself only when we actually learn from history, not when we try to deny and obfuscate the truth. 
   When U.S. Government placed Americans of Japanese descent into internment camps in World War II, we were wrong; and we have since apologized to the families of those victims. This is the measure of responsible leadership. When we implore our friends across the Pacific to apologize for their many mistakes, we ask for no more than what we as Americans are willing to do ourselves. 
   Japan has been a strong ally of the United States for years, and I believe both countries have benefited greatly from that relationship. However, it is a true friend that will tell another when it is wrong, and I believe the United States has an obligation as an ally to Japan to stand up against this atrocity and to reveal to the world in appropriate fashion. 
   It is time for the stories of the ``comfort women'' to be told. It is because these courageous women are speaking out and refusing to be silenced that the United States and the world can finally learn why this issue is so important and why we must never allow it to be repeated ever again on this planet. 
   I urge support for this resolution

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to speak on H.R. 1362, the Accountability in Contracting Act, which was introduced by Government Oversight and Reform chairman Henry Waxman last week. I want to thank the chairman for working with us. 
   This is not a bill that we are particularly enthusiastic about. We have very divergent views in the way we should go about contract regulation, but we both want the same ends. And I want to commend him for working with us, addressing some of our concerns as it moved through the committee process. 
   This bill would attempt to reform our acquisition system through a series of restrictions and reports geared towards greater regulation and oversight. More specifically, the legislation would limit the duration of contracts awarded under urgent conditions; require agency reports on minimizing the use of fixed-price and sole-source contracts; require additional reports to Congress on cost questions by auditors; and broaden the reach of current limitations on post-employment opportunities for our acquisition workforce, as well as limit the ability of acquisition workers hired by the government from the private sector to participate in certain acquisition activities. 
   I want to thank the chairman again for working with me by including two provisions that we requested that are both intended to strengthen the Federal acquisition workforce through better training and management. The first would require the administrator for Federal Procurement Policy to come up with a government-wide definition for ``acquisition workforce.'' This modification would help give Federal agencies a clear picture of the composition of their existing acquisition workforce and provide a baseline for the improvement of the human capital resource dedicated to the management of the acquisition workload. The second would make permanent the Acquisition Workforce Training Fund, which was first enacted under SARA, the Services Acquisition Reform Act, which I authored. 
   Last week our committee revised the introduced version of the bill by approving an amendment I offered to address the concerns I had with the bill's expansion of post-employment restrictions. While I wholeheartedly support the desire to promote integrity, transparency and accountability in government, I was troubled by certain provisions in the bill which sought to significantly expand current post-employment restrictions and curb the government's capability to take advantage of the valuable technical abilities and skills of former private-sector employees. 
   At a time when we need to be looking for ways to retain qualified acquisition personnel, too many of whom are approaching retirement age, while at the same time looking for effective ways to  recruit new qualified people, the introduced version tried to instead impose new restrictions on these Federal employees. These restrictions would have had a detrimental impact on the executive branch's ability to recruit and retain the brightest and the best personnel for the acquisition workforce, something we can ill afford. 
   Our amendment shortened the bill's 2-year post-employment restrictions on contracting officers to 1 year and provided for a waiver of the restrictions on the ability of acquisition workers hired by the government from the private sector to participate in certain acquisition activities. My amendment also shortened the duration of the activity restrictions from 2 years to 1 year. While this language goes part way toward addressing my concerns about the negative effects such restrictions have had on the Federal Government's ability to recruit, hire, and retain the skilled acquisition workforce, I continue to have the same concerns. 
   The bottom line is that there are too many good people working for this government for us to pass onerous restrictions based on the misdeeds of a handful of employees. We need to promote the natural churn of employees between the public and private sector, instead of trying to stymie it. We can't, on the one hand, bemoan the quality of contract management, while on the other, create more obstacles to getting the people that we need to do the job. 
   In addition to the changes we made in committee last week, I am pleased to see the text of the bill that is on the floor today includes the good work of the Committee on Armed Services. That committee made significant improvements and clarifications to the underlying bill. The Armed Services Committee toned down some of the rhetoric in the bill. For example, by changing terms like ``limiting the abuse of abuse-prone contracts'' to ``improving the quality of contracts.'' 
   More substantively, the Armed Services Committee raised the threshold of the report on preliminary audits of contractor costs from $1 million to $10 million. 
   Nonetheless, I remain concerned a report like this, even at the higher threshold and the limitation to significant contractor costs, still presents a distorted and incomplete picture of the management of cost-type contracts. Contract auditors are critical cogs in the management system. They write audit reports which are submitted to aid the contracting officer in making his final determination whether particular costs are reasonable and consistent with applicable law and the contract terms and, therefore, permitted or what we call ``allowable under the contract.'' It is the outcome of the oversight process, not just the first phase, that we should be reviewing. If we want an accurate picture of costs actually billed to the government which the contracting officer determined the government will not pay, the unallowables, then we might learn something. But that is not what this bill does. The bill would only burden agencies with another meaningless reporting requirement and, I might add, add fodder up here for Members to take this review and make something of it that is probably not accurate. 
   Each year our Federal contract professionals use the acquisition system to purchase almost $400 billion worth of goods and services, ranging from paper clips to advanced weapons system, from sophisticated information technology and management services to grass cutting and window washing. Recent reforms, culminating in our Services Acquisition Reform Act of 2003, have modernized the way the government does business with the private sector. No longer is our government laden with inflexible, timely, and costly acquisition systems. Legislative efforts over the past decade have provided many of the tools necessary for our acquisition professionals to get the job done. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal acquisition system has been under stress in recent years because of the extraordinary pressures of a shrinking workforce, combined with the unprecedented Hurricane Katrina disaster relief and recovery efforts, the enormous job of managing contractors who provide logistical support for our troops in Iraq, and overseeing the daunting task of building an Iraqi infrastructure. To no one's surprise, this strain has resulted in a series of management problems that have been exaggerated by the press and exploited by opponents of the system. 
   Nevertheless, the system has worked pretty well, and the vast majority of the government's acquisitions have been conducted properly. The problems have largely been the result of management difficulties exacerbated by an overburdened and understaffed workforce, combined with improper actions by a handful of officials. 
   Frankly, Madam Chairman, I don't think that controls, reports, procedures and restrictions in this bill will go very far in addressing the challenges that face us today. Reverting to the bloated system of the past, weighted down with a process-oriented system doesn't help the government acquire the best valuable goods and services the commercial market has to offer and our government so desperately needs in a timely manner. Reverting to the past, under the rubric of fraud, waste and abuse and cleaning up the system may provide flashy sound bites and play well back home, but it doesn't give us the world-class acquisition system that we need to compete in the 21st century. 
   We have put the current system to the test in some of the most difficult environments imaginable: Hurricane Katrina reconstruction and Iraqi logistics and contracting and reconstruction. The failures which occurred have been rooted in the inadequacies of management and implementation. 
   And yet the Rules Committee, in looking at the Armed Services Committee report and ours, took out the provision that had the 1 percent additional funding for some of the management and implementation dollars that could have gone into training. 
   As legislators, we should resist the temptation to micromanage our acquisition system based on unproven anecdotes of failure and misconduct. More controls and procedures will not remedy poorly defined requirements or provide us with a sufficient number of Federal acquisition personnel with the right skills to select the best contractor and manage the subsequent performance. 
   Why should we force the taxpayers and private entities to undergo unreasonable burdens so politicians can reap short-term gain at the expense of crippling an already overburdened acquisition system and workforce? 
   It is for these reasons, Madam Chairman, we find this bill has sufficient shortcomings. These shortcomings are shared by the administration in their statement on administration policy in the ITAA, and I will discuss those as the debate goes further. 
   Finally, let me just say, this country, over the years, has had the debate over what is the appropriate role of oversight, how much is too much. But we need an acquisition system that works. And sometimes we spend so much in our rules and regulations, making sure somebody doesn't steal anything, that they can't do much of anything else either; and we get a system that is burdened and that does not create the efficiencies that we need to more forward. Once again, one of the greater issues that divide the chairman and myself is our philosophies on contracting. But I want to just commend him for working with us on this bill to try to get to where it is today. I know this is important to him. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (ACCOUNTABILITY IN CONTRACTING ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The administration strongly opposes H.R. 1362, which would impose a new statutory ban on how the government uses acquisition personnel and would restrict the executive branch's ability to determine the appropriate funding for acquisition workforce functions. 
   That is what they say on their statement on administration policy. We also note that other provisions would impose burdensome statutory requirements that overlap with more efficient administrative efforts to strengthen the use of competition and reduce fraud, waste, and abuse. 
   The administration also feels that this legislation would limit the Federal Government's ability to tap technical expertise of Federal employees who are former contractor employees. 
   Frankly, we need the best and the brightest overseeing these contracts. As I take a look at contracts that have failed, a lot of it is due to the fact that we have not had appropriate oversight within the executive branch, and being able to get the best and the brightest is a very, very critical component to this. These restrictions, the administration feels, would lower the quality of procurement, solicitations, and analyses and would significantly harm the executive branch's ability to recruit and retain the experienced procurement officials from the private sector to close skill gaps and strengthen the overall capabilities of the acquisition workforce. 
   The administration also is concerned with the new requirement in the bill that would impose exhaustive quarterly reporting on every significant contract management deficiency at the contractor and subcontractor levels. This requirement will interfere with agencies' abilities to address and resolve contract performance problems in a timely manner. 
   The Information Technology Association of America in Arlington, Virginia says: The Association joined with other members of the Acquisition Reform Working Group in pointing out flaws in H.R. 1362, while saying that such significant legislation deserves the same light-of-day and careful consideration as do the major government contracts that the majority seeks to control. 
   They note that the title of the bill alone mistakenly implies a lack of accountability for government contractors under current law. Their president, Phil Bond, notes that ``to the contrary, there is already abundant chapter and verse to bring best value to government and to protect the interest of taxpayers. What is really needed is better application of existing regulations by a fully staffed professional Federal acquisition corps working with responsible government contractors.'' 
   The letter also points out to committee leaders that many of the contracting issues now being addressed are ``symptoms of the shortages of manpower and training for adequate contract management.'' And they note that ``the government can't retain personnel and fill existing job openings in the acquisition workforce.'' 
   They also joined the working group in taking issue with the sections of the bill regarding disclosure of government contractor overcharges. While agreeing that the proper use and oversight of government contracts is paramount, they dispute any need for quarterly reports to Congress on contract charges that are adjudicated by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the DCAA. They note that these are unnecessary provisions and would force significant  investment and government resources and additional burdens on acquisition personnel. So the ITAA comes out against it. 
   They also note that another section of the bill that seeks more restrictive cost reimbursement-type contracts is also unnecessary and potentially harmful. They note that such contracts typically are used when uncertainties and risks are high, as in emergency situations, and development programs when it is not feasible to set a fixed price for the work required. The Federal Acquisitions Regulations, the FAR, already establishes detailed criteria for proper selection of contract type, including limitations on the use of cost-type contracts ``for use only when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to suit any type of fixed price contract.'' 
   Madam Chairwoman, if we want to fix the Federal contracting system, the appropriate way is to hire, train, retrain, and pay well our acquisition personnel so that they have a toolbox of acquisition options to use to get the best deal for the government in every case, get the best value for the government. The taxpayers' dollars are at stake here, and their role ought to be to make sure the taxpayer dollars are spent most efficiently. 
   Adding burdens and layers and layers of regulatory reports do nothing to help that situation at all, and in many cases it can be very misleading as these burdens come out and we start taking out DCAA reports that have nothing to do with final adjudications of how these work. We already, by the way, have access to that information in Congress. What we don't have access to information is, and one of the things we would have liked to include, is to take final adjudications on costs that were deemed allowable and see what those costs are per contractor. That could have helped us in ferreting out which contractors are using these items. But this legislation does little to remedy those situations, unfortunately. 
   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me start by saying we all want to limit the use of no-bid contracts. These go back of course to the Revolutionary War, where the troops were marching and they needed food and there is one farmer around. And you can't go out to bid to see who is going to sell you the lowest corn; you take what is there. But they should be limited, because competition is the cornerstone of our contracting system. 
   Let me go through some of the assertions that are made in support of the bill and give my thoughts. 
   Assertion one is that spending on sole source and other noncompetitive contracts has more than doubled over the last 5 years. And although spending has increased significantly over the last 5 years, it is due largely to 9/11 and Katrina. The total dollars competed is a percentage of total dollars available for competition. It has remained relatively constant between fiscal years 2001 and 2006, between 61 and 64 percent, according to the FPDS. 
   This notwithstanding, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Administrator will be seeking to help in the leadership of the CAOs to reinvigorate through administrative means the use of competition and related practice for achieving a competitive environment. The role of competition advocates should be revived, with special emphasis on planning and execution in the management of hard-to-task and delivery orders. 
   There is an assertion that over the last 5 years the administration has jeopardized taxpayer interests and squandered hundreds of millions of dollars by giving private contractors exclusive control over huge portions of the reconstruction efforts in Iraq.  
   Frankly, DOD is giving increased attention to contingency contracting, including training for acquisition and program personnel and standard operating procedures. The Department of Defense and other agencies have recognized the need to increase the number of prepositioned, competitively awarded contracts to address contingencies. Also, the Department of Defense has several audit agencies including the Defense Audit Agency and Defense Contract Management Agency working in theater to monitor the contracts and resources.     
   Another assertion that comes from the other side is that this administration has justified the award of lucrative sole source contracts by citing urgent and compelling needs but then allowed these contracts to continue years after the emergency has passed. 
   The Chief Acquisition Officers Council, the CAOC, has established an Emergency Response and Recovery Working Group to improve access to information that can assist the acquisition workforce in planning for and addressing emergencies. The working group created a community of practice Web site, accessible at http://acc.dau.mil/emergencyresponse, so that agencies can share information about their policies and procedures, their best practices, their training resources, and other information of interest. For example, the site provides a link to the Emergency Acquisition Field Guide developed by FEMA so other agencies can learn about and adopt, as appropriate, practices employed by FEMA for performing specific assignments or functions in an emergency acquisition environment. 
   The emergency response and recovery Web site includes a list of interagency contracts that offer the types of supplies and services that were required by agencies to address disaster recovery for Katrina and 9/11, such as communications equipment, fuel and transportation, pharmaceuticals, portable shelters, generators, tarps, bottled water, and emergency meals. The GSA has established a disaster relief and emergency preparedness homepage that provides a quick reference guide to offerings on its Multiple Award Schedules that can be suitable for addressing readiness, intervention, counteractive solutions, or post-emergency logistics. 
   Another assertion is that cost reimbursement-type contracts leave the taxpayer vulnerable to wasteful spending by providing contractors with little or no incentive to control costs. Between 2000 and 2005, the use of this type of contract has risen 75 percent. 
   Frankly, according to the FPDS again, the total government spending on contracts has increased considerably, roughly at the same percentage as the increases in cost-type contracts stated above. From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005, total spending increased from $219 billion to $380 billion. 
   But cost-type contracts play a useful and necessary role in contracting when uncertainties involved in contract performance don't permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract. And the contractors get caught on these many times when they move ahead and they estimate it to be one thing and then the needs of the contract change and they end up having to advance costs. So cost-type contracts in these types of situations are proven useful, but they are only good when they get the appropriate oversight from the procurement officers. And we don't address that underlying issue in a significant way in this legislation. 
   Agencies such as NASA rely on cost-type contracts for critical R&D work, such as planetary science and exploration missions, systems development operation support in physical engineering, and life sciences. In the early 1980s, there was a push towards fixed-price contracts for R&D to address failed major programs, cost overruns. But ultimately Congress passed legislation requiring a secretarial approval for contracts over $25 million. DOD regulations preclude award of a fixed-price contract for a development program unless the level of program risk permits realistic pricing and the use of a fixed-price type contract allows an equitable and sensible allocation of program risk between the government and the contractor.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. I yield myself 1 minute to note again the reason for the rise in sole-source contracts has been emergencies like 9/11 and Katrina, under which the exigencies which government is faced with at that point to meet in a timely manner doesn't allow you to go out in these cases for a wide swath of bids. But I think we share a common desire to bring more competition into government contracting. 
   I also want to note that at our committee hearing on February 8, the Inspector General, Richard Skinner, testified that the government's greatest exposure to fraud, waste and abuse is undoubtedly in the area of procurement. As already pointed out by members of this committee, he notes, the problem is not a new one. It dates back to the Federal Government's nearsighted policies in the early 1990s to reduce the Federal workforce. While acquisition management capabilities were being downsized, the procurement workload was on the rise. 
   I hope to continue to work with the gentleman as we focus on this acquisition workforce and give them the tools they need.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, we fully support transparency and accountability in decision-making, but we need to remember we are asking for all of these audit reports that are only advisory in nature. They are not disposition. These are questioned costs, and contracting in a war zone or in an emergency often lacks appropriate documentation. But these are allowable costs. 
   I think to provide those to Congress not only gives you too much information, a lot of it can be misleading and can be misplayed. 
   Knowing that the results of an audit will be provided to Congress during the negotiation and the resolution process, which is what they are asking for, could unduly influence the impact the audit advice may have on the contracting officer's administrative determination. This inhibits their authority to appropriately and effectively resolve contracting issues using all of the relevant information available to them. This could also have the unintended effect of increasing the number of contract disputes. 
   But I know my colleague feels with a passion that we need to move ahead and do something of this order. I look forward to working with him on legislation on the acquisition workforce which we don't touch in this area. This legislation I think falls short of the promise, but I appreciate the willingness he has shown to work with us. We will address further issues later in our motion to recommit.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This motion to recommit would bar Federal agencies from awarding contracts to colleges and universities that either prohibit on-campus military recruitment, or otherwise do not provide military recruiters access to campuses and to students that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access that is provided to any other employer. 
   On March 6, 2006, the Supreme Court reversed a Federal appeals court ruling in Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights. In doing so, eight Justices upheld the constitutionality of the so-called Solomon amendment, upon which this motion is based, forbidding most forms of Federal aid to higher educational institutions that deny military recruiters access to students equal to that provided other employers. 
   Mr. Speaker, military recruiters must be given access to university and college campuses and students that is at least equal in quality and scope provided to other employers. 
   This motion establishes that requirement government-wide. We already do this to some agencies in government. A number of Departments are already covered; but since this bill is government-wide in scope, we make this government-wide in scope. 
   This motion establishes that requirement, thereby addressing an apparent trend among certain colleges and universities to attempt to frustrate military recruiters through official and unofficial mistreatment. 
   Unfortunately, this growing trend is not isolated to the higher education community, as evidenced by the decision last November by the San Francisco Board of Education to phase out Junior ROTC from the high school system over the next 2 years. At a time of war, when we are depending on a volunteer military, it seems counterproductive to be openly discriminating against our military personnel and to create perceptions that military service is not a noble and professional calling. 
   The Department of Defense noting that certain colleges and universities continue to restrict access or limit opportunities for military recruiters to participate fully in job fairs, placement office services and interview programs, supports congressional efforts to take action to pass legislation granting military recruiters access equal to that of other employers. 
   The motion to recommit would help prod those colleges and universities that currently do not provide equal access to military recruiters. 
   We also, I want to note, have a clause in here that this prohibition does not apply to an institution of higher education or a sub-element if the Secretary of Defense determines that the institution has a longstanding policy of pacifism based on historical religious affiliation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this.

This makes it government-wide. 
   This body has addressed this issue before. But I think it is time to make this government-wide, and I would urge my colleagues to support the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This resolution appropriately summons us to reaffirm the sense of urgency forged in the crumbling inferno of the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and that field in Pennsylvania. Today we fulfill our duty to remember, to honor the memory of the 2,996 martyrs who gave their lives in the earliest day of protracted struggle against godless extremism. 
   This resolution reminds us that we are at war and no political difference or debate can detract from the heroic work done every day by the men and women of America's military. The 184 people who gave their lives at the Pentagon 5 years ago fought on an unexpected battlefield, but toiled until the end in loyal service to the national ideals of liberty and justice. A vote for this resolution confirms our eternal debt of honor to all those who fight to defend America and advance freedom. 
   On 9/11, America's first responders got a bitter taste of the unwelcome battle brought to our shores. But their valor and grit carried us all through that day and those that followed. In this resolution, we also honor and support the work of the public safety and public health professionals who work every day to protect us from terrorist attacks. Between 9/11 observances, however, distance from the tragedy of 9/11 seems to have allowed some politics to seep in to what should be wholly nonpartisan discussions of profound national security issues.     
   With each passing year, what looked hugely urgent after 9/11 tends to get smaller in the viewfinder as more current problems loom larger. While we lose sight of the threat, an enemy who relentlessly worked to transform airplanes into guided missiles is maniacally focused on other ways to harm us. Rather than using the lengthening historical horizon to elevate our perspective, we have also allowed the debate over the next step in Iraq to draw us deep into the political weeds. 
   As a Nation with global responsibilities, we need to climb out of the domestic political trenches and reclaim the high ground so dearly purchased 6 years ago. We do the victims of 9/11 a great disservice if we do not take bipartisan steps toward regaining a fair, far more strategic perspective. 
   While Iraq is undeniably an element of our post-9/11 security equation, we cannot let that effort obscure our view of the emerging threats to peace: an emboldened, nuclear Iran, a resurgent Taliban, a divided Palestinian Government, and our continued dependence on foreign oil as our economic lifeblood. 
   It is more than luck there hasn't been another major attack since 2001. Given the proven strength of our ideals and the moral bankruptcy of these who exalt death over life, defeat in this war can only be self-inflicted. Only if we lose patience, only if we lose faith in the universality of the yearning for freedom, only if we fail to honor the sacrifices of our countrymen, from Bunker Hill to the Twin Towers, can the purveyors of death prevail over the forces of life. 
   As in the almost 50-year cold war against Soviet Communism, our post-9/11 reality has to be defined by a vigilance and a willingness to use all of the instruments of national power, not just the military, to advance the cause of human freedom. That is one lesson of 9/11. Written in innocent blood, it is a lesson we can never forget. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.

   As I have said on previous occasions, Congress has every right to limit the use of appropriated funds. In this instance, I disagree with the manner in which my Democratic colleagues have chosen to do so. 
   The Iraqi government needs to understand our patience is not unlimited. Indeed, establishing benchmarks could well have a useful purpose in the effort to have the Iraqis take more decisive steps towards autonomy. Making these benchmarks public and tying them to a specific date by which we must begin to withdraw our troops, however, is a mistake. It sends the wrong message to our troops, and it gives the enemy invaluable information. 
   Along with many of my colleagues, I want our troops to leave Iraq as quickly as possible. Setting a public date by which this must happen, however, will ultimately create more problems than it solves.

   This amendment, which is a scaled down version of H.R. 1439, the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2007, sponsored by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella) and myself, will help our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen and marines fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan receive letters and packages more regularly from their loved ones. 
   We're not able to be with our heroes fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, but we're able to send a little piece of home overseas to them. Whether it's mailing the basic essentials or a videotape and a letter, tangible items from loved ones are always appreciated.     
   Holding a son or daughter's art project or biting into a homemade cookie reminds them that they support what they are doing and the sacrifices they are making for our country. 
   The cost of sending letters and packages overseas to Iraq and Afghanistan can be a burden for a family already making great sacrifices. I think that regular communication between soldiers and their families should not be inhibited by the cost of postage, and some things just can't be e-mailed. This amendment will help soldiers receive the necessary supplies and words of encouragement from loved ones more frequently, keeping morale raised while in the combat zone.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, my amendment to extend for three years the Information Technology Exchange Program--also known as the Digital Tech Corps--has been included in this en bloc amendment, and I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for accepting this amendment. 
   In 2002, I included language in the Electronic Government Act of 2002 creating the Digital Tech Corps program. 
   The program gives mid-level federal IT managers the opportunity for intensive, on-the-job training in how the private sector manages complex IT projects. Too many complex federal IT procurements fail because of improper management. The Tech Corps gives employees insight and experience in how the best companies in the world are successfully managing IT so they can bring this knowledge back to government. 
   The Tech Corps works in reverse as well, giving private sector IT employees the opportunity to volunteer for rewarding public service. In tackling some of the world's toughest IT problems, they can return to their companies understanding the challenges facing the world's largest employer. 
   The Tech Corps program is a relatively new vision for public service in this century, enabling broader public-private sector exchanges of talented IT professionals. It builds on the successes of other successful personnel exchanges, such as the 1970 Intergovernmental Personnel Act (IPA). 
   All Tech Corps participants must adhere to strict federal employee ethics rules, and they must abide by the laws and rules of the agency and Federal Government. Participants do not receive any special privileges, pay, or incentives--all participants retain pay and benefits from their respective employers while participating in the program. 
   The Electronic Government Act of 2002 required the Office of Personnel Management to issue guidance for agencies engaging in the Tech Corps program. Agencies had 5 years from the date of enactment in December 2002 to implement the program. OPM issued its guidance in 2005, making it difficult for agencies to receive the full benefits of implementing the program. 
   Since the issuance of OPM's guidelines in 2005 and the approval of DOD's Tech Corps policy in 2006, the agency has worked aggressively to get its Tech Corps program off the ground. Nearly a dozen DOD components have expressed interest in participating in the program. 
   My amendment would extend the authorization period of the Information Technology Exchange Program (ITEP) by 3 years for the Department of Defense (DOD) so it can achieve the intended benefits of the program. 
   In particular, the benefits of the Tech Corps program include: (1) participants learn new job skills; (2) the private sector employees can learn about government procedures and processes; (3) the public and private sectors can share best practices; (4) participating organizations are infused with new ideas; and (5) participants gain perspective from others, improve personal competencies and skills, and close skill gaps within the government organizations. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I also express my support for language included in this en bloc amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. MORAN, which would require that the transportation infrastructure necessary to accommodate the large influx of military personnel and civilian employees to be assigned to Fort Belvoir, VA, as part of the BRAC realignment of the installation, be substantially completed before the relocation of these employees. 
   The 2005 BRAC Commission recommended relocating 22,000 Department of Defense personnel to Fort Belvoir by 2011. That is a workforce equal to that of the Pentagon. Due to the magnitude of the BRAC realignment, the existing congestion in the Springfield area, and the potential impact on the surrounding community--and indeed all of Northern Virginia--BRAC implementation has to be done right. 
   I voted against the BRAC recommendations for several reasons, including my belief DoD had not adequately considered the ramifications of transferring 22,000 new personnel to Fort Belvoir within a 6-year timeframe. 
   Since the recommendations were approved, I have worked diligently with my colleagues to ensure the Army is sensitive to the concerns of my constituents and devotes adequate time and resources to mitigate the impact of BRAC to the extent possible. 
   I would like to commend my colleague for this amendment, because it gets to the heart of the matter: it ensures the necessary transportation infrastructure will be in place before personnel begin to relocate to Fort Belvoir. This only makes sense. 
   Without sufficient infrastructure, daily commutes could last for hours. In fact, it might simply be impossible for DoD personnel to even get to and from work, thereby preventing agencies from being able to accomplish their missions. It surely would mark a drastic reduction in quality of life for those employees stuck in what could be a traffic nightmare, and I would submit could easily lead to significant turnover. 
   I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Chairman SKELTON and Ranking Member HUNTER for including language in the bill to require the Army and GSA to work out an agreement to allow the Army to use the GSA warehouse property in Springfield. This facility is located adjacent to an existing Metro and Virginia Railway Express station, yet it currently is used for warehouse space. I have long thought this federal property could be put to much better use than warehouses. With this language, we will put this property to much better use, promote transit options, and take cars off the road. Again, I am most grateful this provision has been included. 
   In closing, I would like to thank Mr. MORAN for this amendment and for his continued hard work on behalf of Northern Virginians. I urge my colleagues to support this language and the en bloc amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION RELATING TO CORRUPTION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - October 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to speak on H. Res. 734, a resolution about corruption in Iraq. 
   Corruption, the theft of public resources for private gain, saps the life out of everything it touches. The fact that official corruption has long undermined government effectiveness and public confidence in Iraq and throughout the Middle East should come as no news to anyone. But no one believes rampant corruption is inevitable or tolerable in Iraq. Republicans don't support corruption, Democrats don't support corruption, so the pace and reach of our efforts to help the Iraqis prevent, deter, investigate and punish corruption in their struggling democracy should be one thing, perhaps the only thing, about our policy in Iraq that we can agree on. 
   But we were never given the chance to agree. The language of this resolution has never been considered by any committee. Why not? Just last week, four House Committee chairmen wrote to the Secretary of State asking for her cooperation in ``finding solutions'' to corruption in Iraq. So those committees apparently have an interest in the issues raised by the resolution. But none of them ever considered this language. Why not? Because this resolution is just the latest find in the frantic search for proxy antiwar votes that the leadership has staged to feed an increasingly restive left wing of their party. Unable to prevail directly, they ignore regular order and nibble around the edges with symbols, surrogates, and sense of Congress resolutions. 
   In this political environment, it almost doesn't matter how we vote since the resolution means so little and accomplishes even less. But, fairly or not, as has been voiced by several Members on the other side, a ``no'' vote would be portrayed as ``pro-corruption.'' That's unfortunate, and it didn't have to be that way. 
   Both the committee majority and the State Department have gone out of their way to politicize the discussion of corruption in Iraq. This resolution cherry-picks statements from our hearing testimony and tries to pick a fight with the Secretary of State over access to certain information. I offered a substitute to try to bring some balance and perspective to this resolution, but it was rejected by the majority in the Rules Committee. I will talk more about that substitute later. 
   For its part, the State Department's process for answering our inquiries about anticorruption assistance to Iraq has been sluggish and poorly thought out. When requested documents failed to show up, we didn't demand a committee vote on subpoenas the chairman decided to send to the Department. It's a separation of powers issue. The committee has a right to timely and meaningful access to information about executive branch programs and operations. The Department then classified information already, irretrievably, in the public domain. As a result of that decision, they felt compelled to limit open discussion on what everybody already knows about corruption in Iraq. 
   Had the State Department witness at our hearing said to the committee what Ambassador Satterfield said in today's Washington Post, broadly speaking about the Iraqi Government's political will to fight corruption, we might not have needed to consider this resolution at all. 
   Nevertheless, this is obviously not a resolution I'd bring to the floor to assert our constitutional rights. Both the process and the product tend to trivialize a serious and pernicious problem by reducing it to the terms of a spat over what State Department employees can say in an open forum and classification of a few sentences and two reports. It's a transparent attempt to draw the Secretary of State into a highly visible, but completely avoidable, conflict with the Oversight Committee. 
   What is the House being asked to ``resolve'' in this resolution? That we should know ``the extent of corruption in Iraq''? That it was wrong to ``retroactively classify'' two draft State Department reports that had never been reviewed for sensitive information before? That it's an abuse of the classification process to ``withhold'' broad, unverified assessments of a foreign government by low-level State Department employees? And that a ``directive'' limiting discussion of potentially sensitive matters to a closed setting should be rescinded? Let me take them one by one. 
   The phrase ``the extent of corruption in Iraq'' is used several times. In truth, it's code for the unspoken conclusion that if we only knew the real level of corruption, we would all conclude Iraq could never stand on its own. But contrary to what this resolution implies, it's no secret there is widespread corruption in Iraq. We concede that. It's sadly well documented, from the scandalous Oil-for-Food Program in the 1990s to present-day diversion of oil revenues. Corruption is a critical concern to the United States Government, to the Iraqi Government, and to the Iraqi people. 
   No amount of handwringing or feigned indignation can avoid the hard truth that the United States did not bring corruption to Iraq, and it won't stop when we leave. And no spreadsheet or corruption clock will ever give us the real-time cost of bribes and the real-time cost of graft there. 
   Focusing on the extent of corruption rather than the extent of anticorruption efforts betrays a desire to publicize corruption, not help fix it. 
   On the classification question, in all honesty, I have my doubts whether the State Department's reports should have been classified. A sloppy process in Baghdad leaked them; they're on the Internet right now. It's probably counterproductive to put that genie back in the bottle. The Department simply should have said, ``The reports got out. Our mistake. But they represent only the collected anecdotes and flavor added by the authors and were not official policy statements of the United States.'' That could have avoided the whole fight over classification, but they didn't do it. 
   On the question of ``withholding'' information, there is a difference, and in my judgment an important difference, between hiding information and simply exercising appropriate caution and good management in deciding who makes official statements about U.S. relations with another sovereign state and where those statements are made. 
   More determined to be aggrieved than informed, the committee refused repeated efforts and offers to question witnesses in a setting that could permit us to discuss sensitive and classified information. 
   If anything constructive comes out of passage of this resolution, I hope it's to refocus and reenergize State Department anticorruption efforts in Iraq. They need it. That might not be the goal of all those that are voting for this resolution, but it's my goal in voting for it, and it's the only positive outcome that I can see. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me just add that official diplomatic statements, even under oath in congressional testimony, critical of foreign governments, have consequences. Criticizing foreign governments through official statements of our government, when you are trying to get them to comply with other things, have consequences. Criticizing specific ministries, which were some of the questions asked, have consequences within a fragile political framework of the Iraqi current coalitions, and, for one reason or another, the State Department felt that, at least in an open forum, they felt constrained to make appropriate statements. 
   However, I think it is clear from the amount of testimony and the volume of testimony and the substance of the testimony that we have heard that there has been corruption in Iraq for a long time. It continues, it will probably continue after we leave, and it is something that this Congress and the American people need to know about, and we can address it here on the House floor. 
   This resolution was introduced dealing with corruption in Iraq and the State Department's attempts to cover up the extent of the corruption, or, I should say, the alleged attempts. This quotes various witnesses that have appeared before our committee over the last several years to discuss the affairs of Iraq. 
   Along with the chairman, I participated in those hearings, too, and I listened to what the witnesses had to say, and I share his concern about the extent of corruption in Iraq, and I hope every Member does. But I am concerned about the way that the statements are being portrayed, the statements by the panels of expert witnesses who appeared before our committee, because in this resolution, it only paints half the picture. 
   I offered to work with the chairman to come up with a resolution that in my judgment paints a more complete picture of the extent of corruption in Iraq, but the offer wasn't accepted. I then, in good faith, filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that accepted basically the resolution that was presented by the chairman but added some additional whereas and resolved clauses that I thought provided a more accurate, bipartisan perspective on the extent of corruption in Iraq. 
   For example, the chairman's resolution quotes Stuart Bowen, the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction, as stating before the committee on October 4 that the ``rising tide of corruption in Iraq stymies the construction and maintenance of Iraq's infrastructure, deprives people of goods and services, reduces confidence in public institutions, and potentially aides insurgent groups reportedly funded by graft derived from oil smuggling or embezzlement.'' 
   I concur with the chairman's concerns about this particular statement by Mr. Bowen and included the same statement in the amendments that we proposed. But I also added an additional quote made by Mr. Bowen at the hearing that says, ``Iraq has a history of corruption'' and ``the United States did not bring corruption to Iraq, and it will not be gone whenever we leave.'' 
   He said that, but apparently that proposed addition didn't fit the theme of what the majority is trying to do this week. 
   Additionally, the chairman's resolution quotes David Walker, the well-respected Comptroller General of the United States, as stating before our committee that ``widespread corruption undermines efforts to develop the government's capacity by robbing it of needed resources, some of which are used to fund the insurgency.'' 
   I concur with the chairman's concerns about that statement made by Mr. Walker, something we want the world to know, Congress should be aware of. I included the same statement in the amendments that I proposed. But I also added an additional quote by General Walker at the hearing that says, ``none of us should underestimate the challenges of establishing strong and transparent government institutions in the wake of a dictatorship where corruption was woven into the very fabric of governing. And none of us should underestimate the challenge of rooting out corruption in a combat zone, even one where violence is diminishing as we have seen over the past 6 months.'' 
   Apparently this proposed addition also failed to fit the majority's tidy little box for discussion this week. 
   Another example, the resolution highlights the fact that the State Department instructed officials not to answer certain questions. My amendment included the same language as the chairman's but added an additional whereas to acknowledge the fact that the State Department counsel, concerned about the specific assessments regarding the government's capacities  of Iraq Ministries and Ministers made in an open setting, and that these statements could affect the United States' bilateral relationship with the Government of Iraq and could put in danger the lives of Americans, of our allies, repeatedly offered to make United States Government officials and employees available to respond to questions regarding potentially sensitive or classified information, including foreign government information, in an appropriate secure setting where we wouldn't be endangering lives. 
   But that truthful statement went too far as well to include in this resolution. 
   The resolution also states that the State Department retroactively classified two reports on corruption in Iraq prepared by the Office of Accountability and Transparency in the United States Embassy in Iraq. I included the same whereas clause, but simply added an additional whereas, to explain that the original leaked report was an internal, unpublished, unedited and unapproved draft report on corruption in Iraq that, as described by one U.S. Embassy Baghdad employee has been embellished with anecdotes for flavor. The report had not been properly reviewed and vetted for classification purposes before. 
   The majority was not interested in including that explanation for why the State Department chose to classify the report. 
   Finally, my amendment would have included all but one of the chairman's resolved clauses and then added a handful of additional clauses to paint a more accurate picture of the extent and cause of corruption in Iraq. 
   For example, I proposed to add a resolved clause that stated it is not an abuse of the classification process to protect from unauthorized disclosure information contained in draft internal, unedited, unpublished and unapproved reports that reasonably may be expected to cause harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States. 
   Like all the previously discussed additions I proposed, apparently this assessment went too far, which leads me to the unfortunate conclusion that the resolution we are considering today is not a substantive resolution intended to achieve a bipartisan consensus on the important issue of corruption in Iraq, which we all agree on. It is intended to politicize and is a political measure, put forth by the majority, with no intention of trying to reach constructive steps to improve U.S. anticorruption efforts. 
   Is that enough for Members to oppose this press release masquerading as serious legislation? That is for each Member to decide. As for me, I am going to support the resolution, with those reservations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying, Look, I think the State Department when this draft was leaked made a mistake in trying to reclassify this and put the genie back in the bottle. They should have just said this is unofficial, this has some problems, and gone ahead. I think that would have made it a lot easier for everybody. 
   Secondly, let's get real. For the State Department to make official pronunciations about another government and particular ministries can have its diplomatic challenges, and I respect the right of the administration in some of these instances to refrain from saying what the majority would like them to say. 
   Having said that, I think the State Department, when they go tell The Washington Post things that they wouldn't tell this committee, gives me some problems and puts me on the side of voting for this resolution rather than defending the State Department. 
   I want to thank the chairman for his oversight hearings on corruption in Iraq. I think it is entirely appropriate. I think he is certainly within his bounds in the right to get the information from the Department of State, and I hope in the future they will be more cooperative in terms of turning over information to the committee instead of just turning it over to the newspapers with their own slant. That is not the way this works. We have a separation of powers. We are a separate branch of government, the legislative branch, and we want to be part of these discussions. 
   Now, this resolution could have been about a strong bipartisan consensus calling attention to the corruption in Iraq and urging the State Department to step up its efforts to ferret out official corruption, but it is not. 
   The resolution is just the latest, as I said before, it is the latest find in a search for proxy anti-war votes that the leadership on the other side has staged to feed an increasingly restive left wing of their party. 
   Unable to prevail directly, they ignore regular order; they nibble around the edges with symbolic surrogates and sense of Congress resolutions. 
   Having said that, I am going to vote for this resolution. It is not the resolution I would have put forward. We would like to have had more input. I hope as we move down the road on a number of war issues, we can work across the aisle to try to bring some consensus and real change regarding what is going on in Iraq, instead of putting up a document such as this, drafted by one party. But I urge support for the resolution. I thank the chairman for his oversight hearings. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to House Resolution 78. This is an uncomfortable decision for me since for many years I have tried to convince the Republican-controlled Rules Committee to grant my friend, the Representative from the District of Columbia, a vote in the Committee of the Whole. 
   In the beginning I did so because the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole, which has little meaning in practice, carried important symbolic meaning to people who had no representation at all. 
   Over the past 4 years, I have embarked on a journey to give D.C. a real vote in the House of Representatives. Working with Congresswoman Norton and numerous legal scholars and many colleagues on my side from across the ideological spectrum, we have crafted a bill that was politically neutral, gave real rights to the District of Columbia, and solved Utah's special problem created in the last census to boot. 
   The Speaker of the House has been a cosponsor of my legislation. The majority whip says he expects the bill to be brought up quickly this session. It is clear that if our bill, the D.C. FAIR Act, were brought to the floor today, it would pass with solid support from both parties. 
   Today's resolution muddies the waters. It fails to recognize the fundamental difference between the District of Columbia and the territories. It ignores the carefully constructed bipartisan compromise we reached in the D.C. FAIR Act. It amounts, as The Washington Post opined today, to little more than ``dithering.'' 
   I hope this vote, which grants illusory voting rights to Delegates, is designed to expose the strong support that exists for full D.C. voting rights. But pardon me if I appear cynical. 
   To the cynic in me, this resolution smacks of obfuscation. What the majority is doing today threatens to delay action on the real injustice that has plagued the District for more than two centuries. I am looking for assurances that this is not the case. 
   Admittedly, we could have avoided this awkward grouping of governmental apples and oranges if the Republican leadership had brought the bill to the floor at the end of last year. The bill was ready. It is ready now, too. It is time for the new majority to not just talk the talk. 
   What is proposed today in H. Res. 78 is not a politically neutral solution. It adds four Democrat votes and one Republican. Traditionally, when we have added votes in the House, we have done so in a politically neutral manner. Worse, this resolution mixes the interests of the District of Columbia, the Federal district, the capital of the free world, whose residents pay Federal income taxes, with those of the territories. 
   This mushy thinking is what has led to nearly 200 years of no representation for District residents. H. Res. 78 distracts attention and saps energy from the movement we have created behind D.C. voting rights. It is confusing and allows Members to check a box that in reality is not being checked. 
   Still it is tempting to support this, if only to get more Members of Congress acclimated to voting to expand representation for District residents. But this is a sham, and I am not going to be part of it. I can't condone grandstanding and symbolism when real reform is so easily within our grasp.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (MOURNING THE PASSING OF PRESIDENT GERALD RUDOLPH FORD -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, though he served as President for only 2 1/2 years, Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr., leaves a legacy of leadership and service that will endure for years to come. As the 38th President of the United States, he is remembered as a man whose integrity and decency would be the salve needed to heal a deeply divided country during one of the most politically turbulent periods in our Nation's history. He is also remembered as a loving and loyal husband, family man, and friend. 
   Born on July 14, 1913, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Gerald Ford graduated from the University of Michigan and excelled in both academics and athletics. He was voted the most valuable player on the football team his senior year at Michigan, which led to offers to play for the Chicago Bears and the Green Bay Packers. 
   Despite these offers, Ford decided that law would be a better career choice. He attended Yale University Law School, graduating in the top 25 percent of his class while working as a football and a boxing coach. 
   It was at Yale that he would receive his first taste of national politics, volunteering on Wendell Willkie's 1940 Presidential campaign. 
   His rise in Michigan politics was put on hold when he joined the United States Navy in 1942 to serve in the Second World War. He served valiantly on the aircraft carrier USS Monterrey until 1946, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. 
   1948 was a banner year for Ford as it was the year he was elected to the House of Representatives, with over 60 percent of the vote, the lowest margin he was ever to receive. It was also the year he would marry Elizabeth ``Betty'' Bloomer, who would become one of his most ardent campaigners and mother to their four children. 
   Ford served in the House for distinction and honor for 25 years, where his contributions earned him a reputation as a Congressman's Congressman. Even though his highest aspiration was to be Speaker of the House, he never got the chance. He did, however, hold the highest Republican post in a Democratically controlled Congress by being elected the minority leader in 1965. 
   He held that post until 1973 when he was appointed by President Nixon to replace Spiro Agnew as Vice President of the United States of America amid allegations of corruption. 
   After Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford became the 38th President of the United States and has the distinction of being the only person to serve as but never be elected by the populace to either the Presidency or the Vice Presidency. 
   As President, he followed a steady, sensible course to cope with the Nation's economic problems. He is credited with halting double-digit inflation and lowering unemployment. He also worked to solidify President Nixon's accomplishments in China and ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. 
   Under his leadership, the United States signed the final act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, commonly known as the Helsinki agreement, which ratified post-World War II European borders and supported human rights, and is now regarded as having helped bring down the Soviet Union.  
   Maybe most importantly, his wisdom, courage and integrity restored the faith of the American people in the executive branch of government. His time in office is remembered for restoring trust and openness to the Presidency. 
   His courageous and difficult decision to pardon President Nixon may have cost him the election. However, it is now regarded as being in the best interest of the Nation, allowing it to move forward and recover from a tumultuous time. 
   After leaving the Presidency, Ford became an international ambassador of American goodwill, a noted scholar and lecturer, and a strong supporter of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. And together with his wife, Betty, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 1999 in recognition of their dedicated public service and outstanding humanitarian contributions to the people of the United States.     
   Also in 1999 Ford received the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award, for his role in guiding the United States through the turbulent times of Watergate, the resignation of President Nixon and the end of the Vietnam War, and for restoring integrity and public trust to the Presidency. 
   Gerald R. Ford, the President and the man, embodied many fine characteristics that we as Americans value: honor, integrity, decency, hard work and kindness. For this, I ask my colleagues to join in honoring his legacy by supporting this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple amendment. I think it is a win-win. This amendment will reduce the appropriation to the U.S. Office of Special Counsel by $1 million, but it redirects those funds to a far more deserving entity, District of Columbia students who wish to attend college, the D.C. College Access Act. 
   I was the original author of this legislation in 1999. This legislation essentially allows students in the District of Columbia to attend out-of-state universities and pay in-state tuitions because the District of Columbia does not have a state university system, 
   Since that time, what had once been a pipe dream for D.C. students, because college was so unaffordable to them, paying for private colleges and out-of-state universities, has become a reality and is becoming part of the culture of the District. It has doubled the number of students in the District of Columbia that are now able to go to colleges. It has doubled that number. It is changing the culture. It is changing the aspirations of these students. 
   This amendment, the $1 million that is added here, will allow an additional 200 District of Columbia students to take advantage of this program and go on to higher education. There will be no waiting lists. There will be no backups. They won't have to wait to see if the money is there. It will be there for them. 
   If you want to change the culture of the city, we start with the education system. Mayor Fenty has started with a new system trying to revamp the public school system. But it doesn't do these students any good if they can't, at the same time, go on to higher education. 
   The other thing this has done is it has kept people in the District of Columbia. Instead of having to move to Virginia or Maryland to attend universities, they can now live in the District and afford to send their kids on to college. Aspiring students who come from, in many cases, single-parent or no-parent homes, can now work their way through colleges, community colleges and other state universities in the region, and be able to commute back and forth. This has been a win-win situation. 
   Now, we take this money from the Office of the Special Counsel. This office was increased by about $800,000 this year over last year's appropriations. We are bringing them basically to the level of appropriation they had last year. 
   It is a troubled office. In February, Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project testified before our committee that the Office of Special Counsel has become a caricature and an object of contempt among the constituencies it supposedly services. It illegally gags its own employees, engages in ugly retaliation against its staff and is engaging in heavy-handed obstruction of justice tactics to intimidate its own employees from testifying in ongoing investigations of its activities. 
   In April, Melanie Sloan, Executive Director of Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW, said, ``Having transformed OSC into a virtual black hole for legitimate complaints of retaliation, Bloch is decidedly not the right person to tackle issues of misconduct and illegality.'' 
   More recently, we witnessed a Special Counsel who is trying to rehabilitate himself. But Beth Daley, the Director of the Project on Government Oversight, was quoted last month as saying, ``It is hard to believe the Office of Special Counsel will be able to conduct a thorough investigation into the White House while the Special Counsel is under investigation himself.'' 
   So I think this office can go back to the basic appropriation it had last year. This money can be better spent invested in the students of the District of Columbia as they aspire for higher education. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Let me just say, first of all, it is the President's requested number, but the District can use this money because of the students that are still waiting in line to make sure that they have a place and there is no waiting list. 
   Let me just add this. You are defending the Office of Special Counsel. The Special Counsel, just weeks after he came into office, removed any reference to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation from the OSC Web site. He then testified before the Senate that he did not believe current law protects Federal employees from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, an assertion that flies in the face of decades of precedent and defies an Executive Order by President Bush. 
   Today, the Special Counsel is under investigation by the President's Council For Integrity and Efficiency and the Office of Personnel Management for claims that he retaliated against employees who complained about office policies, issued an illegal gag order, abused his hiring authority, discriminated against homosexuals, allowed political bias to influence enforcement of the Hatch Act, and forced senior career staff to relocate from OSC's Washington headquarters to a new regional office in Detroit.     
   I would suggest that the gentleman go back and do his homework on this office. There are some sensitive issues they are dealing with. But I will tell you, this takes it back to last year's appropriation level, I think, or just about that level. More importantly, I think this money can be better spent on the students of the District of Columbia.

This is a program I had a lot to do with creating and feel strongly about it and feel it could use additional money. I think the District feels the same way.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment with the majority's efforts today to attempt to restore the public trust in government. 
   The Nation's Capital has been hammered by corruption-related political scandals in recent years, and it is imperative that we take action to respond to these scandals. But H.R 476, the Congressional Pension Accountability Act, is little more than a trophy that the majority can hold up to claim they restored public trust in the Nation's Capital. In a nutshell, the legislation gives Members of Congress who are convicted of a public corruption related crime an additional slap on the wrist by preventing them from counting their time served as a Member of Congress toward their federal retirement. 
   This stands in stark contrast to much stronger, bipartisan legislation that the Committee on Government Reform marked up last February to crack down on public officials convicted of betraying the public trust. The Federal Pension Forfeiture Act of 2006, approved by unanimous consent by the Committee last year, would have denied federal retirement benefits to any Member, congressional employee or political appointee in the Executive Branch convicted of a crime related to public corruption punishable by more than one year imprisonment for an act committed while the individual was employed by the federal government. 
   Unlike H.R. 476, last year's proposal would have permanently denied a pension from an official convicted of a corruption-related crime rather than simply limiting time that counted toward the official's retirement. Additionally and most importantly, last year's proposal covered not only Members of Congress but also political appointees in the Executive Branch. After all, federal officials in both branches of government equally share the blame for the fact that the public no longer trusts public officials. 
   It's unclear to me why the majority would want to only address half of the issue when we have an opportunity to address the issue in its entirety. Unfortunately this is the first opportunity I have had to raise this concern since the legislation was taken straight to the floor rather than receiving the benefit of committee consideration. Regardless of process, I fear that this legislation will do little if anything to restore any of the public's trust in the federal government. 
   Therefore, it is with regret that I will vote in favor of this legislation, and I do so only because no other option has been presented to the House.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HOUSE VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Taxation Without Representation, the phrase that sparked this Nation's revolution of independence, still fuels the aspirations of District residents, especially this week when they paid taxes to a Federal Government in which they are not fully represented. 
   So this House once again considers a bill to correct this historical anomaly that leaves those living closest to the seat of our democracy without the same rights as their fellow citizens living everywhere else in our vast Nation. We persist because the cause is right and patience a vice against long-festering injustice. 
   Today, there is no need to repeat everything said 3 weeks ago. The history, the case law, the constitutional analysis have all been recited. We have heard from the opponents of this legislation who rely on a single argument championed by one very liberal constitutional lawyer. 
   We counter with the studied opinions of two former Federal judges, including Judge Kenneth Starr, and 25 legal scholars from the best law schools in the country, including Viet Dinh, who the Bush administration relied on to write the PATRIOT Act. Anyone who would have been moved by those arguments has already been persuaded. 
   Instead, I want to focus on the moral imperative to act, even in the face of difficulty or doubt. A great man of letters once said: ``Nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome.'' There will always be an excuse not to try. Refute one opposing argument, another sprouts like a weed. In this case, the scales of justice cannot be moved with weightless legal theories. The balance is tipped decidedly by the solid facts  and heavy effects of disenfranchisement endured every day by those who live in the Nation's Capital. 
   The people of the District of Columbia have served in every war this country has fought. Think about that for a second. These Americans bravely risked their lives, not to defend the freedoms they had, but to protect the promise of freedoms they hoped to have restored. They dutifully pay many millions of dollars in Federal taxes year in and year out, with absolutely no say in how that money may be spent. 
   But these are the obvious sacrifices of living in the Federal City. The small daily contributions of this city's citizens should not be overlooked. District residents truly serve this Nation every day performing thousands of Federal jobs. But when this House votes on the shape, the size and the cost of that government, they are invisible, unseen and unheard in debates that affect their lives more directly than most. 
   As a Republican, I am not willing to bear the shame of failing to try to resolve this matter after 200 years. According to our party's own Web site, ``The Republican Party was organized as an answer to the divided politics, political turmoil, argument and internal divisions, particularly over slavery, which plagued many political parties in 1854.'' Our first Presidential candidate, John C. Fremont, ran under a slogan: ``Free soil, free labor, free speech, free men, Fremont.'' 
   We exist as a party to increase representation and liberty in this country and in this world. This legislation is in the highest traditions of this party that fought for free speech, fought to abolish slavery, and fought to give women the right to vote. 
   So I ask my Republican colleagues to see through the fog of armchair constitutional analysis and do the right thing. There is still time to cast a Republican vote, a vote to preserve our party's heritage and to vote to expand liberty. 
   Opponents of this legislation will apologize that the Constitution won't allow them to do the good they wish they could do. I am sorry, but I can't accept that. At the end of the day, this is not an argument about what Congress can do. It is about what Congress is willing to do. 
   Those of us who are supporting this bill are not nervous about its constitutionality. We are convinced that this Congress already has the authority we need to expand freedom and liberty in this Nation. Might we be wrong? Possibly. The Supreme Court has never decided a case like this. But even if we are proven wrong, there is nobility in attempting to do the right thing. There is honor in acting, not just talking, to end injustice. 
   To those still shackled by doubt, I offer the words of Reverend King: ``Take the first step in faith. You don't have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step.'' Take that step with me and pass this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (ESTIMATED TAX PAYMENT SAFE HARBOR ADJUSTMENT -- (House of Representatives - April 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I am going to support the bill at hand because it is the only way we can implement what we just did. 
   I want to thank my friends on the other side. I know this is a complex rule. It is unfortunate we had to go through the machinations we did to get where we are, but this was a historic vote today as we propel legislation along the great ark of our Nation's history as the world's most vibrant experiment in representative democracy. 
   Two hundred six years ago this month, Thomas Jefferson became the first President to take his oath in what was called the Federal City here in Washington. But through the confluence of circumstances and accident, the great compromise that birthed our Constitution and put the Nation's Capital here also produced a grotesque injustice we have so far been unable to right. Today is a time for another great compromise. 
   The capital of the free world doesn't provide full voting representation for residents. In fact, that has been true for too long, but today we have started the process of correcting an unhappy legacy left by the first Congresses. 
   I have discovered over the last 4 years that there are substantial myths surrounding the founding of Washington, DC, so I want to take a few minutes today to lay out the facts of how the city became what it is. 
   The idea for a Federal district arose out of an incident that took place in 1783 while the Continental Congress was in session in Philadelphia. When a crowd of Revolutionary War soldiers who had not been paid gathered to protest outside the building, the Continental Congress requested help from the Pennsylvania militia. The State refused, and the Congress was forced to adjourn and reconvene in New Jersey. 
   After that incident, the Framers concluded there was a need for a Federal district under solely Federal control for the protection of the Congress and for the territorial integrity of the capital. So the Framers gave Congress broad authority to create such a Federal district and broad authority to govern such a place. That is the limit of what the Framers say about a Federal district in the Constitution, that there should be one, and that it should be under congressional authority.     
   After ratification of the Constitution, one of the first issues to face the new Congress was where to place the Federal District. Some wanted it in New York. Others wanted it in Philadelphia. And others wanted it near George Washington's home on the Potomac. 
   These sectional factions fought a fierce political battle to decide the matter because they believed they were founding a great city, a new Rome. They expected this new city to have all the benefits of the great capitals of Europe. They never once talked about denying that city's inhabitants the right to vote. 
   Finally, Jefferson brokered a deal that allowed the city to be placed on the banks of the Potomac in exchange for Congress paying the Revolutionary War debt. New York got the debt paid, Philadelphia got the capital for 10 years. Then, as now, those political decisions were shaped by the issues of the day. 
   In 1790, Congress passed the Residence Act in which the right to vote was given to those residing in the new District. But while the capital was being established, those living here were permitted to continue to vote where they had before, in their States, on the Maryland side in Maryland, on the Virginia side of the District in Virginia. 
   The seat of government officially moved in 1800. In his final address to the Sixth Congress, less than a week after it took up residence in the new Federal District, President John Adams reminded Members, ``It is with you, gentlemen, to consider whether local powers over the District of Columbia vested by the Constitution in Congress shall be immediately exercised.'' That one statement explains the nature of the debate to follow. 
   Once again, the issues of the day shaped the actions of Congress. The political parties couldn't come to an agreement. Imagine that. The Federalists wanted to ensure a strong central control over the city. Anti-Federalist Republicans wanted to limit authority and distrusted all things urban. 
   With Jefferson and his Republicans preparing to take control of the Presidency and Congress, a pervasive atmosphere of crisis compelled the Federalists into action. If a bill was not passed before Jefferson took over, it would never pass. 
   Eventually, the Congress passed a stripped-down version of a bill authored by Virginia Congressman ``Light Horse Harry'' Lee. It simply stated that the laws of Virginia and Maryland then in effect, having been superseded in the District, would still apply. 
   We may never know why this version was passed because no records survived, but there is absolutely no evidence the Founding Fathers, who had just put their lives on the line to forge a representative government, then decided the only way to secure that government was to deny representation to some of their fellow citizens. 
   One historian aptly described the process as a ``rushed and improvised accommodation to political reality, necessitated by the desperate logic of lame-duck political maneuvering.'' But the inelegant compromise ultimately adopted left a decidedly undemocratic accident in its wake. District residents had no votes in Congress. 
   This wasn't, and is not, merely a quirk of history that affects very few people. The problem affects the very  reputation of our entire Nation. Foreign visitors I have met comment with puzzlement on the lack of voting representation in the Nation's Capital. I heard it from the mayor of Hong Kong when we were discussing his relationship with China. 
   Over the next few weeks and as this moves to the other body, we have to agree on this principle. So we have taken important action today. 
   Our very practical Founding Fathers left us a tool in the Constitution to deal with future problems. The District Clause in the Constitution, article I, section 8, clause 17, is there for a reason. Congress reaches its zenith of power in dealing with issues relating to the District. 
   Over the years, Congress has exercised its power to treat the District as a State when necessary, to ensure that the citizens of the city have substantially the same rights as all other Americans. Surely Members should resolve any difference of opinion they may have in favor of our authority to use that plenary power to provide residents with full voting representation. 
   Scholars spanning its political and legal spectrum have concluded, as I do, that Congress has authority through this legislation to provide voting representation in Congress for local residents. What was done by statute in 1790, and then undone by statute in 1800, can be redone by statute today. 
   This is often called the ``People's House,'' and rightly so. Article I, section 2, sets forth that ``The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second year by the People of the several States.'' 
   That same language, ``People of the several States,'' among the several States, is why the District of Columbia pays Federal taxes, even though it applies to people of the several States. 
   The sixth amendment's right to trial by jury, even though it says that it will be an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall be committed, has been applied to the District. 
   Prohibiting district laws which interfere with interstate commerce among the several States, Congress has applied that to the District of Columbia and the courts have upheld it. 
   Treat the District as a State for purposes of full faith and credit. That talks about States and the Constitution. But under the District clause, we have included the District of Columbia. 
   Grant people who live in the District the ability to sue people. Diversity of jurisdiction again applies to States, between citizens of different States under the Constitution, but under the District clause we have applied that by statute. 
   This body has taken an historic step today. I want to thank my colleagues who worked toward this, including my good friend from Pennsylvania, Mr. English, who supported this. But to continue this, we need to support the issue at hand, the bill that is currently on the floor under the PAYGO legislation. 
   It is kind of a jurisdictional morass, but I urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1684, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule. 
   In the manager's amendment adopted by the rule, the majority stripped out a number of commonsense amendments, mostly offered by Republicans, which would enhance homeland security. I think it is a regrettable turn of events which could cost the majority the support of many minority Members. 
   I guess the good news here is that we know this bill may pass the House, but it is not going anywhere in the Senate, and in this form, it is unsignable by the President. 
   But the rule also disallowed a critical amendment to help ensure that the Washington area would receive the necessary senior-level attention from the Department of Homeland Security so that Federal, State, and local governments are properly coordinating their homeland security activities. 
   In 2002, when we established the Department of Homeland Security in a bipartisan manner, it created an Office of National Capital Region Coordination. To demonstrate the importance of this, we put it in the Office of the Secretary.  Unfortunately, the administration decided in their reorganization to put this deep inside of FEMA. My amendment, which was not allowed, was pretty straightforward. It was to restore the office to its original and rightful place in the Office of the Secretary. This amendment would have passed with a large bipartisan majority, but it was not allowed by the other side. 
   Now, why is this important? The events of 9/11 made it all too important that better coordination of first responders is needed in the D.C. region, with two States and the District of Columbia, 12 local jurisdictions, three branches of the Federal Government, 2,100 nonprofit organizations, thousands of businesses and nonprofit organizations, 4 million Americans. They want to put that responsibility into FEMA. It belongs in the Office of the Secretary. We have been through ``tractor man.'' We have been through disruptions at the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. We have been through the snipers. This needs the highest Federal attention for coordination among all these different organizations in the region. And they wouldn't allow this amendment. 
   We are going to introduce this as a commonsense stand-alone bill. I hope it will receive the attention of this House. But in disallowing this amendment, now the other side takes ownership of this provision by putting their confidence in FEMA instead of the Office of the Secretary.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment will remove from this legislation a very dangerous and costly restriction on the government's ability to obtain protective gear, apparel and other materials that are critical to those charged with protecting our Nation. 
   Is 9/11 already such a distant memory that we are willing to sacrifice the safety of those protecting our country in order to delude ourselves into believing we are saving jobs? Are there Members of this House who believe we should not be doing everything we can to make sure that our Customs Officers, our Border Patrol agents, our Air Marshals have the best protective gear, the best bulletproof vest, the best body armor available in the world when we go out and purchase this for them? Wherever it is made, we want them to have the best. 
   Make no mistake about it, a vote against my amendment is a vote to jeopardize the safety and security of the agents and officers protecting our country by restricting the sourcing and our ability to buy the best available around the globe. 
   What is more, section 407 limits competition, which ends up driving up taxpayer costs, and it limits the Homeland Security Department's ability to obtain the best products to protect our homeland. 
   Members should not be conned into thinking that domestic source restrictions, ``Buy America,'' save jobs. Time and time again, these shortsighted restrictions have ended up costing us more American jobs than they save, as our trading partners then take retaliatory action against American-made goods and services that we sell abroad. We should remember that we are only 4 percent of the world's consumers here in the United States. Pretty soon, with these kind of source restrictions on what America can buy and sell, we are going to be selling only to ourselves. 
   Restrictions such as these jeopardize national security; do not make available to us the most modern technologies, the best body armor, the best  bulletproof vests in the world. The highest technology available in the world for ID cards could be eliminated under this amendment. It hamstrings market competition by eliminating who can bid on these contracts, it leads to higher prices and lower quality goods and services, and it wastes precious taxpayer dollars. 
   I think by supporting homeland security, you should support our amendment to strike section 407. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, one of the difficulties in our procurement system today in government is that we try to reach too many competing policy goals in the way that we buy goods and services. When we use taxpayer dollars, when we take hard-earned money from our taxpayers and the government needs a good or a service, our purpose ought to be to buy the best good and the best service and get the best value for our tax dollars, period. That is what we do when we buy our cars. That is what we do when we add additions to our home. The government should be subject to the same rules and regulations. 
   In this particular case, there is no safety issue over where these materials may be made. That is a subterfuge. What this is is an attempt to try to protect American jobs in some ways, and of course, the end result is you lose them in others. 
   But by reaching these competing goals in procurement through set-asides, where we exclude parts of the economic system from bidding, this ``Buy America'' language is another effort another effort to restrict competition. We end up driving up costs for the taxpayers. We don't make use, many times, of the best technology. Although there is catch-all language in this and other ``Buy America'' language that allows the Secretary to certify certain things, in point of fact, they don't work. They are reluctant to do that, and you end up many times with higher-costing goods of the same order. That reduces our ability to use taxpayer dollars wisely. 
   In a global economy, American taxpayers should get the benefit of the best value when we go out and use our dollars to buy goods and services. Restrictions on competition like this means that tax dollars are limited in their choices. Fewer choices means inferior products. It means greater costs. It means less competition. Section 407 of this legislation restricts competition, and it should be restricted. 
   My amendment is endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by the Information Technology Association of America as well. I think every taxpayer ought to be concerned about how their tax dollars are spent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from North Carolina and his position in the area that he represents, but I just don't think these restrictive source provisions over the long term are in the American taxpayers' interests. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. (RESPONSIBLE REDEPLOYMENT FROM IRAQ ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation. 
   The American people are not happy with the conflict in Iraq; I am not pleased either. Every day, my constituents tell me their concerns with Iraq, and I can understand their desire to put this behind us. 
   The reality is, however, that we cannot snap our fingers and make things all better; it's not simply going to go away. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle have argued for years that we rushed headlong into Iraq without seriously considering the long-term consequences. Yet with this legislation they are repeating the very same mistake, only in reverse. 
   Staying the course is not a viable option, but neither is the fallacy of the orderly, phased withdrawal proposed by this legislation. You cannot gradually blow up a dam; once we begin to leave, chaos will immediately ensue. So I ask my colleagues, what do you propose to do after you order our troops away? What's your plan? Where's your responsible and workable strategy and vision? 
   Unfortunately, such a scenario may prove inevitable. But my colleagues hold forth this legislation as a plan: it's not. It's political pabulum. It might give politicians cover, but it exposes our servicemen to danger even greater than they already face. Ethnic, tribal, and religious killings will increase by an order of magnitude. The current refugee situation, already a disaster for Iraq's neighbors, will be dwarfed by the exodus to come. Our own men and women in uniform will be standing in front of a tsunami of violence. 
   What is required is a thoughtful, deliberative plan to make the best of an undeniably bad situation. Such a plan is embodied in the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group--the product of a concerted, bipartisan and sincere effort on the part of some of our brightest citizens. 
   I have long advocated we seriously follow--or at least debate--the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Foreign policy and diplomatic issues are usually complicated, nuanced and multi-leveled; the situation in Iraq is no different. Yet all we have been given to consider are all-or-nothing propositions.  
   I would welcome a bona fide discussion regarding how to move forward in Iraq and in the Middle East generally--that is what we owe the American people. What we have today is nothing but four hours cooing to the other side's base. This is not leadership. No amendments were made in order. There was no reaching out to Republicans like myself who felt the surge was a mistake and are looking for another direction. What we have is a framed ``take it or leave it,'' ``my way or the highway'' approach. That approach got us where we are--a healthy dialogue with options is needed to appropriately disengage. 
   Two months remain until General Petraeus will be summoned before Congress. He will give us--as we have charged him to do--an honest assessment on where this ``surge'' has lead our troops and the Iraqi people. I hope at that time, whether his testimony reveals success or failure, this body will have the wherewithal to have a serious, open debate on what options we have left.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong support for this amendment. 
   U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Multi-National Force Commander General David Petraeus will provide an assessment of Iraq this fall. 
   The assessment will include the military, economic and political situation in Iraq. 
   The assessment will be a key determinant for future U.S. involv ement. 
   The debate over what to do in Iraq will continue and the Crocker-Petraeus assessment will be challenged. 
   If the report is positive Crocker and Petraeus must provide specific signs of progress and lay out in detail how long and how many troops will be needed in Iraq. 
   If the report is negative then Crocker and Petraeus should provide definitive steps on a phased withdrawal plan that reduces the number of lives lost. 
   Whatever the outcome of the Crocker-Petraeus assessment we need an inde pendent validation of the assessment. 
   This is why I am supporting Mr. Shays' amendment to reconstitute the Iraq Study Group. 
   This bipartisan group, that provided observations and recommendations to the President last December concerning the situation in Iraq would be reengaged and provide the American people a bipartisan perspective of what we can expect for the future of Iraq. 
   With all the partisan debate we witness week in and week out in Washington, we must reconstitute this nonpartisan group , which has as its only goal, moving forward American interests. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is time we come together and support this amendment to provide a bipartisan assessment of the situation in Iraq.

   Mr. TOM DAVIS of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to strongly object to the reduction in assistance to Colombia and the significant redirection of funding for counternarcotic programs in this legislation. 
   Now is not the time to turn our backs on one of our most important democratic allies in the Western Hemisphere. We need to reaffirm, not dismantle, our commitment to these programs, to the people of Colombia, and to American citizens. 
   The drug trade in Colombia is a major factor in the instability in Latin America; it is killing Americans every day, and is a source of funding for terrorism in the hemisphere. 
   I have traveled to Colombia several times over the past few years and can say firsthand our significant investment is beginning to pay dividends. Under the leadership of President Uribe, Colombia has experienced success in fighting narcoterrorism and bringing democratic stability to the country. 
   Now is not the time to cut funding--when progress is being made. 
   We must recognize the difficult work of President Uribe and the challenges he faces with guerillas, paramilitary groups, drug traffickers, and terrorists. 
   Despite these difficulties, Uribe has rescued his country from a near-failed-state status and has reestablished state presence in areas of the country that for decades lacked it. Drug traffickers are being captured and extradited to the U.S. for prosecution, kidnapping rates have decreased significantly, and the Colombian people finally feel safe traveling within their own country. 
   We are also seeing tremendous results in illegal crop eradication, and Plan Colombia's efforts have produced record reductions in coca cultivation and in the destruction of drug labs. Each week brings news of new seizures of cocaine and heroin--interdictions that are usually the result of U.S. supplied intelligence. 
   Of course obstacles remain, and progress may be slower than my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would like it to be. 
   But now is not the time to turn our backs on this battle which is so intrinsically tied to our war on terrorism and the scourge of illegal drug use. The Uribe administration is committed to this war but it needs U.S. assistance to improve mobility, intelligence, and training. 
   Congress must continue to provide sustained funding for Plan Colombia and Andean Counterdrug Initiative programs and approve a free trade agreement. 
   The administration requested $589 million for promoting development and fighting drugs in Colombia. 
   Full funding of programs coupled with a free trade agreement is critical to sustaining our success in Colombia, fostering development and investment, and protecting our interests in Latin America. 
   It's simple, Mr. Chairman, we cannot win this war on drugs and drug-supported terrorism without the proper tools and resources. 
   Colombia is a key ally in an increasingly anti-American region--we must do everything we can to ensure it remains a political and economic partner.
