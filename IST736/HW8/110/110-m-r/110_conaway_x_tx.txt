<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (HONORING CAPTAIN BARRY K. CAVER -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Barry K. Caver, commander of the Texas Ranger Company E, as he retires from his long and distinguished career of service to the public. 
   Ranger Captain John Ford once described the Texas Rangers and said of them: ``They knew their duty and they did it. While in a town, they made no braggadocio demonstration. They did  not gallop through the streets, and shoot and yell. They had a specie of moral discipline which developed moral courage. They did right because it was right.'' 
   To be a Ranger is to stand in long shadow cast by some of our Nation's most famous lawmen. The tradition of the Rangers is one of intelligence, duty, honor, toughness, and self-reliance. I can think of few better images of the modern Texas Ranger than Captain Caver. 
   I am pleased to call this great lawman a friend, to salute him, and to thank him for his service to the people of Texas. His leadership and experience will be irreplaceable to the Rangers and he will be sorely missed by all west Texans, whether they knew him or not. 
   It is my honor to represent Captain Caver here in Washington. I wish him well as he finds and explores the new challenges in his life.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONGRATULATING THE RICHLAND SPRINGS COYOTES SIX-MAN FOOTBALL TEAM ON THEIR STATE AND NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the students and families of the Richland Springs Coyote football team for winning the 2007 Texas Division I Six-Man Football Championship and the Six-Man Illustrated National Championship poll. 
   Six-man football has been a part of Texas history for almost 70 years, and today there are over 160 public and private schools fielding teams. For many small towns in Texas' 11th Congressional District, six-man football is simply a way of life. It is no different in Richland Springs, where the Coyotes carry on the best traditions of Texas football every fall weekend. 
   Before a crowd of 5,000 cheering fans in San Angelo's Bobcat Stadium, the Coyotes played the Rule Bobcats in a rematch of last year's championship. It was an exciting game that was close through the first three quarters, but in the end the Coyotes simply outran the Bobcats and won the game 98-54. Throughout their 2007 campaign, the Coyotes went a perfect 14-0 and outscored their opponents 1,015-225. 
   This victory secured the Coyotes their third State championship in 4 years and cemented their reputation as the Nation's best six-man football team. With this national championship, they become only one of two teams to have earned three national championships. During this run, the Coyotes have gone an unbelievable 56-1. 
   As I look ahead to next summer, the Coyotes will lose five seniors. I wish the 29 returning students the best of luck in continuing the outstanding success that the Richland Springs six-man football team has achieved. 
   I'd like to commend Coach Burkhart, Coach Ethridge, Coach Dodson and Coach Rogers for their hard work in preparing, training, and coaching their teams to the championship. 
   Finally, I'd like to extend my personal congratulations to Mark Williams, Haustin Burkhart, Stephen Fowler, Neil McMillan, Shelby Smith, Joe Tomlinson, Nigel Bates, Mitchell Jacobson, Andrew Fowler, Tyler Etheridge, Riche Daniels, Brennen McGinty, Elbert Thomas, Khalid Khatib, Patrick Couch, Randy Couch, Daniel Barrett, Tommy Hollon, Abraham Ahumada, Branch Vancourt, Stephen Thornhill, Franky Soto, C.J. Finke, Dean King, David Greenwood, and Ryan Soto for winning both of their 2007 championships. These young men have proven themselves to be good sportsmen, able competitors and fine athletes.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (COMMODITY MARKETS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Virginia and would like to ask the gentleman from Minnesota if, in fact, he would engage in a colloquy with me. 
   Mr. Chairman, many questions have arisen about section 8 and how it addresses bona fide hedging for agriculture and energy commodities. I have asked you to engage in this colloquy to clarify that it is not your intent or the intent of the committee to unnecessarily restrict eligibility for bona fide hedge exemptions. 
   Under your leadership, Mr. Chairman, we have received hours of testimony from dozens of expert witnesses about excessive speculation and the narrowing of hedge exemptions. The testimony about removing eligibility for a hedge exemption for economic risk is at best inconclusive. This is a very technical area. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has a lot of expertise in this area. We don't want to leave transactions that were traditionally considered a bona fide hedge left with no way to manage risk domestically. 
   The CFTC needs discretion in defining what an appropriate hedge is. Though section 8 codifies a portion of the current regulation defining a bona fide hedger, it ignores modern portfolio risk management theories. In doing so, it threatens more than market liquidity. It threatens market function and structure. If granted discretion, the CFTC can more nimbly grant hedge exemptions to those that truly are managing risk. 
   From our conversations, Mr. Chairman, I know that you're very protective of our domestic futures markets and believe, as I do, that the primary function of these markets is accurate price discovery. 
   Is it your intent to arbitrarily exclude traditional market participants?

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (RULES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - January 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk. I was just trying to clarify a couple of things on the package to make sure that we understand what it is we are actually doing to ourselves. 
   I spent 2 years on the Budget Committee, and it was a very informative time. I sat through hours and hours of conversation by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle touting the virtues of PAYGO and that they thought this would solve the problems of the world, knowing all along that their version of PAYGO that they talked about was, in fact, a stealth tax increase, given the current Code that we have in place with respect to the taxes on capital gains and dividends, as an example, and the death tax that will come back in full force in 2011 unless we actually do something to it. 
   So as we consider this PAYGO concept, I would like for the American people to know that the devil is in the details, as with everything that we, in fact, do. 
   When I campaigned, when most of my colleagues campaigned, none of us campaigned on increasing deficits. We all campaigned, on both sides of the aisle, on reduced spending, on smaller government, all those kinds of things that both sides are saying during this debate today. But I am not sure this PAYGO version will, in fact, do that. 
   Also the point we were trying to check right now, I believe in addition to the rules included in this rule is a change in the Rules Committee itself to allow for votes in the Rules Committee to be not reported out in the rule. So the Democrat-controlled Rules Committee can waive this PAYGO rule and we won't know which of the members actually voted to do that because of the way this rule is. 
   It is interesting yesterday that the word ``transparent'' was used often by the folks on the other side of the aisle, and yet one of the areas in which transparency seems to have been reduced is with respect to the rule that is included in here with respect to the Rules Committee. 
   So with respect to PAYGO, I want my colleagues and others to know that this is a stealth tax increase that is being foisted upon our economy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, during this process of the debate over the last several hours, Member after Member on our side have come to the aisle and proposed amendments that would reduce spending off of this appropriations bill. They do it in good faith but the truth of the matter is, were any of those to pass and should any of those pass subsequent to the actual recorded votes, that money actually stays within the jurisdiction of the committee and gets spent somewhere else. 
   What my amendment would do is say that if we were able to succeed on one of the amendments that reduces spending or cuts spending, that that money instead of going back into the committee of jurisdiction pool or subcommittee of jurisdiction pool would actually go against the deficit. And should it be an unusual occurrence in the future with a surplus circumstance, that money would simply increase the surplus. 
   This is straightforward, no tricks, no gimmicks. It is just simply if the cuts are successful, that money actually does not get spent. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (HONORING THREE COURAGEOUS ODESSA POLICE OFFICERS -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I am saddened to rise today to honor three courageous police officers from Odessa, Texas who risked and ultimately lost their lives responding to a domestic violence call. Corporal Arlie Jones, Corporal John ``Scott'' Gardner, and Corporal Abel Marquez are true heroes that will be missed by their families and friends, the community of Odessa, and this country. 
   Corporal Jones was 48 years and had served with the Odessa Police Department for 23 of those years. He is survived by his wife, Rhonda Jones; children, Kathleen Jones, Chelsea Jones, Shanna Foppiano, Mandy Boren, Shonda Boren; and parents, Arlie and Lolly Jones. 
   Corporal Gardner was only 30 years old and had served the Odessa Police Department for 4 years and 5 months. He is survived by his parents, E.D. and Sally Gardner, and brothers Jack and David Gardner, who both work for the Odessa Fire Department. 
   Corporal Marquez was only 32 years old and served the Odessa Police Department for 7 years and 1 month. He is survived by his children, Isaac Marquez and Sandra Marquez; his parents, Pete and Epi Marquez; and brothers Pete and Philip Marquez, who also work for the Odessa Police Department. 
   On September 8, 2007, these three men answered their final call of duty to a frantic domestic violence call, a 911 call. It was not the first time the police had visited this specific residence. But these three men didn't think twice about the danger they were stepping in to; to serve, to protect, and to defend was all that was on their minds that fateful night. 
   Three days later, members of the Odessa community were busy preparing for the September 11 anniversary ceremony. However, the ceremony was a little different this year. In addition to the 3,000 American flags that traditionally fly in the somber west Texas sky, there were three more flags, one for each of the fallen officers. In an ironic and touching service, the people of west Texas honored all of our fallen heroic first responders, both close and far from home. 
   The community outpouring of love and support shown for the victims' families has been extraordinary, an obvious display of how these three men lived their lives. 
   I want to offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims. 
   During the month of October, we will observe National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. This year as we work in Congress to pass legislation to provide leadership in the ongoing effort against domestic violence, I will personally remember the three heroes from Odessa, Texas who made the ultimate sacrifice for this cause. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to the floor today to honor these three heroes who have been described by Odessa Police Deputy Chief Lou Orras as ``hard-working and dedicated officers with a passion for law enforcement.'' They will be missed, but never forgotten.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONSTITUTIONAL CAUCUS ON THE BILL OF RIGHTS -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleagues from Utah and New Jersey for once again highlighting these important documents and important truths that this country was founded upon, and how important they really are. And you are both doing a great job of walking through some of the details. 
   But at a bit higher plane is the idea that each of us should know what the Constitution says. It is one thing to study the history of the Constitution and try to figure out what they were thinking, but we clearly know what they thought in the sense that they wrote it down. In the language of the day, this Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Declaration of Independence were written in plain English, and each of us as intelligent human beings should be able to read that document and understand what it has to say. And I think our Founding Fathers intended for us to do that. They wrote it down not for some archaic court to continue to interpret on our behalf, but for us to live our lives and run this government and create the kind of Federal Government that is limited, that doesn't have the reach into our personal lives that governments always want to do, that even this government under leadership from both sides of the aisle continues to reach into our own private lives in ways that our Founding Fathers I don't think intended. 
   Hamilton was probably the one founding father who had the most expansive view of Federal Government of any of the Founding Fathers. And I think, if he came back to life today and got a good look at what we are doing, he would simply say, ``Oh, my, how could you possibly do this reach of government based on the documents that we left you guys?'' 
   My bill, H.R. 3550, is pretty simple, pretty straightforward. It is the idea that every Senator, every Member of the House, every senior staffer would once a year be required to simply read the Constitution. It is not a long read, it is about 2,500 words, and most of us have third grade educations or better and should be able to comprehend the simple, straightforward language of the Constitution. 
   I am told anecdotally that even in our law schools where they teach a one-semester or two-semester course on the Constitution and constitutional law, that a requirement to read it from cover to cover, from start to finish, is generally not included in the curriculum. Now, they will read parts of it and they will read pieces of it and study pieces of it, but just simply sitting down and reading it from start to finish is not something that they do. 
   At a minimum, there should be 435 Members of this body and 100 Members across the building who once a year take a look at the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, just to make sure that as we go about our business day in and day out that we are not straying from the original precepts that are clearly there. This body and the one across the other side of the building write laws every day to implement this government, to run this government under that Constitution. From time to time, many of us propose amendments to the Constitution; those work their way through the process. It would seem to me pretty straightforward logic that, if we are working in that manner, we ought to know what is in the Constitution. And, without reading it, with purposely ignoring it, then you run down the path, as my colleague from Utah said a few moments ago, and that is we simply with our own wit, our own wisdom, and our own wishes decide what it says as opposed to actually looking at the document and interpreting it. 
   Another benefit it would give us if we would do that is, from time to time, the Constitution is interpreted by our Supreme Court. One recent ruling that has many of us scratching our head is the definition of the word public good, public purpose, in which the Supreme Court has announced that those words can be defined to say that any government can take property, personal, private property away from one taxpayer and give it to another taxpayer if the subsequent receiving taxpayer can create more value for the taxing entity. That does not seem to square with a simple straightforward reading of the Constitution. And it would encourage all of us, as we look at the work that the Supreme Court does, to understand those clear documents. 
   So this bill, it would be great, my colleagues and Mr. Speaker, if we could get additional cosponsors. In September of each year, we celebrate Constitution Week, and I think it would be terrific if this coming September that one of the things that we brag on about the Constitution is that we will endeavor to once a year read that document and to understand it and to try to use it as we move forward in our business of fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities as the legislators under the legislative branch. 
   I appreciate both my colleagues allowing me to come down here and briefly pitch my bill. It is a bit self-serving. It seems awfully simplistic. I have gotten some rather interesting responses from folks I have talked to about it, ones that you would not expect. And it is a bit disappointing to have people laugh at the idea that we would actually read that document once a year and make a note in the front of our pocket copy that we have read it, that somehow that is beneath us, it is beneath the dignity of this body that we should in fact read that Constitution and the Bill of Rights once a year. 
   So, hopefully we will be able to work on the other 432 Members of this body to get them to agree that this is something that we would do once a year in an attempt to do our jobs better. 
   Again, I appreciate being able to spend the time with my colleagues from Utah and New Jersey.

I am a CPA in a different life, and in order to keep my license current I have to have 40 hours a year of continuing education, and I know you as a lawyer also have to have continuing education. Maybe this could be looked at as continuing education for Members of Congress to spend the 2 hours it might take to read through the document. So, if nothing else, we could say we are trying to learn how to do our jobs better, much in the vein that the other professionals, doctors, lawyers, and CPAs year in and year out have to do to hone their skills.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate a great American. Mr. Daniel J. Hollmann of Odessa, Texas, has been a community leader in Odessa and the Permian Basin for more than three decades. A small businessman, family man and steadfast volunteer, Dan is one of the shining stars in the Eleventh Congressional District of Texas. 
   April 1 of this year marks the 30th anniversary of Dan receiving his license to practice law and the founding of his own firm, now Hollmann, Lyon, Patterson and Durell. Reaching this milestone is a great achievement, and I congratulate him for showing the hard work and perseverance I know it takes to run a small business. 
   I would also like to recognize and congratulate Dan as the 2006 recipient of the Odessa Chamber of Commerce's Outstanding Citizen of the Year Award. The award, given to the chamber member who best represents the collective goals of the business community of Odessa, was given to Dan because of his extensive volunteer history to the community and involvement in volunteerism that led to this award. 
   He has donated legal services to various nonprofit organizations, including the Formation of Court Appointed Special Advocates of Ector County and Catholic Charities Community Services, and is a proud supporter of many public school booster clubs, ranging from the Permian High School Choir Booster Club to the Odessa High School Basketball Booster Club. 
   Again, I congratulate my friend Daniel J. Hollmann on all of these achievements and thank him for his continued service to our community. Other citizens should look to him as a role model, and I am proud to represent him in the United States Congress and to call him my friend.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, on a different topic altogether, we have heard talk that the Democrats will bring forth the idea that we can set some sort of an artificial time line on when to get out of Iraq. I would argue there are really only two choices in this issue, and this third choice is false and misleading. 
   Here is the example: let's assume for the sake of this argument that Democrats decide in March of 2008 we need to stop this fight. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, how do you look those family members in the eye whose loved ones are killed or maimed in March of 2008 and say, gee, if we had known in March of 2007 what we now know in March of 2008, that your loved one would have gotten killed, I might have thought a February 28 date was a better date. 
   Madam Speaker, we have no three choices. We have two choices, and they are honorable, in a sense. One is to fight this fight and win, which is the choice I believe is the correct one; or we simply raise the white flag, admit defeat, say that we have lost and get our troops out today. Anything short of that is untenable. The impact it has on the war fighter is obvious, ignoring, of course, the impact it has on the folks we oppose and the advantages it gives them. We simply cannot hamstring our fighters in this fight. 
   I cannot face families in July of this year or March of next year and say, gee, but for the calendar clicking off, your loved one would not have been at risk. 
   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pick sides in this fight. Either we fight it or we get out. Pick a side. There is no third alternative.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for hosting this hour tonight. It is particularly important, given it is the first of these hours for the week in which rumor has it that the war supplemental will be on the House floor this week up for debate. We don't even have really good rumors as to whether or not the other side will recognize the normal order of business with appropriations bills and bring it to the floor as an open rule, as has been the tradition certainly under the 12 years of Republican leadership. And so we are anxious to see the arrival of this first spending bill, if the other side brings it with a modified closed rule or a closed rule. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. If the gentleman will yield back. We don't know for sure. I know that, during the debate last week, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee could not confirm his instructions from his leadership as to what he should be doing. In other words, were we going to have an open rule, as has been the tradition. Well beyond the 12 years' takeover that the Republican's experienced, it has just been a tradition on each floor that we bring an appropriations bill to the floor with open rules. And as late as last week, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a guy that you would think would be in the know, would be in the inner circle, in the inside skinny with respect to the Democrat leadership, even he didn't know what the Speaker had decided in this arena. 
   So the caveats placed in there, the restrictions on our ability to fight this fight, the instructions to the President, I want to speak at from a little different angle. You yourself talked about the advantages that gives our enemies if we have a date certain that we have to be out of Iraq. That is pretty obvious. It doesn't 
   take a lot of common sense, it doesn't take a lot of warfighting experience to understand that if you give your enemy that kind of an advance notice, that that is a clear advantage to the enemy. 
   I want to look at it from the other side. I want to look at it from the side of our troops. How do we ask good men and women who defend this country with their lives to fight under those considerations? 
   One of the great lines that the other side has used to argue about the war is, well, if we would have just known in 2002 what we know today, we would have voted differently. Well, yeah. Right. Well, let me maybe take a bit of a twist on that. How do we face that mom and dad in March of 2008 whose son or daughter has been maimed or killed? How do we look them in the eye and say, yeah, you know, if we had known in March of 2007, when we were setting the arbitrary and artificial dates, that your son was going to get killed in March of 2008, gee, we would have set the date at March 28 or January 31. 
   And so what we are doing to our troops is that we are undermining their morale, their strength of purpose by asking them to do things that are just unbelievably untenable. Night after night after night we listen to these floor speeches and we hear people build a case that in their mind we need to get out. We have had a couple earlier tonight, in fact, Mr. Speaker, that went through a litany of information they have used, they have gleaned to make their decision that we have lost this fight and that we need to get out. 
   Well, this body, from time to time, like daily, has its integrity challenged. Each one of us has a challenge to our integrity all the time; whether it is from a campaign contribution that we got and they are trying to link it to some sort of official act, all those integrity issues play out in the media constantly, and we rarely get our day in court. We rarely have an opportunity to stand tall and vote our conscience. I am going to argue, Mr. Speaker, that the Out of Iraq Caucus and all those other Members who have come in here night after night after night saying we have got to get out of Iraq have got an opportunity to vote their conscience this week. 
   I will argue, Mr. Speaker, that there are only two legitimate positions with respect to what we are doing in Iraq. The first, that I agree with, is to fight this fight and win it. The other legitimate circumstance is to get out today. There is no half ground. There is no half-stepping it. There is no run up the white flag and retreat the way that this supplemental would argue. There are no other choices but to fight the fight or get out. 
   And so all of these colleagues of ours that have night after night after night preached about getting out of Iraq have got an opportunity to demonstrate their integrity to their convictions. We will see how they vote. Will they vote the party line, come down here, 233 of them strong, vote in favor of this supplemental with these restrictions on  them that are unworkable in the extreme, but that put our men and women in harm, that make it very difficult for our combat leaders? 
   Our good colleague tonight is an experienced pilot in the Airborne. How do you ask a sergeant, how do you ask a first lieutenant to go do a dangerous mission in the last half of March of 2008, knowing that by the end of the month we are getting out of there? And how do you ask people to do that? You simply can't. You can't ask people to do that. You can't ask people to put their lives on the line under that kind of a restriction.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I appreciate my colleague's comment. This war, this fight has been compared with Vietnam. I think it is a lousy comparison. I think it is flawed on every level. But if we look at what happened when America withdrew, under Democratic leadership, withdrew, Democratic House, withdrew from Vietnam, look what happened to the people of Vietnam, the boat people exodus, the death inside Vietnam, and then the spillover into Cambodia with Pol Pot, 2 million lives lost under that ripple effect. 
   But the one thing that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have yet to answer, in addition to how do you face that mom and dad as a part of this artificial deadline, how do you manage the disaster in Iraq if we did pull out tonight, if we did get our guys out of there? The regional fight, the spillover into other countries, the humanitarian suffering on an incredible scale, how do, in fact, we manage that disaster if your answer is that we have to get out of Iraq tonight?

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me finish off, and I will yield back for a little bit. We are talking about young men and women's lives who have volunteered to do a fight for us on our behalf, to fight an enemy that is really bad individuals, to stand between us and those bad individuals. 
   I even hesitate to bring this point up, but you look at this supplemental that has been proposed, an additional $21.8 billion added to it, and I would argue, and I am, on an individual basis, were it not in this bill, I would be for it. I think we have got some disaster relief and some other kinds of things that we could be for, but it appears to be an attempt to circumvent the PAYGO rules, that this, the other side beat our heads about, beat us about the head and shoulders with all during the campaign. In other words, if you declare the milk thing a disaster, then it doesn't have to be held up to PAYGO. 
   All of this emergency spending is outside the PAYGO rules under the Democrat leadership. So they have spoken with forked tongue, so to speak, that they would cling to the PAYGO rules, and yet on this first big appropriations bill, they come whistling in here with an additional $21.8 billion. 
   I would even question part of the $103 billion that the President proposed. I am not sure that Katrina is still an emergency. Yeah, we have issues in Katrina. Yeah, we have issues with what is going on in New Orleans, and we have a got a lot of money in the pipeline backed up. I think we ought to figure that out first before we throw additional moneys at it. 
   So the $99 billion that is for the war fight, for the reset, for the troops that are in harm's way, we would, I think most all of us would agree on. But beyond that we have got some real challenges from a spending standpoint. Those issues pale in comparison to putting a hard deadline on getting out of Iraq and the serious consequences that that leaves our military commanders on the ground.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I would like to add one aspect that hasn't been discussed. We hate to engage in too much speculation, but let us assume that this thing passes and the President vetoes it or let us assume that cooler heads prevail and this thing fails this week on the floor. What next? What is this Congress going to do to actually continue to provide the funds needed, this $99 billion that is needed right now, this year, this fiscal year to fight this fight? What will be the next step? How will we, in effect, bring this about? What kind of a scramble will go on that is totally unnecessary? 
   Instead of dealing with the problem now in a rational, thoughtful manner, this Democratic majority sees fit to play a giant game of chicken, it seems like, to run at this thing in what I believe is an irresponsible manner with loading another $21.8 billion of funding on it, getting away from what the true nature of it is, trying to incite a veto by the President, trying to flex muscle and see who is the strongest as opposed to what do we need to do to deal with the troops' needs and then separate that from the broader discussion of where we should be. 
   So I think we are on a collision course that has the potential for being very disruptive and very harmful to the men and women who fight this fight on our behalf.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
   I want to make sure, Mr. Speaker, that as we talk tonight about an incredibly serious matter that those listening don't have a sense that we have a callous disregard for the men and women who are fighting this fight. We stand up here night after night and talk about the sacrifices made and the dedication of this all-volunteer force, and the phrase kind of rolls off our tongue very easily.     
   I want to make sure that those listening understand that each one of those lives lost is incredibly precious. 
   When I am out and about in the district in Texas talking to folks, I typically ask the question, how many folks have someone they know serving in Iraq or Afghanistan, and a lot of times a lot of hands will go up. 
   I will then ask, no, I need to know how many people out here have somebody in harm's way that when they hear about a death in Iraq, their stomach gets in a knot until they know it is not their loved one, and most of the hands go down. So we are fighting a fight there that while it has a dramatic impact on an awful lot of lives, broadly across this country, day in and day out, most Americans aren't really affected by this sacrifice, by this magnificent fighting force that we have in place. 
   I typically challenge that audience to say, look, anytime you hear about sacrifice for this country, dying for this country, fighting for this country, make sure you think about it in the terms of some specific person. Not the global group, because that defuses the impact. That lessens the tugs at our hearts and helps us deal with it. I want you to think about some specific person that has given their life on behalf of this country. 
   For me, it is a high school buddy of mine that died in Vietnam, a Medal of Honor winner. I look at all that I have done since he and I graduated from high school. He gave up all of that so that we could live in freedom today. 
   We have got the exact kind of men and women fighting in Iraq today and in Afghanistan today and in other places around this world that we don't get to talk about that are laying their lives on the line, laying their futures on the line, laying their ability to walk a daughter down the aisle at her wedding, the ability to hold a grandchild, and all those kinds of things that those of us who make it into this stage of life have gotten to do. Yet our men and women volunteer to take on these responsibilities, take these risks, and put themselves between you and I and some really, really bad people. 
   So as we come to this Chamber night after night to talk about this fight, we need to make sure we understand exactly who it is we are talking about, who we are talking to. 
   We got an e-mail 2 weeks ago, 3 weeks ago, when we were debating that nonsense on the meaningless, toothless House resolution from a buck sergeant in Mosul who made the comment, he said, you know, the professional veneer we keep in place that says that debate, that conversation going on back in America, has no impact on our ability total fight, our moral, he said that veneer is very thin. Underneath, we are angry, we are mad. We think we are being sold out. 
   So the things that we say in this Chamber and in front of newspapers and televisions have a deep impact on the men and women who fight this fight. It is almost as if we taunt them when we talk about, well, we are going to support you, but we don't believe in what you do. We want to support you, but we think you are screwing things up. We want to support you, but we are not going to pay for it. 
   All of those kinds of things are a mixed message that has deep impact, and while I would defend my colleagues' rights to continue to say those things and have those opinions and debate those things, I would also challenge them to understand the deep impact they have as they make those statements, as they talk about their positions, as they put forth their ideas on what we should and should not be doing in Iraq. It comes with a great responsibility that each one of us brings to this Chamber when we talk.

   Mr. CONAWAY. If you look at our history, if you look at the year 1776 and you study George Washington that year, he got up every day thinking that was the last day of the revolution. His army in many cases was in tatters, it was unpaid, it was underequipped. He could not have made the certification that the Democrats are demanding that this President make in order to send a single unit into combat; Washington could not have made that certification and he would have had to give up. 
   He got up every day thinking, This is the last day of the deal. I am sure there were critics all over the place saying we are done, it is over, this grand experiment that turned into America, turned into 230 years of a beacon for liberty and democracy around the world, would have failed had he not stuck to this plan and stuck to the understanding that we could win this fight. And it was hard. Good men lost their lives every day, and it was hard. 
   We are there at the same place today in Iraq. It is hard and good men and women risk their lives and some lose their lives every single day. I mourn with the 
   families and I cry with them, just as you do, when somebody from the district is killed or maimed or injured. This has serious consequences to what we do. But failure in Iraq, a disaster that would be an immediate pullout, is simply unacceptable on every level. 
   Let me switch gears for a minute, and then I will let my good colleague close, with some good news, totally unrelated to the supplemental except that it does have to do with this year's financial results. 
   As you know, I am a CPA and I like to look at numbers and all those kinds of things. If you look at the first 5 months of fiscal 2007, our revenue collections into this Federal Government are up $81 billion over the equivalent 5-month period in fiscal 2006. An additional $81 billion has been collected, not because we raised taxes, not because we had any changes to the Tax Code, because we haven't implemented any of those, but it is because this economy is ginning along. Expenses are also up almost $26 billion. So the net of those two is that we have got a deficit for the first 5 months of fiscal 2007 that is $55.5 billion less than the equivalent 5-month deficit for fiscal 2006. 
   I just wanted to inject a little great news into the conversation and get that into the record. These numbers come directly from the Treasury Department's monthly financial reports that are available on the Web for anybody to look at. I wanted to highlight those numbers tonight as we finish up this Countdown hour that we spent tonight talking about Iraq. 
   These are grave times, tough times, hard times, and I think our resolve is firm. We will see this week the integrity of our colleagues in this Chamber as to how they vote, how they have talked in this Chamber versus how they vote on this deal. 
   There are only two positions: stay and fight, win this thing and be successful; or get out, get our folks out now. There is no half step in between that you can orchestrate any kind of a justification that makes any sense. It will be interesting to watch our colleagues as they struggle with this vote this week, with their own integrity and their own ideas of what is right and wrong. 
   With that, to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, I will yield back. Thank you for having this Special Order tonight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of the amendment, and I am glad to speak on this. 
   I come from Odessa, Texas, an oil and gas province that produces an incredible amount of our country's natural gas and crude oil, and I make no apologies for that. My colleagues from Florida come from Florida and they defend their beaches, and they make no apologies for that, as they should not. 
   But let me talk about a couple of things I have heard on the floor this afternoon. One of them was the effect of time to market. In other words, if we drill today, it will take 6, 7, 8, 9 years in order to get that production to our gas pumps. The moratorium that we are talking about, Mr. Chairman, is dated 1998, 9 years ago. Had we been drilling since then, then that production would have, in fact, come to market and would be available to reduce our demand for that product. 
   We have also heard criticism on this floor this afternoon about oil company profits. They have been roundly criticized from both sides of the aisle in some instances, many times from the other side of the aisle. And the criticisms seem to be that those nasty, vicious, terrible oil companies are going to take those profits and drill, take those profits and try to produce additional crude oil and additional natural gas, as if somehow that is a negative in the way we do things. 
   That is kind of the free market process. If I make money doing something, then I should be taking those profits and putting them back into the ground to produce additional crude oil and natural gas. 
   We have also heard comments about the offshore facilities, the production facilities, drilling facilities, and what terrible things they are and the terrible things they do to the environment, on the shorelines and everything else. And that may or may not be true. But what I have not heard is the equal passion for the production facilities that take natural gas into those States. In other words, where is the passion against the gas pipelines, the roads, the infrastructure that takes that natural gas that is produced in Texas, produced in Louisiana, and puts it into your State? Where is that passion for all of that terrible infrastructure that benefits you? 
   We have also heard an appeal to conservation. Well, okay. If those States who do not want this drilling off their shores would begin to commit today to eliminate their use of natural gas, just simply say, okay, if we are not going to drill off our shores, then we are not going to use it either. Let's see the passion for your commitment to conservation. 
   We have also heard conversations about the importance of the tourism industry in Florida, and I don't doubt that. An incredible impact on that part of the world, a beneficial impact. How about those hotels that run their air conditioning programs off of natural gas? Where does that natural gas come from? Well, it comes from somewhere else. And what we are saying with the gentleman's amendment is that that vast bureaucracy that runs this process of leasing and coming to conclusions that it can be done safely would be unleashed. 
   Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would urge adoption of my colleague's amendment.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This drilling will be conducted in an environmentally sound method. Any time you have got an industrial operation going on, you have got some risks, but these risks have been understood for years and years and years; and this industry is so much better today at drilling and producing crude oil and natural gas than they have ever been. And, quite frankly, they will get better tomorrow than they are today, and they will be better the day after tomorrow than they are today as well. 
   It is inconsistent to say on the one hand that it is a national security interest for this country to be dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas, and I agree with that. The inconsistency comes, though, when we say let's do whatever we can to limit domestic production of crude oil and natural gas. That position is inconsistent with each other, and I would argue with my colleagues that they should examine that inconsistency. 
   The time to market again has been mentioned again, as it was earlier. In 1998, when this moratorium was put in place 9 years ago, today all of that production that would have started in 1998 and 1999 when the price was low would be available to this country to use in hotels for air conditioning, in all of the multiple uses that the natural gas is used for. 
   So I urge my colleagues to agree with the Peterson amendment and vote for it.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We have heard an awful lot of debate already about both of these sections. My amendment is straightforward and simple. It will strike section 104 and section 105 from this bill. 
   What the effect of that would be is to unleash the Interior Department's bureaucracy to begin running the leasing program that is provided throughout this legislation that is not related to what is being conducted today. This bureaucracy would make sure that the environment is protected and that these drilling operations are conducted in ways that will protect the military training lanes; and that these operations will be conducted in accordance with all of the vast array of regulations and rules that we have in place to protect the environment and protect the coastlines and produce this energy in a proper way. 
   Reference was earlier made about the oil spill in Alaska, and I would remind my colleagues that was the Exxon Valdez, a ship that ran aground that caused that oil spill and not directly related to the drilling and production phase of finding that crude oil. 
   As I said earlier, these operations can be conducted through environmentally sound methods. There is a significant amount of oil and gas to be found. I would prefer a 20 percent increase in anything, so to denigrate a 20 percent increase or 20 percent opportunity, I think, is misplaced in our arguments. 
   Cuba and the Chinese governments, along with other folks, are going to be drilling within 45 miles of Florida. That is not necessarily an excuse for us to also drill, but it is in recognition that the risk associated to the folks in Florida with not drilling are out of our control, and if we can control the drilling within 45 miles in ways that are appropriate, then we ought to do that.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Again, this moratorium has been in place for a long, long time, and the gentlewoman from California went through a litany of opportunities, and she has taken a different look at it. 
   We have a growing continued dependence on foreign crude oil. So the old adage about the definition of insanity of doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get a different result might apply in this instance. 
   This amendment would simply allow the Interior Department and its vast array of scientists and bureaucrats and technicians and others who look at this information day in and day out, who know the ins and out of it, to decide how the development of this resource should occur. They will protect the environment. They will protect the military lanes and make sure that all of our codes and rules and regulations are applied to these efforts throughout the time frame that this is conducted. I trust them to do it and do it correctly. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment to set a new track to provide additional natural gas and crude oil resources, domestic production for our country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, currently, small community water systems across America are being forced to increase rates to meet clean water regulations, and some of my constituents pay almost 800 percent more for their water than their urban counterparts. While the rules may be well-intentioned and promote public health, we must do a better job of addressing the restraint of small systems and their communities to raise the capital and afford water treatment technology. If we don't, rural, middle-income families will be forced to leave community water systems in favor of water sources they can afford, namely, unregulated shallow groundwater wells and dirt tanks, and that will not advance the cause of clean, safe water for everyone. 
   I have proposed to take a symbolic $2 from the Office of Ground and Drinking Water, the office which oversees these water regulations, and direct the symbolic funds to two offices which may assist rural water systems comply with these unfunded mandates. 
   First, the EPA is currently working on revising the Small Drinking Water System Variance Affordability Methodology, which, once completed, will redefine the EPA's definition of ``affordable'' to more accurately reflect the world in which rural America lives. My amendment would return $1 to the Office of Ground and Drinking Water to facilitate and urge the completion of this urgent report. Once completed, this report should help communities utilize the existing routes to afford more cost-effective technology. 
   Second, I would have chosen to redirect $1 to the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which was established in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 to highlight the shortfall in funds faced by small community water systems. Although loans are not an ideal way to support unfunded mandates on small water systems, I have been unable to find any other relevant program to build these funds. 
   I would like to encourage the creation of a significant grant program for Small Community Water Systems using existing funds. I would like this fund to be modeled on the USDA Rural Utility Services and the Clean Water Hardship Grants program. There is an urgent need for some funding, as the Rural Utilities Service currently has a backlog of $3.3 billion worth of program applications, and the EPA estimates that over the next 20 years small water systems will need $34 billion to continue to meet EPA mandates. 
   To begin the discussion and move us in the direction of clean, safe and affordable rural drinking water, I have recently introduced H.R. 2141, the Small Community Options for Regulatory Equity Act. This bill would further assist rural communities in complying with the cost of clean water regulations by allowing not-for-profit water systems serving less than 10,000 people to request exemptions from the national drinking water standards that are too costly for them to implement. This would return decision-making power to our local communities who are best suited to understand their needs and resources and ensure that rural communities could provide clean enough water without forcing their citizens to completely unregulated water sources.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I will attempt to be mercifully brief. My amendment would simply do this: Our rules and the way we function here would prevent all of the hard work that goes on in attempting to reduce spending. All of the efforts on behalf of many of my colleagues to actually trim things out of this spending plan really, they labored in vain. Because the mechanics of the system are that should we prevail in any of these votes later on tonight or tomorrow to actually reduce spending, then that money stays within the 302(b) category and is reallocated at some other point in the future and does not really reduce spending. 
   I understand this is a futile effort and the point of order will be sustained, so I don't intend to push it further than this, simply to use this time to bring my colleagues' attention to a failure in our system to in effect protect us from ourselves.  
   I have a standalone bill that would mechanically allow that any reductions in the spending that occur as a result of the hard work here in this Chamber on this bill that would go against the deficit to reduce the deficit, or should we ever get back into a surplus circumstance, would actually increase that surplus. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I bring this to the attention of my colleagues. I do not intend to push it to a vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Texas? 
   There was no objection.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, it is great to be here tonight. 
   Wow. I came here planning to talk about H.R. 6, which was passed this afternoon, but not knowing how much time our colleagues across the aisle were going to take, I was instructed to get here quite early in order that if they quit ahead of time that we might lose our hour. So I have sat here for the last, almost 45 minutes, and listened to my colleagues. 
   It must be great, it must be wonderful to be so smugly self-confident to know the answers unequivocally. Things going on in Iraq are anything but clear-cut. We have some tough things going on ahead of us. I think there is a phrase that describes what really bothers me the most, and that is the classic, if I had known then what I know now, I might have taken a different course. Well, who wouldn't say that? 
   It is just amazing to watch folks flee to the sidelines of this fight and say it is all yours, Mr. President, this is all your deal; and we are smugly confident to know that you are doing it the wrong way and our plan is to flee Iraq immediately. And all of the evidence to the contrary, that Iraq would become a disaster of biblical proportions, they simply ignore with a cavalier attitude that just amazes me. 
   They continue to ignore the fact that since 9/11 we have not had a terrorist attack on this country, and I think that comes from several factors. One, we have some really wonderful men and women standing between us and the bad guys. Whether it is in uniform, whether in the intelligence services, or whether it is in the black operations all around this world, there are great men and women putting their lives on  the line so that that has not happened. And they have done a great job. 
   We are working real hard here at home at Homeland Security and elsewhere to make sure that doesn't happen, but I am afraid we have also been lucky that that has not happened. 
   We heard some comments this morning from an expert in jihadists. She breaks down the Muslim religion and Muslim group into moderates, who make up about 80 percent of the Muslim population of the world, and 17 or 18 percent would be referred to, in her vernacular, as Islamists, who are kind of in between; and then there is that 1 or 2 or 3 percent she referred to as jihadists. Those are the ones that perpetrated 9/11, and may not have had a hand in 9/11 but cheered and danced in the street. And those are the ones whose intention it is to kill Americans. 
   They hate us for who we are and the freedoms that we have. And they are still coming to get us. And all of the rhetoric to the contrary that this would be a great wonderful world if we would just simply grab hands and sing Kumbaya is like the little guy walking by the cemetery in the dark, late at night, whistling to beat the band just to try to keep himself from getting his pants scared off. 
   It is unfortunate we are at this point with respect to the debate, and I am quite frankly saddened by it. It is unworthy of us to be setting ourselves up to say I told you so; the Monday morning quarterbacking. The second-guessing is just legion among the squad who is, with hindsight, with the ability to know things didn't work, yet who at the time supported the program and supported the President, to now come back and cast these horrible aspersions against him and his intelligence squads and all the other things. 
   Yes, mistakes were made. No doubt about it. Mistakes are made in every war. But, you know, I think I will move on to something that is maybe a little better to talk about. 
   Another sad day. Today, on this floor we did something I didn't think was, A, possible or legal, but we did it, and I will walk you through it. We passed H.R. 6 with about a 100-vote margin, which I suspect the folks who voted for it will crow that it is a giant bipartisan bill to make this country less dependent on foreign crude oil and natural gas. 
   In fact, the preamble to the bill says that the intent of H.R. 6 is ``to reduce our Nation's dependency on foreign oil by investing in clean, renewable, and alternative energy resources,'' et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Quite frankly, it doesn't do any investing in that. 
   This bill's preamble is false because it simply sets aside the money taken away from the folks who are trying to provide crude oil and natural gas to this country and puts it into a slush fund to be spent by who knows who in the future on things we don't have a clue about. But their intent is, I suspect, straightforward when they talk about that. 
   Would that this bill even came close to doing even that modest a statement. It doesn't. 
   The one thing that most of my colleagues and I on both sides of the aisle agree on, and most Americans, most folks in my District 11, who I represent, is that we are far too dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas. 
   I grew up in west Texas, and still make west Texas my home. It is one of the oil and gas capitals of the United States, and so I am unabashedly in favor of crude oil production and natural gas production. It feeds my family, in some instances, and fed me growing up. So I don't make any apologies for being in support of crude oil and natural gas. 
   I heard a new phrase today during the debate. One of my colleagues on the other side talked about foreign and polluting sources of crude oil and natural gas and fuels. What I would say to my colleague is that his righteous indignation would be a little more sincere if he would come to me and say, I have committed to either getting to and from my district by walking, I am going to ride a horse, a bicycle, a horse-drawn carriage, or I have come up with some new conveyance that does not use any fossil fuels, non-electric cars, some sort of a new non-fossil fuel way to get here as the first step on making that happen, because I feel so offended by the use of fossil fuels that I am going to begin to take those steps. 
   If my colleagues would begin to say that, then their disdain for the oil business and all the wealth it has created in this country, all the solutions it has provided would be a little more understandable. 
   Yes, there are problems with it, and we ought to be dealing with those in a straightforward manner. But that seems to be lost on the folks who on the one hand drive their cars, ride in their airplanes, and at the same time insult the domestic oil and gas industry of this country. 
   And it is an insult, quite frankly. Just look at the title to section 101, the short title, ``Ending Subsidies for Big Oil Act of 2007.'' What is Big Oil? It is not defined in the act. It is just one of those pejorative terms thrown out there by the folks who drafted this bill, which, by the way, had no Member input into this bill. 
   And I am going to try to keep the whining about process to a minimum and just whine about the bill itself, but this is a staff deal. So at least the staff think the name Big Oil is pejorative, maybe the Members don't, but those who voted for it certainly agreed to that. So they are disdainful of the oil and gas business. 
   Back to what we agree on. From the President down to anybody that you talk to, all of us want to be less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas or, in fact, totally independent of those sources.     
   Well, that road to independence is decades away. And between here and there, that road is paved with fossil fuels. That road is driven by crude oil and natural gas, and it is going to be a combination of domestically produced crude oil and natural gas and foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas because we consume 21 million barrels a day of gasoline, and whatever our imports are, about 65 percent of that is foreign sources. So I think most folks recognize that an immediate cessation of importing foreign crude oil and natural gas is not in the cards, not only in the short term, near term or really long term as we go about trying to become less dependent on fossil fuels, less dependent on foreign sources of that crude that we are headed to that path. 
   I would also argue that every single barrel of domestically produced crude oil and every MCF of natural gas makes us less dependent on foreign sources. That is just one more barrel that we didn't have to import. That is another 50-plus dollars that we didn't send to some country that may hate us. It is another $6 an MCF of natural gas that didn't go somewhere else. 
   And so, why, for goodness sakes, would we want to intentionally inflict financial harm on the folks that are producing the crude oil and natural gas from domestic sources? It is counterproductive in the extreme. 
   And so when you talk about reducing our Nation's dependency over some period of time, since we recognize we are going to have to have crude oil and natural gas, then by reducing the domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, you have, in fact, increased the foreign source requirements of that crude oil and natural gas. And so that is what this bill does. 
   Now, does to do it in a way that is going to destroy the economy or destroy life as we know it? Not likely. This economy, these producers, are incredibly resilient and in spite of all of our predictions of doom and gloom on the one hand, in all likelihood this will have an impact on it. But there will be great men and women working hard every day in the oil business to overcome the challenges that we have put in front of them tonight with the passage of this bill in the House. We will see, of course, whether or not our colleagues in the Senate take this up. 
   The one disappointing thing about this bill is that as it talks about, they call it clean, renewable and alternative energy sources, it clearly ignores clean-burning coal technology, as well as nuclear power. Most folks who understand the need for energy in this country and understand the scope of energy and the scope of how that energy is produced would acknowledge that clean-burning coal and nuclear are two major and significant sources of energy for this path that we are on to try to get to where we have weaned ourselves off of crude oil and foreign crude and foreign natural gas. It is ignored in this bill.  
   Now, I know I heard earlier this afternoon, the chairman of the Natural Resources Committee, in his mind, alternative energy sources is coal, but it is a fossil fuel; and I am hard pressed to understand that clean-burning coal fits into the generally accepted definition. So I am disappointed that he was not able to, well that is right, this didn't go through his committee. So he had no opportunity to make that clarifying statement in the committee where the chairman has great sway, whether you are the Republican or Democrat. If you are the chairman of a committee, you have got great control over the bill. And had it been through his committee in the regular order, my guess is, given West Virginia's coal production, that my good friend would have clarified that the money that is confiscated from producers out of this bill would have been used in the clean-burning coal arena to help us wean ourselves from crude oil and natural gas. 
   Let me talk a little bit about the specifics of what this bill does. Back under the Big Oil category, let me talk about what that did. That is simply a tax increase. Most businessmen and -women understand that taxes on businesses go up and they go down, they go up, they go down, so a 3 percent increase in the tax rate on businesses is not something that is going to destroy any single business, I wouldn't expect. But it is cash flow that would have otherwise gone into their business. And in this instance, their business is producing crude oil and natural gas. 
   Statistics show that the small producers who are impacted by this provision reinvest about, in 2005, reinvested 617 percent of their profits back in the ground. Let me make sure you understand that. If they made a dollar out of their businesses, they borrowed $5 and put $6 back in the ground. 
   Now I would give you the statistics from 1999 to 2005, but it is embarrassing. It is 898 percent. And so these are folks that take that money that they earn, taking the risks of drilling for oil and gas. And I am going to be joined here in a few minutes by a colleague who fed his family for a while owning a service company in the oil and gas business, taking the risks that are inherent with all the oil and gas exploration, all of the regulatory burden with trying to produce crude oil and natural gas and making money with it and turning that money back into additional activity. 
   That 617 percent provides additional jobs, because you spend that with drilling contractors; you spend it with service companies, some large and some small, some mom and pop organizations. In fact, my dad and mom owned an oil field service company for the last 25-plus years of my dad's career. They spent it with folks like him, who he also hired folks, and so that is how that system worked. 
   What section 102 does is to change a section of the code, section 199, which, back in 2003 when America was losing jobs, particularly manufacturing jobs, the Republican Congress in place at the time said, we need some way to incent manufacturing jobs because most manufacturing jobs have better benefits and better pay than service jobs, particularly entry-level service jobs. 
   Now, you know, lawyers and accountants and doctors and others are in service business and they make really good money. But the bulk of service jobs are such that they don't make as much money. But manufacturing jobs, by and large, really are important to this economy on a go-forward basis. 
   In fact, back in 2003, Speaker Pelosi said manufacturing jobs are the engines that run the economy. These are good jobs. They give working families high standards of living. So even our current Speaker agreed that to incent manufacturing jobs to stay in this country was an important thing to do. So that is what section 199 of the code was intended to do. 
   The net effect was to take the corporate tax rate which, on C corporations is 35 percent, and over its implementation time frame would lower that rate about 3 percent to somewhere between 32 and 33 percent, meaning that those manufacturing jobs would have that 3 percent taxes that instead of coming to the Federal Government and having the 435 of us spend it, the companies would spend that money themselves. And with respect to the oil and gas business, they would take that money and multiply it by, from 200 percent to 600 percent for the small companies with additional activity, additional jobs. 
   Now, by definition, oil and gas production was considered to be manufacturing under the definition that was put in place. Now, under the ending subsidies for Big Oil, every single oil company, the companies that produce the largest average daily production down to the smallest daily production, if they are a C corp, are impacted by this. So I guess by impact, we will have to assume, my colleagues on the other side's definition of Big Oil includes every oil company, just because that is how this impact will be. This impacts every single oil company that is in that business. 
   And again, I said taxes go up, taxes go down. But the net effect on this is that there is less money for these companies to spend in the oil business drilling, producing, completing all the things that go on to produce additional crude oil and natural gas which, again, as I said earlier, limits our need for imported crude oil and natural gas. Every single barrel is a barrel that we have not had to buy from somebody who really hates us. 
   There are a couple of other tax provisions that, whether the amortization period should be 5 years or 7 years or 3 years, reasonable people are going to differ on that and it is unfortunate that we have made that change, but that was not one that I think anybody is necessarily going to fall on their sword over. 
   Let me talk a little while about the most insulting piece of this entire piece of legislation, and that is referred to under section 201 as the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act of 2007. Now, just the title would mean that apparently American consumers are paying royalties. That is not the case, and so the title is flawed. 
   I had introduced an amendment that was not made in order for reasons you will see here in a minute when I quote it. My better title, my amendment would have given this thing a little more descriptive title to the bill than the Royalty Relief for American Consumers Act, which is meaningless, except the individual terms have meaning, but in context of this bill they don't have much meaning. 
   The title is far more descriptive of what the impact of title II does on our oil producers, is the Congressional Abrogation of Contracts Using Blackmail Act of 2007. That is much more descriptive of what section or title II in these following sections do as a result of this. 
   Let me set a little bit of the history for you. There are always going to be ups and downs in the oil business, not to be confused with drilling for oil and gas, but nevertheless there are swings in the economy. There are swings in oil and gas, and sometimes it is great to be in the oil business and other times it is not really good to be in the oil business. 
   One of those times that was particularly bad to be in the oil business was 1998, 1999 when the price of crude oil, sweet crude was about 10 bucks a barrel. Sour crude was $7.50 or less per barrel. And so at that point in time, companies were coming to the Federal Government to lease offshore leases in the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Now, again, the price was 10 bucks a barrel, 12 bucks a barrel. Contrast that and today. This is 1998 and 1999. I lived through that time in west Texas. We had a march on the Capital led by some folks who demanded that the Texas legislature do something to try to help the oil business. There were thousands and thousands of jobs lost in the economies of west Texas and throughout the oil business as a result of those low prices. It was almost impossible to make money at that price, and folks were being laid off. Rigs were being stacked and not utilized, and it was one of those bottom down times in the oil business that happens from time to time. 
   So against that backdrop, the Clinton administration, led by Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who I assume is a competent Secretary of the Interior, offered up leases for the oil and gas companies to drill on. 
   Now, when you are trying to decide how much bonus money to pay the leaseholder, in this instance the Federal Government, obviously the price of crude, the price of natural gas is a significant piece of what you are trying to do. Another piece of it is what your  share of the crude oil will be if you find crude oil or natural gas in the ground. Most leases provide for a royalty to the mineral owner. In this instance the Federal Government is the mineral owner. But given the circumstances of the day, there is some fuzziness as to why this happened. But the leases issued in 1998, 1999, which would have normally had a royalty associated with them, did not. 
   Now, I have to assume that there are competent lawyers, maybe some of them still there at the Interior Department who worked on behalf of the Interior Department to negotiate, in good faith, with the companies who were actually wanting to buy these leases or actually wanted to pay the Federal Government for the right to drill in the Gulf of Mexico in an environment which is very difficult to drill. 
   I have to assume, since we have not seen any malpractice suits, we have not seen anybody lose their law license, that these guys were doing the job they were told to do. The companies were represented by reputable lawyers, and a deal was struck. In effect, the Federal Government shook hands with these companies and said, here are the leases. Here are the terms. Here is what you need to do. And go forth and drill. 1998, 1999. $10 a barrel crude oil. 
   Well, today, crude oil has been much higher than it is right now. But it is still over 50 bucks a barrel last time I checked, although it may have dropped some yesterday, and circumstances are radically different. Well, the opportunists on the other side see this as a chance to, in their view, in their mind, correct something that was done wrong in 1998 and 1999.     
   The truth of the matter is, a deal was struck in good faith by the Federal Government, by other companies. These companies should have been able to rely on those written contracts to conduct their business. 
   This Congress, though, has seen fit to step into the breach to do something I didn't think was legal for us to do but nevertheless are doing. Most times, when you have a contract conflict or a conflict over the terms of a contract, our judicial system is where that is ferreted out, where facts are drawn, where rational arguments on both sides are presented, where you have a trier of the fact, you have a judge, and everybody comes to whatever conclusions. 
   That is not how this works on this floor. On this floor somebody came up with a good idea that we ought to go get this money, and 260 of our colleagues agreed to that idea. I am not sure that everybody fully understands that these were contracts that companies should have been able to agree to, should have been able to rely on. Most companies can deal with taxes going up and down. What companies hate to deal with is dealing with a customer, dealing with a partner that you cannot trust. 
   We have now placed the United States in that category. We are now in league with the conduct of Hugo Chavez, the conduct of Evo Morales in Bolivia in terms of how we treat contracts with this Federal Government. 
   From this day forward, as far as the House is concerned, and, again, this may not happen in the Senate, but as far as the House is concerned, we are told, at least people in the oil and gas business, if you sign a contract with the Federal Government, too bad. Now, we are going to hold you to every single term in there, but we on the Federal Government side, if we don't like the deal, if the deal changes, if the deal looks like it is too good for you, then in addition to taking tax money away from you, we are going to impose either a fee or we are going to force you to renegotiate these contracts. 
   Here is some language that is just unpalatable in the extreme. Section 202, the Secretary of the Interior shall agree to a request by any lessee to amend leases. A request by a lessee to come in and change a contract? That is not going to happen. Since when do you have to demand that the Secretary of Interior accept that? 
   This is only happening because this law is, in effect, a gun held at the head of these lease owners to come in and renegotiate. There are some mechanical flaws in this thing that I am not sure was an intended consequence. One is that if you are a holder in due course of one of these leases, and you sell it to somebody else, you sell all of your right, title and interest in it. Then unless that new leaseholder agrees to these terms and agrees to this, nonsense, then you are forever tainted. You cannot get another lease. That is where the blackmail comes in. Unless you renegotiate the lease, you cannot get another lease from the Federal Government to drill on Federal lands. 
   I know there are a lot of folks who hate the oil and gas business, and never drilling on another Federal land is an acceptable public policy, but it is wrong-headed if you think that we can continue to import foreign crude oil and get to where we want to with respect to the energy independence. 
   Another problem that is, in all likelihood, is a Republican problem as well, back in June we passed a similar concept, a conservation fee that is triggered at $34.73 a barrel. Here are the mechanics. If the price is above $34.73 a barrel on average for a year, then you owe a $9 fee on that production. If it is less than that, then you don't owe that fee. So you are the business guy, you are the guy that is producing crude oil and natural gas, you have been rocking along all year along at $34.70 on average, and so you are not paying that fee. You built your business model based on that number. 
   Then you get a $.10 increase in the average price over that timeframe, and you are now making $34.80. You now owe a $9 fee, which drops you back to a $25 gross revenue on each barrel of oil that is sold. 
   There are many places in the world where business people have to deal with that kind of a 25 percent haircut just because something went up over a particular threshold. 
   A couple of amendments that I offered, then I am going to turn to my colleagues for whatever time they would like to take that I offered up that seem to be a little more straightforward than my first one. The first one would have said there is plenty of uncertainty as to what the impact this is going to have on domestic crude oil and natural gas production. We all agree that for every barrel that is produced domestically is a barrel we don't have to buy from somebody else. 
   Given the uncertainty, given the rush to judgment that this was, let's have the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Interior document what the impact is going to be and tell this body for sure and for certain that this will not reduce the investment in crude oil and natural gas and will not reduce the domestic production that we rely on to help wean ourselves off of foreign production. I got turned down on that. 
   Then the second one was if our goal is to increase domestic production while we bring on these other technologies that are decades into the future, then let's not penalize the people who are taking the money and putting it back in the ground. Let's only have these penalties apply to people who are taking the money and giving it to shareholders or, you know, some nasty thing like that. 
   So folks who reinvest over 75 percent of their net profits would not be affected by this. For those folks who are taking the money, putting it back in the ground, they wouldn't be impacted by this law; those folks who are taking less than 75 percent of their profits and putting it in the ground, then they would have to pay these penalties, and they would be associated with that. 
   I meant to say early on that the chairman of the Rules Committee had told us in advance that none of these amendments would be made in order and that we were wasting our time and breath, but it seemed like something I ought to do. 
   I am joined tonight by STEVE PEARCE from New Mexico. He and I share the New Mexico border along a good long stretch. He is also the Congressman for my three grandsons, and I am particularly interested in him doing a good job on behalf of my three grandsons and my son and daughter-in-law. 
   Mr. Pearce, would you share with us some of your thoughts?

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for joining us tonight. It just occurred to me that the Federal Government has contracts with investors all over the world, where we have borrowed money from them at interest rates that may or may not be advantageous. I wonder if those holders of those bonds and T-notes out there all around the world are noticing tonight that if interest rates go the wrong way, that this Federal Government set a precedent of simply changing them at will. That ought to put a chilling effect on the purchase of this money.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I appreciate the gentleman from New Mexico being with us tonight. 
   On the campaign trail and in the town hall meetings throughout my brief career, I have talked about Social Security being basically a contract with ourselves, a promise with ourselves, that we would not break that. From now, every time I talk about that, I will have to think about this legislation, have to think about the fact that, wow, here is a written contract, much like the written provisions of Social Security, much like the written provisions in our veterans' benefits, that we tend to keep but here is one that we did not. 
   I appreciate both my colleagues coming tonight. Here is one final thing. I go through the long list of co-sponsors on this bill. At the end of it, it says they have introduced this bill and it has been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, Natural Resources, Budget and Rules for a period to be consequently determined by the Speaker. I do not think there is a stopwatch fast enough that could measure the amount of time that this bill laid before those committees because they did not work. So how those committees did meet, how they were able to get it through all four of those committees without anything happening, without any meeting is one of those well-kept secrets about how this process works when you do not have a transparency that a full committee process will have. 
   As I told them earlier this afternoon, I hope that my colleagues on the other side are not so intoxicated with this power that they now wield that they continue this process of not having committee hearings, not taking regular order, not moving things through in ways where at least we can point out the flaws in a format and in an arena in which it can be perhaps have an impact on the ultimate legislation. 
   So I want to thank the Chair for having us in here tonight.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the chairwoman's honesty earlier about the fact this was going to be a closed rule. We listened for 2 years about the whining on closed rules and the fact that it reflected a closed mind. So on our side, for the next 2 years, we will try to keep our whining to a minimum. 
   Words are inflammatory. Title I to this act says ``Ending Subsidies for Big Oil Act of 2007.'' I have a title I would like to put on title II of section 1, and that would be the ``Congressional Abrogation of Contracts Using Blackmail Act of 2007.'' We can throw these wild words around at each other all we want to. 
   I speak against the rule and the process. This is staff-developed underlying legislation. Not one Member of Congress had any input into it at a point in time where you could actually do something about it. There are flaws throughout it. 
   I offered an amendment yesterday, which turned out to be for no good reason, that would simply say if you are in fact going to hamper domestic production of crude oil, and clearly in the near term increased domestic production is a way to get us to the point where we are no longer as dependent on foreign oil, if this act works to hamper that, then it wouldn't take effect. In other words, get the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior to tell us this won't have a negative effect on oil production. 
   The other amendment I offered would simply say if you are taking those profits, whether you consider them obscene or not, if you are taking those profits and putting them back in the ground to find additional sources of domestic crude oil and natural gas, then this act wouldn't apply. Evidence shows the small oil companies, to which the tax provisions affect, not just Big Oil but it affects the small companies, those small E&P companies reinvest 617 percent of their profits back in the ground finding additional supplies. 
   The bill is flawed in its mechanics, and I will speak later this afternoon against the underlying concepts, but one of the flaws is, if I am an owner of one of those covered leases and I sell it to somebody else and am no longer in the loop, I am still covered and tainted with that until everybody else in that loop subjugates themselves to this  American government and renegotiates those contracts. 
   The price threshold mechanism is flawed. At 34.73 a barrel there is no threshold, yet at 34.75, I have a $9 pop, which means I am only really making $25 a barrel. These are the kind of things that, had it gone through committee, or I guess it did. Oh, it did not go through committee, that is right. This came straight to the floor without any input from anywhere else. Whether you agree with our positions or not, your closed mind on this issue is clearly evident in this. 
   My only caution is, and we have heard we are coming to the end of this railroad train, that the other side has now become so intoxicated with the power and authority that they have being in the majority, that they do not continue to misuse that power and authority and continue to ignore open debate and honest ideas and an exchange of honest ideas that the committee process typically allows and that brings better legislation to this floor and helps us address these things. 
   The consequence of the taint may be intended. I don't think it is, but we ought to know that. And there is no real way to know that without debate within the committee structure where there is adequate time to go at this. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote against this closed-minded rule, a little bit of whining just to keep up appearances, to vote against this rule, and I will speak against the underlying bill later this afternoon.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The word ``integrity'' in this bill has been used several times today. It is offensive in the extreme just because of what my colleague just mentioned. The lead-in sentence to section 202, which is the beginning of this wreck where we take money, confiscate money from otherwise good hardworking individuals for government purposes, says, ``The Secretary of Interior shall agree to a request by any lessee,'' and I can assure you that no lessee that has negotiated in good faith leases is going to request without some sort of a gun held to their head, and that gun is this bill. 
   Tax rates go up and tax rates go down. Everybody understands that. Every businessman understands that. What these businessmen don't understand is this Congress's attack on the sanctity of contracts. These leases were signed in 1998 and 1999. If mistakes were made by the Federal Government, fine, go find those lawyers and bring them up on malpractice suits. But those leases were signed. 
   This bill has delay rentals which were not in the original negotiation. This bill takes money away from those folks. 
   The bottom line for this increase in taxes and these takings is that there will be less money reinvested in oil and gas domestic production. Every reduction in domestic production leads to a demand for foreign crude oil and foreign natural gas. I recommend a ``no'' vote on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (OUR ONGOING MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Louisiana, my friend, my classmate of the Class of 2005. I am glad to be with you tonight. I did sit today through General Petraeus' testimony, as well as Ambassador Crocker's testimony, and then later in the afternoon, we heard from both General Richard Cody, as well as General Robert Magnus, Army Vice Chief, and the Marine Corps Vice Chief respectively, on the status of our current forces. And I would like to talk about kind of a combination of those conversations that we heard today. 
   Ambassador Crocker was asked, what does success look like in Iraq? We ought to know both sides of the equation, both sides of the coin of success and failure. He described ``success'' in Iraq as an Iraq that is developed into a  united, stable country with a democratically elected government that operates under the rule of law. And that is a path that they are on to. 
   Ambassador Crocker also said today that just because something is hard, as this mission is, does not make it impossible, does not mean it is hopeless simply because it is hard. We have seen some progress on the government side, the national government as well as the provincial government side, in making progress. This surge, as it has been described, was intended to reduce violence as your chart shows. It was intended to allow the government to begin to function in an atmosphere where daily death was not an issue, but they could have the conversations and the sharp disagreements from a debate standpoint on how to run that country. And they have made some progress, not nearly as much we would like, but Ambassador Crocker pointed out today that something as simple as an Iraqi flag, the Council of Representatives and the leadership have adopted a national flag that now flies throughout the country. The Kurds would not fly the flag that had flown previous to that because it had such a connection to Saddam Hussein. And so something just as simple as rallying around a single flag, and we all know how important our flag is to us in its representation to our country, they have been able to do that, and now a common Iraqi flag flies over that country. 
   They have executed a 2008 budget recently in September which provides for record amounts of infrastructure spending, oil revenues that they are getting from these record high oil prices that they are now plowing back into the infrastructure that every government would have to do that is in that circumstance. They have passed a pension law that addresses some of the pension issues related to people that were there. They have passed an accountability and justice law after vigorous debate on both sides because this deals with de-Baathification, in other words, that process of bringing those Iraqi citizens who had previously been Baath party members under Saddam Hussein, ferreting out those who had sold out to Saddam's thuggery and really just have to be retired, and those who simply were members of the Baath party in order to have a job, in order to be a schoolteacher, in order to be a local administrator. They passed a Provincial Powers Act which deals with the elections that are coming up in October, elections which now all major parties have endorsed and they are going to support and will come to the table including the Sunnis. 
   And these are not earth shattering. They are not all that they need to do. But this is a clear line of march down a path that this surge, with its sacrifices that had been made, has provided a space to get that done, and they are making progress. We all want them to make much more progress than they have made. We want them to be quicker than they have currently been. 
   Today, General Petraeus told us that his team on the ground seized the successes that they have had and take great comfort in that. They take great pride in what they are doing. One of the issues that comes up is continuing to replace the number of folks in our Army that we need, I'm speaking specifically of the Army. Third, he told us today the third I.D. has met its April goal for total re-enlistments already just from people serving in Iraq. General Cody participated in a re-enlistment service earlier this month in Iraq. Men who were defending their country today signed up for additional tours and additional extensions on their service to this country, which is an incredibly heartening issue. 
   As I said, ``hard'' does not mean hopeless. But imagine how much easier this fight would be if every American recognized enemy propaganda for what that really is and could parse that out of what we try to think about. Imagine if every American would not tolerate inaccurate reporting and biased reporting out of our media, how much easier our tasks might be. Imagine if all those Americans who oppose this war, and have every right to, would refrain from using rhetoric that is cast just to discourage our fighters, just to cause our veterans to question their service to our country. 
   And the easy one is imagine how much easier this fight would have been had Congress provided the funding on a timely basis through the supplemental process that we have been doing it on. We have a large supplemental that is hung up. It was requested last summer, and this Congress has sat on its fist, leaning back on its thumb for 7 months now, waiting for who knows what. I think it is waiting until next week rolls around, quite frankly.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague for that. 
   More on the spending issue, which is totally within the Members of this body's control, starting with the leadership of this House, dictates the pace at which that legislation should come to us. We should have already dealt with it a long time ago. But since we haven't, there are some pending consequences for not getting that done quickly. 
   By mid June, the military personnel account will be exhausted, and all military services will have to begin shifting money around, which, again, is just a back office accounting thing. But it delays purchasing the long lead items that are necessary to be bought out of this supplemental. This supplemental is intended not only to pay for the fight that is going on immediately, but it is also to pay for replacement of equipment and gear that is being destroyed and worn out as we fight this fight. That gear is special. You don't go down to your local Ford dealer and pick up a pickup truck. It takes long lead times to actually get that money set in place. So while we casually ignore it, we do so at the peril of our young men and women who fight this fight. 
   I want to recount to you a story. I've been to Iraq five times now to visit our troops and hug their necks and tell them ``thank you.'' Probably my most memorable trip was Christmas Day of 2006. I was there with Ike Skelton and a couple of other Members of Congress. And it was particularly meaningful to be away from my family and be with men and women who are away from their families, to share that experience. I was only away from my family for about 5 or 6 days, nothing like the 15-month deployments that our men and women are enduring right now. But nevertheless, it was great to be there with them. 
   At Camp Victory, we went out to a perimeter fence where this particular Kentucky National Guard unit was guarding this fence for the base. And a Lieutenant Colonel Lutrell had come out, having just returned from a trip outside the wire. He had gone to a mosque. You could see the minarets just across our fence. And he had gone over there to talk to the cleric about some sort of a neighborhood watch program because of what was happening. There was an elementary school right near there that some Shia gunmen and thugs were sneaking into and using that platform to shoot at our men and women walking that wire. So this lieutenant colonel had gone to the imam, or cleric, there, because it was a Sunni neighborhood. He said, we could work out a deal. If you just give us the heads up, we will stop that. It helps you because they are just trying to force us to fire back at them into the school. And they were taking the chance of hurting their guys. So he was discussing with us about what was going on. And a young buck sergeant kind of eased up to kind of the back side of the deal. And I was standing looking at the name tags, and it was Lieutenant Colonel Lutrell and it was Sergeant Lutrell. And when I got a chance to say something, I said, you two men have the same last name. And the lieutenant colonel said, let me introduce you to  my son, Sergeant Lutrell. And my comment was, sir, your wife and his mother must be a saint to be able to endure having two very, I assume, very important men in her life in harm's way. But that is indicative of the kind of commitment to country, commitment to duty, and commitment to that flag that is played out hundreds and hundreds and thousands of times every single day over the last 6 or 7 years that we have been in the fight, good men and women stepping forward, putting education on hold, putting families on hold, putting family decisions on hold, while they went to do a job that not very many people are qualified to do, not very many people are willing to do. 
   So in the words of Ambassador Crocker today, our current course is hard, but it is working. 
   I look forward to some additional dialogue with my good colleague a little later in this hour.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (OUR ONGOING MILITARY AND DIPLOMATIC MISSION IN IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. As we draw to the close of this hour, I want to talk briefly about something that also came up in today's conversation. General Petraeus, you went through his resume awhile ago, something that you didn't mention was that he has been deployed overseas, away from his family 4 1/2 years since this fight began in 2001, a significant sacrifice for his family, and in order for him to do the job that we have asked him to do. 
   He said he is keenly aware, personally as well as for the men and women that he leads, that the impact that multiple deployments have had, the impact of the 15-month deployment instead of the 12-month deployment is having on these troops. He said that they have answered the call every single time and have not yet one time blinked in the face of some incredible sacrifices and commitments that we are asking them to take on. 
   One of the problems that we face here stateside is that a remarkably small percentage of Americans have been directly involved in this fight. We have a little more than 4,000 families now  whose lives are forever changed as a result of that knock on the door saying that their loved one has been killed in action or killed in one of these two fights in Afghanistan or Iraq. We have 25,000 or so others wounded in some level of severity, some who have returned to the fight, and many who have life-altering circumstances that happened in the blink of the eye. None of them joined our services to get hurt like that; but they have, and they are now facing a different life, a different style of doing things than they ever contemplated before. 
   They also talked about the men and women who continue to sign up to serve their country. Men and women who know if you join our Army or our Marine Corps today, given this persistent war that we are going to be in, they will fight. This isn't your granddad's army. 
   This is an Army and a Marine Corps that will be asked to fight. 
   I marvel personally at the strength and resolve and resoluteness that these families exhibit. Individually they have made incredible sacrifices. I get a tiny, little glimpse of the anxiety when I go to Afghanistan and Iraq because of the concern and worry that Suzanne, my wife, has while I am away. You and I when we go are never in harm's way. So that helps me a little bit empathize with what the families back home go through 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when they have a loved one in harm's way. While the loved one in harm's way knows whether or not something scary is going on, the folks back home think it is happening all the time and they live in dread of something bad happening. 
   In the face of those sacrifices and commitments that we have asked them to make, they are standing tall and reenlisting in numbers that are appropriate, and new people are coming into the system in numbers that are sufficient to grow the Marine Corps as well as grow the Army which will help shift some of the burden, spread some of the burden out across a larger number of troops. 
   But I stand in awe of how magnificent these warrior families are, as well as their warriors, doing a job that their Commander-in-Chief has asked them to do and that their Nation has asked them to do, and a fight that I personally believe protects America's interests and also keeps us safer at home than we otherwise would have been.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, thank you for yielding me this time. Let me correct that record just a bit. I have got the area just west of Fort Hood. So I have got a lot of civilian contractors and retirees and active duty personnel who live in my district, but serve in Fort Hood.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Absolutely. I certainly would. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this time tonight. 
   I am opposed to this nonbinding resolution. This is a vehicle that the majority is using to bring us to this debate tonight. The resolution is pretty  simple in its language. It simply says that Congress disapproves of the decision President George W. Bush announced on January 10, 2007, to deploy more than 20,000 additional troops, U.S. combat troops to Iraq. It says this twice, in the preamble and then once again in the resolved. 
   It also says once that Congress and the American people will continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have bravely and honorably served in Iraq. We must assume, of course, that, because it is not stated, that Congress and the American people will also support and protect those additional troops that are headed into harm's way who will serve in Iraq, even though the resolution disapproves of the decision that sends those young men and women into harm's way. 
   The majority knows that this resolution will pass. They would not have brought it to the floor if their leadership had not be assured that they had the minimum 218 votes needed to pass this resolution. Since passage is assured, we have to ask, why this language? Why something so like this, that simply says what they are against, as opposed to something that is perhaps more meaningful, like what you are for. 
   It allows those who would vote in favor of this, and like I said I am quite confident it will pass, to set themselves up in that very enviable position to say I told you so if things do not go exactly as planned. And no plan in war has ever done that. So our colleagues who vote in favor of this resolution will be in that position to be able to say I told you so across a variety of circumstances. 
   I do not believe that either side of the aisle believes that it is the role of this or any other Congress to tell the President how not to deploy 20,000 troops. I believe there is another reason for this language. One explanation may be that it sets the stage for something that will really have an impact on the War in Iraq, the way that war is being fought, and I think that has to do with the power of the purse. 
   In spite of the language that says we will continue to support and protect our troops, I believe we will see in the not too distant future attempts by the majority to cut off funding for this war. I think we got a preview of this tactic last week when we passed the continuing resolution which cut $3.1 billion in spending for military quality of life projects and infrastructure that is needed to support the various BRAC decisions. 
   A lot has been made as to whether or not this debate will have an impact on the morale of our troops. Last week in a hearing with the Armed Services Committee, General Pace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told us, as well as Bob Gates, that this debate in and of itself will not directly hurt or harm the morale of the young men and women who are fighting this fight. 
   I think that is generous. But what Pace did tell us was that if this Congress begins to cut funding, cut financial support, begin to go back on the promises made to those young men and woman, that that will in fact have a deleterious impact on the troops' morale and their families who serve here. I think that the debate tonight and the next 4 days will have a direct impact on the families who support these young men and women, who allow them to do what they do on behalf of this country. 
   And that is certainly is regrettable, if that support is hurt and harmed, and that hurt and harm is then transmitted to our young men and women who are fighting this fight every single day. 
   I also do not believe it is the role of 535 independent contractors that make up the House and Senate to become five-star generals and make decisions on how to fight this fight or any other war. I do believe it is our job to look as far into the future as we can, and make decisions and then pass laws that lead this Nation. 
   I do not know of anyone who believes that a failure in Iraq is in our national interest. Both sides have been saying this. There are no good results for such a failure. General Petraeus has listed out a couple of the possibilities that he talks about. One is that sectarian groups would begin to stake out turf. This would generally involve ethnic cleansing. The humanitarian suffering that would go on while that was happening is totally unacceptable 
   He also mentions that international terrorist organizations might gain control of Iraq, and therefore use their bases in Iraq to further their interests. 
   The disruption to the oil markets and the impact that that will have not only on our economy but economies around the world would certainly occur if we have a failure in Iraq. 
   None of these guesses as to what would happen for failure in Iraq, that failure would almost automatically happen with an untimely withdrawal of our troops, none of them are positive, none of these scenarios make Iraq a safer place, none of them make the Middle East a safer place, and they certainly do not make America and the United States safer. 
   There are no guarantees, of course, that any plan will work. But telling the President what not to do is clearly not in the interest interests of moving this debate forward. My personal view of that future that I spoke about is that the effort in Iraq is a major part of the overall global war against Islamic Jihadists. Other Members have eloquently stated tonight that this war will last for decades. 
   I take very seriously the threats that the Islamic Jihadists have made and are making to kill Americans and to hurt American interests. I do not understand why they take these positions, but I certainly believe them when they tell us they are coming to hurt us. 
   This fight, this global war against Islamic Jihadists is really a fight for the heart of Islam. We must begin imploring moderate Muslims to stand against those few who seek to hijack the religion, and who are prosecuting this fight. 
   Let me preface my next remarks by saying that I am a Christian, and I believe that God is always in the business of changing men's hearts, and that the hearts of these Islamist Jihadists can be changed by the God I serve. But short of that, I believe we have only two choices, either we lock these people up forever or we kill them. 
   That is pretty harsh for a Christian to say, but those are our only options. I don't believe we can compromise with them and I don't believe they will compromise with us. I don't believe that they will alter their beliefs to peacefully coexist with us. 
   So we are in a fight that will last for years and for decades. There is no guarantee as to how this fight is being prosecuted and how we win this fight, I just know that we cannot lose it. And this resolution tonight does not move that process forward in a positive way. 
   We are in a long and hard struggle to protect freedom and liberty here and around the world. We are blessed by men and women who are willing to risk everything to defend you and me every minute of every day. 
   This resolution does not help in that struggle. And I urge my colleagues to vote against it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I appreciate the gentleman for yielding me time. 
   I want to set the record straight, or at least set a record that says I have complete trust in the chairman of the Ag Committee. COLLIN PETERSON is an honorable man, and when he makes commitments, I think he intends fully to make those commitments. 
   I think we're under a circumstance where he was not allowed to make a commitment that, were it his decision  alone, that we would have a resolution of this issue that would be satisfactory I think across the spectrum. 
   I'm a CPA, as is my good colleague from Minnesota, my chairman. One of the things you look for as an auditor in financial statements is consistent application of accounting rules. 
   I want to congratulate this Rules Committee on consistently applying their position of having closed rules on everything of importance that comes down here. It's as if every bill that comes out of the Speaker's office is perfect, and I would argue that no one in their right mind thinks every bill that passes this House, whether it's a Republican bill or a Democrat bill, is perfect. 
   There should be the opportunity to say here's an area in a bill that needs further work. I don't think anybody on the other side of this aisle would say this is the perfect fix to the commodities futures market; it's the perfect fix to make sure that the only thing going on in these futures markets is price discovery, and once this is passed and signed by the President we will never have another problem with it. I don't think anybody's arguing that. 
   So it's twisted, in my view, to say on the one hand, well, it's not a perfect bill and it could be improved, there could be some issues be addressed, and one I'd like to talk about in a second. And yet this Rules Committee, dominated by the Speaker I believe, Madam Speaker, is consistently applying the closed rule concept that prevents other voices, whether they're Republican or Democrat, to come to this floor and say I might have a little bit better idea or better take on something, the will of the House will happen, but let my voice be heard. 
   The process yesterday on this bill that came forth was anything but open. It was very quick. They've not laid a predicate for why it needs to be instantly done today, why we couldn't have been allowed an opportunity to present a motion that would have said we need hedgers in the markets, in this commodity futures trading arena, in order to make this thing work. 
   One of the risks of this bill is that it will exclude traditional hedging operators from being able to provide hedging services to small businesses. Putting these hedge positions in place, if you're a long commodity, is expensive, and you need size and volume to get the transaction costs down. So there's an arena of folks in the market who provide these services on behalf of folks who need to hedge. I think this bill overreaches in its attempt to make sure we don't have undue speculation in the market. 
   That's simply what I'm trying to do, and I've got I think a commitment from the chairman to work on this. I visited with him last night, and I believe he is sincere when he said he wanted to keep this commitment that he and I made on this floor back in the end of July to address this issue. 
   This isn't a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an issue that we all should be able to have an independent view on. 
   The previous speaker mentioned the fact that I voted for the bill, and she's absolutely correct. But I voted for the bill because I made a commitment. I made a commitment with my chairman that said, Madam Speaker, if you will work with me on this, then I will vote for this bill. And so I put my green vote up that afternoon, and I can assure you I had no shortage of the 151 Republicans who voted against this bill come to me and say, CONAWAY, have you lost your mind? What are you doing? This is not a normal position that you would take. And I said, Well, I made a commitment to the chairman that I would support working forward in this bill as it moved through the process, either through a conference report or whatever, to address the issues that I'm concerned about, and I committed to him that I was going to vote for it. I kept my commitment. 
   And I don't think the chairman was allowed to keep the commitment he made back to me, and that's an unfortunate circumstance, because we only have our word in this arena, and I believe he kept his word as best he could, but I don't think the Speaker and the dominated Rules Committee allowed him to do something that he should have been able to do and I should have been able to make an amendment here to say here's what I think is going on, have the discussion, have the folks who disagree with me come down here and talk about that. That's the way the system is supposed to work. Certainly the way that every high school civics class in the world would argue that the way this floor works is you have an idea and you have folks for it and folks against it and you come down here and challenge it. 
   This closed rule one more time, consistently applied by this dominated Rules Committee, is wrong. It's just not the way to do it. There is no immediate urgency that we've got to get this passed today or tomorrow. It could have come on the agenda tomorrow, and we would have had time to bring this amendment down here. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this rule and against this bill. The process is flawed. It does nothing to support energy production in this country, nor will it work.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the ranking member. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think to the other Members in the House listening to this debate this sounds like a school yard kind of struggle: Yes, you are; no, you're not; yes, you are; no, you're not. We are back and forth. We are both using the same set of facts. 
   But the truth of the matter is, in 2011 and 2012, however it happens, under the current code the revenues of the government will go up $400 billion. The rhetoric on the other side of the aisle that this does not represent a tax increase would have a lot greater credibility with me and those on our side of the aisle if in fact our colleagues on the Budget Committee hadn't spent that $400 billion. 
   The chairman mentioned earlier about waiting until December 31, 2011, to fix these things. The problem with that is that at the end of 2010, maybe that is the date he was referencing, the estate tax goes from a zero tax rate to a 55 percent tax rate. 
   I spent a career helping folks comply with a very complex code, and estate planning requires generally a lot longer period of time to react and put plans in place than from one year to the next. So, to keep estates out there hung up with the idea that the tax is going to come back fully at 55 percent, I think is unfair. 
   The other thing that has to be said is that all of the tax increases go in fully. So the 33 percent bracket goes to a 39.6 percent bracket. If in fact the Democrats do want to protect the 10 percent bracket from going to 15 percent, as they have said, they are going to have to raise taxes on the top brackets. They are going to have to raise taxes in other places in order to stay within this bill's definition of PAYGO. 
   So I am going to speak in favor of the motion to instruct, but just for full and fair disclosure, I voted twice, since we did vote on this bill twice, against the Democrats' budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (RESPONSIBLE FEDERAL OIL AND GAS LEASE ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. My first reaction to reading this bill was how could 236 Members of Congress on the Democratic side, their legions of staff, and their hired guns, know so little about a fundamental industry like we've got that they would think that these exploration companies would invest millions and, in some instances, billions of dollars of shareholder equity and debt and lease bonus payments, regulatory compliance and bureaucratic compliance costs, geological and geophysical  costs, drilling and exploration expenditures, production facilities, to then sit on these generally unsalvageable investments and not produce oil and natural gas, which is the only way to recover these investments and make a profit. 
   This chart, Mr. Speaker, shows a 14-year timeline of the typical exploration in the Gulf of Mexico. It is a difficult process to get through. There are some 27 bureaucratic steps that we go through. This legislation today will add another ongoing step that these companies will have to comply with. 
   My colleagues here on the other side of the aisle know this discourages exploration. It fits in with their overall attempt to continue to keep gasoline prices high. It is one more dagger in the heart of the American lifestyle that has been developed since World War II that has centered on reasonable gasoline. 
   Defeat this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Well, I thank my classmate from Georgia for hosting this hour tonight. 
   We spend an awful lot of time at these microphones, both sides, basically talking past each other. Usually, the rhetoric is heated, and we don't listen. My experience is this is the worst 435 listeners on the face of the Earth because we are clearly more interested in hearing what I have got to say than listening to what you have got to say. 
   It happens time and time and time again at these microphones, basically because we tend to polarize and take the absolute positions, knowing full well that the best path for America is somewhere in the middle. 
   The best path for America includes working all the other alternatives and trying to develop those and trying to see as far over the horizon as we can for a day in which crude oil and natural gas will no longer be available, not by choice but by the fact it has all been used up. It is a finite resource. We should be conserving everywhere we get, not on an individual basis but collective as well. 
   Yes, from our position, we should be exploring and developing and producing American resources; crude oil, natural gas, uranium, nuclear, oil shale, tar sands, the full gamut of these resources. 
   So if we can actually spend some time and sit together and try to work out our differences, I think there is a solution here that is really best for America. 
   When I first read the ``use it or lose it'' bill, my first reaction was how can 236 of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and all of their staffs and all of their hired consultants know so little about a fundamental industry that is so vital to our national security, our economic security, and that is the oil business. Then I came to the cynical conclusion that I was wrong; they do know about it. 
   They do know exactly what they are doing by this bill that was up earlier today on a suspension calendar that we were able to defeat because over a third of us said that is wrong-headed. 
   Here's a quick basic. When an oil and gas oil company, generally a major oil company because it requires so much money, leases in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have been drilling for a long, long time, they pay a lease bonus, which is a sizable amount of money that is given to the Federal Government, that says for a time certain I get exclusive rights to explore and try to find crude oil and natural gas on this particular parcel of land. That bonus money is a sunk cost because if they find oil, they get to produce it. If they don't find oil, too bad. 
   This industry, much maligned from these microphones, is a group of dedicated, hardworking, patriotic, honest people who have an incredible tolerance for risk in this environment. 
   So they put up the lease bonus money, sometimes millions and millions of dollars, just for the right to wade into the bureaucratic morass that we have created around these circumstances, where you have got 27 permits and all kinds of stuff to get to just until you get to start the process. The process includes geological studies, geophysical studies, evaluation to try to find where on that parcel of land the best spot may be. You have got sunk costs, regulatory compliance costs. 
   Then, once you have decided where you are going to drill, that you decided that you think there are commercial reserves in place under that dirt, under that ocean, then you still don't know it until you drill it. Then you have got the cost of drilling, all the expense there. Then, if you find commercial quantities of crude oil, you have to build a production platform that has got to be uniquely built for the particular formation you have got, and that has got to be moved out into the gulf and anchored. 
   So what you have is many millions and millions, in some instances, billions of dollars of shareholder equity and debt that's been invested in trying to find crude oil and natural gas. Most of that is sunk cost. The only way they get a return on their investment, the only way they justify to their shareholders that they are making the right decision is to produce whatever crude oil and natural gas is in place. 
   So there are plenty of incentives already built in to produce. The idea that they would ``sit'' on production in the hopes that this price gets even higher, which they know the price is too high now, is just wrong-headed.

   Mr. CONAWAY. The traditional offshore lease needs to be at least 10 years because from start to finish--we have got some graphs here that we can show you the logical, businesslike progression that companies have to walk down. What is not mentioned so far is all the litigation costs that are associated with these leases, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. If a company is able to win a lease, they are immediately sued by environmentalists to prevent their exploring for it. This current price of gasoline and crude oil is a product of supply and demand.     
   About 86 million barrels a day of production, about 85 million barrels a day of usage, and that varies from day-to-day. Inventories start dropping. That means demand has gone beyond the current production supply. 
   The most immediate area for quick relief in this regard would be Iraq. The Iraqi government has recently reached out to ExxonMobil, Shell, BP and Chevron to ask them, ask the experts, the folks who have the money to be able to do it, to come into Iraq and help them increase the amount of production that Iraq produces from oil and gas. They are about half of what they were under the Shah. And their fields are on land and the most quickly responsive to getting new oil and gas supplies to the market.

   It's interesting that, if you look at this bill, which I intend to vote for, what it basically does is it points a finger in the face of the commodities future trading corporation and very sternly and mean-eyed says: Do your job. Great. 
   They're doing their job. As a matter of fact, I'm sure it's already been mentioned on the floor this afternoon that we had the acting chairman of the CFTC in front of the Ag Committee this week, and he reported that he is, in fact, doing his job, that he looks for every day manipulation in the oil market. He looks every day for undue impact by speculators on swaps in the market. 
   And to the best of their ability and their economists' estimation, the price of crude oil is currently fundamentally set by laws of supply and demand, and that while they are not able to find any evidence of it, they look for that evidence or look for manipulation and undue influence of speculators in the market every single day. 
   I want to thank the chairman for doing his good work on that committee. I know that he will take this stern advice to continue to do his job to heart.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I take this opportunity tonight to point out one more time one of the quirks of the rules that we operate under. 
   We have heard over the last 2 days many of my colleagues come to these microphones and propose reductions in spending in this particular area of the Federal budget, very eloquent, very passioned, to try to reduce this spending. 
   But the harsh reality is, should any of those amendments have passed or should any of the ones that we're about to vote on pass, the reality is that that spending does not, in fact, get cut out of this budget. This spending would simply be spent in conference and would not reduce the deficit or, should we ever get to that point, increase the surplus. 
   So my amendment would simply state the sense that instead of continuing the practice, the age-old practice of spending whatever is in 302(b) allocation, whether it's warranted or not, we would actually take an opportunity to reduce spending which I think folks on both sides of the aisle, many people on both sides of the aisle would say is arguably one of the things that we ought to be doing and studying. 
   This is not a revolutionary position to take, but it's one in which I think it makes sense. Most folks in Texas in District 11 would clearly understand the intent of what I'm trying to do. In fact, it would come as a shock to them to know that if we found 218 votes to adopt the 1 percent cut or the half a percent cut or the 25-basis point cut, that all of that hard work would be for naught and that that money would still get spent. 
   So I understand there's a point of order that lies against this. I will not push for a ruling from the Chair. I just wanted to simply take the opportunity tonight to point out to my colleagues that we need to change the rules. We need to change the way we operate in this House, and this would be one of those that we ought to seriously consider doing so that the will of the House could operate to actually change spending if that were, in fact, the case.  
   So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this opportunity to say this tonight, and I will not push the point of order. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good colleague from Arkansas for assisting and allowing me to speak tonight. 
   Mr. Speaker, over the next 3 or 4 days, a partisan tone will be exhibited in these Chambers, harsh rhetoric will be exchanged on both sides, some of it intentional, some of it in the heat of the moment, some of it out of simple frustration with not being able to convince ourselves of issues that are going on, but nevertheless, partisanship that is communicated back to America and America's despair that we will ever get past this partisanship. 
   Is there some way for us to listen to you and you listen to me and let us thoughtfully consider our positions and then make those compromises that have to be made in order to deal with the issues that face this country? 
   It is not brand new. Two hundred twenty-one years ago, Benjamin Franklin observed the same partisanship, the same ugly tone going back and forth and came upon a solution that he communicated to President Washington in a letter. And I would like to read some of that letter into the Record tonight, because that solution I think would stand us in good stead as well. 
   Reading from Benjamin Franklin's letter to George Washington: 
   ``In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark to find political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us, how is it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to the Father of lights to illuminate our understandings. 
   ``And have we now forgotten that powerful Friend? Or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance? I have lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without His notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without His aid? We have been assured, Sir, the sacred writings, that `except the Lord build the House they labor in vain that build it.' 
   ``I firmly believe this, and I also believe without His concurring aid we shall succeed in this partial building no better than the builders of Babel. We shall be divided by our little partial local interests; our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become a reproach and bye word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind may hereafter from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing Governments by human wisdom and leave it to chance, war and conquest. 
   ``I therefore beg leave to move that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of Heaven and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this Assembly every morning before we proceed to business, and that one or more of the Clergy of this City be requested to officiate in that Service.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, we observe that tradition today. Every morning our House Chaplain and maybe one of our constituents from back home will come and pray and seek God's wisdom on our deliberations. As effective as that is, Mr. Speaker, I would argue that 435 members of this House observing that tradition of daily seeking out the plea that Solomon had in II Chronicles 1:10 in which he asked God for wisdom and knowledge that he might govern this great people, that 435 of us and 100 on the other end of this building, on our knees every day, seeking wisdom, guidance and knowledge as how we would reduce the partisanship, how we would try to strive valiantly to come to conclusions and compromise with each other that deal with the problems that face this country.  
   Our constituents are crying out for it. None of us go home that we don't come across somebody who has asked, why do you constantly argue with each other and fuss and fight? Get something done. 
   Benjamin Franklin knew a solution 221 years ago, Mr. Speaker. I would argue that that solution is more powerful today, and it is clearly more needed today by this body than even 210 years ago.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (BONNIE RICHARDSON, A CHAMPION IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD -- (House of Representatives - June 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, Heywood Broun, a renowned sportswriter and life-long champion of the underdog, once said that ``Sports do not build character, they reveal it.'' I've heard it before, but today I finally understand it thanks to Rochelle High School junior Bonnie Richardson. 
   On the weekend of May 9 and 10 this year, high school athletes from all across Texas gathered for the State track and field championship. At the meet, athletes compete for two honors, for success in each event as individuals and for the State championship as a team. 
   With Bonnie Richardson as a sole member of the Rochelle High School Lady Hornets to qualify for the meet, the Lady Hornets were the ultimate underdog to win a team trophy. Yet, after medaling in all five of her events--winning two golds, two silvers and a bronze--Bonnie found herself in an unlikely position, standing atop the podium to accept the girl's Class 1A team trophy. Her five individual medals earned her 42 points, more than any other school in her team's class. She also wrote herself into the Texas Track and Field history books as the only female ever to win a State team championship without the help of teammates. 
   While Bonnie's accomplishment defines the word ``exceptional,'' the depth of her character is not revealed in her medals or trophies, but in her attitude. Even as her story has been transmitted around the world and back again, her comments reflect a young woman with poise beyond her years. In every article and in every quote, Bonnie has been very gracious to her competitors and modest in her unparalleled achievement. 
   In an era where athletes' behavior and attitudes can be more infamous than celebrated, Bonnie's self-effacing demeanor shows us how sportsmanship should be practiced. I am amazed by Bonnie's athletic prowess, but I am humbled by her easy and free manner in which she praises her opponents, remains grateful for her gifts, and uplifts those around her. Although such an attitude may seem routine to her, a lifetime has taught me that character like hers is not as common as we would all wish. 
   Bonnie's quiet confidence extends beyond her abilities in track and field. She is a well-rounded athlete who is an all-state basketball player and an accomplished tennis player. In addition, she is in the running to be named her class valedictorian. It is clear to me that her attitude is an asset in all she undertakes. 
   It is an honor to represent Bonnie and all the students like her across the 11th District of Texas. As she prepares for her senior year, and as her national notoriety begins to wane, I wish her luck in returning to her version of business as usual--excelling at everything--and success in the upcoming season and beyond.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (IN HONOR OF THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST. JOSEPH'S CHURCH -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with my colleagues a small story from a small corner of America called Rowena, Texas. 
   The 20th century began with a tremendous movement of people to west Texas in search of good land, opportunity and prosperity. Among these intrepid travelers were many Czech and German Americans whose forefathers had come to Texas to farm, ply trades and create better lives. Their descendants found these lives in Rowena. 
   In 1906, four Rowena Catholics, William Glass, Mike Feist, Frank Schwertner and John Jansa, sought to erect a church to serve their community and better practice their faith. After a year of toil, the church opened and celebrated its first mass, a wedding, on November 20, 1907. The church was aptly dedicated to St. Joseph, the patron of immigrants, families and working people. 
   St. Joseph's grew rapidly during its early years, reflecting its growing significance in the community. In 1916, the church opened St. Joseph's School, with the Sisters of the Divine Providence serving as teachers. And in 1924, a new church in the gothic style was dedicated, and the annual fall festival was begun to support the church. To this day, the gothic church still stands, and the fall festival is still celebrated each year. 
   Soon the church began to host community-service organizations and social clubs as well. The Knights of Columbus, St. Ann's Altar Society, Catholic Daughters of America, the KJT, KJZT and the Immaculate Conception Society would all call the church home through the coming decades. 
   The Great Depression and World War II would see an especially important role for St. Joseph's and its parish organizations to play as they led their rural community through troubling times. 
   As the church aged in the 1950s and in the 1960s, it prospered. It marked its 50th anniversary in 1957, and a new community space was constructed in 1961. And all the while, the high school continued to educate and graduate the youth of Rowena. 
   Unfortunately, as with all institutions, the church inevitably faced a period of decline. As the small town of Rowena began to lose population, difficult times ensued for the church. The parish school finally closed in the late 1970s, and church membership shrunk. 
   Shaken by these developments, the parish renewed its commitment to the sacraments, its members and its community. They reestablished religious instruction, revitalized their parish organizations, and moved into the modern age. Today, St. Joseph's is fittingly led by another immigrant, Father Bhaskar Morugudi from India. 
   2007 marks St. Joseph's centennial celebration. The belief of four men led to the creation of the parish, but it took the faith of a community to sustain it. Throughout the last 100 years, St. Joseph's has been the rock for the people of Rowena. It has educated their children, guided them through trouble and saved their souls. 
   As the parishioners of St. Joseph's look to the future, I urge them to remember the rich history that lies in their past. The legacy of their founders created in Rowena through service, education and salvation is inspiring. The church is woven into the threads of Rowena itself and highlights the history of America herself, and I feel privileged to share this story with you all. 
   No matter who we are or where we're from, we can all find common ground in the story of St. Joseph's parish. It is a story of individuals seeking and creating a better life for themselves and their descendants, and of a people of deep devotion seeking to practice their beliefs and enrich their community. We should all strive to be so noble in our ambitions and generous in our spirits. 
   Today I celebrate and honor the parishioners of St. Joseph's in Rowena, Texas as they reflect on the past and embark on another 100 years of ministry and service.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chair, I want to speak against this Progressive Caucus budget in the strongest terms available. 
   Over the last couple of weeks, I have somewhat tongue in cheek talked about when the Defeat in Iraq Caucus and when the Defeat in Afghanistan Caucus get their way that it won't be long before they declare a defeat dividend. 
   As you recall in the 1990s when the Soviet Union failed, this Chamber and others declared a peace dividend. They took money that would have otherwise  supported our troops in the fight and spent it somewhere else. 
   I thought it would take until the defeat actually occurred, but I come today and find that the Progressive Caucus has already declared a $781 billion defeat dividend. 
   We have men and women in harm's way right now giving their lives for this country. Whether you agree with it or not, that is what they are doing. Where was this group last week when they said let's keep them in the fight for 17 more months? Why did you stand up and say that was okay and yet call what they are doing the single largest waste of taxpayer money in American history? You cannot have it both ways. 
   Vote your convictions. Get them out of Iraq now. That is a legitimate position to defend. But to say we are going to keep them there for 17 more months, strip them of $781 billion in flak jackets and up-armored Humvees and all of the things you would take away from them is simply unfair and unconscionable. 
   I encourage my fellow colleagues to vote against this Progressive Caucus budget over and over. This is wrongheaded. It is not the way to lead this country. It sends a terrible message to our soldiers in the Armed Forces who are fighting this fight on our behalf.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, we are all anticipating the report David Petraeus will bring us in mid-September. But between now and then, there is hard work, dangerous work, and important work that has to be done. 
   For Members on the other side of the aisle to begin to anticipate what David may say to us and to plan political spinning of that is irresponsible. 
   Mr. Speaker, that is the ``ready, fire, aim'' approach to taking a position. That works well in a target-rich environment like the Alamo or Little Bighorn, but it is unworthy of Members of this body. 
   Let's don't anticipate what David might say. Let's don't undermine that work that is going on in Iraq. Let's take the responsible position and listen to what he has to say before we try to spin it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONGRATULATING THE HOWARD PAYNE LADY JACKETS BASKETBALL TEAM ON THEIR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AND PERFECT SEASON -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Howard Payne University Lady Jackets on their 2008 NCAA Division III Women's Basketball National Championship. In this, their fourth consecutive appearance in the tournament, the Lady Jackets defeated the Messiah University Falcons 68-54. Winning the National Championship was a fitting end to an unbelievable season for this rising basketball powerhouse. From day one the women of the Lady Jackets unwaveringly pursued excellence, and in the end they achieved perfection. The Lady Jackets finished with a record of 33-0, the only perfect record of any of the 3,823 men's and women's collegiate basketball teams in this country. 
   Located in Brownwood, Texas, Howard Payne University is a small school of 1,400 students that I am honored to represent. As Division III athletes, the members of the Lady Jackets team receive no scholarships or lucrative contracts for their collegiate exploits. Rather, these women play for the thrill of competition and the glory of their achievements. Every minute of every team practice, at every meeting, and every game is endured for the love of basketball. 
   I am proud to commend the Lady Jackets today, not only for their victories but also for their dedication to their sport and to each other in the drive to be the best. It is my great pleasure to extend my personal congratulations to team members Tiffany Warner, Katy Sarem, Stephanie Brewer, Mionca Hall, Daphnie Pippins, Kimberly Hoffman, Makiesha Davis, Meia Daniels, Elaine Hobbs, Stacey Blalock, Hope Hohertz, Sarah Pfiester, and Sarah Jockers on their remarkable accomplishments. 
   I'd also like to congratulate coaches Mr. Chris Kielsmeier and Ms. Lindy Hatfield, who coached this year's team. This season belongs to them as well. While a coach's devotion to their team is often displayed simply in the wins column, this perfect season speaks volumes about Mr. Kielsmeier and Ms. Hatfield's ability to bring out the very best of their players and nurture the talents of their team. 
   Mr. Speaker, hallowed as these walls that we work in are, we rarely have an opportunity to witness perfection, that which cannot be improved upon. Lest we forget what such accomplishments look like, the women of the Lady Jackets have reminded us that there are rare moments in time when imperfect individuals can work together to achieve perfect results. I hope that by taking time to celebrate these small moments we can remind ourselves the importance of working together to achieve success. 
   And, again, Lady Jackets, congratulations on a very unforgettable season.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, we come to the House tonight to talk about a variety of things, most of which we will deal with taxes and the impact those taxes have on good, hardworking men and women across this country. 
   But I did want to respond just a little bit to what the previous speaker bragged about. She went through a long litany of good things that happened this weekend, which I certainly agree with everyone's right to do what they did and to express themselves and to come to this Capitol and make those statements. 
   She did leave out one minor issue, though, and that is that some of the antiwar protestors brought spray paint with them. And they came to this Capitol, this hallowed ground, the center of liberty for the world, which looks to this Capitol building for that; and those folks brought spray paint, and they painted the walls. They spray painted anarchy signs and anarchy slogans on the walls of this Capitol, which I think defacing public property under any circumstance ought to be wrong. That is wrong. 
   What else is wrong is the fact that the Capitol Hill Police were told to allow that conduct to go on. And there were reports in one of the scandal rags today that the police's reaction to that was that they were disgusted. They were livid about the fact that they were forced to allow these anarchists to deface this public property, this building, which all of us serve in. Most of us serve very proudly here. 
   So not all of the folks who came this weekend conducted themselves the way that they should have, and there was a problem with that. And, hopefully, we will learn what the responsibility of the Democratic leadership was, what their role was in overriding what the Capitol Hill Police's natural and normal reaction would have been. Where did that come from and who told them not to stop that? We hope that we get some answers to those questions over the next coming days, because it is a serious issue when people are allowed to deface this building. 
   But let us talk about taxes. As our sign shows here, we are 1,433 days away from a staggeringly large tax increase. The first year I think it will be $250 billion of taxes. In 2011, we will get an immediate bump. The Democrats simply have to do nothing. 
   In the 109th Congress, Lou Dobbs and others accused us of being a ``do-nothing Congress.'' Well, you can put that label on the coming tax increase, because the Democrats simply have to do nothing over the next 4 years, and that is exactly what is going to happen. 
   Built into the current law, the current Tax Code has a drop-dead date of December 31, 2010, in which the changes made to the estate tax will expire and the other provisions of the 2001/2003 tax reductions will also expire. So if the Democrats do nothing, then we are 1,433 days away from that major increase. We are only 11 days since the last tax increase by the Democrats. And that was on Thursday a week or so ago where they increased taxes on the oil and gas business in this country, and we have talked about that some as well.     
   We are going to have several speakers tonight, and the first one that we are going to yield time to is my good colleague, John Sullivan from Oklahoma.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman mentioned a couple of things that I would like to flush out. You mentioned the phrase ``Big Oil.'' It is used as a pejorative, of course. But under the Democrats' H.R. 6 they passed 11 days ago, Big Oil is defined as any C corporation exploring for oil and gas, any C corp. That includes ExxonMobil, all the way down to the smallest C corp, and that is tax phrase, for those out there that might be listening. But it is any C corp that has now got a tax rate that went from 32 to 35 percent, if this H.R. 6 sees the light of day from the Senate, and with the President signing it. So Big Oil includes a lot of folks, hardworking men and women who try to make a living in the oil business. 
   When I ran for Congress 3 years ago, I ran under the idea that being a CPA, being a business man, that that viewpoint was underrepresented in Congress. I did not have any empirical data to substantiate that, but it seemed to be the case. And once I got here, though, I had discovered that there are an awful lot of our colleagues who really do not understand how hard it is to make money, that finding a product that you can sell to somebody else, and having bought or built that product for less than what you sell it for, and all of those kinds of things that go into making money is hard to do. 
   There are an awful lot of our colleagues who simply do not appreciate how hard that really is. So when they talk about tax increases or taking money away from hardworking folks, they do not understand the impact that that has. 
   One of the other things you mentioned, and you and I share districts where oil and gas are a major piece of the business, is how rugged and resilient and self-reliant these oil and gas guys are. We hit them with a tax increase 11 days ago. One of the things we talked about in the lead up to the debate to try to convince our colleagues on our side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle that this was not really a good idea is this idea that if you reduce the amount of money that is going into increases in domestic production, then you will lower domestic production. 
   I think everybody agrees on that we ought to be less dependent on foreign oil and foreign natural gas. That phrase rolls off every tongue in this Chamber. The truth of the matter is from where we are today to that point is a decade-long journey. And that decade-long journey is going to be driven with cars and trains and airplanes using fossil fuels. 
   So to the extent that we can increase domestic production, it seems to me logical that that would reduce the amount of foreign crude that we would have to import. And while it is difficult to exactly understand what the impact will be on those oil and gas C corporations with this tax increase they got 11 days ago, logic will tell you, if you spend less money in the exploration for crude oil and natural gas domestically, you will get less of it. That is just the mechanics. I think that is a pretty easy thing to say. 
   I appreciate my colleague coming here tonight from Oklahoma, sharing with us his thoughts on tax increases. I would now like to recognize my colleague from Pennsylvania who is actually the moving force behind these weekly hours. It is my pleasure this week to replacing him here in the well, but Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania has got some thoughts.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, my sense from being around for a little better than 2 years now is that the reaction that was forced upon the Capitol Hill Police went against their nature. Their nature is to protect, not only to protect you and I and any other law-abiding citizen on these grounds, which is their job, but to protect these grounds as well. So it is inconceivable to me that our Capitol Hill Police, whose natural, normal reaction would be to stand back and let those spray-painters have at it, at the walls of this Capitol building. They had to have gotten some instructions from somewhere. And given the comments reflected in the paper today, that is clearly the case. They were told to stand down and not protect this building as is their nature and their love. 
   These folks love their job and do a great job at it. And so I agree with my colleague.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me make a comment if I could on something that you had said. You talked about what hardworking Americans do with the money that they earn and keep; and you went through a litany of things that they buy, washers and dryers, cars and all these kinds of stuff. If you think about it, though, everything that they bought is made by somebody; and that person made a living making whatever it is they made. 
   Then there is also a good string of, for lack of a better phrase, middlemen in between that product being made and it being sold to the American consumer, which is the ultimate driver of this economy. You have got truck drivers and warehousemen and storage handlers and retailers and a long list of people who take that finished product from wherever it is made, even if it is made overseas, from wherever it is made, and they get it all the way to that retailer's shelf, where an American consumer takes that money that he or she earned themselves and they go buy that product. 
   That starts the cycle all over again that has built a growing economy that is now in its fourth year of growth; and if you look at the CBO estimates that the Budget Committee will talk about tomorrow, that growth is expected to continue over the next 10 years. 
   Now, 10 years is about as far as we project anything. And like I said, I am a CPA, and I have been dealing with projections for a long time. Quite frankly, years 5 on through 10 are just mathematical exercises. I mean, who knows whether or not those are going to be correct or not? The 2007 estimate is pretty good. The 2008 estimate is pretty good. But, beyond that, it gets a little fuzzy as to the accuracy of those projections. But, nonetheless, those projections show an improving economy. 
   Not only that, but the Federal Reserve as well shows an improving economy; and that is because people are out buying things, furnishing homes, buying cars, all the kinds of things the American consumer does to continue to drive this economy. 
   The Federal Government, the best thing we can do is get out of the way. And one of the best things we can get out of the way of are tax increases, and there is a big one coming. 
   You know there is a phrase out there, if a violent jihadist threatens your life, you probably ought to take him serious. Well, I think the same thing applies to tax increases. If somebody  threatens you with a tax increase, then I think you ought to take them serious. And we are 1,433 days away from a significant tax increase. 
   I now want to go to my good colleague from Kentucky. GEOFF and I are in the same class. The 109th Congress was our first time here. And Geoff has got a big family, which in and of itself contributes to the economy, we appreciate that, of your part of Kentucky as well the rest of the United States. So, GEOFF, share with us tonight what your thoughts are on taxes and the American people working.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I appreciate my colleague from Kentucky joining us tonight to have this conversation among the several of us. 
   I served on the Chamber of Commerce board in Midland for a number of years, and one of the things that the chamber looks at is the impact that payroll has on a community. There is a difference of opinion among folks on the chambers as to what this number ought to be, but there is a guess as to how many times that payroll turns over in a community. In other words, when the payroll is made, it is spent on local goods and services, and that person then turns around and spends it on local goods and services, and the range is, for most economic development guys, is between four times to seven times. Depending on the number you want to brag on, it will be somewhere in that range. 
   So the payroll that gets created that my colleague from Kentucky was talking about a while ago where these small businesses add employees turns over several times within the community and creates additional jobs, additional opportunities and additional prosperity for those folks. 
   It is interesting, I had a conversation this afternoon with my staff, and we are all anxiously awaiting the continuing resolution from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Chairman Obey of the Appropriations Committee posted on his Web site this afternoon that they did in fact file the continuing resolution. And my staff called, and we went to the Web site. They said it was  filed. And me and my staff did. Of course, nothing is there. 
   So my staff called over there and asked and they got kind of a runaround. So I said, well, I will just call. So I called, and I said, hi, this is Congressman Mike Conaway, and I would like to see a copy of the continuing resolution that has been filed. 
   And the lady said, well, it has not been filed. 
   I said, well, I am looking at a Web site for the Appropriations Committee, and it says they have filed. 
   She said, well, I know. I am not sure why that is up there, but. 
   I said, well, am I getting the runaround here? Is it really up there or not? 
   She said, no, that is a mistake. It hasn't been filed. 
   So, anyway, we are all awaiting the continuing resolution. 
   In the meantime, we are all trying to guess at what might happen. And over at the Social Security Administration they are concerned about furloughing employees because the continuing resolution that they thought might be in place will fund them at lower levels than they have been expecting and so that they are going to have to lay off employees.

   Mr. CONAWAY. And my good colleague has added to the list of folks that are going to be impacted by this reduced cash flow to these agencies. Think about that for a second. That is what we are talking about, over at the Social Security Administration, at the FBI and other places that Geoff has talked about. It simply reduced cash flow to those agencies; and, because there is a reduction in cash flow, they are reducing mission, they are laying people off, they are doing less service. The Social Security folks won't have as many people to service all those callers out there. 
   That is exactly what happens in small businesses when we reduce their cash flow by tax increases. Because money that would otherwise go into making payrolls and paying benefits and adding folks to the payrolls is now coming into these Federal Government's coffers being spent in ways that, for the most part, I suspect they are good, but there is an awful lot of waste in there. And, clearly, our taxpayers out there can spend their own dollars better than we can on their behalf.     
   Now, subsequent to my conversation with my staffer, we have gotten a rumor. And again in the minority we get to whine all the time. It is just going to be our job over the next 2 years, just to be very good whiners. It is not in our nature, it is very unlike us to do it, so we will probably do it very poorly. But we don't know what is going on over there. It has been days and days and days. These folks knew they had the reins of this thing starting January 4; they knew that on November 8. And we have had now over 2 months that they knew that this was going to be the circumstance, that they were going to be dealing with the continuing resolution, and we have no resolution to the continuing resolution. And I am sure there are good reasons on their side of the aisle for why they have not been able to make these decisions, but surely these decisions are not going to involve some of the draconian nonsense that many of our agencies are worried about, and they are worried about it because they don't have the facts. Most folks deal real well with facts. What we don't deal well with is uncertainty, innuendoes, and rumors. 
   So I would encourage our folks on the other side of the aisle to get that CR done if you are going to do it. If not, then let's start bringing appropriations bills to the floor. There is nothing wrong with that. That is a nice way to do it. We should be legitimately criticized because we didn't get it done under our watch, but that same criticism now applies to the folks in charge. It doesn't matter, just get on or off the pot, as they say. Bring a CR to the floor, show us what it is; if you are hiding stuff, give us a second to try to find that out. Or let's go at it from the appropriations standpoint and bring those to the floor one at a time, as we should have.

It will be their definition of an earmark, and it will be interesting to see which earmarks really get zeroed out and which ones don't and how they parse that definition between the two in order to keep the ones they want and peel out the ones that they think are wasteful spending, and it will be interesting where those earmarks impact and which districts are the ones that really get peeled out.

   Mr. CONAWAY. It is not likely that this continuing resolution will go through committee either. It is just going to get dropped on us like a laser-guided bomb, rushed straight to the floor, not going to go through committee, not going to have the openness and the transparency and the 48 hours and all the kinds of things that our good colleagues on the other side of the aisle promised in October. 
   Promises in October are hard to keep in January, and we are seeing it, and we will continue to try to point that out without seeming as whiny as it sounds, I suspect, to my colleagues and my constituents in west Texas. But that is going to be part of our role over the next 2 years, is to be the loyal opposition, to try to do so in a respectful manner as we point out promises made and promises broken by folks on the other side of the aisle.  
   Does my colleague from Kentucky have some other thoughts?

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank you. 
   Let's go to another colleague of ours from Georgia. Dr. PHIL GINGREY is an OB/GYN doctor, a provider of professional services for most of his career. And while all of us have great respect for physicians, at their core they run small businesses and maybe big businesses. But at its core the practice of medicine has to be a business, because he and his colleagues have to make money, they have to be able to pay their payrolls, they have to be able to buy the supplies for their offices, and all of those employees and provide benefits and all the things that they do. So in addition to providing I suspect outstanding professional care over a long, long period of time, and maybe he will share with us the number of babies he helped deliver, he is also a businessman. And in my book, that is a good two hats that he has worn over these years. So let's hear tonight from Dr. GINGREY.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague. 
   Let me make three points really quick and then we will go to closing comments because we have about 12 minutes left. But you mentioned the sales tax deduction. Just to help our many colleagues that have joined us tonight to listen to this great debate in the Chamber with us, let me explain to them what the impact is. 
   It is a matter of equity, because States that have income taxes, those income taxes that you pay in the State reduce your for Federal tax purposes. So you get to deduct those State income taxes.     
   So you get to deduct those State income taxes. States without an income tax, unless we put this provision back in, those taxpayers in effect subsidize the rest of the United States' taxpayers because there are inequitable circumstances. So being able to deduct sales taxes means that the taxpayers in Texas are on a more equal footing with taxpayers in States that have an income tax. 
   You mentioned the marriage penalty being a detriment to getting married. I don't know if that is the case. I do know there is a calculable tax toll for making the decision to get married. That may not dissuade couples from getting married, but it might. There is a tax toll, and all of us agree that strong families are the core of the institution that is America. And to the extent we discourage strong families, shame on us. 
   Finally on the 179, by dropping that deduction from $100,000 to $25,000, what happens there is the only businesses that pay money are businesses making money. You have to have taxable income in order to make money. If we have reduced the deduction by $75,000, the company has to pay tax, and let's assume a 35 percent tax rate, on that $75,000. So you take the $75,000 in profit, less the $26,500 that you pay in taxes and that net, $48,000, is all they have got left to pay dividends or reinvest in their business as opposed to the $26,250 that they could have reinvested in the equipment. So these are meaningful hits and meaningful tax policy that we ought to continue. 
   I yield to Mr. Davis.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania who is the chairman of the Countdown Crew where we come in weekly and talk about tax policy. 
   There is nothing magical about tax policy. There is nothing sacred about it. There are various terms and provisions. We ought to be about trying to find an efficient tax collection scheme that allows for voluntary compliance, a scheme that is easy to comply with and costs the least amount of money possible to comply with, but raises the minimum amount of money needed to fund the Federal Government. 
   The policy we have in place is incredibly complicated. I am a CPA, and I have spent 32-plus years in business, both complying with the tax law and trying to help other folks comply with the tax law. It is unnecessarily complicated, but it is the one we have got. The provisions we have, as has been mentioned tonight, the current rate on capital gains tax, the current rate on interest, the 179 deduction, the various marginal tax 
   rates, all of those, while there is nothing cast in concrete or stone about that, nevertheless if you look at the results we have had since they were implemented in 2001 and 2003, this economy has grown with those tax policies in place. 
   Could the economy have grown with other tax policies in place? Certainly, but that would be a guess as to whether or not that happened. The truth is we know these were in place and we know what happened with respect to the economy since they have been in place, since they brought us out of the recession of 2000-2001. 
   GEOFF mentioned his taxpayer that he talks about. The guy I think about when we talk about raising taxes is a fellow working morning tour for a drilling rig company, probably the derrick man. He probably has the most exciting job on a drilling rig. Most drilling rigs of any substance have 15 to 30-foot substructure from the ground to the floor of the rig, and then they have a mast on top of that of something in excess of 100 feet. And the derrick man's job is to stand at about 90-plus feet above the substructure, so he is 120 feet in the air, and works. It is hard work. It is physically demanding and dangerous work. He is making good money. He works 8 hours and if he is lucky some weeks he gets overtime. 
   That is how he feeds his, and I say ``he,'' most of them are men, that is how he feeds his family. When we talk about raising taxes on individuals, I don't think about Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. I think about that guy working morning tour, for example, for Parker Drilling, or Patterson Drilling which is based in Snyder, Texas, who comes to work at 11 at night and works until 7 in the morning, and gets in a car with the other four guys on the crew and they drive home and he sleeps during the day. That is how he feeds his family. That work is 7 days a week for the most part. It is a hard job. 
   That is who I think about when we talk about raising taxes. 
   So we will be coming back here again next week on the first night back to highlight again. We will have peeled off another 7 days that we have before the automatic tax increase. We have a good colleague who gets all over us about mandatory spending. Well, this is a mandatory tax increase headed our direction, as our colleague from Pennsylvania said, if we simply run out the clock. 
   It will have been 18 days at that point in time since the last tax increase. We are not aware of any tax increases on the floor this week. But hang onto your wallet. Given the way so far our colleagues have run the shop, you don't get a lot of heads up on this stuff. It just comes to the floor. They could have something up their sleeve as part of the CR that would raise taxes and do all kinds of things. And I don't want to taunt them, but again not going through committee and doing regular order leads to the kind of blindsided unexpectedness where that can happen. 
   It has been 11 days since the first tax increase, and others are on the way. 
   I want to thank my colleagues from Pennsylvania, Georgia and Kentucky, and also from Oklahoma, for helping us out tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (RECOGNIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AS AN INDEPENDENT MILITARY SERVICE -- (House of Representatives - September 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues from Ohio and South Carolina. 
   I rise today to recognize the 60th anniversary of the United States Air Force as an independent military service and to support House Concurrent Resolution 207, a bill which acknowledges and commemorates this significant milestone in our country's history. 
   From the days the sky was ruled by such pioneers of aviation as Eddie Rickenbacker and Hap Arnold, the United States Air Force has continued its commitment to fielding a world-class Air Force by recruiting, training, and educating its active duty, Air National Guard, Air Force Reserve, and civilian personnel. 
   Over the past 60 years, the United States Air Force has repeatedly proved its value to the Nation by fulfilling its critical role in national defense and protecting liberty and humanity throughout the world. 
   On September 11, 2001, the United States Air Force fighters took to the skies to fly combat patrols over major U.S. cities to protect our loved ones  from further attack. Today, United States airmen continue their great service around the world to defend our liberties and freedoms in the global war on terror. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, a facility that's dedicated to training of intelligence specialists and firefighters. I'm proud to represent the folks who used to serve there, who serve there today, and who will serve this great Nation tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join with me and others in celebrating this anniversary by supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my friend from Nebraska hosting this hour tonight. We listened earlier tonight to one of our colleagues from Ohio who recited some of the same statistics that you and I work off of, and that is, most reputable projections of energy usage in this country by 2025 and 2030 shows that, no matter what, even the rosiest predictions show that we still will be importing millions of barrels of crude oil and refined products every single day. And I don't know of any of us who thinks that America is better off by importing crude oil and refined products. Most of us would agree that that is a bad thing. Our balance of payments is out of whack. 
   As you mentioned earlier, our foreign policy options are different. Our risks and threats to this country are exacerbated by that dependence. And then you begin to talk about the solutions. We agree on those facts. It is kind of looking at the glass half full or half empty. The amount of water in the glass is the same; it is just how do we look at it. And the proposals that she began to tout and promote seem to cost American taxpayers an awful lot of money. They also seem to involve some sort of price-control scheme that would not allow the natural market forces to work and operate as we begin to export these ideas. 
   We will hear, as you said, over the next 2 weeks a lot of policies, and I think we ought to look at those polices through a lens that has four pieces. One lens would say does this policy help or hurt domestic production of crude oil and natural gas. 
   I am a CPA by trade and I operate pretty often just by straight logic, and the logic is that if we increase domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, it means we are less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas. I have yet to have anybody refute that argument in any way that makes sense. So, promoting production of crude oil and natural gas I think is a positive. So as you look at their policies, challenge them. 
   If their policy continues to close off areas of domestic production and domestic exploration like ANWR, like the Inner Continental Shelf, then that policy does not make sense for America today. And many of the policies they have in place or want to continue in place have that result. 
   If their policies retard or restrict the construction of new refineries in this country, the ability to process our domestic crude into refined products, gasoline, jet fuels and other kind of things, and force us to import refined products, it seems to me that that is a policy we ought to challenge. 
   We in the minority spend a lot of time being against stuff, and I guess that is pretty much our role, but part of that is to be responsible devil's advocates. And if a policy curtails domestic production of crude oil and natural gas, that seems to be on its face something that you and I can challenge pretty easily. 
   The second lens would be does it increase our reliance on foreign sources of crude oil. And in this category, it would be things like does it promote or inhibit personal responsibility for conservation. 
   Republicans get beat up about not being wanting to conserve and wanting to use less fuel, but at the heart of that is the personal responsibility to use a little less gasoline than you used last week. The idea is that if all of us would use just 1 gallon of gasoline next week, if we did that, you would see an immediate increase of inventories. You would see a drop in the prices because the folks holding those inventories are wanting to sell them and sell them at a profit. 
   So policies that either encourage personal responsibility for conservation or discourage personal responsibility for conservation, I think we have got to be for and against. If it encourages that and those policies come forward in the next couple of weeks, I think we ought to back those policies and help us do a better job making good choices ourselves, goofy little thing like keeping the tires in our car aired up properly, taking all the extra weight out of the trunk. Doing those kinds of things, you would probably pick up 3, 4, 5 percent efficiencies in the use of gasoline and see a dramatic impact. Just using less, that helps reduce our imported refined products. So policies that they bring forward that increase our reliance on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas, I think we have to challenge those. 
   The third would be does it encourage private investment in all sources of domestic energy, and that includes oil and natural gas. It includes coal, nuclear, wind and solar, and all those kinds of things that are out there.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (ENERGY SECURITY -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. You would think it would. 
   Uncertainties about tax policies. How is a particular investment taxed and treated under our code over an extended period of time or changes in that policy contribute to a reduction in the private investment in these various sources. Other government initiatives, like things like the government picking winners and losers in a particular area as opposed to looking to the market to do that, to give incentives to the markets to create the most efficient kinds of policies that are in place. But, nevertheless, anything that comes in front of this body that retards or discourages or puts in question the private investment into all domestic sources of energy, I think we have to challenge those, and respectfully. 
   And the fourth lens I would look at is what does this do to the consumers. At the end of the day, you and I and the people who pay the light bills when we turn the switch on, who buy the gasoline at the pump have to pay those costs.     
   And if we do things as a part of these policy initiatives that come forward over the next couple of weeks that arbitrarily and capriciously increase costs to consumers, then we need to challenge those. There has to be a pay the fiddler at some point in time. I mean, we have to pay for whatever sources of energy that we've had. We've enjoyed low gasoline prices for a long, long time, and we're coming to the end of those lower prices just because crude oil and natural gas are finite resources. 
   You've already mentioned the increase in demand from around the world that we're in competition with those. And it's not likely that we'll see a significant decrease in the price of gasoline. 
   On the one hand, high gasoline prices help us to look at doing things a different way. They help make other alternatives more viable for the consumer, because at the end of the day, the consumer across this country has to be willing to pay the cost for whatever it is you're talking about. You can't subsidize. You can't use government programs to overcome lack of a consumer participation. 
   So any of these now policies that cause cost to consumers to go up arbitrarily and too quickly I think we have to challenge. 
   Let me make one final point that you talked about, and that is converting either coal or nuclear plants to natural gas fired plants. Natural gas does not transport across oceans well. We've got to liquefy it. We've got to put it into tankers. We've got to have facilities for regasification and all those kinds things, and so importing natural gas is very difficult in comparison to how easy it is to import crude oil. 
   So as we increase on natural gas, our local domestic cost for natural gas will go up. They're already the highest cost for natural gas in the world and because we are relying on it so much. 
   The other point is that if all 38 nuclear permits that are currently in some form of approval are approved and those plants are built in the next 20 years, nuclear power will still represent only 20 percent of our demand. So if we're going to have nuclear that's going to actually help lessen the load on natural gas, then we've got to have a nuclear plant increase from where just the current system, the current new plants and new facilities and existing plants are in process. 
   So as we look at these policies that come at us over the next couple of weeks, let's use common sense. Let's look at things that can be rolled out in a scope that makes sense. It's one thing to be able to do something on a very tiny, microscopic scale. But unless you can convert that into a significant portion of the demand or the supply of energy, whether it's electricity or gasoline or other sorts, other forms of energy that we use day in and day out, then you're barking up a tree and you're not helping the circumstance. 
   So we've got some work to do, being in the minority, over the next couple of weeks to help point out the areas where we think these policies that are coming forward fail the American consumer.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chairman, this is an attempt to do some stuff tonight that will eliminate otherwise doing it tomorrow and perhaps shortening tomorrow. 
   Amendment after amendment has come before this body seeking to reduce spending out of this appropriations bills. We took some 16 votes earlier this evening. The harsh truth of the matter is, should any of those votes to reduce spending have been successful, the reality is that money would not have been saved. The deficit for 2008 would still be exactly the same as it was under this bill that was presented. 
   What my amendment would do is to create a sense of Congress that should we be successful in reducing spending coming up out of these appropriations bills, that that money would in fact reduce the deficit; and, hopefully, in the near future when we are in a surplus circumstance, that would increase the  surplus as opposed to simply being recycled back through the Appropriations Committee to spend in perhaps some other area, but nevertheless spend that money. 
   I understand there is a point of order that lies against this, and I will not insist on a ruling from the Chair. But I did want to highlight again on this bill tonight that, should any of my colleagues be successful in getting a vote to reduce spending, that reduction in spending does not actually happen; the money stays in 302(b) allocations and is spent somewhere else. So all of the conversations we have in here on the pros and cons about those issues is really wasted rhetoric under our current set of rules. 
   Madam Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chairman, again in an attempt to get a little work done tonight that we would otherwise have to put off until tomorrow, I am offering up an amendment that would say straightforwardly that we will not spend money. None of the funds made available under this act for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program would be spent as long as we keep restrictions into place on drilling in ANWR and our intercontinental shelves. 
   It seems illogical to me to drive the costs of home heating oil and natural gas up by restricting domestic production of those two commodities and, at the same time, try to fill an insatiable demand for LIHEAP funding. We added $400 million in LIHEAP money to the continuing resolution for 2007. This adds another $880 million in LIHEAP spending, again, an insatiable demand for these funds. And, at the same time, we are driving up the cost of that commodity so that the funds that we actually do plow back into LIHEAP don't go as far in terms of buying and giving relief to those folks who qualify for this program. 
   So while I am not so much opposed to LIHEAP, I am opposed to the illogical public policy of limiting domestic production of crude oil and natural gas through artificial restraints on drilling in those places of the United States where we have our own production and thereby increasing the cost to consumers in States that take advantage of these LIHEAP funds. 
   So, again, I understand a point of order lies against this. I do not intend to push that to a ruling of the Chair, but I did want to bring to the attention of my colleagues what I believe is the illogical position to take to restrict domestic production of crude oil and natural gas and, at the same time, try to fund as I see it is an insatiable demand for LIHEAP funding. 
   Madam Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I want to thank my friend. 
   There was an interesting headline and a couple of sentences in today's Hill newspaper, one of the leading newspapers in all of Washington, DC, by the way. It says, ``The Energy Bill is Out of Gas.'' The lead sentence is, ``House Democrats are in a bind on the focal point of their energy plan. Worried that a floor vote on any energy related measure will trigger a Republican-forced vote on domestic drilling, the leadership has scrubbed the floor schedule of the energy legislation that it vowed to tackle after the 4th of July recess.'' Politics, Mr. Speaker. 
   I spent all week in West Texas and Central Texas, an area that is blessed with a lot of crude oil and natural gas production. There are an awful lot of folks that make a living in drilling and producing crude oil and owning the minerals and owning the land that it is produced from. And I heard every day, why are these prices so high? Why can't we do the logical, rational things to lower these prices. 
   So if I am hearing that from a district that is very pro oil and gas, very pro drilling, I can't imagine what my Democrat colleagues heard on the other side. I was able to look them in the eye and say, Mr. Speaker, I am for it. Let's drill ANWR. Let's drill Outer Continental Shelf. Let's do all those things, all five things that my colleague from Georgia talked about. Let's do all those things. 
   I can't imagine any of my colleagues going back and facing their constituents, their voters, and looking them in the eye and say no, it is really best that we keep these prices high. It is really in your best interests that we don't drill Outer Continental Shelf, we don't drill ANWR. It is really in the best interests of the United States to continue to buy crude oil from folks who hate our guts, from a clown in Venezuela. That is really the best public policy. 
   I am surprised we had 300 people voting here tonight, because had I gone home and done that, I'd have got lynched, and it wouldn't have been a new rope. 
   I am going to make two points. We have some natural allies in this fight, and they come down here almost every  single night and rail about NAFTA and CAFTA, the anti-trade crowd. Where are they in this particular issue? 
   You know, they gripe about us exporting jobs to the other parts of the world. They gripe about the impact that NAFTA and CAFTA have, all the bilateral agreements. They vote against them. They just rail about them. Why aren't they down here screaming about this issue? Because every well that is drilled in the Outer Continental Shelf and ANWR, every plant that is an oil shale plant, the coal-to-liquid, those are American jobs. 
   And that is what the anti-trade folks are all about, is American jobs. Every new refinery that is built, those are American jobs. 
   The other natural ally is most all of those refinery jobs are union jobs. Now, the domestic drilling, et cetera, isn't much unionized. But in the refinery world, those are union jobs. Where are those guys?

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (ENERGY CRISIS -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. CONAWAY. I am sure you are right. If the unions, for goodness sakes, could force a vote on card check, an absolute walk-the-plank vote across America, a 90 percent issue, if they could force our colleagues across the aisle to vote for a card check bill, why can't they force our colleagues to vote for an American refinery bill? 
   The other point I want to make is we hear this glib little smart aleck remark that, well, we can't just drill our way out of this problem. You know, that is shallow and insincere. I mean, it is just insulting, quite frankly. 
   The raw mechanics are that every well that is drilled, not only in the United States, but in the world, has a finite amount of crude oil and natural gas that will be produced out of that well. That is a finite resource. And so if we have got 86 million barrels of production today and we produce 86 million barrels, we have got to find 86 million new barrels to tack on to maintain just flat, where we are, because demand is continuing to grow. 
   Night after night, we come down and talk about demand growth in India, demand growth in China, demand growth in the United States. So in order to just stay flat, we have to continue drilling if we are going to use crude oil and natural gas as a source to drive automobiles and trucks and airplanes, which we are. 
   The real issue is not the ultimate end game of weaning ourselves off of crude oil, as an example. That is not going to happen in my lifetime, but it will happen one of these days. But we all agree where we are trying to get to. 
   The difference in our conversation between us and the guys on the other side of the aisle is, what do we do between now and then? We all want to get there, but how do we get between now and then? 
   Crude oil is a finite resource. It will always get more expensive. There will be ups and downs, but it is going to get more expensive. How we manage that growth, those increases in costs of crude oil, how we buffer against those increases is really in our best interests. And, quite frankly, the commonsense plan that the Speaker has either kept to herself or not, I can understand why she didn't roll it out in 2006, because we were in charge and we might try to steal the good idea and implement it and take credit for it. But we have been out here better than 18 months now and we still haven't seen that commonsense plan to address gasoline prices. Not the overall energy thing, but to address gasoline prices, which she spoke about. 
   So I heard it loud and clear all week long, on every stop, every town hall meeting, every coffee shop, every conversation that I had. ``You know, what is the deal with drilling offshore? What is the deal with drilling in ANWR? What is the deal with oil shale, coal-to-liquid, all these kinds of things? Why is there a political issue going on?'' Because these solutions don't wear party jerseys, you wouldn't think. 
   It is really what is in the best interests of America. This is not about Republicans. It shouldn't be about Democrats. This ought to be about a rational, thoughtful, straightforward energy policy for America that takes advantage all our natural resources and exploits those natural resources until we can move to whatever is next for the internal combustion engine that revolutionized America and the world coming out of the 19th century into the 20th century. 
   So I appreciate my colleague letting me get up here tonight and rant and rave a little bit and spit all over the folks sitting down here in front of us. But this is important stuff. And our cutesy little sayings, we use them, the guys on the other side of the aisle use them, we can't drill our way out of it, use it or lose it, all that little nonsense, is disrespectful for the seriousness of this particular policy. Emptying the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, I had not heard her say that.     
   As long as we can buy crude oil, let's buy it. Let's keep our savings or the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for that weird eventuality when we can't get it from anywhere else and we have got to try to figure out a way to survive in that environment. How we deal with the cost of crude oil, you, you don't take the savings out of the ground for that; you drill or do whatever you have to. But that is a really bad idea and one that is not a particularly thoughtful idea that seems to be rampant in this environment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (AMERICA NEEDS TO DEVELOP ITS OWN NATURAL RESOURCES -- (House of Representatives - April 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague for hosting the hour tonight and for his work on the issue of trying to educate the American people as to what we are doing here.     
   I would say as kind of a spin-off of your comment earlier, I think our colleagues on the other side do have a plan, but they are not explaining the plan fully to the American public. Their plan is to promote anything but oil and gas and fossil fuels. And that is fine. We can have a legitimate philosophical debate and argument and disagreement as to whether or not we should continue to explore for and exploit fossil fuels. But in that conversation ought to be the cost of changing to a non-fossil fuel environment. 
   So I would argue that the policies that have been put in place over the last 15 months have been specifically garnered to reduce America's production of fossil fuels. They have been specifically put in place to raise those costs and make other alternatives more competitive in the market. But what they have not done a particularly good job of is explaining to the American public that these alternative sources have a cost. 
   If it were already cheaper to produce electricity any other way than the way we are currently doing it, we would be doing it that way. That is the American model. If it were already cheaper to power our automobiles and trucks and planes any other way, we would be doing that. 
   So as we look at these policies that are being put in place by our colleagues on the other side, they are specifically intended to raise costs on our businesses, raise costs on American businesses, raise costs to consumers. When you raise costs to businesses, those businesses compete in a global environment. They compete with companies around the world who may have a different cost structure than they do. And to the extent that our costs here are higher than other places in the world, particularly as it relates to energy, then our companies would be less competitive, and the less competitive our companies become, the fewer jobs available for Americans to take. So you can kind of get a sense of this death spiral that we put ourselves in by making ourselves less competitive. 
   The cold, hard facts are that energy costs over my lifetime and your lifetime will continue to increase. There is just no other way to get around it. That is going to happen. But those increases should not be as dramatic as the increases that my colleague has shown on the floor. We can manage and work towards slowing those increases down, making those increases much more manageable and easier to deal with if we had a rational, pro-production, pro-supply policy that we put in place. 
   If we make a decision that we want to go totally green, we want to go to a zero carbon footprint, that has immense costs that we have to agree on. If we collectively agree those are costs we want to bear, then let's go do that. But at this point, at this juncture in time, no one is talking about the costs of moving to the style of energy production that my colleagues on the other side want to do. 
   As an example, section 526 of the energy bill that was passed in December prevents any Federal agency from contracting for sources of energy if they can't prove that the lifecycle greenhouse gases are less than they otherwise would have been. Well, that has a cost to it, because that means our Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, can't buy energy from Canada. 
   Now do you want to buy energy from Canada? We share a long border with those guys, it is a democracy and we go to war together. We don't go to war with each other. Or do you want to buy crude oil from countries who hate our guts, from regimes that would just as soon America would go away as look at us? 
   What section 526 does, well-intentioned but misguided in its impact, is it says you can't buy things, you can't buy unconventional sources of energy like gas-to-liquids, like oil shale, like tar sands, unless you can prove, quote-unquote, that the greenhouse gas cycle is less. 
   These are policies that our colleagues on the other side are putting on. They are policies intended to increase costs to the American consumer. They simply won't say that. But if you look at the impact those policies have, they are specifically set to reduce America's supply of energy. If you reduce our supply of energy in a growing demand circumstance, straight economics tells you that your costs are going to be higher. 
   So as we move toward what we would all agree is a laudable goal, and that is making America dependent on energy sources that are within American control, that are environmentally responsible, let's look at the cost of how we make those moves. If we want to make them dramatically and unprepared, then, fine, those are dramatically higher costs than would otherwise have needed to be the deal. 
   So the basic points are costs will go up over the rest of our lifetime. We ought to do to what we can to manage those costs, prevent the spikes we see and the dramatic impact there, because businesses and consumers have a difficult time dealing with spikes. They can deal with a gradual increase over time, because that is just the way normal things work, but spikes hurt us in trying to plan for and be competitive in the world markets. 
   Let's come clean as to what all of these costs are for carbon tax or global warming or climate change, whatever it is. Our colleague from Michigan has said it ought to be 50 cents a gallon for gasoline. I don't know if that is the right number, but at least he put a dollar value on the ideas of how we move toward less dependence on sources of oil, in this instance fossil fuels. 
   But the phrase ``energy independence'' is a misnomer. We will never have a world where we aren't dependent on energy. We have to have energy to turn the lights on in this building. What the phrase should be is that we are not dependent on energy from sources that we don't control, from sources in countries who hate our guts, from sources that when we give them money, they turn around and take that money and do bad things to American citizens. So we can have an energy policy that makes sense, is responsible to the environment, but doesn't raise costs dramatically and arbitrarily on the American consumer. 
   I appreciate my colleague giving me a chance to rant a bit tonight and participate in our conversation.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me add one other thing that I left out. I had a conversation today with some folks from an energy electric company. We talk about energy, we ought to bifurcate the discussion. One is the electricity production, which is the bulk of the energy we use in this country, versus fuels that power cars and airplanes and trucks. They are looking at the impact that some of the proposals out there are with respect to increased costs in order to lower their CO  
   2 emissions. 
   They currently produce energy at almost 4 cents a kilowatt hour. Under  the proposals that they are examining, which are led by the Democrats, they believe their costs will go to 11.8 cents a kilowatt hour. That doesn't mean just in the vacuum. But take your electric bill that you pay this month, or the one you pay in July when it is really high because of air conditioning, and multiply it by 2 1/2 . That will be kind of a rule of thumb as to what some of the proposals out there are doing for energy costs.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, most credible estimates of future energy supplies for this country indicate that, by 2025, we will still be importing millions of barrels of crude oil and refined products every single day. That scenario is not positive for America. We should begin today looking at policies that decrease our dependence on foreign crude oil, policies that increase domestic production of crude oil, policies that increase the private investment in domestic production of all energy sources, including crude oil and natural gas, policies which will help stabilize prices to consumers both for gasoline and electricity. 
   Any policy that we look at that does the opposite, that increases our dependence on foreign crude oil, reduces domestic production, reduces private investment in sources of energy, and arbitrarily increases prices to consumers must be challenged and opposed. These are important. They do not wear party jerseys. They are simply the right answer for America. It is our job to get those policies in place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, tonight I'm asking my colleagues to make a clear choice, a choice between a rational development of American energy resources, or a flawed policy of shackling ourselves to unfriendly nations for the fuel we depend on every day. 
   The Republican motion to recommit will move restrictions on the Federal Government to speed the development and production of American resources, as well as reduce our reliance on imported refined products. It would first repeal the misguided policies introduced by section 526 of the Energy Independence and Security Act, which senselessly handcuffs the Federal Government, especially the Department of Defense, to only conventional sources of diesel, gasoline or jet fuel. 
   Second, it would expedite the siting of potential new refinery capacity. 
   Congress has already admitted that we want to continue relying on fossil fuels by passing legislation to let Americans sue OPEC to force them to increase their oil production. It is irrational to restrict our access to American fossil fuels, but continue buying these same fuels from countries that are, at best, not our allies. This motion will unleash the purchasing power of the Federal Government to accelerate the development and exploitation of unconventional fuels. 
   With oil at $130 a barrel, we should be embracing alternative sources of fuel and actively seeking to improve processes and increase refinery capacity, as well as increase fuel efficiency. But instead, Section 526 shuts the door on alternative, unconventional and synthetic fuels, and makes us more reliant on foreign oil. 
   This motion to recommit also provides the Secretary of Energy with the ability to reuse not less than three excess military installations as possible locations to site new refineries. This process will protect all Federal, State, local review and permitting processes and will even allow an opportunity for the Governor of the State to veto the site. These refineries are critically needed to address not only our military's vulnerabilities, but the needs of all American consumers. 
   By repealing Section 526 and providing for the construction of new refining capacity, we are taking positive steps to alleviate our reliance on foreign sources of fuel and ensuring the Department of Defense has what it needs to accomplish its security mission. 
   To me, a choice like this is no choice at all. Relying on untrustworthy regimes for fuel we need that leaves our Nation vulnerable to the whims of thugs and dictators. Tonight, this motion to recommit provides us with the opportunity to become more economically and strategically competitive by promoting the responsible development of American sources of refined products. 
   Please join me in supporting the passage of this motion to recommit and putting our Nation on a path to energy self-reliance. 
   I now yield to FRED UPTON.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Well, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for letting me join tonight's conversation, and I wanted to speak directly to that tax rate increase vote that will happen on Thursday as a part of what I believe to be a very misguided attempt to punish a segment of our economy that quite frankly is doing a job that all of us want. 
   It would be curious if I could ask all of our colleagues collectively in this House how many of them walked to Washington, D.C. from their home district; actually physically walked, or rode a bicycle from their district here, or horseback, maybe came on horseback or a horse-drawn carriage. Could we get anybody to raise their hand?  Even the folks who live right across the river. Ms. Norton, I guess, could say she walks in. But I would say that every single one of our colleagues comes to Washington, D.C. and leaves and goes back to their home districts in a car or an airplane or a train, or some mode of transportation that uses at its core fossil fuels to get us back and forth. 
   The bill on Thursday directly penalizes the folks who provide that resource that we all use every single day. It is hypocritical and two-faced of us to on the one hand say that, yes, we need to be independent of foreign crude oil and foreign natural gas, as our good colleague from Kentucky said, we are sending billions of dollars into the hands of countries and nations that in all likelihood are using some of that money to hurt us, to talk about getting away from that and at the same time, on the other hand, wanting to directly penalize those small producers and large producers in this country that provide the domestic crude oil and natural gas supplies. 
   I have seen some data which shows that the small independent producers in this country in 2005 reinvested 617 percent of their profits back in the ground. Now, think about that: Not 50 percent of what they made, not 70 or 80, but 600-plus percent of what they made back in the ground. So what this legislation will do is take dollars away from them and bring them to Washington, D.C., and albeit they are going to try to sequester those dollars to be used somewhere else, I would argue every dollar we suck out of these producers is a dollar that doesn't go back in the ground or produce domestic crude now, which we need. 
   I don't think anybody argues that we have a short-term problem and we have a long-term problem. The long-term problem with coal gasification and other things, nuclear, whatever they might be, those are long-term solutions. Nobody expects us to be able to put a very big dent in our energy needs in this country in the near term from anything but fossil fuels. 
   And for goodness sakes, why would we begin on Thursday to lay in place the groundwork to penalize those very people who are producing domestic crude oil and domestic natural gas? It is wrongheaded. Now, it makes great drama to be able to beat up on the oil companies. 
   In all fairness, I come from an oil and gas producing province, west Texas. I am very proud of the oil heritage and I am very proud of the supplies of oil and natural gas that those hardworking, risk-taking individuals have provided you and I in this country since Spindletop in Pennsylvania. 
   So it is wrong headed by our Democrat colleagues to want to tax those individuals differently than we tax other manufacturers. The specific codes section, 199, that we are going to snatch the oil and gas producers out of and in effect increase their tax rates, was put in place in 2003 by a Congress that said we need to incent manufacturers in this country, jobs that stay in America. And we are going to do that by a combination of wages paid within the manufacturing environments in this country to affect the tax rate. 
   The idea was to take the corporate rate from 35 percent down to between 32 and 33 percent on manufacturing activities in the United States. And the definition was written intentionally by the Congress to include oil and gas exploration as manufacturing. It also includes timber and other kinds of things that don't normally come to mind when you talk about manufacturing. 
   But the incentives for 199 weren't put in place just for the oil companies. They were put in place for all manufacturers to incent people to produce in America, to produce jobs, to produce products that we can sell and export or use within this country. 
   And now, on Thursday, we are going to have an opportunity to flush out where everybody stands. A lot of rhetoric in October about who is going to do what to 
   whom and all those kinds of things, but Thursday will be our first chance for all of us to decide whether we are tax increasers, or we are against domestic oil and gas production in the near term and in the long term with this specific vote on the bill, H.R. 6, that will be up on Thursday. 
   So I appreciate being able to pitch in on that subject, and I have some other thoughts later on in the evening, but I would yield back to either of my colleagues.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me comment on what happens, or the mechanics of the exploration business in the domestic arena. I have got some statistics here that just are almost incomprehensible in their scope. E&P is an acronym or initials for exploration and production companies. Those are the folks that take the risk. They start by trying to find rock, underground, sometimes 2 and 3 miles deep, that has the potential for bearing oil and gas. And they do this through a variety of means, through seismic and geology, and sometimes just flat out guessing. But they do their best science at the project to try to determine where oil and gas might occur. Now it doesn't occur everywhere, unfortunately. But it does occur in certain spots. And it starts off with a geologist or a geophysicist or somebody who has an idea that this particular province or this particular area may produce oil and gas. So they spend some up front money trying to decide whether or not there is the potential for oil and gas being in place. They then will send out a land man to acquire the rights to drill in the acreage that they think is prospective. And this land man will go to the land owners and the mineral interest owners and others and he will try to lease this property, lease the mineral rights, lease the ability to drill for oil and gas from each and every one of those. And that can take a great deal of time. Again, more money invested, salaries and travel and other kinds of things trying to put the prospect together. 
   Once they have got the right to drill in the area, then the operator, the person putting this thing together in all likelihood generally does not have the money to risk 100 percent of the well. As an example, we have got some, Barnett Shale Wells in Texas, that it is 4 to $6 million for dry hole costs, meaning you are going to risk 4 to $6 million before you know whether or not there is any oil and gas in that particular horizon. A lot of money at risk. 
   So this operator will go to, let's keep this simple. He will go to three friends in the business and he will say I want you to take a quarter of this deal and I will take a quarter, you take a quarter and a good colleague Mr. Shuster will take a quarter, and let's go find somebody else to take that fourth of it. And together we will share this risk of drilling this prospect. So you put up a million and my good colleague from Kentucky takes petty cash for his million, and I squeeze my cookie jar for my kids, and I get my million together, and we go drill this well. 
   Now, the drilling of the well involves hiring a drilling contractor, because the operator is not going to own any drilling equipment, so he goes out to a drilling contractor to hire the rig on a day rate basis or a footage basis or a turnkey basis, all these kinds of special terms, to actually drill the hole into the ground. And you have got all kinds of service companies that go along with it, pipe and mud and logging and all kinds of equipment and services go into trying to decide whether or not there is oil and natural gas in this rock. 
   And then if there is you do the appropriate test, then you run pipe and you incur additional costs. The completion costs in our example, let's say that is another 2 million. So we have put up our 4 million. Now I have got to come back to you for the other $500,000 each in order to be able to complete the well and begin the process of producing that oil. And right now, all of this is sunk cost. There is no way to recover much of this cost. You can get a little bit of the pipe out of the ground, but most everything else is sunk. And so if we don't produce oil and gas from that well our investment is worthless. I mean, it is just flat out worthless.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Gone. And much of the $2 million we spent completing the well will also be gone and there is no way to recover that. So the folks in this business are big time risk takers. 
   Now, let me show you how big time they are. In the 5 years in between 1999 and 2005, I guess that will be 6 years, the smallest U.S. E&P companies reinvested 898 percent of their profits back in the ground. Now what that means is they took their profits, as well as borrowed a lot of money against the reserves that they found in the ground to reinvest in the oil business. All the way up to the super E&P companies, those are the large publicly traded companies that are in the exploration and production business. They have reinvested 247 percent of their profits back in the ground to find additional oil and natural gas reserves. 
   The integrated, U.S. integrated oil companies, the very largest in our country, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Phillips, all these guys, 174 percent of their profits back in the ground. 
   So, as we take dollars, whether in this tax increase that we are going to, however they come out of it, those are dollars that will not go back into the ground to find additional supply of domestic oil and natural gas. And each time we do that, it reduces the investment, it reduces all of the activities that are associated with that. And the bottom line is that we have a shortage of supply of crude oil and natural gas. And the law of supply and demand generally works in most businesses. It clearly works in this business. And if we have a shortage of, as we saw, as Katrina, shortages as a result of natural disasters and other things, you get a spike in prices. 
   Well, we have got a systemic problem with crude oil and natural gas worldwide because, in addition to the supply not going up nearly as fast as the demand is going up, with China becoming an industrialized country and India becoming an industrialized country, the demand for crude oil worldwide has outstripped our ability to produce and increase the production in crude oil. 
   That could be temporarily offset if we could drill in places like Iraq and Iran, where they have let their oil and gas industry languish for lack of investment and upgrading. But even then that would only be a short-term fix. 
   So the impact that this tax rate increase will have on Thursday, if it turns out to be a law, is that there will be less searching for domestic crude oil and natural gas. And it seems counterproductive to me to talk, on the one hand, about reducing our reliance on foreign crude oil and natural gas, and then turn around and penalize and rein  in the people who are trying to provide domestic crude oil and natural gas.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. If the gentleman would yield. One of the things that it was a bit counterintuitive in west Texas, there was no bumper sticker. The old business has gone through a series of booms and busts that, I suspect are typical in most businesses, but they are pretty dramatic in the oil business. In 1986 there was a bust. In the early 1990s there was a bust. Late 1990s there was a bust. In the early 1990s, when the price of crude oil dropped, there was this bumper sticker that said Dear Lord, give us one more boom and we promise not to screw it up. 
   And then we had the real dramatic bust in 1998-1999 where the price of crude went to 10 bucks a barrel for sweet crude, and even less than that for sour crude. Things were really grim. Thousands and thousands of jobs pushed out of the oil business. 
   And so when the prices began to rise, in the early 2000s, and when they began to push past 40 and 50 bucks a barrel and into those ranges there was a real lag in the up tick in activity. Most folks would have said, what do you think the drilling, the number of drilling rigs working in the United States would be if the price of crude oil was 45 bucks a barrel? And when it was at that point, 2002 and 2003 and 2004, most folks would have said, the number of drilling rigs operating in the United States would have been much, much higher than it really was. And the reason for that was there was a real cautiousness on the part of these exploration and production companies as to whether or not that price would really hold, were they going to get a drop in price. So there was a real cautious reinvestment in the business that was going on during that time frame because, quite frankly, the pros in the oil business weren't sure it was going to last. 
   Now, we have been in these prices for a lengthy time now and you are seeing the kinds of drilling rig rates and activities in the domestic production that ought to be happening when you have got prices at this level. So it is a wonderful industry. It provides great jobs. Those jobs provide benefits, and it is a wonderful experience. Most of those jobs are ``living wages,'' is that phrase that is bandied around from time to time. And to penalize them directly on Thursday is wrongheaded and extreme.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Looking at the tax cuts for 2001 and 2003, it might be helpful to get into the RECORD what one of the impacts has been from those, from that tax policy being in place. I may be the only guy in Congress who drags this out once a month, but once a month the Treasury Department publishes a statement of the cash receipts and cash disbursements for the United States Government. 
   It makes for some interesting reading. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which was last year's, October, November, December of 2006, the Federal Government's deficit for those 3 months was $119 billion. 
   That is a lot of money. 
   For the equivalent period this year, for the first 3 months, fiscal year 2007, which we have just finished in December, the deficit is $80 billion, so a $40 billion improvement over last year. Why is that? 
   Mostly because tax receipts and government receipts are significantly higher again this year for that quarter than they were last year. Last year was a double-digit increase. The year before that was a double-digit increase in tax receipts. 
   This year we have collected year-to-date from income taxes from individuals, $251 billion, versus $230 billion last year. This year, corporate income taxes are up the first quarter, almost $99 billion versus $81 billion. That has happened because this economy continues to grow. 
   More people are working now than have ever worked. When those folks worked, they paid taxes. That doesn't count the Social Security taxes and all the other excise taxes that come into this Federal Government, but the truth of the matter is this economy is working and working well. 
   Let me brag real quickly on taxes, which might surprise you that I would brag on taxes. In 2003 when our legislature, which meets every other year, came into session, they were facing a $10 billion deficit. The comptroller was projecting the State revenues over the next 2 years, 2003-2004, would be $10 billion short of what the spending was going to be. The Texas legislature dealt with that and that legislature, the senate and the house and the Governor did a great job with it. The legislature that went into session a week ago today in Texas, for this year's biennial, is facing a $15 billion surplus, pretty dramatic turnaround in 4 years. 
   The reason for that is this economy is continuing to jet along and to boom, no matter what the naysayers are talking about. All the angst that is in the American public, when you look at facts, every criterion you look at, this economy is better that it used to be, better than it was this time last year. So the change that was talked about that happened on November 7, I don't think the change, as you said earlier, was to change this economy, to drive people out of work, to reduce homeownership, to increase tax rates on those who do have jobs. 
   I didn't sense anybody campaigning for that. I certainly didn't have any folks in my district come up to me and tell me that is what they wanted to have happen as a result of this change on November 7. I appreciate the gentleman letting me get those facts into the record.

   Mr. CONAWAY. If you look at those numbers, we have had tax receipt increases here, but they have come in the right way. They have come in the way where you have had more people paying and all those kinds of things. I am hopeful that the budget that does come forward understands that we have got a spending problem and not a revenue problem. 
   If you are in business, as you did in the car business, and my good friend did in his small businesses, and you are looking at deficits, you rarely have the option of raising revenues when you are in business. Yes, you have got to put more emphasis in sales; you have to do all those kinds of things. But the way you are most assured of being able to deal with your deficit is to cut your expenditures. 
   That is where most responsible businessmen go at first when they are in circumstances where they need to 
   eliminate a deficit. There is more emphasis on the cutting of spending and trimming back on expenditures and then try to do what you can with revenues. It is only in this arena where revenues can magically appear by the signing of a pen without a great deal of hard work to go in and do that.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman sponsoring this hour again tonight. We tend to spend a lot of time trying to scare each other into actions one way or another. I am as guilty as everybody else. It is almost as if whoever of us can scare us the most wins the argument. 
   The truth of the matter is, the policies in place now are helping the economy. We don't have this great economy because of the policy; we have this great economy because we have great men and women throughout the country willing to take risks and work hard, get up every morning to go to work and provide for their families and build this country. That is why it is there. 
   What these policies have done is make their job less difficult. It is not easy. It is hard to make money. In the real world, it is a very difficult prospect to make money. So low tax rates and a consistent tax policy that people can count on help pave the way for that. It makes it less difficult for the hard-working men and women of this country to do what is being done, and that is to grow this economy, and by growing the economy, the tax receipts into this government have increased double digits for the last 2 years, and in all likelihood we may have a double digit increase again this year for a record collection. So that is doing it the right way. 
   As this Congress begins to try to lead toward a different direction, toward a different policy that says bigger government, higher tax rates on these folks, it is my opinion that it will make it much more difficult for the entrepreneurs in this country to continue to do what they do. 
   They will continue to do it in the face of an insurmountable odds, that is just their nature, but by this 1,446 days away, if that does happen the way we think it will, then the tasks of growing this economy, continuing to provide greater opportunities for most Americans, will be much, much more difficult than currently today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the ranking member. 
   The Democrats' budget clearly shows, and depends on collecting, the largest increase in taxes in our Nation's history. 
   Most tax experts agree that one of the hallmarks of good tax policy is consistency and stability in that code. A high degree of uncertainty about future tax policy makes long-term planning difficult for both families and businesses, and that uncertainty can have a negative impact on economic growth, yet this majority continues to actively foster that uncertainty, again producing a budget that depends on the collection of the largest increase in taxes in American history. 
   Congress recently passed a bipartisan stimulus package that will give struggling families some of their tax dollars back with the hopes that they will spend this money and bolster our economy. But before they can even get these checks out the door, the Democrats have unveiled a budget that will take back all of that money, plus billions of dollars more. Do we really expect families to go out and spend  money when they've got a host of new income taxes that will dramatically decrease their discretionary income hanging over their heads? 
   Last year, the new Congress waited until the 11th hour to pass a 1-year AMT patch, in effect threatening more than 20 million Americans with an average tax hike of $2,000. This AMT slow walk, according to the Treasury, has now forced 3 million taxpayers to delay filing their tax returns to collect child care, education, and energy credits. 
   If, as the Democrats claim, they actually intend to stick to their PAYGO rule from now on, and as an aside, last night's ethics bill completely ignored the PAYGO impact, Americans can expect to see their tax burdens rise to a level never seen before in our Nation. But just whose tax bills are going to explode, and when, we're not sure. 
   My point here is that, beyond the damage they will do when taxes actually go up in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the majority is doing a great disservice to American workers and businesses and our economy as a whole by maintaining this tax uncertainty. As a result, we have a whole Nation of workers and businesses with no idea of what their tax burden will look like in the future, let alone in this coming year. And I can't imagine too many folks going out and buying new refrigerators, or too many businesses investing, expanding and the creating new jobs necessary to get our economy back on track with that kind of uncertainty hanging over their heads.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I had an amendment that was not made in order that would have allowed us to have a conversation about States' rights. 
   There is a provision in the bill that severely rejects States' abilities to run their food stamp programs in ways they see fit in ways that are economical, provide benefits to beneficiaries in a respectful way; and it was not made in order. 
   I think States' rights and a conversation about that is a worthy topic this evening to have this discussion. It's unfortunate that a select few on the Rules Committee, on the majority, are afraid of that conversation. 
   I don't know if I would have won it or lost it. I think every time we trample on a State's rights to do things, the 10th amendment to the Constitution, that that's worthy of a conversation for this floor. 
   I am flabbergasted that the majority on the Rules Committee were afraid of having that conversation tonight. So let me add my voice to the long line of Members on this side who whined about being cut out of this process. 
   This is a legitimate issue, the right of a State to run its business the way that it sees fit, and if it does things correctly, and we develop new ways to do things, allowing other States to adopt those same models. This bill prohibits that from happening. This tramples on States' rights. It's an issue we should have had a full debate on, at least 5 minutes on each side, but we are not going to because of some fear on the other side.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate being able to offer this amendment tonight. What I would like to do is establish the legislative history for a pilot project that would help eradicate a tactical cover along the Rio Grande. 
   My amendment simply adds $5 million to title II and subtracts $5 million from title II, but would take $5 million from the environmental regulatory assessments funding, which would lower that back to what the President requested.     
   The Border Patrol would use this money to create a pilot project to eliminate, eradicate, noxious, invasive species of weeds along the Rio Grande. The Rio Grande creates the border between the Republic of Texas, United States, and Mexico; and many long stretches are inundated with a noxious weed such as Russian olive and salt cedar. These weeds can grow from 10 to 15 feet in height. They provide excellent tactical cover for anyone trying to sneak across the border, or in what is on this side of the United States, stage in ways that our Border Patrol agents can't see them. 
   I have spoken with leadership of the Border Patrol, along with former sector chief Simon Garza for the Marfa sector in relation to this project, and it is an idea that they would support if they were able to get funding for that. 
   This is a win on two different levels. One, it would eliminate this tactical cover that the folks trying to sneak across could use, and it would make our cameras and UAVs much more effective because of the loss of that cover. But it would also have a conservation issue in that these weeds, such as the salt cedar, will use up to 200 gallons of water a day. If these weeds were eliminated along the Rio Grande, that would put additional water in the Rio Grande, which would of course make that much better of a barrier to folks trying to sneak into this country. 
   The safety of our Border Patrol would be improved as they walk up and approach the river. If this cover was eliminated, they would be able to see what was going on along our border to better do their job. 
   This amendment would also ask or require that the Border Patrol report on how they spent the money and whether or not this is a program that they would want to pursue going forward.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, as a parent, there is no greater pride than the pride felt watching your children grow from being infants to being responsible adults. Suzanne and I are blessed to have four grown children who have grown into wonderful, responsible adults, and, in the case of three of them, seeing them become terrific parents themselves. 
   While I would like to brag about all four of our children, today's event dictates that I am limited to bragging on the young man who just delivered the morning's opening prayer. That young man is our son, Erin, who is associate pastor at South Main Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. He is a graduate of Baylor University with a fine arts degree and a graduate of Truitt Seminary at Baylor University with a master of divinity degree. 
   More importantly, he is a man of deep faith in Jesus Christ as his personal savior. He is also the husband of Carmen Brassfield Conaway and father to daughter Alexandra and son Samuel. 
   In addition to being a wonderful son, husband and father, Erin is also a gifted writer and pastor. Our family was recently blessed when Erin performed the memorial services for my dad, his grandfather. 
   Suzanne and I are always proud of your accomplishments, but today we are particularly proud of seeing you opening this session of Congress and look forward to your bright future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to one issue in this budget, and that is the tax trigger. I believe this is a ruse to hide behind a tax increase. 
   I know my colleagues on the other side will argue it is not a tax increase, but I can assure you that American families in 2010 whose financial circumstances are similar in 2011, will pay more in taxes in 2011 than they pay in 2010. Call that what you may, but I believe it is a tax increase. 
   It is a ruse, Mr. Speaker, because it is built on a foundation of brittle clay. One of the pillars of the foundation is that spending will be restrained. This Democratic majority can spend their way to a point where these tax cuts won't be triggered. 
   They have already shown a great penchant for spending, a wanton disregard for fiscal restraint. There is $6 billion extra in the omnibus bill, $20 billion extra on the supplemental that is yet to pass, and another $23 billion of new spending in this bill. So they will spend their way. 
   The other thing it is built on the good graces of the Secretary of the Treasury and the director of OMB, both of whom have to agree that the tax cuts can in fact go forward. 
   I believe this is a ruse to hide behind the fact that American families will pay more taxes in 2011 and 2012 than they do in 2010 because rates will go up. I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (AMERICA'S ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, we have an hour's worth of comments today about an issue that there is little debate, and that is that we have got an energy problem in this country. How do we continue to power the factories and the plants and the office buildings, hospitals, our homes, our cars? How do we continue to use energy? Where do we get that energy from? And at what cost? 
   There is not a lot of debate these days that we are in fact too dependent on imported foreign oil and natural gas, and that is a national security issue that I suspect the folks at the Pentagon chew on every single day. It is an issue for factory owners and businessmen and women all over this country as they look at ways to reduce  their energy usage, as they look at ways to reduce their costs, their input costs on the product that they are trying to manufacture and sell to others. That is an issue to every family in this country as they decide how to pay for gasoline for their automobiles and home heating oil and natural gas to heat their homes or electricity to heat their homes. Energy should have a central front in our debate, in our actions, particularly in this body. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a story about a fellow who went to visit a neighbor. And when he got there, the neighbor was on the front porch. So they are sitting there visiting about things, and the neighbor's dog is in the front yard, and the dog is just howling to beat the band. He is making all kinds of racket. He is just howling. So finally the visitor says to the owner of the house, he says, ``What is the matter with your dog?'' And the owner looks out there and says, ``Well, he is sitting on a cactus.'' And the visitor says, ``Why doesn't he get up and get off the cactus?'' And the neighbor says, ``Well, I guess he would just rather howl.'' 
   Well, we are doing a lot of howling in this country today about energy. And rather than get up and get off the cactus and do some things about it, we continue to just howl and gripe about the price and the cost and solutions, and are unwilling to focus and study on this issue that is of terrific importance to every household, every business, every governmental entity, because they buy fuel as well, they buy electricity, they buy power. 
   Let me give you a couple statistics. The crude oil December contract, the good news, it fell for the fourth time in 5 days to close at $91.17 a barrel; but the bad news is, it closed above $80 a barrel for the 40th time in 44 days, 22 consecutive days above 85, and the 14th time ever above $90 a barrel. This will ultimately translate into much higher gasoline prices. 
   Let's talk about home heating oil, which is of grave concern to my colleagues in the northeast. The home heating oil for contract December did fall for the fifth time in 15 days, down 8 cents, to close at $2.50 a gallon. However, home heating oil has closed above $2 a gallon for the 53rd consecutive day. Home heating oil prices are above a year ago prices for the 57th consecutive day, up almost 81 cents. This does not bode well for this year's coming winter. We can all hope and pray for a mild winter, but that doesn't make for very good public policy. We ought to be doing some things today. We should have been doing things yesterday, and tomorrow is open to us to do some things. I don't hold out a lot of hope for tomorrow, but maybe a few days from now the colleagues and I on both sides of the aisle can come to some rational conclusions about how do we power plants? How do we heat homes and hospitals? How do we drive our cars, and on what fuels? What costs are we going to live with as we transition from carbon-based fuels to some other based fuels? That has to be a part of the equation. We cannot simply just immediately wean ourselves off of crude oil and natural gas, because the replacement for that product is not in hand, nor is it in hand for the foreseeable future. 
   Later on this evening we will talk about some reports that have recently been issued by some groups who should get some respect from us that the makeup of the energy usage in America 25 years from now, carbon-based products of crude oil, natural gas, and coal, will make up about the same percentage of that total demand that it does today.     
   These projections are done by reputable people and ones that we should look at in terms of relying on those as we begin to craft public policy. 
   So with that, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to yield to my good colleague from Illinois, JOHN SHIMKUS, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for some comments that he may have.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (AMERICA'S ENERGY PROBLEM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague for his comments tonight. They are spot on. It really is about the supply of energy and where we're going to get it, what form it's going to take, how we should transition from where we are today to where we want to get to and what that will cost. 
   Much of the debate to date has ignored the cost to the consumers, the cost to businesses. And should we do that, we do so at our own peril because if we artificially or arbitrarily raise costs to American manufacturers, American producers, and ultimately American families and homes, that makes us less competitive around the world as we try to compete. We've got 5 percent of the world's population, and so 95 percent of the world is our market. And if we're going to make things in America that we can sell to somebody else, we need every single competitive advantage that we can have. 
   Clearly, we've been coming out of a period where energy was relatively cheap. We've enjoyed very cheap gasoline prices almost as if a right of being an American. That right and those low prices has come as the result of some incredibly efficient and risk-taking people who've been willing to risk fortunes and make a lot of money and lose a lot of money trying to provide crude oil for our refineries that have allowed us to drive on cheap gasoline when the rest of the world isn't. 
   Before I turn to my colleague from Pennsylvania, my colleague did make some rather benign comments about the legislation, energy legislation that's already come across the floor. And I'd like to call his attention to a study that's just been released by API, which was prepared by the Charles River Associates International. This study looks at the legislation that's pending or has passed so far. It looks at the oil savings provisions, the increased CAFE standards, the increased taxes on the industry, the renewable portfolio standards, expanded renewable fuel standards. 
   All of the bills that are passed or talked about passed were reviewed by this group. And there's some pretty startling impacts that this legislation will have. Every vote has a consequence, and to the extent that we do things to reduce supply and to harm our own country, here's what some of the impacts could be. 
   This study, and I hope my colleagues across the aisle will get the study and study it, try to poke some holes in it, try to show where it's wrong. But to the extent that this is a reasonable analysis of what those bills do, I hope that they also take that into consideration as they continue to formulate the energy bill that we may see this week which has no Republican input. I don't know that it's got a lot of Democrat input in it. It seems to be a leadership, Speaker/ leader of Senate kind of a bill. 
   But these bills so far will cost, 5 million jobs will be lost by the year 2030. The average American household's purchasing power could drop by $1,700 by 2030. Aggregate business investments in the United States could drop by as much as $220 billion by 2030. Our national GDP could decline by more than $1 trillion by 2030, relative to the baseline. And cost of petroleum products could more than double by 2030, just on the bills that have been threatened and some that have already passed so far in this House. 
   So the energy bills that have passed this House and have been introduced on this floor have a consequence, and these consequences appear very dire. 
   What I don't see is what the benefits are from the bills that have passed. It is clearly not a supply-based concept that's being worked on from the other side. 
   So now it's my great pleasure to turn to JOHN PETERSON, a Member from Pennsylvania who's on the Interior Committee. And JOHN has studied this issue quite at length, and is one of our go-to guys when it comes to particularly natural gas. So, JOHN, let's hear what you have to say.

One of the problems with a renewable portfolio standard of 15 percent, now, that our chart does not depict just electricity, but if we had a chart that did just electricity, the big players are going to be the same.

Now, we all want to get to a, I would refer to it as an energy security, not only American energy security, but we ought to be talking about global energy security in this context. Right now we're focused just on the U.S. And so as we look at this energy security, not understanding that a global portfolio standard increased to an unworkable 15 percent is a heavy tax on consumers, it's a tax on businesses, it's a tax on anybody who turns on a light, anybody who gets in a car, anybody who uses electricity, that's a tax that they're not currently paying; and those increased taxes go to a narrow margin of the energy supply. And our real goal should be energy security at a cost that we can afford. 
   And I yield back.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Texas Utilities announced that they were going to build, I think the number was 12, 300-megawatt coal fire plants in Texas. And the reason for that was that over in that time frame of construction, the demand in Texas was expected to increase, electricity demand was expected to increase to the point that our grid, ERCOT, which is separate from the rest of the United States, the differential between demand and supply would narrow to a margin that is unacceptable from a safety standpoint. And these 12 plants were going to help keep that margin at the 9 or 10 or 12 percent excess capacity to allow for spurts in daily demand or to allow for continued growth in demand without getting to a point where you turned the light on and it didn't work, the experience in California where they had brown-outs because supply outstripped demand. 
   You mentioned earlier about the opponents to coal fire plants. They went to work, Texas Utilities, to demand that they not build those plants. And as a result of that, and a takeover by a private entity, eight or nine of those plants have now been scrapped and they're only going to build three. Now, what got lost in that conversation was, where is the extra electricity production going to come from in order to keep ERCOT at a margin of safety for the differential between supply and demand that it has had over these years and should have in the going-forward future. 
   So as we look at how we produce electricity, and all of us who have always turned lights on with the assumption that they would come on, left unchecked and left to our own devices, the growth in demand will get us to a point in the not-too-distant future where we will turn light switches on and nothing happens because the electricity is just not there to be used.

   Mr. CONAWAY. That will do the research to be able to learn how to burn all forms of coal from the lignite that we have in Texas to the hard coals in Pennsylvania and Illinois, learn how to burn that coal to generate electricity but yet capture the CO  
   2, and then take that CO 
   2 and either sell it back to the oil and gas business to sweep oil reservoirs to enhance the oil recovery, or in many places we will have to learn how to put it underground, deeply buried, permanently buried in the ground so it is not in our atmosphere. That is essential that we get that done, and the sooner the better, because all of us believe coal is a long-time solution to electricity production, but it ought to be clean-burning coal, zero-emission coal-fired plant. That is important not only for the coal plants that we ought to be building in the United States, but India and China are also part of this consortium that is going to develop this technology. China is bringing on a 500-megawatt power plant every 2 weeks or so. India is in a similar mode. They are going to burn coal however they need to in order to generate electricity because electricity and an increased electricity supply drives growth and economies. The availability of the electricity helps drive the growth in these economies. China and India are going to continue to burn coal and spew CO 
   2 into the atmosphere no matter what we do. So it is in all of our best interests to learn how to burn coal cleanly and take advantage of that 250-year supply that my colleague from Illinois was talking about.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I want to thank both my colleagues tonight for coming in and sharing this hour and hopefully shedding a little bit of light on an issue that is of interest to every single American. We all use electricity in some form or fashion. It is all important to us. 
   In the couple of minutes we have left, I want to bring both my colleagues' attention to a study that came out this summer called ``Facing the Hard Truths About Energy.'' This is a study that was done by the National Petroleum Council. It involves some 350 contributors. It was not a new study in the sense that it went out and did the research, but it gathered the research from these 350 participants that cover a very broad spectrum. It included of course energy producers. It included environmentalists. It included everybody who might have something intelligent to say about the issues and problems that we face. It was transparent. Everybody got to see what was going on. There weren't any hidden agendas. There weren't any preconceived ideas. 
   I want to quickly run through the things that this study shows that we must do in the United States. Some I agree with wholeheartedly, and others I am still questioning and understanding the impact. But this study, which I hope over the next several months we are able to show to the American people and have them look at it and understand the issue as you and I do, but this study would say that we need to moderate the growing demand for energy by increasing efficiency of transportation, residential, commercial and other industrial uses. That is one we can all agree with. Expand and diversify production from clean coal, nuclear, biomass, other renewables and unconventional oil and gas; moderate the decline of conventional domestic oil and gas production, which means lifting those restrictions and going after domestic crude oil and increased access for development of new resources; integrated energy policy into trade, economic, environmental, security, foreign policies; strengthen global energy trade and investment; and broaden dialogue with both producing and consuming nations to improve global energy security. Not just energy security of the United States, but global energy security, because a world that has global energy security will be much more peaceful than a world that is fighting for the energy. 
   Enhanced science and engineering capabilities and create long-term opportunities for research and development in all phases of the energy supply and demand system. And finally develop the legal and regulatory framework to enable carbon capture and sequestration. In addition, as policymakers consider options to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, provide an effective global 
   framework for carbon management, including establishment of a transparent, predictable economywide cost for carbon dioxide emissions. 
   A couple of their findings unrelated directly to their recommendations were that the majority of the U.S. energy sector workforce, including skilled scientists and engineers, is eligible to retire within the next decade. The workforce must be replenished and trained. These are millions of jobs across a broad spectrum, from roughnecks all the way to the smartest scientists, that we have got in this country. 
   So I want to thank both my colleagues for coming to us tonight. We have 1 minute to close. John, anything? John, anything?

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, the previous speaker mentioned that the current energy policy was crafted in the dark. I would have to agree that the current energy policy that's being proposed has certainly kept the Republicans in the dark because we have yet to see the language on the policy that we will be asked to vote on over the next couple of days. In all likelihood, it will require mandates. Mandates are good ideas that I've come up with that you have to pay for. 
   There will be a lot of talk on this floor, there will be a lot of good arguments made, but to cut to the chase, if  it were cheaper to produce electricity today by using solar and wind and other alternatives, we would be doing it. That's the American way. That's the commerce of the circumstances, but it is not. And so, as we look at these proposals that will require how we go about providing America with the electricity and energy we need over the next decades, let's don't forget that there is a cost associated with it. We ought to know that cost. We ought to know the cost to consumers and to the businesses that have to use that energy. 
   There's an old saying, ``If you don't like the high cost of eggs, then why would you kill chickens?'' Let's be careful that with this new energy policy that's being proposed, that we don't, in fact, kill the chickens that produce the eggs that generate the electricity and the energy that we need.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, it's good to be with you this afternoon. 
   I want to spend most of the next hour talking about the oil and gas business and energy issues in general but specifically about the oil and gas business. 
   In the interest of full and fair disclosure, I grew up in West Texas, home to much of the oil and gas production from the Permian Basin, and I now have the high honor of representing much of that region in Congress. My dad was in the oil business. He had a service company for the last 25 years of his career. I had oil and gas clients in my professional career. And so I hope the fact that I have some background and experience in this area doesn't disqualify me from talking about things that I know and that doesn't discount what I have to say. 
   In looking at our overall energy picture, almost every legitimate projection of energy usage in this country, over the next 20-plus years, shows that crude oil and natural gas will continue to be a vital part, an important part of the energy complement for this country for the next 20-plus years, as I mentioned. 
   There are no breakthrough technologies. There are no scientific advances that anyone can anticipate today that would reduce our dependency, particularly as it relates to driving cars and trucks and airplanes, on crude oil and natural gas. We don't produce enough of it domestically to meet the needs of our existing oil and gas needs, so consequently we import 60-plus percent of the crude oil, natural gas and gasoline products that we use every single day. And that percentage is growing, unfortunately. 
   Most commentators, and I agree, would believe that this importation of crude oil and natural gas from foreign sources coming from countries whose leadership hate us, whose political schemes are directly opposed to what we would want to do, is not in our best interest and represents a strategic vulnerability that our country has to other parts of the world that in many instances can be far less stable than you would want to count on. 
   So given the fact that we will be using crude oil and natural gas for the next 20, 30-plus years, and that we don't produce enough of it ourselves, it would seem that it would be in our best interest to promote policies that encourage and incentivize additional production of domestic crude oil and natural gas, policies and incentives like allowing the responsible and environmentally sound exploration of areas in this country which we currently, either by law or by executive order, prevent our crude oil and natural gas exploration companies from having access  to, promoting policies that, to the extent that it is safe and sound, reducing and eliminating unnecessary bureaucratic red tape. 
   You can look at the reasons we've not built a refinery in this country for a number of years is because of the long lead times it takes to get that done. The approval process, or the bureaucratic nightmare that companies have to go through, all of the money they invest on the front end, they don't get the return on that money until the plant is built and done, and the longer you extend that timeframe between when you start to when you actually begin to refine crude oil adds to your cost, it adds to the carrying cost, it adds to the cost of the money you've borrowed, and is a disincentive to actually entering into that particular business. 
   So when we on this floor from time to time, today may have been one of those times, when we on this floor from time to time put in place new laws, new regulations, added taxes and other burdens on the domestic and international oil and gas companies, we are, in effect, I believe, cutting our nose off to spite our face, because increased domestic production offsets the need for additional import of crude oil and natural gas. 
   No one that I'm aware of with any rational thought thinks that we can produce enough domestic crude oil and natural gas to completely wean ourselves from international imports or foreign imports of crude oil and natural gas. So it's not about totally doing away with those, but at least putting ourselves in a position to make ourselves less dependent on those foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas. 
   My colleagues earlier this afternoon were talking about the high cost of gasoline. And gasoline is high here in the United States. It is higher in other parts of the world than it is here in the United States, but that's scant comfort to the consumers and the folks out there who are, as they stand at the pump and they watch that price ratchet up past $40 and $50 for a tank full of gasoline, the fact that there are people around the world paying more for their gasoline than we are is not much comfort as that happens. 
   I understand that the high cost of diesel, whether it's ag producers or farmers or long distance truckers, whatever it is, adds to their operating cost. The cost of gasoline, of course, has taken an increasingly larger share of the family budget as that number goes up, and that's something that should be of concern to all of us. 
   The bad news is that over time those costs will simply continue to get higher. Short of a worldwide recession, in which demand for crude oil and natural gas was dramatically lessened or reduced, we are going to continue to have increases in the price of crude oil, an increase in the price of natural gas, and that, of course, will be reflected at the pump. 
   Our job should be to try to minimize those increases or delay those increases as long as we can, to smooth them out as best we can to allow consumers and businesses to make the accommodations they need to to begin to live with these higher gasoline and diesel prices that we're currently experiencing.     
   A big jump that we have seen from $30 a barrel to today, I guess, $100-plus per barrel has had an impact, a surprisingly limited impact to the extent that the economy that we've enjoyed over the last several years has not gone down as much as most folks had predicted with a rapid increase in crude oil and natural gas prices. But nevertheless, families are paying more out of their family budget each month for gasoline, and that's not going to get any better. 
   We can make it worse with the policies that we pass on this floor to the extent that as we make it more expensive to find and produce crude oil and natural gas, we will add to the costs and the burdens of families that are unnecessary additions to costs by taking a different tack of promoting and incenting crude oil and natural gas producers to produce more, then we would help go a long way of providing additional supply as the demand goes up. 
   So I was in Midland, Texas, in 1998 and 1999 when the price of crude oil was $10, $11 a barrel, a scant 9 years ago. It's hard to believe that today it's 10 times that number. But there's the yo-yo effect with respect to crude oil and natural gas prices. We have seen those prices go up and down dramatically over the last 40 years. 
   I think the difference this time in this run-up is that China and India are much greater consumers of crude oil than they were in the late 1990s, so we were able to see a price drop to $10 a barrel. I don't think anyone realistically expects that to happen because you have got additional consumers in the market, and those consumers are China and Japan, as I mentioned. I was in China last April and was told that a thousand new cars a day are being added to the traffic pattern in Beijing alone. A similar statistic for Shanghai. These aren't cars or people that are switching from one car to another. These are folks who are getting off their bicycles and beginning to drive automobiles. So this is a net-plus increase in the demand for crude oil and natural gas that has not been there before. 
   So while the prices are high, they will fluctuate some, but I don't think we will ever go back to the levels that we have seen 5 and 6 and 7 years ago. 
   The people who produce crude oil and natural gas, those companies are vilified in the press and, sad to say, with our Presidential candidates from time to time, as well as Members of this House come to this floor and will say some pretty outrageous things about the companies that supply us with the level of crude oil and natural gas that we have today at these prices as if they are some sort of a bad person. 
   When we make critical statements, critical statements about corporations, and let's take ExxonMobil, for instance, because they're the easiest target having just released earnings this past week or so, earlier this month, showing that they had set a record for a 2007 profit of some $40.7 billion. That is a huge number in any comparison, except, perhaps, maybe the total Federal budget. But it's out of context as it is taken most the time. It can be criticized, and some very unflattering adjectives are used such as ``outlandish,'' ``unjustifiable,'' or ``appalling'' or ``ruthless.'' These words have been used by some of my colleagues to describe ExxonMobil, and that's unfortunate. 
   Now, I'm not an apologist for ExxonMobil. They're a corporation, and if they've done something wrong, they should be held to high standards of conduct. But to the extent they have played the rules and played the game within the rules that are set for them, the fact that they have been successful, the fact that they have done well should not be held against them simply because the fact that they've done this well. They are not price gouging. Their prices are set by the international market like everybody else's. And the fact that they are big helps them do things that smaller companies simply cannot do. 
   The investments, the billion-dollar investments that are necessary to explore for and to produce crude oil in some of the more remote areas of this world require huge investments, and it takes big companies to be able to do that. And the fact that ExxonMobil is in that arena and is successful at it should not be denigrated the way it is. 
   Here is some of the bad things that ExxonMobil does, if you think that making money in the oil business is, in and of itself, bad. 
   They produce some 4.2 million barrels of crude oil a day, an oil equivalence of some 637,000 barrels a day. So that's a sizable production of things. I don't have the exact percentage of total worldwide percentage that that is off the top of my head, but I think the production is about 80 million barrels a day. ExxonMobil is 4.2. So that is a sizable piece. 
   When you consider the governmentally owned entities in that 80 million, ExxonMobil is a small player, given the fact that Saudi Arabia and others, as a group owned by the governments, are much bigger producers than that. 
   ExxonMobil, out of that $40.7 billion that they earned in 2007, they paid out $7.6 billion in dividends to their shareholders. 
   Now, when we denigrate corporations, it's easy to do because we don't  put a face on the corporation. We just think of it as an entity. But the truth of the matter is corporations can't do anything without people, employees, and directors and others at ExxonMobil. So when we make negative and ugly comments about this corporation or any corporation, we are, in effect, talking about the people who work there. 
   ExxonMobil has some 82,000 employees worldwide. That's 82,000 families who feed their families, feed their kids from hard work and the successful work at ExxonMobil; 82,000 families who own homes, 82,000 families that try to find a way to send their kids to college and pay for health care and take care of the things that they need to do to put braces on their children and all of those kind of things that families do. Those people are no different than anyone else working in America or around this world. They've got the exact same cares and responsibilities that every parent has. And so to denigrate the corporation and, by extension, these 82,000 people is really unfair. 
   Hidden in the conversation about the profits that ExxonMobil made of some $40.7 billion was the fact that they paid some $32 billion in taxes; $32 billion in taxes. Now, if you added up the bottom 50 percent of all individual taxpayers in the United States, I think that number is some $27 billion. And so ExxonMobil single handedly paid as much in taxes as half of the individual taxpayers in the United States, actually paid more than that half. 
   And so as you talk about all of the bad things that ExxonMobil has done, saying they're guilty of some pretty rotten stuff: creating 82,000 jobs, paying out $7.6 billion in dividends to their shareholders, creating the wealth that relates to what those shareholders do. Those shareholders have bought stock in this company. They bought it expecting to be able to sell it at some point in time in the future for a profit, which is not bad, because when they sell that, they will pay capital gains taxes on that. The 7.6 billion, to the extent it went to taxable entities and not to retirement plans or IRAs, those taxpayers pay taxes on that 7.6 billion. 
   So there's an additional 7.6. The 82,000 employees that are U.S. citizens pay individual income taxes on their salaries as well. And they're paying the payroll taxes, and ExxonMobil is matching those payroll taxes in a responsible way. 
   So, as you see, the comments made about the amount of money that ExxonMobil has made, please put it into context with the amount of money that they would have to invest in order to do that. The return on shareholders' investments is in line with other U.S. corporations and other industries within the United States. It should be a good investment. It should create wealth for the shareholders that are able to take advantage of owning that stock having bought it when hopefully the price is lower than what they could sell it for. 
   So, as you hear comments, negative comments, if it is about the breaking of a law or something like that, fine. We will deal with that. But if it is just the fact that they're big and the fact that they found a lot of crude oil, natural gas, and produced a lot of it, then those are misplaced. And when you make those comments about what Exxon does within the rules, you are criticizing people. You are criticizing 82,000 folks around this world who are getting up, going to work every single day trying to do the best job they can at providing a resource and a commodity that all of us enjoy 
   each and every single day. 
   I did not mention the fact that ExxonMobil refines 5.6 million barrels a day worldwide and almost 4.7 million barrels a day here in the United States. So, again, jobs are created up and down the stream with respect to the oil and gas business. 
   As you look at energy policy, I think that we spend a lot of time in this Hall talking about what we should be doing, and yet we don't listen to each other very well in terms of what the impact is of what we are trying to do. And consequently, we don't have in place rational policy for what we should be doing in this country. 
   There are two broad areas of energy that we should talk about separately: One is electricity generation and the other is crude oil and natural gas. That is what we use to drive our cars. 
   With respect to electricity, we have had a dramatic event in Florida yesterday where we had a blackout, an infrastructure failure, overload of some sort that quickly got corrected, but it was a microcosm of a wreck that would happen if we didn't have adequate supplies of electricity. 
   Now, the growth in this country in terms of population, with it comes an automatic growth in the use of electricity. That's just the nature of the beast. Now, we should be doing all that we can to conserve. We should be using smart appliances and smart light bulbs and doing all of those kinds of things. But the truth of the matter is, as the population of the United States increases, we need more energy, more electricity to be able to meet the needs of this increased population, whether that is lighting their homes, air-conditioning their homes, providing electricity to power the businesses in which they work. That is going to be a demand that is there and is growing. 
   If we don't continue to invest in generating capacity, then we are going to get caught in a circumstance where our demand has outrun or outstripped our ability to supply that energy, and we will have very sizable increases in the cost of electricity. 
   You can see what happened a number of years ago in California where they got caught in that exact same wrinkle. They discouraged generating capacity to be built in California, but yet the demand for electricity continued to increase and they got caught in circumstances where the demand was higher than the supply and they had a dramatic increase in prices. They had some regulatory issues involved that created that problem, but when you have demand that outstrips supply, you have large price increases in that arena. And those kinds of circumstances have the dramatic effect on individuals as well as businesses, because when you are putting your monthly budget together or your business plan for your company, you try to estimate what your costs are going to be over a near-term and mid-term circumstance; and you ought to be able to predict reasonably close what your energy costs should be over the next 4 or 5 or 6 months. And when you get sharp spike increases, as was seen in California, then that wreaks havoc not only in the family budget but also with businesses that are subject to passing on those electrical costs through their products and services ultimately to consumers. 
   So as we look at the electrical side of this thing, we should be promoting wind, as we see in west Texas, and solar and hydropower. All of these alternative and green sources of electricity should be promoted as well. But the growth in that side of the business cannot even keep up with the growth in the demand. We've got two circumstances: natural gas-generated electricity, we've got coal used to generate electricity, and we've got nuclear that is used to generate electricity. Those are the three main backbones of the current grid. 
   And so as you look at those plants, they are all getting older every single day. Recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been able to go through a second round of licensing for existing plants and has been able, because of the good maintenance and upkeep and the proper operating procedures and plans that have been in place at the nuclear plants, have been able to extend the useful life of the current complement of plants we have for another 10 to 15 to 20 years, which is important, because the time frame of which a lot of that production capacity was built, they're all going to fall off the grid in a relatively short period of time, which means the supply is going to dry up if we don't create additional sources of electrical generation that can be counted upon.     
   So we've got a problem, going forward, with how to generate electricity. The green sources can't keep up with the growth in demand. Natural gas is an expensive commodity. We're not drilling for sources of domestic gas. And because natural gas is hard to import, those prices and costs of generating electricity using natural gas will continue to go up faster than the cost of using coal or nuclear. 
   The backbone of the grid, for certainly my lifetime and perhaps even  my children's lifetime and beyond, will have to be nuclear and clean coal burning technologies. I don't think realistically there is any other way to generate electricity on the scope that we're going to have to generate it on and get it done. 
   If you don't acknowledge that, if you put your head in the sand, then you develop policies that will not promote a rational, orderly, thoughtful process of how to provide electricity for this country over the next 50 or 60 years, and that is an unfortunate circumstance that we see ourselves in. 
   None of the alternative sources can fully replace everything that's going on, and yet we seem to be placing great reliance, or hope, that we can develop these alternative sources, green sources of electrical generation in time to offset the loss of the nuclear power plants that ultimately wear out, the coal-powered plants that ultimately wear out, and the natural gas that is a commodity of seemingly infinite supply. But that's wrong, too, because crude oil and natural gas are finite resources. There will be a day, a long time from now, when the last barrel will be produced and the last MCF of natural gas will be produced because it is such a finite resource and takes so long, millions of years, to create it underground. 
   The argument about nuclear is that it's unsafe and unsound. It's dangerous. I had the opportunity to visit the Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant that's just on the eastern edge of my district. It's not in my district, it's just outside on the eastern edge. Quite frankly, I had never been to a nuclear power plant, and so it was an eye-opening experience for me. Everybody had the little meters on, DOSA meters on that will show whether or not you've had an exposure to radiation that is inappropriate. 
   We actually, as a part of that tour, went into the storage facility for the spent fuel rods, the spent rods that they've used over the years to create the nuclear reactions. And I'll admit to being a little apprehensive. You simply walk through this door and you're standing in front of what appears to be a giant swimming pool. At the bottom of this pool of water are these spent rods. And I kept kind of glancing at my DOSA meter to make sure that I wasn't getting a dose of radiation. Sure enough, I was not. It's perfectly safe. But I didn't know that. Ahead of time, if you would have said that this spent fuel is stored underwater like that in an open arena pool, I would have been a little bit skeptical about how safe that was. But our nuclear industry is a safe industry and deserves to be exploited as we look at ways to generate electricity. 
   The argument is that spent fuel creates a hazard and a problem for disposal and storage, and that's the case. But you have to weigh that against the way electricity is produced everywhere else. If we continue to use coal, until we learn how to capture the CO  
   2 and sequester that CO 
   2, the equivalent amount of electricity between producing with coal versus nuclear, the coal will have produced X tons of carbon dioxide that would have gone into the atmosphere, versus on the nuclear side, a small, relatively containable and handleable spent fuel that we have to deal with. 
   So you look at the two. And clearly, given the emphasis on global warming and climate change, the folks who are proponents of that argue that CO  
   2 and climate change are the single biggest things threatening our lives. Well, if CO 
   2 is the biggest threat to our way of life, why not deal with that by using nuclear? I mean, nuclear waste has to be way down the list of things that are dangerous for us to deal with. 
   I'm not a Pollyanna. I understand that when you build a nuclear plant, that it is subject to being somebody's target to do something stupid. But we have done a good job the last 7 years, since 9/11, protecting the nuclear plants, we'll get better at it, and assessing the risks to those power plants and understanding the opportunities that some bad guys might want to do at a nuclear power plant. But getting exposed to it, which is probably not a good word, but at least understanding and becoming more informed about how the nuclear power plants work and how the controls are in place, the systems they have in place for fail-safe circumstances, in addition to developing new generation or next-generation power plants which use a different model that in and of itself is a safer model of a way to generate electricity, and approaching that in a rational, thoughtful manner is going to be in all of our best interests. 
   And yet there are still an awful lot of people out there who are apprehensive to the point of not wanting to use nuclear because they believe that the risks are too great. We need to have these conversations between the folks who believe it's too risky and the experts who understand exactly what it is and how it works and where those risks are and where those risks aren't, to get those to come together and help us understand how we mitigate the risks and how we adjust them and go forward with a source for the grid that is clean, zero emissions, and is going to be one of those sources of electricity generation for the U.S. that is important to our grid. It's important already in France, and other countries of the world are using it safely without incident. And certainly we're as good as the French are at doing things, I would expect, and should be able to handle nuclear power in ways that are responsible, both to the areas where the plant would be, as well as to how we handle the spent fuel and the waste that is an issue, and where we store that. All those kinds of things can be solved and should be solved if we can begin to deal with the issue, and first dealing with our irrational paranoia about it, getting past that and dealing with the realities that the experts and the scientists could certainly help us understand that. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, the national energy policy, we've had several attempts at it over the years. We currently don't have one that's rational, I don't think. We continue to penalize the oil and natural gas industry with added taxes, as we did this afternoon, with red tape, with regulation that prevents them from being efficient. We lock away vast areas of the United States to prevent domestic production of crude oil and natural gas. We don't have a thoughtful, rational approach to electrical generation and how we're going to get that. Clearly, clean burning coal and nuclear have to be exploited and explored. Yes, continue to work on the wind and solar and other ways of generating electricity, but the truth of the matter is that those are going to be at the margin of the electrical grid. 
   Every American alive today, when they walk into a room and flick the switch on, expects the lights to come on. They don't know how that happens, but they expect it to happen. And except for yesterday afternoon in Florida, most all the time it does. When it doesn't happen, like what happened yesterday in Florida, it shows how vulnerable we are to not having electricity, what impact that has. You saw the traffic grids, the traffic parking lots across Florida because the traffic lights went out. You couldn't move traffic the way it normally moves. And all the people trapped in elevators and all that kind of anecdotal excitement that happens when that goes on helps give us a little bit of a sense of what a world without all the electricity that we need to produce and to use is not readily available at our fingertips at the flick of a switch. 
   With respect to crude oil and natural gas production, again, as I mentioned earlier, we are going to be using it for a long, long, long time. If it's imported from countries that are not operating in the same thought patterns that we are with respect to human rights and women's issues and other kinds of things, if it creates a strategic vulnerability to this country to import crude oil and natural gas, then it seems logical to me that we would put in place policies and regulations that would promote the domestic production of crude oil and natural gas as opposed to hindering them. 
   To reduce domestic supplies is wrongheaded. And when we increase taxes on the oil and gas business, that is money that is taken away from the exploration for new sources and new supplies of crude oil and natural gas. 
   The mechanics of an oil and gas company typically says that when you find, through the exploration process, through drilling and finding it, you understand that there's a reservoir of crude oil or natural gas underground. Through scientific estimates and from petroleum engineers, you can determine what the value of those reserves  are once you've drilled a well and begun to produce those. 
   Typically what happens, the independent producers in particular then go to the bank with the reserve report that shows what they think the estimated value of that crude oil and natural gas is in the ground. They go to the bank and use those reserves as collateral to borrow additional dollars to drill with and to explore that field further or to increase production. And so each dollar that goes somewhere else other than back into production is a multiple of that dollar that is not used to explore for and to produce crude oil and natural gas. 
   Most of the independents that I represent in West Texas are trying to drill in the United States. Statistics show that independents, as that term is defined, typically reinvest 600 percent of their profits back in the ground. In other words, they borrow six times as much money as they earn in a year in order to continue to grow their reserve base to replace the production that they've already produced and to continue to do the things that they do best. Major oil companies, such as ExxonMobil, are generally well above 100 percent, I think it's 170 percent of their profits go back into the ground to explore for and to produce additional crude oil and natural gas, much of that is worldwide, which in a commodity such as crude oil and natural gas, there is really no distinction between the oil produced around the world versus domestic production as far as creating supply against the demand that is out there and is a growing demand as well. 
   So a broad-based national energy policy that encompasses electricity production, how we drive cars and fly planes and drive trucks and those kinds of things, I think it is awfully important that this Congress come to grips with. 
   I have not mentioned conservation, but that is a huge piece of the pie as well. We can use less per person than we currently are, and that's less electricity and certainly less gasoline in our cars. 
   I have introduced a bill that would create a public-private partnership in order to help remind consumers that they have a direct role in energy usage in this country. The partnership would point out things that we can do individually, by choice, to reduce our own demand. Our own use of gasoline is an example. And it doesn't have to be draconian. I'm not talking about giving up your automobile and riding a bicycle to work. That's not rational. We're not going to do those kinds of things. But there are some small things that each one of us can do and choose to do on our own that would have a dramatic impact across the system. As an example, if we would arrange our affairs next week to use one gallon of gasoline less than we used this week, that would have a dramatic effect if everybody decided to do it. If the millions and millions of consumers and drivers out there would just simply use one gallon less, you would see a dramatic increase in inventories. When inventories go up, the folks who are in the business of retailing gasoline are very price sensitive, and their prices move around, up, and they also come down. But if their inventories begin to grow unexpectedly because we just simply used a little bit less individually, but if collectively across all the United States, you would see a big rise in inventory. 
   Now that does two things. One, you would save the cost of that one gallon of gasoline. And at $3.50 a gallon, you may think, well, that's not all that much. But if you look at the impact that that savings would have across the system, you would save $3.50 per person, but you would also see a drop in the price of that gasoline because the supplies and inventories would go up. That means that collectively all of us would be better off.     
   Now, how do you save a gallon of gasoline? You do some simple things like you keep your tires aired up to the proper limit. You take the extra weight out of the trunk of the car so you're not hauling it around. You think each day about what are the trips I'm going to make today. How can I drive a few miles less today than I drove yesterday, and just be smart about it. You can be a safer, more polite driver to the extent that as you accelerate your car, if you're not aggressive in accelerating it, if you don't slam the accelerator down and race away from red lights and stop signs, if you drive a little friendlier than some of us are used to, that uses less gasoline as well. 
   So there are a lot of things that you and I can choose to do. It doesn't require a government mandate. It doesn't require a bureaucracy to administer. It's just simply all of us working in our own best interests to save a little bit of gasoline. And, again, 1 gallon this week less than I used less last week would have a dramatic impact on those prices, and we would all collectively benefit because we would be doing what we ought to be doing, and that is conserving the resources that we've got responsibility for. 
   The same thing applies to electricity. Using less electricity, you could do a lot of things, and we all can do that, to reduce the growth in the demand for electricity. Again, you're not going to read at night by candlelight or campfire or lanterns. We're not going to do those kinds of things, but we can have a dramatic impact on electrical uses. 
   I had a client when I was with Price Waterhouse back in the early 1970s, Recognition Equipment. Recognition Equipment made some pretty, at that time, sophisticated optical readers, and they had a very complicated cost accounting system in which they would allocate their indirect costs, heating and air-conditioning and lighting and all those kinds of stuff, would allocate those to their products that were being produced. As you remember, in 1973 we had the Arab oil embargo and prices shot up from $3 a barrel to 30 bucks a barrel. There was a big push to use less electricity, to use less energy. REI went all through their plant and did everything they thought they could do rationally to reduce their electrical usage; things like they went to every other light in the hallways and all kinds of things. They were able to so dramatically reduce their electrical usage that it screwed up or messed up their indirect cost allocation to their products, and they had to go back through and readjust the amount of money that they were applying to come up with the cost of their products through their process. So we can do those kinds of things when we have to. Typically when we have to is when the prices get so exorbitant that we are forced to do it. We can choose to do those things ahead of time without being forced to. 
   I currently represent a chain of convenient stores in west Texas where I know the folks who run it, and we were talking about gasoline uses. They make a lot of money selling gasoline at these convenience stores. And 2 years ago when the price first started going over 3 bucks a gallon, they could see a dramatic difference and a change in their consumer patterns when the price of gasoline was above $3 versus when it was below. Consumers would immediately react to that. Now we have become desensitized or less sensitive to the $3 number, and that new number is somewhere north of that where we would feel the pain enough where we would be willing to make some changes in our own personal life to do that. We don't have to wait for that price to go up in order to motivate us to do those kinds of things. There should be plenty of motivation for us to be able to take the kinds of conservation steps that each one of us individually could do as a free-will choice that would help this issue tremendously as we move forward. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, there are no magic bullets. There's no magic wand that we could wave across this problem and instantly fix it. It requires thoughtful compromise across a lot of folks who are in this arena, folks who have legitimate concerns, legitimate worries, legitimate issues. Working through those, working off of sound science, looking at rational approaches to things and not taking the extremes is going to be important as we as a society continue to move forward with an energy policy that makes sense. 
   Calling each other names, talking about the producers of crude oil and natural gas like ExxonMobil in some very unflattering terms is counterproductive to the system. Beating up ExxonMobil makes absolutely no sense if you think that the product that they are producing is something that we need. Now, you may not like the prices that they're producing it at, but those  82,000 people who work for ExxonMobil are human beings. And when they hear their company denigrated by folks in this Chamber and Presidential candidates and others because they have been successful working within the rules and within the laws, that sends a really bad message to folks who are providing a service, providing a commodity to us that we simply can't get along without. 
   So thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me this time tonight. I would encourage my colleagues to thoughtfully think about the words they use, the adjectives they use as they describe this problem. This is not a Republican issue. It's not a Democrat issue. This is an issue that's important to every single American out there. It's one that deserves our best, thoughtful consideration. It deserves our listening to each other and hearing the concerns each of us have and working toward a solution and actually putting it into place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I make a point of order against the consideration of the resolution because it is in violation of section 426(a) of the Congressional Budget Act. 
   The resolution provides that all points of order against consideration of the bill are waived except those arising under clause 9 and 10 of rule XXI. This waiver of all points of order includes a waiver of section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act which causes the resolution to be in violation of section 426(a).

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, this bill that is the subject of this rule that is about to come before us includes two tax increases, one on section 199, which eliminates the oil and gas industry's ability to take advantage of this provision within the law to increase their taxes over the next 10 years by some $13 billion. There is also some tweaking with, and that's an odd word to use when it raises $4 billion, but a tweaking with the way foreign oil and gas income plays into the computation of the foreign tax credits that these companies could take advantage of.     
   Both of these violate the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act provision on private initiatives and therefore are subject to this point of order on being waived. So I think that favorable consideration of this point of order is where we should be going with respect to the private sector mandates that are waived under this rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would also at this point in time like to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake).

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague for pointing that out. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office on a similar, almost exact, bill, 2776, earlier in the year, clearly stated that these were unfunded mandates. They breached the threshold appropriate under the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act, and a point of order should be sustained against this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5351, RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ENERGY CONSERVATION TAX ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - February 27, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I was laboring under a misconception that the debate was to be limited to the point of order rather than the underlying bill itself. So since the other side has raised the issues in the bill, I'll take a couple of seconds to add some gratuitous comments about those as well rather than strictly talking about my point of order. 
   At a time when we are clearly dependent on foreign oil, imported foreign oil, crude oil, and natural gas, and everyone recognizes that it's a strategic vulnerability to our country, a reduction in domestic production of crude oil and natural gas seems to be very wrongheaded in the sense of trying to reduce our dependency on imported foreign oil and natural gas. 
   This bill will take $17 billion out of the search for crude oil and natural gas, domestic supplies in most instances, and put it towards some very worthy initiatives in terms of trying to find alternatives to that. There is no rational projection that any of these alternatives will develop in the next 15 to 20 years to supplant the need for crude oil and natural gas to drive the economy, whether you're talking about generating electricity or driving cars and trucks and airplanes. So at a time when we are fully dependent on crude oil and natural gas, it seems to make eminent sense that we ought to be encouraging domestic oil and gas companies to reinvest their profits, reinvest their moneys back in the ground. 
   Now, mechanically what happens with respect to the oil and gas business is when they do find crude oil and natural gas, they find reserves in the ground and there is value associated with those reserves. Typically, those producers then go to the bank and use those reserves as collateral in the ground to borrow more money to spend additional money going into the ground. So for each dollar that we increase their taxes, there is a multiple of that dollar that does not get spent on searches for crude oil and natural gas that would be used domestically. We do nothing about the restrictions on a responsible, environmentally sound development of other areas that have proven crude oil and natural gas reserves, domestic crude oil and natural gas reserves. We do nothing in this legislation to affect that. 
   In addition, my colleagues brought up the vaunted PAYGO rule, which is used almost every day in this Chamber. Quite frankly, these taxes have been used multiple times already in this Congress to pay for a variety of things. So if our constituents back home fully understood how theatrical the PAYGO situations with this bill really are, they would be probably offended, that that is just the typical Washington business-as-usual kinds of things that are going on. 
   So while this bill, I believe, creates an unfunded mandate that is in violation of the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act and it should be properly subject to this point of order, the underlying bill itself is flawed on a variety of things as well. 
   I will close, then, by just saying that I believe this point of order should be sustained and this rule should be defeated. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, this is not an either/or match. This is not either alternatives or crude oil and natural gas. This is both. The issue is how do we transition from where we are today to where we all want to get to, and how do we afford that transition. 
   If you simply cut off crude oil as part of that solution today, then you're going to have exactly what we've got: rising gasoline prices, soaring electricity prices, natural gas prices are going to go up, home heating costs are going to go up. And in an ironic twist of fate, the commonsense plan to lower gasoline prices includes being allowed to sue OPEC to increase their production. I'm anxiously awaiting reaction in the OPEC countries to allow OPEC citizens to sue America to force America to produce her own energy. 
   This is not either/or. It is both. 
   Let's turn down the rhetoric and begin to work toward both a current short-term solution as well as a long-term solution all of us embrace.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (FAITH IN GOD IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, a deep abiding faith in God, I believe, undergirds and protects this Nation from its very start until today. As you and I tour this Capitol, as you and I work in this Capitol, and as you and I go about the business of the people in this Capitol, there are signs of that deep faith throughout the Capitol. Some are overt, such as the inscription above you that says ``In God We Trust,'' and there are others that aren't quite as overt that are particularly subtle, and it is one of these subtle remembrances and reminders that I want to talk about today. 
   As you move between the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda, there is a statue of a gentleman named John Muhlenberg. John Muhlenberg's story is what I want to talk about today. 
   John was a clergyman, a soldier, and a politician. John was a Virginian, and he was a member of the Assembly of Virginia; and he was a witness to the British taking over the armory in Williamsburg and taking the gun powder and the weapons out of that armory. He was incensed that his country, his communities would be attacked by these British soldiers. 
   So he rode his horse back to his congregation in Western Virginia, and on a Sunday morning began a sermon, and he spoke from that familiar passage Ecclesiastes 3 in which he said, There is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven; a time to be born and a time to die; a time to plant and a time to uproot; a time to kill and a time to heal; a time to tear down and a time to build; a time to weep and a time to laugh; a time to mourn and a time to dance; a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them; a time to embrace and a time to refrain; a time to search and a time to give up; a time to keep and a time to throw away; a time to tear and a time to mend; a time to be silent and a time to speak; a time to love and a time to hate; and a time for war and a time for peace. 
   He then looked at his congregation, Madam Speaker, and said, This is a time for war. Standing in a pulpit with his clerical robes on, he then removed his robe to display his colonel's uniform and sword. Pastor Muhlenberg then went on to raise the militia of some 300 strong Virginians and fought valiantly in the Revolutionary War on behalf of his country. 
   In addition to John Muhlenberg, he had a brother named Fredrick Muhlenberg who was also a preacher in New York City. His brother, once understanding what John was doing, wrote to him telling him the error of his ways, that this was not his fight, he should not be participating in it, and to stand down and to leave this matter of a revolution alone. 
   Fredrick held that position until the Brits burned his church in New York City, and then Fredrick took up arms against the Brits as well. In addition to those feats, Fredrick became the first Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
   So as you walk between the Statuary Hall and the Rotunda, you will see a statute of John Muhlenberg. He's got clerical robes, and on he's also got a sword; and as you see this statue, be in remembrance of the fact that this was a clergyman who had taken up arms to create and defend this country. 
   Madam Speaker, I believe that this country should remain with a deep abiding faith in God, and that we should absolutely adhere to the inscription ascribed above your head and that in fact in God we do trust.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time, and I also want to congratulate our chairman on getting the job done. Getting a budget is obviously never easy in an election year, it's never easy in an off year, but his perseverance has us here today debating a budget that I couldn't be more strongly against. 
   It fails on a number of occasions, a number of points, not the least of which is that it fails to address entitlement reform. We have recent reports that we've got some $57 trillion in unfunded promises that we've made to each other; no attempt to address that. What that means is this government, over the next 75 years, would have to run a $57 trillion surplus in order to make that work. And this government has never been good at running surpluses. In fact, if you look at the last 40 or 45 years, there is only a handful of years in which an actual surplus occurred. 
   Now, the other side talks often about the projected surpluses that were there in 1999 and 2000, but those projections weren't worth the paper they were written on as it turns out, as no projections are. But the actual surpluses in years totaled some $17 billion, well short of the $57 trillion that we'll need to run in order to meet these promises. 
   This budget does include $683 billion in new spending that they fund through the tax increases that will automatically happen in the law that's currently in place. Now, you will hear a lot of rhetoric about this being the largest tax increase ever; and we'll say it is, they'll say it's not. It's true, there is no tax law included in this budget. But what happens with the tax law that's currently in place is that the projections are that it collects an additional $683 billion in taxes from the hardworking Americans and companies in this country. And this budget gives us a blueprint of what the other side intends to do with it. They don't intend to address the surplus, they intend to spend it on other programs and continue to grow this Federal Government. 
   So, while I congratulate my chairman on getting this to where we are today, I intend to vote against this bill and urge my colleagues to vote against it as well.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, Monday, April 23 of this year marked the beginning of Small Business Week, honoring small business owners and their employees for their dedication and hard work that has helped to ensure that this Nation continues to remain a strong leader in the global economy. 
   This week, we celebrate their countless hours, their commitment to their families, communities and our Nation. The 11th district of Texas boasts a large number of successful small businesses and, combined, they have labored extraordinarily to establish themselves as a backbone of our economy. They have provided numerous jobs, endless opportunities, and sustained economic growth. 
   Mathis Field Cafe in San Angelo, Texas, is one of the small businesses that I am proud to represent in Washington. Mathis Field Cafe employs 26 people, specializing in serving authentic Chinese cuisine. It was founded by two Chinese immigrants in 1988, Sam and Rose Ng, who are now United States citizens running this very successful small business. 
   It is small establishments like this one in the 11th District of Texas that I proudly represent and that I want to honor and thank for their tireless efforts day in and day out. Steady pro- economic and pro-business policies encourage job growth and allow our small businesses to thrive. I expect to see cafe and other small businesses in District 11 reap the benefits of our strong economy and give back. This week we honor all small businesses alike.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, my previous colleague is a friend from Washington, but he really doesn't get it either. 
   When you have a convoluted national energy policy that the Democrats are putting forward, they meet themselves coming and going. On the one hand we have had speaker after speaker stand here today and tell us we can't drill our way out of it. Yet earlier this month we passed a bill that allows American citizens to sue OPEC to force them to produce more oil and gas. 
   The only way for them to produce more oil and gas is to drill more oil and gas. On the one hand they say production won't affect supply, and on the other hand they want to sue OPEC to force OPEC to produce more oil and gas so that we can buy it, from folks who are, at best, not our enemies. 
   This is wrongheaded on every level. I expect the OPEC companies today are working on legislation to allow their citizens to sue America to force America to produce her energy. 
   We can do better than this. We can quit talking past each other and make this thing work if we just do it.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, the New York Times today has got an article predicting $200 a barrel for crude oil in the not-too-distant-future. The laws of supply and demand, the economic law of supply and demand works. This House, led by this majority, has passed bill after bill after bill whose intent and whose implication is to increase the costs to generate energy, whether its electricity or gasoline. Those policies specifically demand higher prices. If there was a cheaper way to generate electricity or drive our cars, we would already be using those cheaper methods. 
   So the policies are to raise the prices, and the twisted logic is they then come down here and speaker after speaker gripes and complains about those exact high prices, which is the direct result of what their policies are putting in place. 
   Yesterday, in a staggering twist of illogic, is to pass, as a part of that bill that was passed yesterday, to unleash our Department of Justice on the very producers that we are trying to incent to produce more crude oil and natural gas on an unfettered witch hunt that will cost millions and millions of dollars and result in absolutely zero. 
   It's wrong policy. The American people need to speak up.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (DUNCAN HUNTER NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I also want to add my congratulations and words of appreciation to our chairman and ranking member for the terrific job they did on this year's defense authorization act. 
   The members of our Armed Forces, whether during times of war or peace, deserve the wholehearted support and moral and financial commitment and support from its citizens and its government. I believe this support from this committee of our men and women in uniform is undeniable. This bill does support the national defense mission, the individual servicemember, and the military family. However, it is not complete. We are continually increasing the demands of this voluntary force, but our budget does not provide the needed resources for the military with a growing responsibility and mission. 
   Some of these shortcomings includes cuts to future combat systems, cuts to anti-missile defense systems, and the Marines are getting cuts in the Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle. This vehicle would replace the aging 38-year-old Amphibious Assault Vehicle that they currently rely on in getting from their ships to the shore and exposes our Navy to unnecessary risks, and I am concerned about these cuts. 
   But there are a lot of things to be in favor of in this bill. With respect to SOCOM, these warfighters, as you know, operate throughout the globe conducting missions that most of us will never hear about but are absolutely essential and critical to defend against the unconventional threats and preventing additional threats and crises around the globe. 
   We support these warfighters, these magnificent warfighters by fully funding their requirements. In addition, we added some $186 million to provide for their unfunded requirements that they have on those lists for surveillance capabilities and personnel protection gear. We also authorized 26 human terrain teams that they have requested, and supports our National Guard with some $800 million in additional money for equipment. 
   With respect to our troops and their family welfare, we are in complete agreement that the individual marine, sailor, soldier, and airman is our most valuable national security asset. They stand between this Nation and those who wish to do us harm and, along with their families, sacrifice daily in defense of this Nation and our freedoms. This bill reflects our commitment and responsibility to ensure that they are taken care of. We are giving them a 3.9 percent pay raise, some $650 million to improve barracks, and the elimination of all temporary barracks between now and 2015. 
   We are going to add to their force, to their numbers so that they can spread their responsibilities across a greater number of soldiers and marines. We are re-equipping and resetting these forces with additional funding provided for unfunded readiness initiatives, for training shortfalls within the Army and Marine Corps. In addition we are providing gear in the field to be used immediately with MRAPs, additional body armor, and up-armored Humvees. 
   Mr. Chairman, while we may disagree with how these assets, tools, and, most importantly, this personnel are used, there should be no disagreement that we should provide this Nation with the personnel, assets, and tools to protect this country with overwhelming force to counter any and all threats. This bill moves us toward that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding some time. 
   I did vote for the underlying bill that this rule is associated with and intend to vote for it on the floor as it is currently drafted. But I'm going to speak against the rule and intend to vote against the rule, should we get that vote. 
   While the Defense Authorization Act doesn't have much public policy in relation to energy in it, it is a beneficiary of good, sound national energy policy.  
   DOD is the single largest department purchaser of energy of any of the Federal agencies that this Congress oversees. It would benefit dramatically by decreases in costs of energy, as would every consumer, every American home would as well. And conversely, its budgets are dramatically negatively impacted with rampant run-up in costs. We fly jets, we drive tanks and Humvees and other vehicles, and we have to buy that fuel to get that done. These increased costs as a result of an unsound national policy on energy are a detriment to the Department of Defense. 
   A sound national policy on energy should promote additional supplies of domestically produced sources, both fossil fuel sources as well as unconventional sources. It's not an either/or, it ought to be both. And this Democratically led House has consistently, over the last 16 months, had a very negative bias against fossil fuel sources. 
   Every rational projection of energy usage over the next 20 to 30 years shows that we will continue to be reliant on crude oil and natural gas for that entire time frame. The larger the domestic supply of crude oil and natural gas we have, the less dependent we are on foreign sources and the cheaper it will be. There is an action in economic law for supply and demand that says if you restrict the supply, then your costs are going up. And increased costs of energy and fuel to the Department of Defense is a negative that we ought to address. 
   If you punish the producers of crude oil and natural gas, you're going to get less of it. The bill we passed yesterday, which unleashes the Department of Justice on an unwarranted witch hunt against the oil and gas industry, will increase costs and will, therefore, have a negative impact on the operations of the Defense Department, which this authorization bill governs. Those increased costs are not in the best interests of Americans and not in the best interests of the Department of Defense. 
   So while this bill and this rule do not specifically address our national energy policy, a policy that is sound and promotes domestic production of both crude oil and natural gas as well as unconventional sources of energy to supply our Department of Defense with the energy it needs to fly those airplanes, drive those tanks, drive those Humvees, and light the offices at the Pentagon, as well as the housing associated with the Department of Defense, is in all of our best interests. I would urge our colleagues to look at that as we approach these issues. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to join me in voting to override the President's veto of the farm bill. It's a widely held axiom that good agriculture policy is good Federal policy. This farm bill is a fulfillment of that statement. 
   This legislation will continue a safety net for America's producers and consumers, while providing a proper return on investment to the American taxpayer. The food and fiber commodity market is an extremely unpredictable place in which our producers have no ability to set their prices for their products. 
   Furthermore, farmers and ranchers in all areas of the world are forced to deal with uncontrollable production risks that could at any time wipe out an entire year's income at a moment's notice. These are fundamentals that will never change, and I firmly believe that we'll always have a need for policies and mechanisms to address these issues. 
   This long overdue and extremely important piece of legislation, once law, will return a sense of certainty to farmers and ranchers of rural America. 
   The farm bill has an important impact on every single American, and I strongly support this bipartisan act, and urge my colleagues to override the President's veto.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to celebrate the wonderful and full life of Robbie ``Gran'' Juanita Sepolen. 
   In her 105 years on this Earth, Gran was a daughter, a wife, a mother, a foster parent, a student, a teacher, an activist, grandmother, great-grandmother, great-great-grandmother, and even a great-great-great-grandmother, and most importantly, she was a devoted Christian. Her accomplishments are innumerable and the lives that she touched along the way are countless. 
   Growing up in Brownwood, Texas, Gran was part of the first graduating class from Brownwood Colored High School in 1918, later named the Rufus F. Hardin High School. After college, during a time of great bigotry against the African American race, Gran overcame those boundaries and shared her love of learning with others as a teacher and librarian in the Brownwood School District. 
   A true public servant, Gran used her rights as a voting citizen to help others find their voice by helping them register to vote. She was active in the senior citizen ministry as well, sharing her love of the arts in senior citizen centers throughout the county. 
   Gran never tired of meeting new people or learning new things, participating in numerous cultural events, and was even crowned the 2001 Cowboy of Color Rodeo Queen in Houston, Texas. 
   While we mourn the loss of such a unique and wonderful woman, we must also celebrate a life well lived and move forward knowing that Gran left footprints on the hearts of all that crossed her path.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman. And I'm glad he is hosting this hour tonight so that we may have an opportunity to have a bit of an exchange of ideas and dialogue on these energy issues. 
   One of the catchphrases that has become popular among the uninformed is the ``use it or lose it'' phrase which trivializes an incredibly complex process. It trivializes the importance of an energy policy in this country and tries to reduce, as I said, a complex issue to a bumper sticker. It is demeaning to those in the business. And it demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of exactly how the process works. 
   The idea is that oil companies in these United States, including major oil companies, are somehow warehousing good drillable prospects in the hopes that crude oil will go higher than it already is. Well $140 plus a barrel is plenty of incentive to drill almost everything in these United States. I want to walk you through a brief description of some of the things that go on in the development of a prospect, the drilling of a prospect and bringing crude oil to the market. 
   Now this applies onshore and offshore. The onshore processes are a little quicker because the infrastructure is already in place. The offshore is staggeringly more expensive than the onshore. And it takes a longer time. 
   The first thing you have to have is an idea of where you think oil and gas might be. You can't just willy-nilly drill in the United States offshore, or anywhere in the world, and expect to find crude oil or natural gas. You have to have a reasonably scientific guess as to where crude oil or natural gas might have occurred. You base that guess on other production in the area. You base that guess on the geologic history of that particular spot in the world. But you have to have some sort of an idea that there might be oil and gas in that place. 
   Once you come up with that idea, you do some preliminary geological work trying to map what that subsurface structure might look like under where you're trying to drill. You may be able to do some preliminary geophysical work in that process to get this idea to a point where you're willing to invest thousands, hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars. And with respect to offshore, it's billions of dollars of shareholder capital, your money or the bank's money, depending on how you have financed this particular idea. 
   So you have the idea. You have done the preliminary work. And you say, all right, here is an area where I think there is oil and gas. I need to make a deal, a trade, with the people who own the minerals under that dirt. Now the United States is one of the few countries in the world where individuals own minerals on their property. The government owns a lot of property. It owns those minerals. Private citizens own a lot of property. And they own those minerals, or they have sold those minerals or detached them from the surface rights. But somebody owns those minerals. You have to find all those people. And depending on the size of the block of acreage that you're wanting to put together, it could be one owner. It could be hundreds of owners that you have to make a deal with. So you go through that process. 
   You finally come to a lease term. Let's do an easy one. The Federal Government owns all the minerals, has all the surface and you have one owner to deal with. You negotiate that opportunity with the Federal Government. The Federal Government then puts the leases out for bid across anybody who wants to bid. Well you have the idea in mind. You think you have nominated that prospect, that acreage for drilling. So you put your bid in. You win that bid. You negotiate that lease. You pay your upfront lease bonus money for the right to then begin spending some really big dollars on trying to find out what that's done. 
   Now let me talk a little bit about that lease, because this speaks to the ``use it or lose it'' nonsense that is currently permeating the debate in this House. This lease is a legal contract between the lessor, the landowner, in this instance the Federal Government, and the lessee. It has specific terms that the lessee has to abide by. One of those terms, of course, is a lease bonus payment typically based on the number of acres. So you put that money up front. It will have a fixed term. Onshore non-Federal lands, it could be 3 years, it could be 5 years. Offshore it's generally 10 years just because of the timeline that my friend will show us here in a minute that it takes to move from point A to point B, selling the crude oil or natural gas off that. So there's a fixed term that you have paid upfront money to. You have the right to explore all of that acreage for the term, for the primary term of that lease. 
   Now while you're exploring and not producing, you will have to pay annually delay rentals of some negotiated amount just to maintain your position in that lease. Once you have gone beyond that primary term, many leases, most leases, will have what is referred to as a continuous development clause in that you have to continue drilling wells, producing wells, at a fixed rate over some period of time in order to keep the acreage that you have not developed. 
   If you decide that you have drilled all you want to, then the acreage that is outside your production unit, when you drill an oil well or a gas well, in Texas it's the Railroad Commission that will assign a spacing unit. Oil wells are typically 40 or 80 acres. Gas wells could be 160 or 640 depending on the depth. That is the aerial extent of the land that they think that one well will drain efficiently. 
   So any acreage outside of that production unit after the primary term, and once you have quit meeting your continuous development clauses, reverts back to the original owner. So if I have leased a 5,000-acre tract from the Federal Government, I've done all the G and G work, drilled it, found production and I know exactly where it is, I don't think the rest of that acreage is worth drilling, then once that primary term of that lease expires, all of that acreage under the terms of the written contract goes back to the Federal Government and can be leased by someone else throughout the process. 
   Now you say, well, why would you let that acreage go once you have made that decision that you're not going to drill it? Well, A, you have invested a per acre bonus in all of that acreage, B, someone else may come up with the idea that they think there is oil and gas under that. Even though you don't, they may think there is oil and gas under that. You have paid your upfront bonus money. It's your property to deal with during that time frame under  the terms of your lease. So somebody comes to you and says, I think there's oil under this piece of property. You have got the control of the minerals. You don't own them outright. You have them leased. Can I do a deal with you so that I will drill it? That is called a ``farmout.'' I will farm out that acreage and then you put your risk dollars up so I don't release that acreage when it's under the primary term because I have paid for it. I will keep it through the end of the lease. I am making the delay drill payments. Somebody else may have a better idea that there is oil under that place. There is a serendipity kind of thing. You never know when that happens. 
   Once you have the lease in place, you then begin the complex G and G work that is on the property. Offshore or onshore, you will do additional geological work. You will shoot seismic perhaps, you will evaluate that seismic on 2-D, 3-D, go through a lot of work. In the meantime, while that is going on, you also begin the permitting process that on Federal leases is quite extensive. There are some 29 agencies that may get involved in your ability to drill on the lease that you have already paid for. You have to get EPA permission. You have to get Bureau of Land Management permission. You have to get drilling permits. There are all kinds of things that you have to go on. And all of that takes time. It obviously cannot be done instantly, because some of these permits are piggy-backed. You have to get one before you get the other. Some of them you run concurrently. And all of that work is going on while you are trying to pick the spot you want to drill that first well. 
   Once you have the permitting in place and you have a reasonable idea of when you can start drilling, you then go through the process of negotiating all those contracts to drill the well. You'll have a contract with the drilling contractor for the rig. You'll have contracts to buy mud. You'll have contracts for logging, other services, casing, equipment, all those kinds of things. You have to get all that gathered up and moving toward your location. Now onshore it's a little easier than offshore but nevertheless, the process is still the same. 
   You then put your rig up. You set up the rig or rig it up, and you drill your hole. And if you're lucky, one in six wildcat wells will discover oil. There is a little better percentage than that on development wells. But you will then go through the completion process. Once you have got it completed, you will build out the surface facilities, tank batteries, flow lines, all those kinds of things in order to move your product, either gas or crude oil, from that well site into a market. 
   At that point, you also have to negotiate a contract to sell the product. Now, crude oil is a pretty quick contract. They are very standard. And the product has got a certain quality, and you sell it. Natural gas, on the other hand, is a little different animal. And the contract negotiations for natural gas take a lot longer. 
   Once you have got the contracts negotiated and you have all the permissions to drive and do everything you've got, now you're ready to sell that first barrel of crude oil or that first Mcf of gas. And the length of time that can take varies. There's not a standard that you go by, because every single deal is different. Onshore is different from offshore. All the offshore deals are incredibly different than the onshore.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Yes. In the Gulf of Mexico there is a production platform, a drilling platform, a production platform and a crew quarters platform called Atlantis. It is about 150 miles offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know if it's technically in Louisiana or Texas. It's 150 miles offshore. It's in 7,000 feet of water. So you have 7,000 feet of water before you hit the seabed. And they have drilled 13,000 feet once they've reached the seabed. So it's about a 20,000-foot well that they have drilled and they have I think five producing wells. This will produce about 150,000 barrels a day. It's rated for 200,000 barrels. Billions and billions of dollars are invested in this floating monstrosity that sits in the Gulf of Mexico and produces crude oil and natural gas. It's an incredible amount of investment. Now if you have invested in Atlantis or if you have invested in a prospect onshore, you get no return on your dollar. You get nothing back from your investment until you sell crude oil and natural gas. And therein lies the misunderstanding by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. There is no juice in sitting on production. At $140 a barrel, the only way I get my money back out of the investment I have got in this well is if I sell crude oil and natural gas. So I have no incentive to sit on it for any reason because there's no way for me to get money back out of my investment. So there are plenty of good business reasons why the oil and gas is being produced in a commercial properly developed manner.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Yes, in the time line. Leases were obtained in 1995. You walk through the step, the first production was September of 2007. The ship was commissioned for full operations in December of 2007, so 12 years of activity that went on in investment, more importantly dollars invested because they had to pay for the building of that platform. The folks who built it didn't say, okay, when you start producing crude oil, you can pay for it at that point in time. They wanted their money up front. And so only major oil companies have the resources to be able to drill in 7,000 feet of water. The technical aspects of drilling like that, many of them had to be developed on the fly because they didn't know how to do it. Bottom hull temperatures at 20,000 feet are very high. And the ability to maintain casing, maintain well, maintain the down hole structures, they had to figure that out, because no one else had ever done it in the world. So being able to do that is technically very, very complicated.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Sure. The Dallas-Fort Worth airport is a large facility in between Dallas and Fort Worth. Underlying all of that airport is a formation called the Barnett Shale. Barnett Shale is a gas-bearing formation that the industry has known about for a long, long time. It was not commercially producible on a vertical well bore because the formation would not give up enough gas on a vertical structure in order to be able to make your money back out of what it took you to drill that well. Someone had an idea and said, what if we drill the Barnett Shale horizontally, you know, go down 8,000 feet, and then drill a leg out 3,500 feet to 6,000 feet? I wonder what that would do? They did that. And all of a sudden, they got a commercial gas well. 
   The estimates are for the Barnett Shale, which is very extensive from the middle of between Dallas and Fort Worth, just north of that area, all the way down toward Waco and out toward Abilene. They don't have the extent of where it's commercially producible at this point in time. But current guesses are that it's 26 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Barnett Shale. This is a gas plate that has been there and been known for 50 plus years, maybe even longer than that. But it's only been recently that they have developed it. 
   Dallas airport sits over the Barnett Shale. So Chesapeake went through the airport authority and said, we want to drill. We want to negotiate those leases. My recollection is they negotiated the lease in 2003 and paid the upfront bonus of $186 million to drill.     
   They will drill 303 wells on Dallas airport property. They will use 52 pads to drill those 303 wells, and so obviously each pad will have multiple wells. The royalties will go to the airport. First production began in 2005, and they are now continuing to drill.

   Mr. CONAWAY. To be fair, doing things offshore, 150 miles from shore, is technically much tougher than it is doing it in the heart of an oil-and-gas region like Fort Worth is. So there is a natural difference in time. Some of it has to do with the permitting and all of the other stuff that goes on. But also, it is tougher to drill 150 miles offshore where everything has to be brought out there.

   Oil and gas companies, much like manufacturing companies, have a work-in-process scheme that includes all of these steps.

So this use it or lose it phrase, in addition to being demeaning to the process and to the industry, is wrongheaded at best.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Exactly, something that most everybody understands. 
   When I came to Congress, actually, my first race was against my good colleague, Randy Neugebauer. He and I campaigned against each other and, quite frankly, campaigned the way Republicans ought to campaign against each other, and that is why you should vote for me, and he stuck to why you should vote for him. And one of the reasons that I thought folks should vote for me was that I thought the small business mind set or experiences were underrepresented in Congress. Now, I hadn't done any empirical research. I just made that up. It sounded good. I thought, from having watched the way things going on out here, I just thought it was the case. But Randy won the first one. He was a small business guy. He won that first race, and then I was fortunate enough to win a race, and we now serve together. And I suspect he has found, like I did, that that was a lot truer than I had even thought about; that there really is a real lack of appreciation of how hard it is to make a buck. 
   Not to denigrate anybody's path to this place, but I think folks who have worked in the real business world, who have, as you said, met payrolls and been responsible for both sides of a budget; it is easy to budget if you are in government and all you are worried about is how much you spent because you know that you can collect it from somebody. You have got a sheriff someplace that will go collect it if need be. We have got a big gun that we will point at folks and take that money away from them. 
   But in business, you have got to worry about both sides. You have got to figure out how to do some service or put together some product that you can sell to somebody else for a profit. And then you have got to hold your costs down and all those kinds of things, all those decisions that go into that. 
   I had 32-plus years in business as a CPA. I had a, from a variety of clients,  from really big clients to really small mom-and-pop shops. 
   We have got a colleague that is going to talk in a little bit that is a doctor. One of the closest things that I had to being a doctor-like experience and telling somebody they have had a terminal illness was each year when I would have to go to my dad, who ran a small business in the oil field service company, and tell him what his taxes were going to be. I dreaded that like the plague because it was my fault. I was his accountant. And even though the Congress and the Internal Revenue Code were done by Congress and implemented by the Internal Revenue Service, I was the bad guy. I had to go tell my dad that he owed more money in taxes than he really wanted to pay. And he would constantly say, well, how do I not pay those taxes? How do I get out of doing that? 
   I heard an interesting phrase the other day that fines are a tax on criminal activity; taxes are fines on successful activities. 
   Every time we spend a buck in here, and we spend a lot of bucks, $2.7 trillion, I try to not lose sight how hard it is for us to, for whoever that taxpayer out there that we collected that buck from, how hard it was for them to make that money. 
   I live in West Texas where oil and gas is a big deal. And part of my background is working as a rough neck on drilling companies for drilling rigs. And when we spend money, I think about that rough neck working morning tower for a drilling company. In the winter, it is cold and miserable and wet and nasty, and in the summer time, it is hot and dry and miserable. Hard work. I am talking labor. Now we sometimes refer to what we do in this body as work. But folks, this is not work. This is a job. This is something we do. Work is when you are outside doing physical labor. And I have done some of that, and I went to college so I didn't have to keep doing that. 
   But I think about how hard that person works to earn the money that we then take taxes away from him to help do whatever it is we do. Most of what we do appears important. Some of what we do is not important, and we shouldn't do it. And that is where we ought to be about the process of reducing the amount of money that we take away from people and spend. But I keep thinking about that guy working morning tower and how hard it is for him to earn a dollar so that we can take $0.20 of it or $0.50 of it, whatever it is we decide to take in our infinite wisdom from him as a result of his or her hard work. 
   We will hear over the next 2 years as we talk about this stealth tax increase that is coming, that is either the capital gains rate going up or the various family-friendly things that we did in 2001, 2003, or the death tax that comes roaring back in 2011; we will hear the Democrats talk about, ``well, we are going to fix it for the little guy. We are going to not raise taxes on the small taxpayer and all those kinds of folks.'' That is a class warfare issue that I think is unworthy of us. As we begin to kind of differentiate between good folks who make money and bad folks who make money based on the amount of money they make, I think it is unworthy of us. Let's try to not do that because successful people are the ones who invest. They are the ones who create 
   businesses. They are the ones that make money that can provide jobs. 
   The times that I have had to go look for a job, it has been very few, but the times I have gone to look for a job, I have not gone to somebody that was losing money to ask for a job. Only the Federal Government can lose money and still hire new people. Every small business out there, every medium-size business, most big businesses quit hiring people if they are not making money. Only in the Federal Government do we have the luxury of continuing to hire folks when in fact we are in a deficit spending that we have been on in the last several years. 
   In an attempt to, well, before I start that, I spent 2 years on the Budget Committee and listened to some of our good colleagues on the other side talk, day after day in those hearings about their proposals for PAYGO, their proposals for reducing the deficit, all those kinds of things. Every single one of those conversations, either overtly or as a sub plot to those conversations, was a tax increase. It wasn't about spending less money, because at the same time they were talking about reducing the deficit, they would propose billions of dollars of additional spending within the budget that we were trying to pass. So the idea that we can only fix the deficit by raising taxes is misplaced. 
   We don't have a tax revenue problem in this Federal Government. We collected a record amount of revenues for the Federal Government in fiscal year 2006, up double digits from the collection record in 2005, which was up double digits from the collections in 2004. We have got a spending problem. And I have got some, a couple of proposals that I want to talk about which may not be exactly on point with what Mr. Shuster wants to talk about tonight. But one of them is a ``no new programs'' agenda. This was a rule to the House rules that, you know, I hate to whine like the rest of us, but we had no input in the House rules. But I introduced a House rule the other day that said, if you are going to propose a new program of some sort, then, as a part of that enacting legislation, you actually have to eliminate another program of equal or greater spending; the idea being that if we have come up with the newest great new idea, that I ought to find somewhere else in the Federal activities that there is a program that is less important than my new one. The idea being is, if I can't find something that is less important than my new program, then what I am effectively telling the taxpayers of this country is this new program is the least important thing the Federal Government could do. And for goodness sake, why would we do that? 
   And so the idea is to help us begin to set priorities. Talk is cheap, and we all, both sides, talk about setting priorities and all those kinds of things. But this would help put some teeth in the idea of forcing Congress to make choices between two good things. I am not talking about good and bad. Anybody can make those decisions. But we have got to make choices between two good things a lot of times as to where we spend our money. Families do that. Businesses do that. And all of us have to do that, except at the Federal Government level. So in an attempt to help us learn how to set priorities, this ``no new programs'' would be a small step in that direction. 
   The other thing that I have done and I have actually got two of the Blue Dogs to cosponsor, original cosponsors on my savings and appropriations concept. If we come in here, and our experiences so far with the Democrats is that the rule under which we debate things that we are passing has not provided us opportunities to amend them. I mean, it is a closed rule. We did it to them; they are doing it to us. That is just kind of the way it works. But on appropriation bills, those are the one opportunity that we have where the Rules Committee is not in between us and what needs to get done. And with all due deference to my former member of the Rules Committee, this is an opportunity for those of us on the floor to suggest changes in the appropriations process that we think are appropriate. 
   Under the current scheme, if we amend an appropriations bill to reduce the spending in that bill, common sense would say that that money doesn't get spent. That is not how this system works. That money goes back to the committee and is spent somewhere else. So while we are able to get an amendment that the 218 of us would agree that spending shouldn't occur, it gets spent somewhere else. 
   So what this law would say is that when that happens, if we are able to overrun the appropriators, and the appropriators legitimately hate this idea, but if we are able to get 218 of us, whether it is, in our case now, it has got to have some Democrats now to help us out, but we are able to reduce an appropriations bill by some amount, that that will actually reduce the 302A and 302B allocations and all of that machination that goes on so that we would actually not spend that money.     
   It would reduce the deficit or increase a surplus, if we ever got to that particular place. I have got a couple of Democrats who have agreed to cosponsor, so I am encouraged by that, that we can, in fact, begin to work on the spending side of what we have got going on here.  
   I want to again thank Mr. Shuster for having this out here tonight. 
   When Congress saw fit to increase the section 179, throwing a little code at you, section 179 deduction for businesses or small business deduction where you can immediately expense up to $100,000 of business property that you put in service, that was a huge boon to small businesses. 
   It allowed them to immediately write off the cost of having to put new equipment into service, and as Mr. Neugebauer has already said, when his plumber friend bought a new truck, he had to have somebody drive that truck. In all likelihood there was a swamper on that truck so he put two more people to work. 
   That happened thousands of times across this great country. It was part of that impetus, part of this push to get us out of this recession that we were in 2001, 2002 and 2003, that single piece was a great part of what helped do that. That was directly positive for small businesses, and it is one of those that we continue to extend, but will go away unless this Congress acts to keep renewing it. 
   One final story. In talking with folks about the death tax back in the district, I tell them that probably the most dangerous week for anyone who has assets and beneficiaries is the week between Christmas of 2010 and New Year's Day. Here is why: 
   If you have got assets that you have worked hard for your life, but you got beneficiaries, you are going to get those assets when you die, if you are still breathing on January 1 of 2011, then those beneficiaries immediately have a 55 percent partner called the Federal Government. 
   My advice to those folks is to go ahead and have Christmas with your family, but then you probably ought to make yourself real scarce unless, if the current law stays in place where the death tax goes completely away in 2010, and the Federal Government has no claim on your assets when you die, to January 1 of 2011, when the Federal Government gets a 55 percent claim on those assets. So those of you who have assets, if we aren't able to get the laws changed and effect that, you probably ought to make yourself pretty scarce around your beneficiaries post-Christmas and January 1. Good luck with that. 
   I would like to thank my good colleague, Mr. Shuster, for having this hour tonight, sponsoring it. I hope to participate with you in the future.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me just, on your point, most business, every business, has to decide what they are going to charge for their product or their service. It is one of those key decisions every business manager has to make. 
   Because if they set their prices too high, they will not sell enough units. Obviously if they set it too low, they will not make as much money as they should. So most times the businesses decide to lower that price in order to get volume up, in order to sell more. 
   The Federal Government doesn't exactly do that; but the truth of the matter is, if we do raise taxes, you will get a short-term blip; tell people, until that begins to act, in effect a fine on doing well, and having a negative impact on the economy. Businesses have to make that decision, and I think the Federal Government ought to be in that same mind-set as well.

But the alternative minimum tax is another tax that we in the Republican majority basically kicked the can down the road a year at a time; this Congress under the Democratic leadership will have to do the same thing because it is a tax increase that is on the horizon that requires Congress to do something or the tax comes in. 
   We were unable to put a permanent fix in place, and full or fair disclosure. I actually had to pay the alternative minimum tax this year, and it ticked me off.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me add one point to what you just said. The bill we passed this evening to make the world quote, unquote, a safer place, which I voted against, one, in my view, of the fatal flaws to that is we don't know how much that costs. There were open-  ended blank check authorizations in that bill for so much money and for such time as is needed. 
   So the first rattle out of the box, the first substantive piece of legislation that the other side proposed and put forward had these open-ended spending issues in there. You know, the cost is not necessarily always the determinative factor, but I grew up in a world where I had to ask what things cost, and I suspect most folks do. I factor that into a cost benefit analysis that we all make every single day. 
   It is one of those fatal flaws to the very first piece of legislation that our colleagues on the other side put forward today, of substance. The rules we did last week, that is one thing. But today's piece, couldn't score it from CBO. They don't have a clue what we authorized in terms of new spending, new programs, new dollars that we have to take away from good hardworking Americans. I appreciate the time.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Let me just add a little bit to what my good friend is talking about. 
   In 2011, the portion of your estate that is not taxable drops back to $1 million. You know, $1 million sounds like a lot of money, and it is, don't get me wrong. I had a staffer the other day who made the comment that $12 million wasn't much money. And I said, ``Well, who has got a checkbook?'' So one of them got out a personal check, and I said, ``Tear a deposit slip out of that checkbook.'' So they tore it out, and I handed it to the staffer, and I said, ``Put $12 million on that deposit slip.'' And they said, ``Well, it won't fit.'' I said, ``Okay, well, $12 million is a lot.'' 
   One million dollars is a lot of money. But in today's environment, with property values having gone to what they are, it doesn't take a super successful individual to get at that $1 million and much above that when you 
   add in their house and life insurance and those kinds of things. So when the other side talks about the death tax, they typically throw out Warren Buffett or Bill Gates or these other bazillionaires as examples why we need to redistribute that wealth. 
   The truth of the matter is this tax hits smalltown America. I was at dinner tonight with an individual who had some property west of Fort Worth, west of Aledo, actually, maybe in your district, that 4 or 5 years ago was selling for $750 an acre. And because of the growth in population, growth of Aledo and other areas, now that land is $46,000 an acre, and so that family has suddenly gone into a pretty good sizeable estate. 
   Now, it is their money. They took the risk of owning that property. They took the risk of trying to make a living off that property, paying the property taxes year after year after year on that property, and now the Federal Government in January 1, 2011, becomes a 55 percent partner in that deal. 
   This is the one tax that I think is just fundamentally wrong. We are always going to have taxes collected in some way or another. We have got to find the minimum amount of money needed to fund the Federal Government, and that has got to be taxes. But the death tax ought to be one that we wean ourselves from and get away from it because it is fundamentally flawed. It is unfair, and it is really one that hurts small America, and it has generational ripple effects. You and I both have constituents who tell us time and again they are paying for their own property a second and third time because when grand-dad died, they had to borrow money to pay it off. They just got that paid off, and then their dad died and passed it down, they had to borrow money to pay the estate taxes, and now they have got it paid off. So that cycle is just flat out fundamentally unfair.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for letting me join him tonight in this Special Order. 
   I want to talk first about PAYGO, and then I want to talk about something a little closer to home for Texans, and that is the way sales taxes are treated in the budget and under the current Tax Code. 
   For the entire time I have been here in Congress, which is a relatively short period of time, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pounded away this idea, using the term ``PAYGO.'' ``Pay as you go'' is the phrase, which rolls easily off the tongue but can have a multitude of definitions. And most of the folks in District 11 who hear the term ``PAYGO,'' in other words, that you are going to pay for something as you go along, it really makes a lot of sense to them under a more traditional definition of that phrase. 
   This past week we had an interesting parliamentary ploy that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle used in order to get a vote on whether or not the delegate from Washington, DC would have voting privileges. And that  is, it was debated at length last week, and it did pass. But it had a fiscal limit attached to it. It cost money. And our colleagues across the aisle, particularly the Blue Dogs, had made a huge point over the last 2-plus years of not wanting to pass anything where any new spending wasn't offset with either, in their preference, tax increases, and the second least likely choice would be to reduce spending in other areas to in effect offset that so that any new spending would be paid for, as that phrase is used, with tax increases or, less likely, spending cuts in other areas. 
   Well, the first bill that passed last week had an interesting rule attached to it in which our colleagues from the Rules Committee had said that if a bill passes on the floor of the House, if the companion bill does not pass, then in spite of the fact that the first bill passed on its own, neither bill would be able to be sent to the Senate if the latter bill didn't pass. 
   The latter one is the one I want to talk about tonight, and that was the bill that was passed in order to pay for the additional spending for the delegate converted to a Member and the new Member for Utah is going to cost. Now, in terms of West Texans, it is a lot of money. But in terms of the overall budget and the numbers that we typically deal with here in D.C., it is a relatively modest amount of money. But, nevertheless, it is new spending. 
   So the bill that did pass was to, in effect, alleviate the PAYGO violation that the first bill created by spending new money without offsetting it with increased taxes on someone or decreases in spending. And what the bill did was simply accelerate or increase the amount of estimated tax payments that taxpayers who make more than $5 million in adjusted gross income each year have to pay in. 
   Now, admittedly, folks who make more than $5 million a year in adjusted gross income are not a particularly sympathetic group. They are easy targets; so this increase in the estimated tax payment would pay for the additional spending on a strict cash-flow basis. 
   Now, what they have done, in effect, with this mechanism is to take an advance on next month's salary to pay for this month's expenses, which creates a very interesting definition of PAYGO. It is not by any means a traditional definition of PAYGO, but as I noted last time I looked, most of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted in favor of what I would call a very twisted version of PAYGO to get out from under this taint that their first bill passed. 
   The mechanics are that folks who make more than $5 million a year in adjusted gross income have to make quarterly estimated tax payments, in addition to whatever withholding they may make on their salaries, in order that on April 15 of the following year they have paid in all of the money that they will owe in taxes that year, estimated to have made. 
   So they will make a payment on April 15 for their 2007 taxes. They will make a payment on June 15 for 2007 taxes. They will make a payment on September 15, and then they will make a final payment on January 15 that should, in effect, pay 100 percent of their 2007 tax bill. 
   What this provision does is it creates a safe harbor for those folks that says if their income went up substantially from one year to the next, then they may have paid in less money than is due for that year.     
   The mechanics of this is the Tax Code creates a safe harbor for these taxpayers. It says if you've paid in 100 percent of what your actual was the year before, and you've paid that in by April 15 and your ultimate tax liability is a lot more than that, then there are no penalties and interest associated with it if you do the catch-up on April 15. 
   So what the bill last week did is it increased that safe harbor number by one-tenth of a percent. Now, this is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo for most folks back home, but basically what this does is we have borrowed the money to pay for these additional expenses from someone that may or may not owe additional taxes. And, in fact, the bill sponsor from the other side specifically said at the end of his conversation on the floor last week that his bill raised taxes on no Americans, did not raise any new tax, did not raise any taxes. 
   So what we had here is a cash flow issue that accelerated some cash flow to the Federal Government, and under this scoring mechanism that we use, it appears that PAYGO has not been violated, it has been honored. But basically what we've done with this version of PAYGO, and apparently there are going to be multiple versions of PAYGO that get talked about on this House floor, this version of PAYGO simply says that if we can take an advance from next month's salary to pay for next month's expenses, then we're okay, and we will worry about next month next month. So this is a very interesting concept for PAYGO. It is not the traditional PAYGO that most folks in District 11 would understand and agree to. It is a new version.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. In its purest form it would mean that any new spending that this House decides is good Federal new spending, whether that's new, new spending or a growth in expenditures that is built into current mechanisms, would be paid for, in effect, by raising taxes, new taxes from somewhere, or reducing expenses in some other place in this Federal Government so that you have a net zero. In its purest form it would apply to both new programs as well as existing entitlements that grow on their own, that we would continue to keep the number, in effect, flat if we are using offsets against expenses; or if we increased it, we would increase taxes to pay for it so that the deficit wouldn't get any worse or any better under PAYGO. We wouldn't cause any problems with new legislation that would cause the Federal deficit, in effect, to go up by either doing like we do at home, getting a part-time job to help pay for those other expenses, or making some tough hard choices on priorities, setting priorities to reduce spending in some other area to provide for monies for this new spending that may be coming in. 
   So that is PAYGO in its purest form. It's unusual, not likely that we would get, collectively, both sides of the aisle to agree to that strict a term of PAYGO. The PAYGO that will probably be used often is some variation of what you may have heard about tonight, and others. Spending that grows on its own under the entitlements programs that are out there probably isn't subject to PAYGO. We won't have to offset that or increase expenses anywhere else. We just let that continue to grow out. So there will be a variety of definitions. 
   So what I hope to be able to communicate to the folks in District 11, and, Mr. Speaker, what I hope other Americans understand is that when they hear the phrase ``PAYGO,'' it is all in the definition. It is all about what does it mean. Because apparently PAYGO has a variety of meanings in these Chambers from time to time. And the one that was used last week, in my view, is flawed in the purest sense of PAYGO. 
   So if you would indulge me a couple more minutes to talk about sales taxes, that is particularly important to folks from Texas. 
   The tax extensions and the tax changes that were brought about 2001-2003 and more recently extended into 2006 address some inequities between States that have State income taxes and States that don't. Texas is one of those States that does not have a State individual income tax and, as such, funds its State and local governments through property taxes and sales taxes, along with a lot of other fees and excise taxes, those types of things. 
   But under our current Federal Income Tax Code, all States that have income taxes, those citizens get to deduct their income taxes from their Federal taxable income in order to get to a net tax; in other words, they are not paying Federal tax on the monies that they have to pay into their State governments. They get a deduction for that, and that's fine. 
   But to States like Texas, since we have no income tax, we don't get a deduction. In the past, beginning in 1986 and forward, off and on again, Texans were allowed to deduct their sales taxes in lieu of a State income tax. So a citizen could look at whichever tax they paid and deduct that, and it would  put those citizens on a more equitable footing with citizens from States that pay taxes. In effect, what you get, if citizens from non-income tax States don't get to make that deduction, then they in effect are paying a higher Federal income tax than taxpayers in equivalent circumstances in States with an income tax, and that is inequitable and should be addressed. 
   So the impact specifically on Texans, if this is not fixed, would be that the average tax increase per taxpayer, as computed by the Heritage Foundation, the average tax increase per taxpayer, not family, but per taxpayer, for Texans, would be $2,755 per year beginning in 2011. The loss of income per capita, and this is income lost on top of the increased taxes, is $510 per person. And Texas will lose, as a result of this, estimated in 2012, 75,000-plus jobs. 
   Let me talk in a little further detail on District 11, which I represent. The tax increase there per person will be a little bit less than the state-wide average. We will have a tax increase per taxpayer of $2,091 a year, about $200 a month almost. And then on top of that there will be another $974 that each taxpayer will lose in income on top of this tax increase. And there will be 2,153 jobs lost across the district. 
   This happens if we allow this unfair, inequitable circumstance to exist between States that have State income taxes and States that don't at the Federal level. And I am hoping that, while it's not provided for this year in the budget that was passed, I am hopeful that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see this as one of those opportunities for tax equity in our Tax Code, and we will put in the right provisions in the next tax bill that would allow Texans to deduct sales taxes in lieu of their Federal income tax. 
   My colleague from Pennsylvania, I appreciate you giving me this time tonight, and I yield back.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I had one more comment. I was also sitting with my older son, who is a broker with Merrill Lynch. And while his CPA was handing him his tax return, he was going through it, looking at it and he suddenly discovered that he owed a relatively sizeable amount of alternative minimum tax. And we will go through that concept on another night, but this is a tax that is going to catch a growing number of middle-income Americans that is, in effect, a tax increase on him. So once he discovered that he had now become subject to the alternative minimum tax, he was, shall I say, less than pleased with that number and is looking forward to this Chamber addressing the alternative minimum tax as a part of the overall tax fix. We are trying to come up with a tax scheme that collects the minimum amount of money needed to fund this Federal Government.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I need to correct something. The sales tax issue that I was talking about is included within the overall numbers that I talked about. Those overall numbers are the same ones that compare to the $3,000 tax hit that you will have. The sales tax issue is included with the other expiring Tax Code provisions that we were able to implement in 2001 and 2003. 
   So the numbers I quoted was not just sales taxes, but sales tax is an element in Texas of $2,755 increase, in District 11 a $2,391 increase. So it is more than just a sales tax. I think I misspoke earlier in our conversation when I was talking about sales taxes. That sales tax issue is included in that number as well.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, last August a man named Mike Flynt attempted to use his final year of college eligibility by walking on at Sul Ross State University in Alpine, Texas. He endured the rigors of two-a-days and made the team. Although a nagging groin injury prevented him from participating in games through the first half of the season, his leg healed to the point that he could participate in several games on special teams and, in the final game of the season, played at linebacker for the final defensive series. 
   Mr. Speaker, so far, this story is not unusual. However, Mike Flynt's story is unique in that he will turn 60 years of age next year. Mike and I graduated from high school together and played on the first State championship team at Odessa Permian. 
   Mike fulfilled a 30-year desire to compete one more time in a game he loves. His efforts and accomplishments amaze us all. He was an inspiration to his teammates, coaches and fellow Sul Ross students. His efforts brought positive publicity to a small university in far west Texas. 
   Mr. Speaker, in a world where athletes often seem to let us down, it's refreshing to see the example of hard work, dedication and perseverance that is Mike Flynt.

   Tomorrow the Democrats will roll out their new energy policy. As we evaluate these proposals, it is our job to challenge them. If these new proposals cost more American jobs than they create, let's challenge them. If these new proposals unnecessarily increase costs to American consumers, let's challenge those. If these new proposals make us more dependent on foreign sources of natural gas and crude oil than we currently are, let's challenge those. If these proposals really result in less energy for America, let's challenge those.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   Perhaps the next couple of hours, and certainly most of all day tomorrow, Member after Member on our side will come down here to these microphones and attempt to reduce spending in this appropriations bill. My amendment would fix a problem that they will have should they be successful in any of their amendments. 
   Under our existing rules, the existing processes under which we work, the budget is passed and is allocated among the various programs under what we call a 302(b) allocation. Each of these subcommittees bring their bills down here in a total amount to be spent. As I have mentioned, Member after Member will come down here to attempt to convince a majority of us to reduce the spending that is included in the bill. Should they be successful, it's not likely but should they be successful in reducing that spending the little known secret, unknown outside the Beltway, is that the actual total amount of spending under the 302(b) allocation will not change, no matter what we do here on this floor. It stays where it is. 
   And so what my amendment would do, it would be to take those successful attempts to reduce spending and would funnel those dollars against the deficit that this country will continue to experience in 2008. If you look at the budget that was passed by the Democrats, the budget shows a deficit for this year. So should we be successful on any of these bills, my amendment would allow the savings to go against the deficit and in future years should we have a surplus, it would actually allow the surplus to increase. 
   So it's a pretty straightforward concept. Most folks back home understand when they save money in certain areas on spending, they have that money available to spend somewhere else, to put in savings, to reduce debt, to do all the kinds of things, but under our arcane system here, that money simply stays with the committee and through some process in conference gets spent again should we be successful. 
   I understand there's a point of order that lies against this. I do not intend to push it, and I will withdraw my amendment, but I seek to point this out one more time to anyone who might be listening at this early hour in Hawaii or late here on the east coast. 
   I would also like to get acknowledgment that I'm getting my amendment out of the way tonight as opposed to tomorrow when the heavy lifting on the spending cuts will occur. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (BUDGET SCHOOL: THE RIGHT TO KNOW HOW WASHINGTON SPENDS YOUR MONEY -- (House of Representatives - April 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee for yielding me time. I always enjoy hearing the young whippersnapper from Wisconsin, who has been here for a long time, his thoughts, the ranking member of the Budget Committee and also serves on Ways and Means. 
   A couple of points that I would like to add on or pile on with what my good colleague from Wisconsin talked about. You will hear in these chambers over the next several weeks, months and years that the Democrats do not intend to raise taxes on everybody, as the charts have shown is going to happen if we do nothing. Their intentions are good. They don't intend to raise the lowest tax rate from 10 percent to 15 percent, or a 50 percent increase in tax rates. They don't intend to do that. 
   But by these budget proposals they brought in in the last 2 years, they commit all of the money that those increased taxes raise. So in order for them to make good on their promise of not raising, as example, the 10 percent rate to 15 percent, they have got to raise taxes somewhere else in the system to make up for those revenues. 
   So your chart says we have a right to know how Washington spends its money. We also have a right to know how Washington raises its money as well, and that is one of the categories that this one falls into. 
   I have seven grandkids, about the same age as Paul's young children, and when I look at what we are doing in this Federal Government, I try to translate that into what impact it has on their lives, on their opportunities when they are in our positions. 
   We have built a world around the concept that let's take care of today's problems with tomorrow or the next day's money. As we look at the problems that face us, and they are daunting, no doubt about it, if they are worthy of being fixed, then they are worthy of taking our money to fix those problems and not taking money away from our kids and our grandchildren to do that fix. 
   When folks come to Washington from Texas to ask me what can we do, how can we help you do your job better, every single time I go through this speech about $53 trillion in unfunded promises that we made to each other, a process that we have to begin the renegotiation of those promises, and that they as community leaders have to begin self-assessing whether or not what they are 
   asking Washington to do has a constitutional link to the Federal Government. 
   In other words, if they want money for a particular project in San Angelo, Texas, or Midland, Texas, is it right to take tax dollars away from somebody in El Paso to pay for that project, or is that a project that ought to be handled by the local folks? Because as Paul said, every time you ask the Federal Government for help in something, that means spending goes up, and we have a very terrible time of saying no. 
   So if we can get our community leaders, our mayors and county judges and others to do a better job of analyzing what they are asking us for so that it really does have a constitutional Federal nexus to what they are trying to get done, then that is a step in the right direction to make this happen. 
   I want to talk a little bit about the budget process, because that is really where the spending piece of this wreck occurs. I serve on the Budget Committee with Mr. Ryan, and that top line number is incredibly important, because whatever it is set at, whether it is on a vote between the two Houses or a vote in the House or then some sort of gentleman's agreement with the Senate, that amount of money is going to get spent, come hell or high water. 
   There is no way to stop it, because as the appropriations bills come to this floor, they have already allocated that top line number among each of the subcommittees. And if we on the floor are able to work to win an amendment to the appropriations bill that strips spending out in some fashion--now, we never win those, but we come down here and try every time--should lightning strike and we actually strip a program out of an appropriations bill, that money does not get saved. That money simply goes back to the committee to spend on something else. Our budgetary processes don't allow us to come down here and effectively drop that top line number. 
   So I have a bill in the hopper that says if we are successful in reducing the spending in a particular appropriations bill, that that money goes to offset the deficit, or that money does not get spent, which is how most folks in West Texas thought our system would work up here. If we won a fight on the floor on a vote of more than half the Members that the Appropriations Committee got it wrong and that they sent a priority that that money should not have gotten spent on, that is money we could save in the budget and not get spent. So working to try to correct that is awfully difficult.

What it says is the Appropriations Committee, in all of the hard and worthy work they do, they get one bite at the apple of setting priorities. We give them the top line number. They get a bite at it. And if they bring that bite to the floor and more than half of us disagree with what they did, then that money should be saved to the taxpayer, go against the deficit or increase a surplus, should we ever get into it. That is not the way the mechanics of our system work today.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman. I want to make one more point, and I will yield back and visit with the gentlelady from Tennessee, and that a third of the budget that we work on every year is annual discretionary spending. In other words, it's money that we should be deciding, can we afford this this year or can't we, a legitimate setting of priorities. 
   The other two-thirds of the $3.1 trillion that we spend is going to happen on autopilot. It will happen whether we do anything or not. We have to act aggressively and make hard decisions to go after that two-thirds. 
   This year's budget proposal took a pass on the hard work of addressing the two-thirds of the budget that we referred to as entitlements or mandatory spending or automatic spending--I won't offend some of my colleagues by using the word ``entitlement''--but it takes courage in this body to go after those spending programs. 
   They are the ones that are on the charts, are driving us to bankruptcy under our current system of government if we don't have courage to begin to say we have to renegotiate those promises. We have made promises that we just can't pay for. 
   But a third of the budget that we can do something about, we ought to have rules on this floor that allow the majority's will to be reflected in whether that money gets spent. I yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank my colleague from Texas for allowing me to rise. 
   I, too, support the short-term extension of this bill. But you cannot talk about the regulation of the airline industry without talking about jet fuel prices. As has already been stated in a variety of ways, airlines are experiencing dramatic increases in their cost of fuel. They're trying to cope, they're struggling to cope with these high prices, but baggage fees and soda fees and blanket rentals are not going to get there in terms of allowing them to become profitable again. They need more jet fuel at a cheaper price. 
   One of our problems is additional refining capacity. We don't build refineries in America anymore. We import some 3 million barrels of refined products every day. Even Iran recognizes that they're vulnerable and have announced a doubling of their refining capacity so that they no longer have to import refined products, and yet we continue to do that. 
   As we take steps and measures are brought to this floor, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to understand the impact that those have. I am told that we will have a bill on the floor later on this afternoon on price gouging--in the face of all evidence that there has never been any price gouging--that they want to try to curtail. This price gouging bill that they will bring again will have a chilling effect on anybody who wants to build a refinery because it will place grave uncertainties as to whether or not, during times of emergencies or times of shortages, that the market will be able to function the way the market is supposed to. 
   So I urge my colleagues to vote for this short-term extension, but we also ought to be about rational, thoughtful approaches to increasing the fuel supply in this country, whether it's diesel for truckers, gasoline for cars or homes, or jet fuel. 
   We can fix this problem. We really need to quit talking by each other and understand that the extremes don't work. The path is in the middle of responsible development of American resources and American energy to reduce our vulnerabilities and, at a minimum, address a crying need these airlines are trying to deal with, and that is higher jet fuel prices. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Well, I thank my colleague from Texas, and I want to say a few things. We'll get to some of our other speakers who are here tonight before we get into the heart of what you and I intend to talk about. 
   Mr. Speaker, the serious business of providing energy for America, whether that energy is electricity to light the lights in this hall or to run manufacturing facilities or gasoline, whether it is diesel or jet fuel to move people and goods and us around, is serious business. Yet our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not treating it seriously. This week's get-out-of-town energy strategy included four peripheral bills that are not intended to really deal with it or intended to give cover, political cover, for the folks who voted for these four bills. 
   Next week, when we all go home to our constituents, we'll have to look them in the eye and tell them that, yes, we've done absolutely nothing to address the cost of gasoline that you're paying. The interesting thing about gasoline is that we may not buy gasoline every single day, but as we drive around, we see the price posted all over town, and I dare say that every single driver looks at the price to check to see what it is. Even though you may not intend to buy gasoline that day, you check those prices constantly. So it's constantly in front of our minds as it is when we have town halls or telephone town halls. 
   The get-out-of-town strategy included a price-gouging bill--again, puffery--because seven DOE and Federal Trade Commission price-gouging studies over the last decade have shown absolutely no evidence whatsoever of price gouging. This serious business of providing gasoline to consumers at prices that they can afford has been reduced to sloganism: ``Use it or lose it.'' ``We can't drill our way out of these problems.'' They're casual, offhand, flippant comments that don't do the seriousness of this issue justice. A 30-second sound bite works well on a television commercial, but at the heart of the matter, these are complicated issues that deserve and that should get serious consideration on both sides of the aisle. 
   The solutions aren't Republican. The solutions aren't Democratic. The solutions are what are best for America. To the extent that we can begin to delve deeper into what the issue might be and into what the solution might be, the better off we are, but as long as we're just very cavalier about what we're doing with the get-out-of-town energy policy or with the sloganism that seems to permeate everything that we do with respect to energy, we will not solve this issue. 
   Gasoline prices will continue to rise. Electricity costs will continue to go up as natural gas prices rise and as we use more and more natural gas to generate electricity. So we are not about the good work of trying to find solutions. We are simply about the bad work of being very casual, very cavalier and very unthoughtful, quite frankly, about this particular issue. 
   So I look forward to hearing the comments from the other two speakers we have with us tonight, and then I look forward to delving a little deeper into things that I've already talked about. 
   With that, I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (AMERICA'S FAILED ECONOMIC AND ENERGY POLICIES -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for hosting this night's hour. I hope that it helps some of our colleagues learn a little bit more about the oil business. One of the things that is true in almost every area is that before you begin to regulate something, before you begin to try to control something, you really ought to understand it first. And the lack of understanding, not malicious, but it's not in their professional background. But the lack of understanding of most of our colleagues about the oil business and how it happens is--most of that information is limited to the ``Dallas'' TV show and J.R. Ewing, which was anything but the truth. 
   The interesting thing about Section 526 is that it basically says the Federal Government can't buy fuel from unconventional sources unless it can be proven that the lifecycle greenhouse emissions are less for the unconventional source than under the conventional source. 
   What this mechanically does is it takes a tremendous buying power of the Federal Government out of the development phase of getting to unconventional and new sources of ways to drive our cars that are better. The Federal Government has great capacity to buy and buys great quantities, particularly the Department of Defense, and we've now pushed that market aside in terms of being able to use that market to be able to develop these alternatives. 
   In addition, we've said that rather than buying fuel from tar sands in Canada, which no one can prove whether or not the lifecycle of greenhouse gases is more or less under those circumstances, we can't buy that fuel, but we can buy fuel and crude oil from countries that are, at best, not our allies. 
   In fact, we have recently passed on the floor of this House, hopefully it won't get any further in the Senate, the opportunity for Americans to sue OPEC to increase OPEC production. Again, an example of how the wrongheaded energy policy has become under the leadership that currently runs this House. 
   On the one hand, we will sue OPEC to increase production, on the other hand, we say it is not in our best interest to have oil and gas production from stable sources like the Outer Continental Shelf of the United States or the Rocky Mountains of the United States. We don't want to produce those resources, but we want to sue OPEC to force them to produce more crude oil that we would, in fact, buy. 
   I'm also anxious to see how OPEC is going to respond to that by allowing--setting in place the mechanisms to allow their citizens to sue America to force America to produce its own energy. And the reason they would do that, of course, is that crude oil is a worldwide market, and to the extent that America is withholding her crude oil from the market, she is, in effect, pushing up the price of crude oil worldwide. So on the one hand, we want to sue OPEC, force them to produce their barrels, but on the other hand, we don't want to produce our own barrels which would go into the worldwide supply and would help bring down that cost. 
   Now, I suspect there is some crafty Federal Trade Commission lawyer that would look at America as creating some sort of a tort within that system by withholding specifically supplies off the market in order to push up the price of crude oil. I think that you could be arguing with that. 
   I wanted to walk through the energy work that we're going to take up this week. 
   One of them we've already taken up was the price gouging bill. Price gouging is an interesting phenomenon. There's no real good definition for it. It's pretty vague and in the eye of the beholder. But the price gouging bill that we took up today would have penalized gasoline retailers for trying to adjust their prices during a time of emergency to equalize supply shortages and demand circumstances in those shortages. The market is the best allocator of that resource, and it happens to be on price. 
   So what we were setting our retailers up for, must of which are mom-and-pop shops or small convenience store chains, or corporations like Valero, which is simply a refiner and also a retailer of gasoline, for the fall of this deal because if this bill had passed today, the Federal crime that would have been committed was ill-defined. 
   And I want to read briefly from a CRA international study done back in 2007 talking about price gouging.  
   It says, Under legislation that threatens to punish acts that are defined vaguely and ambiguously, the behavior of the enforcing agencies is inherently unpredictable. And businesses potentially affected by the legislation could form expectations of prosecutorial conduct that could discourage the efficient functioning of markets. Excessively harsh penalties for setting the wrong price could give pause to market decisions that are critical to alleviate shortages, especially if individuals, unsure about the actions of the enforcers, were to adopt very conservative behavior so as to ensure compliance with the law. 
   The result would be exactly the opposite to the good intentions of the legislation's authors, disincentives to 
   provide additional ..... the waste occasioned by gas lines and the failure to allocate supplies to those who benefit the most. 
   And then finally, this FTC study is in fact only the most recent assessment of claims of gasoline price gouging. In the last decade, the United States Department of Energy and the FTC have investigated all of the numerous incidences of regional price spike--gasoline price spikes. Their conclusion in every case has been that gasoline prices increases--gasoline price increases were due to the operation of supply and demand in light of an interruption of supply and that the magnitude of price increases was consistent with the magnitude of the loss of supply. There has never been a finding that gasoline price increases were caused by manipulation of the markets. 
   And yet we continue to hammer away at price gouging, the second time at least that this bill has come up, and it failed again today. 
   There is also a title of a bill that will deal with speculators in the market. And as of early this afternoon, we've not seen the actual language of that bill. But it is an attempt to go after speculators. Now, it's interesting that the ag committee that I serve on, the full committee had a hearing today in which Walter Lukken, who's the acting chairman of the CFTC, the Commodities Futures Trading Corporation, which oversees the speculative market in crude oil, among other things, testified today that while he is constantly on the lookout for potential manipulation by speculators and/or other participants in the market, that they have seen no evidence that those speculators are having undue influence on the price of crude oil. And then in fact the price of crude oil is set by supply and demand as best they can tell it. 
   But they are on the lookout every single day. And again, Mr. Lukken feeds his family trying to protect markets from manipulation like the speculators might have an impact on. 
   The other bill is a ``use it or lose it'' that my colleague from Texas has already talked about. One of the other facts--it's interesting. If we say facts around here, if you say a wrong fact often enough, and often enough as we clearly do, it becomes legend; and that 68 million acres is tossed about by every member of the Democratic leadership, 68 million acres. We have asked how they came up with that number. The Bureau of Minerals Management can't figure out how they've come up with it. The Department of Interior can't figure out how they've come up with it. And we've gone to the leadership and said, We don't know if that number is right or wrong. Tell us how you got to that number. And much like the extrapolated production numbers that our colleagues just talked about, they won't tell us. 
   All they'll say is that the majority staff of the Natural Resources Committee came up with this number. Now, we don't know if it's good or bad without knowing what it is. So we're having to defend against a number that may have just been flat-out made up. But our colleagues across the aisle won't come forward with their methodology to help us understand what they've done. 
   And it's a pretty clear statement. If you're going to beat us about the head and shoulders with a number of 68 million acres, then you need to prove to us what that is and how you came to it and whether or not we should be beat about the head and shoulders with it. 
   And then the final bill which we take up is something referred to as the Saving Energy Through Public Transportation Act of 2008. This is an attempt to help Federal employees cope with these higher commuting costs through public transportation and reimbursements for that, which is not a bad thing, but it clearly shows how tone deaf our colleagues across the aisle are. 
   They will listen to their employees who are saying we're having a hard time getting to and from work and we need help to reimburse that, but not being able to understand that that is going on across the United States, that that's not limited to just Federal employees. 
   So they've taken the position that it's a good thing to try to help Federal employees help deal with and cope with these higher gasoline prices, but let's ignore the rest of America who are actually paying the taxes that would have to be used to pay for those commuting costs. 
   So looking forward to my colleagues' continued comments on these and other issues, the 526 bill, Section 526 repeal is important. We've made several attempts at it. We've included with that a refinery siting bill that would ask the President or require the President to locate no fewer than three potential unused military bases for sitings of refineries, go through all of the proper evaluation and permitting processes, and the governor of the States involved would have a veto. 
   But nonetheless, an attempt to say, Here are some places we can build refineries to help alleviate the strategic vulnerability that this country has. And so far, we've just been shut out on any attempt to move towards actual more and new production of crude oil and natural gas that would, in fact, deal with this issue of higher prices.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I want to thank our two colleagues for being with us tonight to talk about this. 
   What you're really talking about is an attack on the American lifestyle. We have built a Nation predicated on cheap gasoline because it has always had cheap gasoline, and we've built suburbs. We've expanded into rural areas. We've built a lifestyle that demands low gasoline prices. 
   And what we are telling Americans is that this Democratic-led Congress wants high gasoline prices and wants to attack the American lifestyle.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, in the immortal words of Doc Holiday in Tombstone, ``Our hypocrisy knows no bounds.'' Both sides equally applied. 
   The arguments earlier that half of a percent cut, 5 basis points of a cut, as if that's some sort of a draconian decision to be made, the truth of the matter is the committee, the subcommittee had a fixed amount of money to work with, and they chose to make some trade-offs. They chose to fund more here and less here, more here and less there. But none of those decisions that they made were couched in the terms of some sort of mean spiritedness. 
   And at the risk of prolonging the debate, which I think is an important debate for us to have, I'm going to offer up an amendment that I know has a point of order which stands against that. 
   Before I do that though, I'd like to quote something from Justice George Sutherland. A lot of us heard earlier about the way tax planning is done, used, misused, and it was used in the pejorative; that only big oil companies or other companies could use the code that we currently have in place, that you and I and our colleagues put in place, to affect their tax affairs and that families don't get to do that. Well, I would argue based on this quote: ``The legal right,'' and that's a right, ``of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his or her taxes, or altogether avoid them by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted.'' Gregory v. Helvering, Justice George Sutherland. 
   So as we listen to this debate about how much we ought to spend, let's understand that we put in place this code, and if we don't like the way that's done, then there are forums to debate that, and we ought to have that debate. But let's not denigrate people who are using the code we put in place to lower their tax liability and call that some sort of a pejorative. 
   This is the classic argument that you cannot throw enough money at any subject to fix it. And that's what we heard from the other side; that the more money you throw at it, the more you're going to fix the problem. And I don't necessarily agree with that. 
   My colleagues on the other side used the word ``take'' in reference to revenues from oil companies, and that's exactly what they would intend to do. They would take those revenues and spend them the way they would like to. Legitimate way of doing government. 
   I'll also argue that in the next 2 weeks we may have some sort of a conversation about an energy bill, and during that time frame we will argue vociferously that there's enough in reinvestment in domestic sources of energy, and those revenues taken from these mean, ugly oil companies would otherwise go back into that reinvestment into energy. 
   So, as I mentioned, our hypocrisy knows no bounds. 
   My amendment is simple. All of this great work that's been done, and bad work according to our colleagues on the other side, or wasteful work according to our colleagues on the other side, to try to reduce spending in the bill is for naught. 
   In addition to the ringing defeats that my colleagues endure, were they to be successful, the rules of this House do not allow those cuts to actually be implemented. If my colleague had actually won the argument that we could trim 5 cents out of $100 out of this budget, whichever budget, that money would still get spent. The money that stays within the 302(b) allocation, which is code for inside the beltway stuff, but then would simply not get spent. And so we've spent hours and hours and hours down here debating, trying to reduce the spending in a particular bill. 
   The harsh reality is that were we to win some of those amendments, it would simply be a piratic victory, because that money would still get spent. 
   My amendment, sense of Congress, would say were we to win one of those arguments, that money, the reduction in spending would actually go against the deficit, or, heaven forbid, that we would ever be in a surplus circumstance, that money would increase the surplus. 
   So this is something I'm trying to point out on each one of our bills, that we've got a goofy set of rules that only you and I understand, only you and I appreciate, and maybe only appropriators embrace, that does not allow all of this hard debate and work to really mean anything at the end of the day. 
   And so while I challenge my colleague's characterization of our use of this debate time as wasteful in some way, I think it's important for the American people to understand as they go about managing their affairs that we couch the terms of managing our affairs, their affairs through us, in those kinds of terms. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I understand that a point of order lies against this, and I will not prolong the debate much further. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn. 
   There was no objection.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chairman, this bill left our committee on a bipartisan basis and with my enthusiastic support. I agree with many of the laudatory comments made by my colleagues across the aisle. You will hear that there is a broad group of associations, commodity groups, and, most importantly, producers that support the bill that left our committee. 
   Now you need to know the rest of the story. My colleagues and I were repeatedly told that the necessary offsets would not come from tax increases. We have just heard Chairman Rangel confirm that his taxing committee provided taxes for the offset. I was misled, I hope unintentionally, but nonetheless misled. Over the last 48 hours, poison pills have been added that the cynical among us would conclude were intentional; short-sighted, but intentional. 
   Each of us must weigh the good and bad in all the legislation that we consider. Great judgment is required. Last week at this time, almost at this exact time, I fully expected to be here tonight perhaps fighting off bipartisan opposition to this bill, but nonetheless supporting this bill, not participating in a raw, partisan fight that was totally unnecessary. 
   This bill is proproducer and prohungry around the world, but it is antibusiness and antimanufacturing jobs. It is an affront to States rights and unnecessarily panders to unions. 
   Sadly, we have gone from a bill that should have passed with broad bipartisan support to one that will not enjoy that support. 
   Madam Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, for 18 months I've worked, along with my Democrat colleagues, to try to craft a bipartisan bill that we could be very proud of. Last week, it went through committee with some very hard work on both sides, both sides gave a little, got a little, and we thought left the committee with a great bipartisan bill, a bill which would have Democrats and Republicans for it, and perhaps Democrats and Republicans against it, but a bipartisan bill. We were assured on every turn there would not be a tax increase. 
   I was a member of the bipartisan whip team on Tuesday and was told as late as noon that there would be no tax increases to pay for the $4 billion. I was misled, and that's unfortunate. 
   All of the good bipartisan work accomplished by this committee has been squandered by, I believe, the top leadership of the Democratic Party in an attempt to strip Republican support for this bill away. We were going to have a bipartisan bill that was going to pass this floor. We're not going to have that now. 
   I vote against this rule. It's unfortunate that the other side has seen fit to waste the good bipartisan work that we did. If we can't trust what we tell each other, you cannot work in a bipartisan manner.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank Mr. Goodlatte for yielding. 
   The subcommittee rejected this bill's predecessor on a 0-18 vote. There were no hearings on this activity. We have already heard the chairman say that the unintended consequences just of the scoring of this has not been done. 
   This speaks to the fallacy of coming to this body tonight with a policy that is as broad and important for America as farm policy and to try to fix it with 20 minutes of debate on each side. It is just nonsense. This did not go through any hearings. We had field hearings, we had committee hearings, we had testimony from experts, we had testimony from producers throughout this process. And while that may have come to a result they don't like, it at least came to a result that has broad support. 
   This process that they are bringing to us tonight should be subjected to the same scrutiny, to the same opportunity to look at what it does and what it does not do that all of the farm bill that we are looking at tonight does. They have not done that, and they have a lot of unintended consequences, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kind amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (REPUBLICAN ENERGY POLICY -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman for his comments and for hosting our hour tonight. 
   We have been talking about this issue of energy and America's need for energy and America's supply of energy for quite some time now, and I hope we are making progress with certainly the American people, Mr. Speaker. I don't know that we are making much progress with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle as we continue to talk about American-sourced energy. Whether that is American-sourced oil production, American-sourced natural gas production, American-sourced coal, coal to liquids, American nuclear, American hydropower, American wind, American solar, American all of the above. And it seems lost on some of my colleagues that there is something inherently bad about American production. 
   Crude oil as an example is a worldwide commodity that nations around the world produce and nations around the world use. And the price is set in the world market, it is not set here in the United States, and the players in the world market pay for that crude oil and there is a big issue with supply and demand. 
   There is a relatively thin difference between total world supply and the total world demand. Currently, the supply is just barely in excess of the demand. And when you have got that thin a margin, disruptions or potential disruptions that are threats to producing areas cause the markets to get anxious about the delivery and the ultimate supply of the crude oil. So, consequently, you see a run-up of prices like we have seen recently, you see a decrease in prices. 
   It makes the price very volatile when the world produces about 86 million barrels a day and uses about 85 million barrels a day, that much of a disruption in any of the major suppliers will cause great anxiety among those folks who have to buy crude oil to run their refineries, those folks who have to buy that product, making sure they have got to it to keep their work in process moving and their production flow going. 
   Recently, Mr. Speaker, we have had an interesting phrase that has been thrown about that I think trivializes and ignores the true depth of this issue, and that is the Use It Or Lose It bumper sticker that served as the in-depth analysis of the problem that we face from some of my colleagues across the aisle. They throw out a figure of 68 million acres that is currently under lease by oil and gas companies as somehow being evidence that we are doing all we can to produce American-sourced crude oil and natural gas. We have got a series of questions that I would like them to answer for us about that 68 million since they seem to have come up with the number and know the most about it. 
   I would like them to analyze that 68 million to tell us how much of that 68 million was leased within the last 2 years. Certainly, no one rationally expects any oil company to be able to go through the bureaucratic exercises that they all have to go through in order to get all of the permissions from some up to 29 Federal agencies that they have to walk the tight ropes to get permission to drill in less than 2 years. 
   I would also like to know the amount of acreage that is currently in the bureaucratic morass that we put in place for all Federal leases, how of much that acreage is simply waiting on a decision from some bureaucrat deep in the bowels of the Department of Energy, deep in the bowels of EPA, deep in the bowels of Washington, wherever they are, to simply make a yes or no decision on a particular permit. Because I think there is a significant layer of that 68 million acres that is hung up with the bureaucrats waiting on their decision. In some instances it is a good-faith delay on the part of the bureaucrats, but I think in many instances it is just simply business as usual to slow play, to not make expeditious decisions on the applications to drill, the applications to conduct seismic, the applications for access, all those kinds of things that go on. 
   A third layer, Mr. Speaker, would be those acreage that cannot be developed because they are currently tied up in lawsuits. The experience of many folks who get a Federal lease one day is to be sued by the Sierra Club and others the next day just on general principles, because the environmentalists don't want us exploring on Federal lands, and so they will file frivolous lawsuits in most instances that continue to tie up acres for extended amounts of time, and don't allow these oil companies to move forward with the progress that they would want to. 
   I think a fourth layer, Mr. Speaker, of the 68 million acres would be those acres on which we are actually conducting drilling operations. There are some 1,800 drilling rigs working in the United States, many of those on Federal leases and offshore, and so there is a significant section I would believe of that 68 million that is actually being worked on and drilled right now that they are trying to determine if crude oil is there in commercial quantities, and we need to know what that is. 
   And then the final layer, Mr. Speaker, or next to the final layer would be those acres on which drilling has been conducted, commercial quantities of oil and gas that have been found, and the operator is simply waiting on those final bureaucratic permissions to run the flow 
   lines, to build the roads, to build the infrastructure needed to move the crude oil and natural gas from the wellhead into markets. 
   And then that final layer, Mr. Speaker, would be those acres that companies have looked at, they are still within the primary term, and they are not actively seeking production on those but they have paid the lease bonus on all of those acres as a permission to take that time, the 10 years on Federal offshore leases, to make their decision. And since they paid the piper, they ought to be able to maintain those leases through their primary term. And so to the extent that we voted that down in the last couple of weeks on this use it or lose it thing, I hope we can put it to bed in its final form. 
   We hear comments from time to time from our colleagues across the aisle that these oil and gas companies are sitting on production and holding it off the market in hopes of, I guess, getting a higher price. That begs the question of: How do oil and gas companies make money? They have onshore hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars invested, offshore billions of dollars invested of their shareholder money and equity capital and in many instances debt that they have invested in these oil and gas leases, and the only way they get any money back, the only way they get a return on those investment dollars is if they produce the crude oil and natural gas that they are exploring or set up to produce. 
   So there is actually no incentive for them to withhold production from the market in hopes of getting I guess a higher price, because the longer they take to produce the crude oil natural gas and sell it, the longer it takes for them to get their money back on the original investment, the lower the return on investment, and it is just bad business to try to do something like that. 
   It is an interesting concept that producers would withhold production from the market and that they get accused of doing that, when in fact if you look at the policies of this democratic majority, most or all of their policies do just that. The Democrats withhold American-sourced crude oil, American-sourced natural gas from the market; and particularly with respect to American-sourced crude oil, they are withholding that off of the market, holding that out of the worldwide supply, they are directing contributing to these higher prices that my colleagues are talking about and the higher prices that result in higher gasoline costs, diesel costs, and ultimately home heating costs this fall. 
   Let me leave you with this one thought, Mr. Speaker. I don't think anybody rationally thinks that we won't be using crude oil in 10 years. So as we look at America's potential for  production of crude oil over the next 10 years, why is it not good enough reason to do that simply to replace barrels of oil that we import from countries like Venezuela, like the Middle East, other places where the countries are at best maybe not our allies or in the instance of Venezuela an avowed opponent, why does it not make sense to replace production that we buy from bad guys with production that is produced here in the United States? Because the American production creates American jobs. American refineries create American jobs. So even if that is the only thing we are able to accomplish with all of this effort is to reduce the number of barrels that we buy from other folks, it helps balance the trade, it will strengthen the dollar. It does a lot of good and, to my view, it does limited, if any, harm to produce American crude oil and natural gas. 
   So as we conduct this debate, we do it on a lot of levels, but on one level it simply should say: Look, if we are importing crude oil and natural gas from other parts of the world while we have domestic crude oil that could be produced, we are making a foolish decision and a foolish allocation of resources to do that. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to drop the partisan rhetoric, drop the issue of just simply trying to maintain who gets elected in November, and let's deal responsibly with this issue of high crude oil prices and the resulting high gasoline prices that come with that. 
   So I want to thank my colleague from Texas for allowing me this time to speak.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (RETIREMENT OF DR. DAVID E. DANIEL -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the great educators in my hometown of Midland, Texas, Dr. David E. Daniel. David is retiring next month after 17 years as president of Midland College. 
   All of Midland owes a deep thanks to Dr. Daniel, who has worked tirelessly to create a community college that is part of the fabric of the city. His presidency has seen Midland College undergo many changes and emerge as a first-class educational institution. 
   The most visible aspect of Dr. Daniel's tenure is the building boom that has taken place across the campus. His administration built or renovated over a dozen campus buildings to help make more space for students and improve the classroom space at the school. Dr. Daniel has been instrumental in garnering the community support needed to finance this construction. 
   But more important than the physical improvements to the campus has been the culture of success that Dr. Daniel has installed in the school. His philosophy that every person can succeed if they are given the right motivation and opportunity has created a campus atmosphere that puts students first. 
   He has long understood that students are the reason for Midland College, and has never forgotten the trust they placed in him when they enrolled. 
   To be an educator is to be a purveyor of hope to those seeking to improve their lot in life. As Dr. Daniel looks back on his career, I hope he sees the thousands of lives he has touched. He has offered the opportunity of a better of life to every individual who has passed through the doors of the school. 
   I wish Dr. Daniel, my friend, David, my heartfelt thanks for guiding Midland College to such great heights during his stewardship. He has left the institution stronger than when he found it, and forged a deep bond between the school and the community that it serves. Midland College has enriched the city of Midland beyond measure, and thanks to David Daniel, will continue to do so. 
   It is an honor to represent David Daniel and his wife Dee Dee, here in Washington, D.C. As they begin the next chapter of their lives, I wish them the best of luck and the deepest of happiness.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CORPORAL ALFRED MAC WILSON POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - July 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Thank you, Ms. Foxx, for the ability to speak on behalf of Corporal Wilson. 
   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today again to ask the Members of this body to honor the life and memory of one of America's fallen heroes. Marine Corporal Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson of Odessa, Texas, served during the Vietnam War and gave his life so that his brothers might live. 
   For his extraordinary and selfless acts of bravery, Mac, as his friends and family called him, was posthumously awarded our Nation's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. Mac died on May 3, 1969, but his legacy endures to this day. His fellow Odessans have asked that we commemorate his sacrifice by designating a post office in his honor. In this way, Mac and his story will always remain a part of the community that he loved. As a fellow Odessan, it is my great honor to play a small part in these efforts. 
   Mac was born in Olney, Illinois, on January 13, 1948, to Edna and Fred Wilson. The family moved to Odessa, Texas, where Mac attended Odessa High School, where he ran track and played football before he graduated in 1967. 
   Mac enlisted in the Marine Corps in Abilene, Texas, in the fall of 1967, on the ``buddy plan'' with his high school friends Johnny Wright, Tom Chapman, and Jimmy Whisenhunt. After completing recruit training at San Diego, and Camp Pendleton, California, then Private First Class Wilson deployed to Vietnam on July 21, 1968, as an infantry rifleman with Company M, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. 
   I imagine that March 3, 1969, unfolded like most every other day in Vietnam. There were posts to stand, missions to undertake, supplies to deliver, and jungles to march through. For Mac, I am certain that earning the Medal of Honor was the furthest thought from his mind as his platoon embarked on that day's reconnaissance mission. Yet, his heroics turned the rout of his platoon by North Vietnamese forces into a victory. His uncommon valor saved the life of his fellow marines; and for those men, March 3, 1969, turned out to be a dramatically different day than it otherwise could have been. 
   Mac's Medal of Honor citation details his dramatic and selfless actions, and I'd like to read those into the Record. On March 3, 1969, while returning from a reconnaissance-in-force mission in the vicinity of Fire Support Base Cunningham in Quang Tri Province, the 1st Platoon of Company M came under intense automatic weapons fire and grenade attack from a well-concealed North Vietnamese force, pinning down the entire center column of the platoon. 
   Rapidly assessing the situation, Private First Class Wilson, acting as Squad Leader, skillfully maneuvered his squad to form a base of fire and act as a blocking point while the point squad moved to outflank the enemy. During the ensuing fire fight, both his machine gunner and assistant machine gunner were seriously wounded and unable to operate their weapon. 
   Realizing the importance of recovering the M-60 machine gun and maintaining a heavy volume of fire against the hostile force, Private First Class Wilson, with complete disregard for his own safety, followed by another marine, fearlessly dashed across the fire-swept terrain to recover the weapon. 
   As they reached the machine gun, a North Vietnamese soldier threw a grenade at the marines. Reacting instantly, Private First Class Wilson fired a burst from his M-16 rifle, killing the enemy soldier. Observing the grenade fall between himself and the other marine, First Class Wilson, fully realizing the inevitable result of his actions, shouted to his companion and unhesitatingly threw himself on the grenade, absorbing the full force of the explosion with his own body. 
   His heroic actions inspired his platoon members to maximum effort as they aggressively attacked and defeated the enemy. Private First Class Wilson's indomitable courage, inspiring valor, and selfless devotion to duty upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country. 
   Mac was escorted home by Sergeant Jerry Pruitt, United States Marine Corps, of Odessa, Texas. He is buried in Sunset Memorial Gardens in Odessa, Texas, not far from another Medal of Honor recipient, Army Staff Sergeant Marvin ``Rex'' Young. 
   The Medal of Honor was presented to his family by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on April 20, 1970, at the White House. Mac is survived by his sister, Sue Wilson, and by her children, Lloyd Whitehead, Vickie Whitehead, Debbie Frasier, Angie Aleman, Robert Wilson Aleman; and Mac's aunt and uncle, Warren Kininmonth and Kay Kininmonth. Mac's mom, Edna O'Neal Wilson, died 3 months after his death, and his father, Fred Wilson, died in 1969. 
   Soon after his death, Mac was posthumously promoted to the rank of Corporal to recognize the exceptional potential that he possessed. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Mac earned numerous other awards and decorations: a Purple Heart with Gold Star, the Marine Corps Combat Action Ribbon, a Presidential Unit Citation, an Army Presidential Unit Citation, a Navy Unit Commendation, Meritorious Unit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Vietnam Merit Medal, the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm, and the Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation ribbon bar, the Vietnam Campaign Medal, and a Rifle Sharpshooter Badge. 
   The great British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli once said that, ``The legacy of heroes is the memory of a great name and the inheritance of a great example.'' With this legislation, the people of Odessa will always remember the legacy of Alfred Mac Wilson and his noble and heroic efforts without hesitation to serve his country and defend the lives of the men he served with.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (ADVANCED FUELS INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to rise in support of my colleague's amendment from Virginia on three points: conservation, fiscal responsibility, and example. 
   Those of us on our side of the aisle from time to time are criticized, perhaps correctly or incorrectly, on our lack of appreciation of conserving fuels when it comes to driving cars, buses, trains, airplanes. I have had amendments in the past that would seek to try to educate Americans how they can drive their own personal automobiles smarter, in ways to use less gasoline. Not only would that help them in the pocketbook but also help the environment. 
   This is a clear overreach from a standpoint of conservation because the jets available to the Speaker, she should make the most appropriate selection of that jet to accommodate not only her safety. Clearly, that is an important mission for this to be considered, but also take into consideration the operating characteristics of the airplanes that she wants to fly in. 
   So the selection of a 757, however it is configured, we have already paid for that configuring and somebody in the Air Force decided that they needed that particular configuration, and I am not questioning that, but the 757 itself is clearly too large an airplane to carry one person, the Speaker, to and from her district. 
   The fiscal responsibility stands on its face. It does not take a CPA to understand that an operating cost of $22,000 per hour versus the operating cost of a G-5, which is in the $5,000 range, that $17,000 an hour differential is being paid for by somebody. 
   Well, in my mind, that somebody is a taxpayer in west Texas. That taxpayer is probably working morning tower on a Parker drilling rig or a Patterson UTI drilling rig, going to work at eleven o'clock at night working till seven o'clock the next morning, trying to pay his taxes, in addition to feeding his family and providing for them. 
   That is who I think is going to pay the $17,000 when I look at the option of the $5,000 G-5 versus the $22,000 757. 
   The last point I want to make is that of example. All of us are in leadership positions. All 435 Members of this House are leaders in one small way or another. We lead our own offices, and we set the example of the way we conduct ourselves. If I conduct myself one way, my staff, in all likelihood, is going to mimic that. They are going to do what I do and hopefully maybe learn from my example. I think the same thing will happen here. 
   When the leader of this House, by her example, says money is no object, cost is no object, if for whatever we are trying to do, that is not a consideration to be considered when you look at decisions that have to be made. 
   Now cost does not drive every single decision; but where I grew up, most of the folks in District 11, that is one of the questions that gets asked whenever we are trying to make a decision, how much is that going to cost, because in our own mind we make a quick cost-benefit analysis between the benefits that we seek versus those costs. If we can get those benefits for a lower cost, then I can assure you most folks in District 11 will opt for the lower cost to get those same benefits. 
   So the benefits that we want is the Speaker being able to go to and from her district safely with the security folks that she needs to have on the plane. Beyond that I am not sure why we should be flying folks back and forth on this jet; but if there are empty seats in that smaller jet, I do not begrudge any of my Democrat colleagues from California wanting to ride back and forth. That is fine. As I make the stop in Dallas or Houston and wait for the next leg of my flight or I have missed that next leg of flight, I will not begrudge the fact that they are flying nonstop to San Francisco. That is fine.  
   So safety of the Speaker, clear, that has got to be done, but we also ought to do it in a cost-effective manner. So if she is leading from the top, with her tone from the top being that money is no object, whatever it takes to have something done that she wants done, that needs to be done, we are not going to consider costs, then I think that will percolate throughout her staff and the Democrat side of this institution, and the fiscal responsibility that they laid claim to throughout the campaign last year and they are trying to lay claim to in this Congress I think is called into question. 
   So I support my colleague's amendment and urge a vote ``yes'' in favor of it.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONGRATULATING THE RICHLAND SPRINGS COYOTES FOOTBALL TEAM -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Richland Springs Coyotes football team for winning the 2006 Six-Man Division 1 State Champions and the Sports Illustrated six-man football poll national championship. With its second national crown in 3 years, Richland Springs becomes only the third school to achieve such an honor. 
   Playing before a record crowd of 12,000 fans at Abilene's Shotwell Stadium, they defeated the Rule Bobcats by a score of 78-58, finishing the year with a perfect 14-0 record. The Coyotes broke the 1988 record for the highest score in a championship game and amazed the fans with their speed and skill by recovering the on-side kick to open the game. 
   Six-man football has a long history in Texas. From its beginning in 1938, Texas now has over 102 public schools and as many as 60 private schools continuing this proud tradition of six-man football. 
   I want to recognize the tireless efforts of Coach Burkhart, Coach Ethridge, Coach Dodson, and Coach Rogers for the national and State titles that they have brought to Richland Springs. 
   I also want to recognize members of the team: Coey Smith, Jeremiah Ramirez, Cason Fikes, Houston Burleson, Mark Williams, Haustin Burkhart, Kevin Larson, Shelby Smith, James Farris, Nigel Bates, Mitchell Jacobson, Andrew Fowler, Chevy Saldivar, Tyler Ethridge, Richie Daniels, Adrian Avila, Bobby Borders, Khalid Khatib, Patrick  Couch, Genero Hernandez, Randy Couch, Daniel Barrett, Abraham Ahumada, Branch Vancourt, C.J. Finke, Dean King, Dean Charriez, Jesstin Fox, and Ryan Soto. 
   I congratulate the Richland Springs Coyotes on their national and State championships and wish them the best of luck next season.

Every one of these jobs are no longer American manufacturing jobs, but get the same treatment that the jobs for foreign workers. I know my colleagues in the oil business in West Texas are not excited about that.

<DOC>
<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (DEMOCRATS MUST ACT TO AVOID TAX INCREASES -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Pennsylvania's hosting tonight and allowing me to participate in it. 
   Let me kind of flesh out what our good colleague from Kentucky said about the mechanics of those impacts on tax increases. He talked about a variety of manufacturing and some service industries who may or may not be directly impacted by section 199, but here are the mechanics of what happens: 
   The small E and P companies, the exploration and production companies, those companies that are out there trying to find crude oil and natural gas, on average in 2005 spent 617 percent of their profits. In other words, for every dollar that they earned, they spent $6.17 reinvesting in the ground. And here is how they are able to do that: if you are a successful oil and gas finder, you find reserves in the ground that have a value. The value is based on the price and the length of time you expect it takes to get that crude oil and natural gas out of the ground; the lifting costs, depending on what that costs; lease operating expenses. All those expenses go into that, and they make a reasonably scientific guess as to the future value today of those reserves in the ground. Proved oil and gas reserves. 
   In other words, you take the life of that well, those cash flows. You discount that back to today's number, and that creates a value that in many instances these E and P companies go to the bank. They take the reserve report that shows that they have got a cash flow stream over the next 10 years, as an example, to their banker, and they say, Mr. Banker, we want to borrow against those reserves because we want to replicate what we have done. We want to put those dollars that we borrow from you back into the ground to find additional reserves for oil and gas or develop additional wells that are currently in the proved undeveloped category that they will continue to expand our reserve base, in other words, continue to expand the cash flow stream that we are going to earn as that oil and natural gas is produced over the next 30, 40 years, whatever the life of the well is, 10 years, 5 years, whatever the economic life of that well may be. 
   The large companies, to my recollection off the top of my head, reinvest about 175 percent of their profits. So everybody in the exploration and production food chain spends more money than they make going back in the ground. 
   So this tax increase that this Congress, and some of our good colleagues on the Republican side joined in, passed last week, a mere 4 days ago, what that does is it reduces the cash flow, reduces the profits of all of these companies. And as you reduce those dollars, like in the small E and P company, if you reduce them a dollar, you have really cut expenditures in the oil business by $6. So for every dollar of taxes that are increased as a result of this action, we have eliminated $6 out of the reinvestment in the ground. And it is that reinvestment that my good friend from Kentucky was talking about, because that money goes to all of these suppliers, goes to all these subcontractors, goes to all the folks who actually do the work and try to find this business. 
   So when that doesn't happen, then there is less work for them to do. There is less need for employees, less of everything. So just the mechanics of the tax increase has that effect. 
   Here is the twisted logic that our colleagues on the other side have used, and I have been thinking about this for all of last week when we found out what that bill was going to do, as well as over the weekend. I think one of the things we can all agree on is that we want to be less dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas, sources that we pay our good hard-earned money for. These are foreign sources. So all of us agree on that. The road forward or how we get that done is a multidecade journey. 
   While we are on this journey, it would make sense to me that the more domestic production we can produce, the more domestic barrels, the more domestic Mcf of natural gas that we produce means that that offsets or reduces in and of itself the crude oil and natural gas that we are importing. So the logic that our good colleagues used last week was if we can reduce the domestic supply of 
   crude oil and natural gas, then we have also reduced our dependency on foreign crude natural gas. 
   Well, that doesn't make any sense. I grew up in Odessa, Texas, and I am just a country boy from west Texas and grew up in the oil fields. That is twisted logic. It does not make any sense whatsoever. 
   It would seem that we would want to promote the production of domestic supplies so that we could increase the domestic supply and therefore offset, in some small way, the need for foreign imports. Now, that does make sense. So a bill and a mechanics that reduces directly the domestic production seems awfully weird to me and a convoluted logic that I have been unable to kind of work my way through that. 
   Now, you and I and many of our colleagues have stood at these microphones and bemoaned the fact that that happened. Will we be able to point specifically at last Thursday's vote 5 years down the road and say, okay, had we not had that tax increase, had we not abrogated those contracts, if we hadn't done the things that the Democrats decided were in the best interests of this country, production would be some percentage greater than it currently is? We will not have that analysis. We just won't be able to do it, partly because the industry that we hit upside the head with a big old stick last week is incredibly resilient. 
   These are tough, independent, self-sufficient folks, and whatever hand they are dealt, they are going to go back to the drawing board and try to find domestic crude oil and natural gas. That is what they do. We have just simply made their job harder. We are going to force them to do a little bit less of it, or we are going to force them to go to other sources for their backing. But whatever it is we did, it will have an impact on the volume of crude oil and natural gas produced in this country over the next decades. 
   The bad news is we won't be able to quantify that. We won't be able to come to these microphones and say, as many of our colleagues did over the last 2 years, I told you so, Monday morning quarterbacking. We are telling you ahead of time that this will happen, and we will be more dependent on foreign sources of crude oil and natural gas than we would have otherwise been, and that is really the differential here. We didn't have to be that dependent. We are going to be dependent on it, but we could have helped ourselves just somewhat by every increased barrel of crude oil produced and every increased Mcf of natural gas produced domestically and whether those restrictions come and where we can explore for crude oil and natural gas, the resources that companies have available to them after they comply with all of the regulatory schemes and the tax schemes that we have put in place. 
   And just to whine the most, the contracts we abrogated last week, you saw some of the estimates of why that is important to the folks on the other side, which is that money stolen from those oil companies is big dollars. The leases signed in 1998 and 1999 when the price of crude was 10 bucks a barrel, when that seemed to make sense, if it did at that point in time, it takes 5 or 6 years to get that crude oil to market, as it were. By the time you get the rigs put in place and all the things that have to go on when you drill in deep water, it takes awhile. And now we are beginning to see the fruit of all that hard work, the fruit of the risks taken by those companies. 
   There is a particular company I am aware of that, along with one of the major oil companies, has recently discovered what looks to be a very large oil discovery in the gulf, and it is off of one of those leases in which they were incented to buy and pay the lease bonus on at a time when it really didn't make a lot of economic sense, 10 bucks a barrel. They are estimating the cost to themselves, if this process that went through last week is sustained, that it will cost that one company $1 billion. And as you mentioned earlier, 41 percent of the stock is in individual retirement accounts. But I wonder if you picked up in addition to retirement accounts mutual funds owned outside of retirement accounts, individuals who owned stock directly in these oil companies.     
   My guess is the percentage ownership would be much higher than the 41 percent.

   Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman. 
   I think it is Money Magazine every year or so runs a contest where they will present a set of facts, the same set of facts to a variety of tax preparers. And it is interesting the variety of taxes due number that comes up. You would think, the same facts because everybody is working off the same codes, the same set of regulations, that all these tax return preparers would come up with the same answer. But it is very rare that even two out of the group come up with the same answer because of the complexity of the code. 
   I spent 32 plus years of my professional career helping clients comply with the code or a company that I was working for and attempting to do my own tax return, because most folks  really wouldn't understand a CPA screwing up his own tax return. So if I couldn't do mine right, why would I hold myself out for doing somebody else's right? And every time you signed one of those returns, it gives you a pause, because this is complicated stuff. And the legend at the bottom where you sign doesn't say, I have got this as close as I can to the right answer, sign your name; it requires you under penalties of perjury to say you have got it right. And that does give you some pause, because it is an incredibly complex code, unnecessarily complex. 
   And we will have hopefully another night where we can talk about ways that we ought to be looking at how we collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this Federal Government in a fair, straightforward, easy-to-comply-with way that most Americans would buy into, because I think our voluntary compliance in that arena would be far greater than it currently is with this incredibly complicated code. 
   If you want to file manually, your client, you can file manually. I am trying to remember, I was reading one of those tax credits that was extended.     
   There is no line for it on the form, and so the services said if you want to claim this credit or deduction, one of the two, since we did not put a line item on the return for it, stick it on a different line and tell us what that is. So you can go ahead and file manually if you would like to, but you are right. I thought it was February 4 maybe.

   Mr. CONAWAY. The alternative minimum tax was put in in 1969 at a point in time where our marginal tax rate, upper marginal tax rate was like 70 percent, and it was a point in time where there were a lot of gimmicks and tax loopholes, not loopholes because the code was written that way, but there were a lot of deductions and a lot of activities that folks could deduct against that 70 percent number. 
   So consequently you had a lot of folks incented to do that, to take risks they might not have otherwise taken. So, as a matter of fairness and equity, the Congress put in an alternative minimum tax. In other words, they felt like everybody in America ought to pay something and that these folks were taking advantage of tax shelters in a way that was keeping them from paying any tax at all. Congress and the President, Johnson I guess, at that point in time felt like everybody ought to pay a little something. 
   This was targeted at the really larger tax returns, really big investors, the big folks who made a lot of money. It was never intended to catch those two teachers who make together, what did you say, about $110,000, $120,000. The spirit of that was never intended to catch them in this loop. 
   In the interest of full and fair disclosure, I had to pay the alternative minimum tax this year which irritated me. 
   So the AMT is something that we did not do a good job of it. As Republicans, we kind of kicked the can down the road for a couple of years, a year at a time. This Democrat-led Congress is going to have that issue wrapped around their neck, and we will see how they go about trying to propose a fix for it, but it is an issue that is going to catch millions and millions of new taxpayers through the alternative minimum tax scheme each year that we move forward.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Too many, clearly. There are not a lot of lines created or spoken here that many people quote. The inaugural address produces great lines. It is not what you do for your country, all those kinds of lines that come out. I do not know of anything spoken here that many people quote. 
   Lincoln said, and I will butcher this, but I think he said in his Gettysburg Address, the world will little remember what is said here. As it turns out, he was wrong, but I think that is exactly what happened here. 
   In West Texas, I suspect, and in central Pennsylvania as well as Kentucky, talk is cheap, but what we do here is important and it is remembered. When we vote, as we did last week, to abrogate contracts with the Federal Government, when we vote, as we did last week, to tell people who have business deals with this Federal Government you really cannot trust the contract because if it begins to look like you are making a little money off this contract, some Member of Congress will think that is a bad idea and they will convince a party, maybe both parties, to take and redo that contract. 
   When we vote, as we did two weeks ago, to say there are some lives in this country, they are not particularly important, lives on the front end of creation, that is remembered. That is important. That has an impact on what we do. 
   When we vote here to do things to protect America, as I suspect over the next coming couple of weeks we will vote as to how we think this Congress ought to be commander-in-chief, that is important what we do. 
   The good is important and the bad is important just as well. It is long remembered and long noted by the people of this country, the people in West Texas in District 11, and many instances, the people around the world. 
   As I hear tonight our good colleague from Maryland talking about flaws in the bill that we will vote on tomorrow with respect to pensions, that I think all of us would love to support, when he says, well, guys, do not worry about it, this is just the House version; we will fix it in conference or we will fix it in the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding the time. 
   It is interesting, and our good colleague has left, but I would wonder why we constantly talk about history from 6 years ago that eliminates the conversation about 9/11, the recession that we went into, and an awful lot of things that had an impact on the financial circumstances or guesses at the financial circumstances over these intervening 10 or 12 years that seem to get lost whenever it is convenient. 
   What I would like to speak to, though, is the mechanics of what is happening right here. This is a PAYGO fix and is intended to ``pay for'' the additional expenses for adding an additional Representative to this body. I disagree with that. It is unconstitutional from a straight reading, but that is not our issue. How do we pay for that? 
   The folks back home understand the term ``PAYGO'' as if they want to pay for something, they have choices. They can borrow the money, which we have collectively done an awful lot of, or they can earn more money or they can cut spending in an area to pay for whatever the new expenditure is. 
   This bill takes the first route. This is simply a cash flow issue. This does not actually raise the money that the Federal Government gets to keep to pay for these additional expenses. This bill simply looks at a very unsympathetic group of taxpayers out there, folks who are blessed to make over $5 million in AGI each year, and says, we are going to borrow the money from you to pay for this. 
   And so our friends on the other side of the aisle have a very twisted, in my view, definition of PAYGO which involves simply borrowing money, whether it is to pay for your American Express bill off of this month's Visa or to sign up for a new Visa to pay the old Visa card. This bill doesn't pay for these added Federal expenses. It simply finances it through a borrowing from taxpayers who make more than $5 million in adjusted gross income. 
   So we many times come to this floor with less than straightforward conversations about what we are doing. This is one of those times. This is not a PAYGO fix. This is simply a cash  flow, borrowing the money from a certain number of taxpayers, because the bill does not raise anyone's tax. It does increase the amount of advanced payment that taxpayers have to make each year, depending on what their tax scheme is. But their ultimate tax bill is decided by the code that is in existence right now and will not be changed. 
   So as the other side, Mr. Speaker, brags on this bill as being their answer to the additional spending under the D.C. voting bill, it is not right. This simply borrows the money from some other group and does not pay for it. 
   So I would oppose this bill. It does not honor the traditional definition of PAYGO that we are all familiar with, and I would urge my colleagues to vote against it.

   Mayor Calvert graduated from New Mexico Military Institute in 1956 and served in the Army as a second lieutenant. He served in various command and staff positions, including test officer in Greenland, assistant professor of chemistry at West Point, and he served in combat in Vietnam where he was awarded the Purple Heart. After a 3-year tour at the Pentagon, he served for 3 years in Germany. Mr. Calvert then served at Joliet Army Ammunition Plant and in 1979 was assigned to the Army War College. 
   Following this assignment, Mayor Calvert then served as the director of Battlefield Automation at Fort Hood and after 3 years he retired from the United States Army as a colonel. 
   Mayor Calvert's service to his community and his country did not end after his retirement from the military. He then served on different civic groups. He and his wife, Fran, chose Lampasas as their home and purchased a historic house to restore back to its original structure. Along with his service, he and his wife, Fran, raised three children: Charles Douglas, Lee Ann, and Mary. 
   As mayor of Lampasas, he successfully guided the city and its councils through many growth issues. Jack Calvert is a true leader of leaders in the 11th Congressional District, and I am proud to represent him here in the House of Representatives.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Pennsylvania and good friend from Kentucky for coming down here tonight to talk about what the Countdown Crew has been talking about, and that is the pending tax increase that is looming large on the horizon. 
   Part of the problem as I toured District 11 during the Easter break was that because the actual tax law change is still years away, many people in the district are not paying as much attention to it as I think they should. It is kind of like the fellow who fell off the 10 story building. As he passed the 5th floor, he was heard to say, ``so far, so good. So far, so good.'' 
   We have fallen off the building. January 2, when the Democrats took over the House, we fell off the edge. It took them 14 days to raise taxes on the oil business, the first tax increase, and we are much like that gentleman who was in midair headed to an abrupt halt when he hit the ground, and that is the misguided idea that so far, so good; so far, so good. 
   Back in March, these chambers heard an incredible amount of rhetoric about the budget and if you had just tuned in, you didn't really know which side was which. Basically what you heard was a schoolyard squabble in which our side said yes, you are, and their side said no, you're not, and yes, you are; no, you're not. We went back and forth, and I don't know that any of us really adequately explained to the people listening, Mr. Speaker, why both sides claimed the exact same set of facts with two totally different interpretations. Let me try to be a little instructive on that tonight, as best I can. 
   The current tax law says that in 2011 most of the tax breaks as we refer to those that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 will expire on their own. Back in 2001 and 2003, the Senate, the Democrats particularly in the Senate, invoked the Byrd amendment or the Byrd rule, I guess, which restricts tax law thinking to a 10-year window. In other words, we handcuff ourselves with respect to tax policy in some artificial time frames that may or may not make sense. 
   It is unfortunate that we do it that way, but that is kind of the ground rules we have. We could spend nights and nights talking about how we could reset the ground rules and have a much better way of developing tax policy in this House that would make much more sense. 
   But, nevertheless, that 10-year window restricted the elimination of the death tax, the tax rate decreases, the marriage penalty, the earned income credits, that we wanted to make permanent that left this House. The bill that left the House would make all of  those things permanent. But the compromise in the Senate, in order to get it out and passed the obstructionist Senators, Democrat Senators at that time, we were limited to 10 years. 
   We are now coming on to the end of that time frame and existing law says that on January 1, 2011, tax rates, as an example, the top rate, which is now 33 percent of earned income, will rise to 39.6 percent, a 20-plus percent increase. The bottom rate, which is currently 10 percent, goes to 15 percent, a 50 percent tax increase on the folks who make the least amount of money in our society. So what is happening is that the Democrats are hiding behind the operation of law as it currently exists to say that they are not raising taxes. 
   But the proof is in the pudding, because in their 5-year budget window that they have presented and passed through the House and that we will appoint conferees on tomorrow, spends the money that gets raised in the budget window of 2011 and 2012. So the Democrats actually let it work as it is supposed to, as it is going to, without intervention by the Republicans, and the Federal tax collection scheme will collect an extra $400 billion in 2011 and 2012. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say they are not intending to allow the tax increases on those 10 percent brackets, et cetera, et cetera, to actually happen. That we need to trust them. That their intent is to not allow that to happen before this 2011 timeframe. 
   But the problem is, they spent the money that is raised. So in order to offset under their definition of PAYGO, that they invoke from time to time, and they change this definition, by the way, from time to time.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (AMERICA FACES LARGEST TAX INCREASE IN HISTORY -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Yes. We recently passed the D.C. Voting Rights bill which is a separate conversation. It had a modest amount of money in terms of D.C. modesty. In terms of District 11, there aren't very many people out there who have a deposit slip big enough to deposit the $14 million that it is going to cost. It will cost $14 million to add two additional Members of Congress. 
   The bill that was passed violated PAYGO on its face. They had a convoluted rule that said even though that bill has passed the House, if we don't pass the fix, the PAYGO fix, then neither bill will actually pass. So they winked at themselves on the first bill, saying we are going to fix the $14 million hole. 
   Then the next bill that came forward to fix their PAYGO issue did not raise taxes on anyone to pay for it. They did not cut spending anywhere, and it didn't raise the taxes necessary to do that. 
   The manager of the time that afternoon actually said from the microphone right over there in the middle, we are not raising taxes on any American. What they are doing, though, is basically taking an advance on next month's salary. What they did was said taxpayers who have an adjusted gross income of more than $5 million, which is a relatively small group of people and not a crowd that draws much sympathy among folks, we are going to insist that they advance their tax payments a little quicker than they would have otherwise. The overall tax that they are going to owe is not going to change, but we want them to pay in an amount a little quicker. 
   However the CBO scored that cash flow, they scored it as a positive which allowed them to wink and say yes, we now have conformed with our own PAYGO rules. 
   So the Blue Dogs have to explain to us how their new version or definition of PAYGO works where they can simply advance moneys out of next month's salary, in effect, and that somehow meets the PAYGO standard. 
   Tomorrow we will debate this issue that the tax rates happen on their own. We intend to not let it happen. But in order to do that, they have to raise taxes somewhere else. So they have to take that 39.6 new rate in 2011 and raise it even higher in order to make up for reducing taxes on the folks at the bottom of the deal. 
   Republicans have said that this is a tax increase. You allow it to happen. You have the choice to not allow it to happen. You allow it to happen and you spent the money. So both sides have got arguments that have some substance of truth, some version of truth in them, and you have to look at the total package. 
   But at the end of day, at the end of their 5-year budget window that we will be debating tomorrow, good Americans will pay in another $400 billion in taxes. And guess what, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle found a place to spend it. They didn't reduce the deficit. They didn't reduce the national debt or put it into a rainy day fund, or save it. They spent it. Their rhetoric to the contrary that they are not raising taxes is hollow at best given the action that their budget will actually do. 
   I want to talk a little bit about overall tax policy in this country, if I can. I pose this idea. We tax capital gains, dividends and interest at rates that are less than the rate we tax earned income. So what we are saying is as a policy of this government, we think that hardworking people who sweat should pay higher taxes than our money does when it is working for us in the capital markets. Now that is an interesting philosophy and one that has been accepted around these halls for a long, long time, and we can have a debate whether or not that makes sense. 
   But what is the correct tax rate on capital gains? I know what the Tax Code says, but what should that rate be? What should we tax earnings from capital gains and interest and dividends? What should the tax rate be? What is magic about the current number? Should it be twice that, half that? 
   It is not like math classes where you went to the back of the book and the even or odd-numbered questions had the answers. There is no back of the book. I will pose the same question about earned income. A person working for Parker Drilling Company in West Texas or UTI Patterson Drilling Company, folks who work hard and understand what work is, what you and I do here, we call it work but it is not work in the tradition that I understand hard work is. What should we tax that guy or that woman for their earned income, their work? What should we tax accountants and doctors and lawyers for the work that they do day in and day out, providing the services and goods we want? What is the correct rate? 
   We have rates in the code. We think the rates that have been in place for the last 7 years may or may not be right, but they have helped produce an economy that has boomed and is continuing to grow. 
   Now Ronald Reagan said the stuff you don't like, you ought to tax it. If we don't like people working, we raise taxes. 
   As we have this debate night after night and year in and year out, let us talk about the idea what should the correct rate be. Regardless of the Byrd rule and regardless of the 10-year plan and regardless of the budget act nonsense that we have to tie our hands with, what ought to be the rate? Is there a better tax collection scheme than the one we currently have? Should we go to a national sales tax or flat tax? Let's begin to have those discussions. 
   I have spent 30-plus years helping clients comply with this incredibly difficult Tax Code. No, I am not an expert in it. I have some background and some depth, but this thing is incredible. We have narrow experts in the accounting world who take on various segments of it who don't know the full deal. It is incredibly complex. Let's begin to discuss how should we collect money? How should we collect the minimum amount of money needed to fund this Federal Government in ways that are fair, simple, straightforward, easy to comply with, and don't cost the estimated $260 billion a year that Americans spend complying with this incredibly complex code. 
   This code has all sorts of winners and losers. As we begin to talk about PAYGO, and you look at the tax increases that the Democrats will propose, every one of those have winners and losers. Every one of those pit some segment of society against the other, some level of wealth against another, and I don't think that makes for a good way to do things, to create this constant tension between taxpayers. We  are in this all together. We all want the Federal Government to work as efficiently as we can.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. That is exactly right. I thank my colleague. 
   The Internal Revenue Code, 1986, as amended, is incredibly complicated, as we have already talked about. If you look at most of the provisions in there, many of the provisions in there, they have a history. They have a reason for being. We are trying to manipulate our economy. We are trying to manipulate conduct. We are trying to do something, manage something. If you look at the alternative minimum tax, there is actually a story there. There is a history there. 
   Back in the late 1960s, Congress discovered that there were 155, no commas, 155 taxpayers who made more than $200,000 in 1966, but they did not pay any taxes. So, in an attempt to get at those deadbeats making all that money, and now in all likelihood those folks hired folks who will say this argument, I have talked about that, but nevertheless in an attempt to get at 155 taxpayers, Congress created what is now known as the alternative minimum tax. In other words, Congress was offended that you could have people so structure their compliance with the tax code in existence at that point in time that they did not owe any tax. So they set in place an alternative minimum tax which started with your taxable income and then it added back certain preferences that folks, quote, unquote, took advantage of so that everybody paid some taxes. There is some value in that. 
   In 1969 that went into effect. Thirty-eight years later, millions, literally millions, of taxpayers are now caught up in what is known as the alternative minimum tax. Now, today's alternative minimum tax is not your daddy's alternative minimum tax. This is a separate computation. So most taxpayers who are in this wreck have to keep a regular tax set of computations and an alternative minimum tax set of computations. You have got different basis on your assets. You have got different basis in your stock if you bought a set of stock options, all kinds of things that you have to do separate under alternative minimum tax. You have got an alternative minimum tax net operating loss that is different from your net operating loss on your regular tax. So two schemes trying to get at how much money you owe the Federal Government.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Oh, absolutely. When you turn on a television program that is going to have some adult content in it, most of them say, viewers, give you a warning that this next program may not be suitable for young children. Well, I am going to give a warning that what I am about to go through may not be suitable for young children. 
   This is Form 6251. Form 6251 is a 2-page form that every taxpayer who is caught up in the alternative minimum tax has to complete. Internal Revenue Service agents, when they audit you, if you have not put this form in your tax return, they will fill one out for you, thinking that maybe you screwed up and did not fill it out. It is in the instructions on how you audit taxpayers. 
   It is a 2-page form. There are 10 pages of instructions to Form 6251, and it is relatively mind numbing to go through these instructions. I want to just kind of walk you through the first 28 lines quickly on this form. So hang on for dear life. 
   It starts off: Line 1, ``If filing Schedule A (Form 1040), enter the amount from Form 1040, line 41 (minus any amount on Form 8914, line 6), and go to line 2. Otherwise, enter the amount from Form 1040, line 38 (minus any amount on Form 8914, line 6), and go to line 7.''

   Mr. CONAWAY. ``If less than zero, enter as a negative amount.'' That is line one. 
   Line 2, ``Medical and dental. Enter the smaller of Schedule A (Form 1040), line 4, or 2 1/2 percent of Form 1040, line 38.'' 
   Line 3, ``Taxes from Schedule A (Form 1040), line 9.'' 
   Line 4, ``Enter the home mortgage interest adjustment, if any, from line 6 of the worksheet on page 2 of the instructions.'' 
   Line 5, ``Miscellaneous deductions from Schedule A (Form 1040), line 26.'' 
   Line 6, ``If Form 1040, line 38, is over $150,500 (over $75,250 if married filing separately), enter the amount from line 11 of the Itemized Deductions Worksheet from page A-7 of the instructions for Schedule A (Form 1040).'' 
   Line 7, ``Tax refund from Form 1040, line 10 or line 21.'' 
   Line 8, ``Investment interest expense (difference between regular tax and AMT).'' Here is where we get that two scheme thing going. 
   Line 9, ``Depletion (difference between regular tax and AMT).'' 
   Line 10, ``Net operating loss deduction from Form 1040, line 21. Enter as a positive amount.'' 
   Line 11, ``Interest from specified private activity bonds exempt from the regular tax.'' 
   Line 12, ``Qualified small business stock (7 percent of gain excluded under section 1202).'' 
   Line 13, ``Exercise of incentive stock options (excess of AMT income over regular tax income).'' 
   Line 14, ``Estates and trusts (amount from Schedule K-1 (Form 1041), box 12, code A).'' 
   Line 15, ``Electing large partnerships (amount from Schedule K-1 (Form 1065-B), box 6).'' 
   Line 16, we are halfway there, folks. ``Disposition of property (difference between AMT and regular tax gain or loss).'' Again, two separate computations. 
   Line 17, ``Depreciation on assets placed in service after 1986 (difference between regular tax and AMT).'' 
   And line 18, ``Passive activities (difference between AMT and regular tax income or loss).'' 
   Line 19, ``Loss limitations (difference between AMT and regular income tax or loss).'' 
   Line 20, ``Circulation costs,'' that is not physical circulation. I think that is newspapers. ``(Difference between regular tax and AMT).'' Here they reverse the order. Previously it was alternative minimum tax versus regular tax.

   Line 24, ``Income from certain installment sales before January 1, 1987.'' Glad you are keeping up with that.

   Line 26, ``Other adjustments,'' you have always got to have other, ``including income-based related adjustments.'' 
   Line 27, ``Alternative tax net operating loss deduction.'' 
   And finally, line 28, you get to ``Alternative minimum taxable income.'' And there are some instructions, though. ``Combine lines 1 through 27. (If married filing and line 28 is more than $200,100, see page 7 of the instructions).'' 
   That is just Part I. We will save Part II and III for a future date to work you through that.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (STAFF SERGEANT MARVIN ``REX'' YOUNG POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman's yielding. 
   Next Monday, our Nation will pay tribute to all the young men and women who fought and died so bravely and honorably for our Nation. On Memorial Day, we will celebrate with parades and speeches and flag waving and fireworks, as we should. From the Revolutionary War to the war we are fighting today, we celebrate and remember the fallen as a group. For those of us who have lost a loved one in a war or through the service of this country, Memorial Day has a deep meaning. 
   For the family and friends of the men who served with Marvin ``Rex'' Young, the last Monday of May is much more than just symbolic. On this day, Rex's family and friends and fellow soldiers remember and honor his brave actions on behalf of his country. 
   On August 21, 1968, while in battle in Vietnam, Rex sacrificed his life to save the lives of his friends and comrades. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery and sacrifice. Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to honor the life and memory and heroism of Staff Sergeant ``Rex'' Young. 
   Rex was born in Alpine, Texas, on May 11, 1947, the third and youngest child to Marilyn and Roy Young. Rex's mother has provided this picture of Rex serving in Vietnam back in 1967 and 1968. 
   The family moved to Odessa when Rex was a child. I met Rex when we were both attending Odessa Permian High School. Rex was a year ahead of me and graduated in 1965. He was a gifted athlete, played both football and baseball while at Permian. His mother said Rex was more interested in just being on the team and contributing, but he was much more than that. He was a star player. Childhood friends remember Rex as an exceptional athlete who could have written his own ticket in baseball. And they remember him as a very unselfish guy, so they were not surprised when he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his bravery in battle. 
   After graduation, Rex attended Odessa College and Kentfield Junior College in California and then joined the United States Army on September 15, 1966. He completed basic training at Fort Bliss, Texas, and advanced infantry training at Fort Lewis, Washington, and then departed for Vietnam on October 20, 1967. He was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion (Mechanized), 5th Infantry of the 25th Infantry Division, known as the ``Bobcats.'' Rex earned his first Purple Heart from a shrapnel wound on December 7, 1967; and he earned his second Purple Heart on February 1, 1968, during the TET Offensive.  
   On August 21, 1968, Rex was killed by enemy fire as he provided protective fire to shelter elements of his platoon as they were withdrawn to safety. It was in these final selfless acts that Rex saved so many of his friends' lives. 
   Jesus said in John 15:13, ``Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.'' 
   I would like to read from the citation that describes Rex's final moments on this Earth: 
   ``Staff Sergeant Young distinguished himself at the cost of his life while serving as a squad leader with Company C. While conducting a reconnaissance mission, Company C was suddenly engaged by an estimated regimental-size force of the North Vietnamese Army. During the initial volley of fire, the point element of the 1st Platoon was pinned down, sustaining several casualties, and the active platoon leader was killed. Sergeant Young unhesitatingly assumed command of the platoon and immediately began to organize and deploy his men into a defensive position in order to repel the attacking force. As a human wave attack advanced on Sergeant Young's platoon, he moved from position to position, encouraging and directing fire on the hostile insurgents while exposing himself to the hail of enemy bullets. 
   ``After receiving orders to withdraw to a better defensive position, he remained behind to provide covering fire for the withdrawal. Observing that a small element of the point squad was unable to extract itself from its position, and completely disregarding his personal safety, Sergeant Young began moving toward their position, firing as he maneuvered.     
   ``When halfway to their position, he sustained a critical head injury, yet he continued his mission and ordered the element to withdraw. 
   ``Remaining with the squad as it fought its way to the rear, he was twice seriously wounded, once in the arm and once in the leg. Although his leg was badly shattered, Sergeant Young refused assistance that would have slowed down the retreat of his comrades, and he ordered them to continue their withdrawal while he provided protective covering fire. With indomitable courage and heroic self-sacrifice, he continued his self-assigned mission until the enemy engulfed his position. By his gallantry, at the cost of his life, and which is in the highest tradition of military service, Staff Sergeant Young has reflected great credit on himself, his unit and the United States Army.'' 
   In the heavy fighting that day, Company C suffered 17 men killed, 21 wounded. And no one knows how many other men would have died that day had Rex not stepped in to save his friends. 
   For his gallantry and self-sacrifice, Sergeant Young was posthumously promoted to staff sergeant. Rex earned his country's highest award for bravery, the Medal of Honor. In addition to the medal, Staff Sergeant Young was awarded the Combat Infantryman's Badge, the Bronze Star with ``V'' Device, Purple Heart with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, the Republic of Vietnam Military Merit Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with Palm. 
   Rex was buried with full military honors at Sunset Memorial Gardens Cemetery in Odessa, Texas. Near him lie many other Odessans who perished in the Vietnam War. Fifty feet north rests another Medal of Honor recipient, Alfred ``Mac'' Wilson, Corporal, United States Marine Corps. 
   Rex's sister Margaret now lies next to him. His brother Charles Ray and his father are also deceased. His mother lived in Odessa for many years. She has recently moved to McKinney to be close to her friends. 
   Rex's last day on Earth was almost 39 years ago. Because he and I are close to the same age, I think often of all the experiences that I have had that he willingly gave up that hot, fateful day halfway around the world. 
   I am loved by a wonderful woman, and together we have raised four children. I have watched them grow into responsible adults. I have watched the boys play football and basketball, baseball and golf. I watched my daughters lead cheers as a cheerleader and a team mascot. I have watched our sons take beautiful young women to be their wives. I walked one of my daughters down the aisle so that her mother and I could give her in marriage to a starry-eyed young man. I have held our seven grandchildren in my arms and looked into the eyes of America's future. And I buried a wife and a father. These are life experiences that Rex should have had. All of these experiences that I know Rex must have looked forward to, the good and the bad, were sacrificed on freedom's altar in his heroic acts that day so long ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, next Monday our Nation celebrates Memorial Day, a day set aside each year to honor all of the Rex Youngs our country has produced and who have made that same supreme sacrifice that Rex made. This includes, of course, the brave men and women who for the past 5-plus years have stood between us and some very bad, soulless people that want to destroy our way of life. 
   I would like to challenge each of us that in addition to honoring these men and women as a group, that we think about them on an individual basis. By that I mean that each of us should have a specific person that we think about, honor and celebrate each and every time sacrifices are mentioned. It could be somebody in our family, it could be a friend or somebody that you know through a history lesson, but my challenge to you is this: That every time you are reminded of all the lives that have been given in defense of this country, that you think about a specific life given. For me, Mr. Speaker, that life is Rex Young. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and gratitude that I ask this House to honor SSG Marvin ``Rex'' Young by naming the post office at 4551 East 52nd Street in Odessa, Texas, after him. By doing so, his memory will live on not just in the hearts of those of us who knew him, but also by everyone that uses or drives by that post office and sees his name. 
   His Nation honored him with its highest honor for bravery. I now ask that his Nation honor his memory by taking one more official act. I ask each of you to vote in favor of this legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member of the committee for yielding. 
   This budget resolution we are talking about tonight is a target-rich environment for things that we can disagree about that are in there. I have been tasked to talk about the things that aren't in the budget that we wish we would have been able to get in the budget, such as process reform. 
   Every year that we have this opportunity to do a budget, we have an opportunity to reform our processes and do this budgeting process in a better way. We spent all day last week in the Budget Committee during the hearing to try to get some of that done; and, quite frankly, we failed miserably on our side to convince our colleagues of the value of some these reforms. 
   Reforms like strengthening PAYGO to make it really mean PAYGO in the way our folks back home would understand it, to have PAYGO apply to the very first year of this budget. We were unable to get that done. 
   I offered an amendment that said if you are going to start a new program, a new, great idea in this vast array of programs that we have in our Federal Government, you would have to kill an existing program of equal or greater spending. 
   Well, in the rarified air of that room that night, I got laughed out of the room. I don't do instant messages, but I think the term ``LOL'' comes to mind. They were laughing out loud. One Member rolled their eyes the way my 14-year-old daughter used to do about, I guess, how naive I was about this process. 
   But I can assure you, I can assure you that back in Texas the idea of setting priorities, of trying to decide between good things, what we can afford and what we can't afford, and putting in place a mechanism that helps us with that discipline, does not get laughed out of the room. It is only in Washington that would be a laughingstock. 
   We also attempted to do away with the Gephardt rule. I have heard for the first 2 years of my service here night after night after night people decrying the fact that we had hidden in our arcane way of doing business raising the debt ceiling without taking an up-or-down vote, without standing in here and doing it the way we ought to do. 
   We offered an amendment that would have eliminated the Gephardt rule. A vote for this resolution is a vote for whatever requisite debt ceiling limits are necessary; a separate vote would have been better on that. 
   We offered up other process reforms that had been offered in the 109th Congress by the Democrats. We brought these to the committee hearing on a word-for-word basis for what they proposed, brought and voted for just last year. Not one of those passed. Every single one of those went down on a party-line vote. 
   I am here tonight to express my disappointment with the fact that we were not able to gain some process reforms in this resolution. I am disappointed that it is not in the underlying resolution. I will oppose it for that reason and a lot of others. I am here to express my disappointment, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. As you see, the theme this morning is to talk about gasoline prices, and as we look at the various solutions that are available to our country, it's interesting to note how votes happen in this House. It's rare that a particular position is supported or opposed 100 percent by either party. But let me walk you through a couple of solutions that have been voted on in this House over the last 14 years. 
   Drilling in ANWR; 91 percent of Republicans supported it, 86 percent of Democrats opposed it. Coal-to-liquids; 97 percent of Republicans supported it, 78 percent of Democrats opposed it. Oil shale exploration; 90 percent Republican support, 86 percent Democrat opposition. Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, 81 percent of Republicans support it, 83 percent of Democrats oppose it. Increased refinery capacity; Republicans support that by 97 percent, Democrats oppose it by 96 percent. 
   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to begin to look rationally at the solutions that will help address America's need for energy, gasoline and electricity as we move forward.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I'm glad to speak against this rule and against this bill in itself. 
   First off, this is not a Federal responsibility, this is a State and local responsibility. And to the extent that we spend Federal taxpayer dollars, this isn't the Federal Government doing this, there is no such thing as the Federal Government doing this; this is the Federal taxpayer doing this. So you've got taxpayers on one hand funding their local schools; you've got Federal taxpayers funding those same local schools. This is a wreck of bureaucratic nightmare. This should not happen. 
   We're not fully funding IDEA, we're not fully funding title I; this is just something new. So it's because it's new that we can get away with acting like this is something that's good, and it's not because we're not fully funding what we should be. 
   Electrical costs in our schools are very high, no doubt about it. And the truth of the matter is we can't conserve our way into lowering those electricity costs because electricity cost generation is going to continue to go up. And as this majority continues to restrict the growth in clean coal burning technology, as they continue to restrict the growth in nuclear power plants, they're going to continue to drive electricity costs higher and higher. 
   Now we all like wind, we all like solar, but the truth of the matter is growth in those alternatives cannot even keep up with the growth in the demand for electricity. As schools begin to quit going to field trips, as they begin to quit going to football games and quit going to things they're already telling us they're going to do because of gasoline costs and diesel costs being higher because of lack of supply, it's our responsibility to address the broader issue of energy and not school buildings, which is a local and State issue. 
   Mr. Speaker, I speak against this rule and against this bill.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, from the rhetoric we have heard in this House today, it is clear that somebody is going to be negotiating on behalf of Medicare. 
   For my money, I will trust the private enterprise employee who works for that prescription drug plan who is negotiating with the drug companies to get the lowest price in order to be able to lower premiums to the Medicare beneficiary that is going to be paying those premiums. That system is working. That is one side of the negotiation. 
   If H.R. 4 passes today, we will substitute for that free market negotiator a career bureaucrat who keeps their job no matter what happens with respect to the price of drugs. 
   H.R. 4 is a flawed solution to a problem that doesn't exist. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words. There's a movie out called ``Groundhog Day'' in which the same thing happens over and over for a particularly long period of time. 
   We've had this debate once recently. We're having it again today, and I understand the leadership on the other side intends to have these conversations once a week for the next 4 weeks. I don't anticipate that much different information will be said. 
   I have the profoundest respect for the chairman of the committee and the man whose name is on this resolution, but I'm going to have to oppose it. 
   Much of what gets said here today, Mr. Speaker, is doublespeak. It's doublespeak to talk about the failure to get benchmark progress on the civilian scene, on the political scene in Iraq, and yet to strip $2 billion out of the State Department's funding request, part of the CR, to strip another $500 million out of the 2008 appropriations request, money that would go to do the nation-building part, the provincial reconstruction team part in Iraq, and then to call it a failure. That's doublespeak in a classic sense. 
   It's doublespeak, Mr. Speaker, to talk about how wonderful our troops are, and they are. They are magnificent, and even more magnificent are the families who support them and let them do what they do. And then to turn around and say that the implementation of this policy has failed, but somehow they've not failed as a result of that; I think that's doublespeak as well. 
   It's also doublespeak to say the current policy says we're going to have a report in 60 days from David Petraeus, the right man at the right spot to give us that report, and then vote on a resolution that says 120 days we're going to start getting out, when we'll have the better information in September, in 60 days. That's doublespeak. It's disingenuous, I believe, to do it that way. 
   The majority has the ability to get out of Iraq today. And all of the talk about failure, all of the talk about the lost lives, all of the talk about the costs, by extending this another 120 days, as they intend to do, leaves additional lives at risk. And somehow to me, that just seems to be at counter purposes of what the conversation is. 
   I encourage my colleagues to vote this resolution down.

   I, too, rise in opposition to the Udall amendment, not because I am opposed to conservation of grasslands, but simply because hard choices were made to craft a bill that was as balanced as we can get it. If you were on the living end of the commodity program and cotton, you know already the dramatic changes that are going to be in the offing if this bill does pass. To come in now and ask for one more change, one more reduction, is inappropriate, and I would oppose that and hope that our good colleagues who support conservation would understand this is a very difficult process. We have set priorities, and I think the finely tuned bill that came out of the committee is one we ought to support and not make this change. I respectfully oppose the gentleman's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (THE COUNTDOWN CREW: COUNTDOWN TO THE TAX INCREASE BY THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY -- (House of Representatives - March 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Because, as you know, I am only one election away from being back in public practice. So maintaining my credentials that I have used for 30-plus years is important. Part of that work I did was with taxpayers, folks who actually make money and then pay taxes on that money. 
   There is nothing inherently moral or immoral about a tax rate. The number in itself is not magic. We have gotten ourselves into a real ugly box in comparing or contrasting or linking spending issues with particular tax rates. In my view, those are entirely two different issues all together. 
   We ought to determine what we ought to spend and what that appropriate amount is and then figure out how to collect the minimum amount of taxes needed to spend that. To the extent we try to link tax cuts on one type of a taxpayer to spending in other areas is a false argument. It is a straw man that is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. I can assure you that the Federal Government's accounting system does not put cash from this particular tax rate into this bucket that is only spent on welfare; from this tax rate into one bucket, only goes in the Defense. 
   Cash is fungible. I think we should reformulate the debate away from this idea that there is some link between the specific tax rates and specific spending issues, because I believe that is just a false argument, and it leads us down a bad path. Let's focus on what we ought to be spending in a variety of  areas, whether it is defense or health care whatever it might be, let's figure out what the right amount is for that area. Then let's look for a system that allows us to collect that in a straightforward, easy to comply with, fair basis. I don't think our current Tax Code meets any of those criteria. 
   I have made a living for a long time helping people comply with the complexity of it. You know, a lot of my colleagues are in the same boat. But this current system is unworkable, and it leads us down the wrong path. 
   As you have mentioned, we are now under 1,400 days away from the largest tax increase America has ever seen with the expiration of the current tax rate and the current tax schemes as it relates to the death tax. 
   We don't know if those are the right ones or not, but they are the ones we have got. The ones we have had in place since 2001, I think, in no small part have contributed to the growth of this economy, have contributed to taxpayers being able to have more of their own money, to put that investment back into their families, businesses and other things. The current tax rates are working, and to the extent that they expire and have automatic increases is unfortunate. 
   I understand we are about out of time. I appreciate getting to join you late in the hour.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (NATIONAL HIGHWAY BRIDGE RECONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chairman, I offer a bipartisan amendment in that it is cosponsored by Mr. Arcuri and Ms. Sutton. 
   This amendment is an effort to encourage States seeking Federal funding to develop plans that will alleviate or avert corrosion on all new bridge construction, as well as major rehabilitation projects. It is a commonsense approach to dealing with an issue, one of the issues that faces our Nation's infrastructure and that is corrosion on bridges. It is perfectly reasonable to ask States seeking Federal funds that build or rehabilitate a bridge to submit a plan for how that State plans to maintain it, specifically the State's plan for preventing and mitigating corrosion. 
   Each year corrosion of our Nation's highway bridges hits the U.S. economy with a hefty price tag. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation Highway Administration report, corrosion costs and preventive strategies in the United States presented to Congress in 2002, corrosion of highway bridges cost the U.S. economy about $8.3 billion annually, with an outlay of repairs of about $3.8 billion over the next 10 years to replace structurally deficient bridges. 
   The bill, this sense of Congress amendment, would seek that, in order to get approval, to have an approved bridge corrosion mitigation and prevention plan, that it would include the minimum items, such as the estimated useful life of the bridge, an estimate of the environmental exposure that would influence corrosion and corrosion mitigation strategies for the bridge, such as environmental type, marine, industrial and rural, rainfall, temperature, freeze-thaw cycles, deicer applications, and other factors that influence corrosion prevention and corrosion mitigation strategies. An identification of the functional classification of the bridge, details of corrosion mitigation and prevention methods that will be used to protect the bridge, including material selection, coating, cathodic protection, design considerations for corrosion, and concrete requirements, details of a project maintenance program for the life of the bridge, a certification that the plan was developed by the State and approved by a corrosion expert, and a certification that each individual conducting inspections of a Federal-aid highway bridge in the State receive training from a corrosion expert. 
   Madam Chairman, this is a sense of Congress in a stand-alone version that a couple of other Members and I have in Congress that will be an actual requirement, and I hope that at some point in the future we can work with the chairman and the committee to look at the idea of whether or not this makes sense; that when you build a bridge, one of the factors ought to be how do you protect it from corrosion, how do we taxpayers get the maximum amount of useful life out of a bridge by protecting it from corrosion, and that this plan be in place so that the builders of the bridge not only will know what the cost of the front end of the bridge is, but what the maintenance costs and protective costs, corrosion protection costs for this bridge would be over its life so that they can budget for that cost and make sure that we have those plans in place. 
   Madam Chairman, I encourage adoption of what I believe is a pretty straightforward commonsense approach to an issue that affects every single bridge of the United States. Whether it is a rural bridge, an urban bridge, a bridge on the ocean or a bridge on the inland seas, has corrosion issues. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

The taxpayers can get all of the money out of them, all of the benefit out of them that they should have gotten when they were originally built. This corrosion effort, I think, is a good part of that.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Chairman, things that we do in this Chamber have consequences, and the things we don't do in Chamber also have consequences. Quite frankly, there are a lot things that we are not doing that are having immense consequences, things like renewing the FISA bill, the war supplemental, long-term issues like Social Security and Medicaid. We had another one today, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, which are things that will have consequences because we have not dealt with this on the floor. 
   The internal combustion engine will be used for a long time to power pleasure craft on our lakes and beaches and waterways. The public policy decisions that we are taking in here and have taken in here make that use of those boats and jet skis much more expensive. 
   Public policy decisions that are specifically aimed at increasing the energy costs to all Americans are things like raising taxes on energy companies so that they are no longer able to use that money to explore for and produce additional crude oil and natural gas, restrictions on where we can drill for these additional sources of crude oil and natural gas, and the gasoline that results from that to power our water crafts and jet ski, added regulations on the production of crude oil and natural gas, added regulations on the refining of crude oil and natural gas and the gasoline that can be used to power jet skis and motor boats and others, and even new regulations that are coming that will increase the cost of electricity to American consumers and American businesses.     
   All of these public policy decisions that we make in this House and have made in this House are specifically designed to raise the operating costs of all these vehicles to consumers in America. It is the elephant in the room that none of us want to talk about as we go forward with the energy policy that is put forth by the leadership of the current House. That is, they specifically want Americans paying higher gasoline prices because when you reduce supplies, as these policies do in the face of increasing demand, then the law of supply and demand works, in spite of our best efforts, and costs go up. 
   As we have seen, gasoline prices are at an all-time high. This weekend, which will be a wonderful weekend to be on our beaches and lakes, using those watercrafts, the gasoline that will be purchased to pay for that recreational use this weekend will be much higher than it otherwise would have been than if we had taken rational steps with respect to energy policy in this country.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. I, too, want to congratulate the majority party for bringing an open rule bill to the floor. It is a rare event. And hopefully our side won't wear out its welcome so poorly that this is the last open rule bill that is brought. I know it has to happen on appropriations bills, but we are not too excited about those coming later this year. 
   I rise in support of the Flake amendment. It is a pretty straightforward amendment that, to quote an often poorly used phrase, the opponent doth protest too much. I have not heard anything really as to why it is inappropriate for this to be attached to the legislation, how this would cripple the legislation, how this would prevent the monitoring processes, how this would prevent the grant-based programming from functioning. I have just heard arguments that ``let's don't do it because we have never done it that way before.'' 
   And I am persuaded that under the Department of Homeland Security example, this idea of ``let's just, because we have not done it before, we won't do it in the future.'' And I would prefer to have a straightforward statement in this important legislation. 
   We had an event this past year where a young man, although this legislation won't affect this because it happened in one of the lakes in Texas, where a young man had an amoeba-borne illness get into his brain, and it killed him. It was a freak and tragic accident. And obviously this legislation is aimed at trying to prevent similar type of occurrences on our beaches, coastal beaches I guess, but the idea that somehow because we have been pure in the past we will remain pure in the future. And our history here with respect to earmarks is anything but that. 
   So as we look at the Flake amendment and why it is important, I hope that someone can rise to say, here is a mechanical reason why it is inappropriate to have this earmark restriction, this statement, flatout statement that I think both sides can agree on. Because while earmarking doesn't really fix the overall spending pattern and the overall spending problem that we have in this Congress, because everybody knows that the annual budget is set, and every one of those nickels that get allocated to the Appropriations Committee will get spent, and most all of this earmark churn happens within that number. And so to the extent that we do away with all earmarks, it really won't impact the total amount spent.     
   My grandchildren, of whom I have seven, have a $53 trillion debt staring them in the face because we have made $53 trillion in unfunded promises to each other, issues that we think are important to my generation and my parents' generation, but we are taking their money to pay for it. 
   So anything that we can do to begin the process of restricting spending on issues like earmarks in this instance, on a bill that clearly works best on a grant-based formula, where the mileage of the beaches are assessed in each State and the money is parceled out that way as fairly as it can be, we can argue how much that money ought to be from time to time, but to expose it to the earmarking process I think is inappropriate. 
   I hope, like I said, that the Members who oppose the mechanics of this can help those of us who don't understand the mechanics understand why an earmark restriction that the Flake amendment would put in place cripples and hamstrings this otherwise good legislation, because all of us want safe water to swim in and to play in, but we also want my grandchildren to be able to afford to address the issues they have in front of them some 50 years from now with their money. Quite frankly, it is going to take a Herculean effort among all of us here and everybody listening today to rein in that $53 trillion in unfunded promises. 
   This House, as important as this legislation is, continues to ignore major problems facing this country, problems like the FISA reauthorization, problems like the war supplemental, problems like Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid. We continue to simply let those slide, and those failed actions have consequences. 
   We are going to add another one today, the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. By refusing to take action on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, we have left more work undone as we  go about all this business. All of that has consequences. As many of my colleagues have said, it has consequences on energy policy, it has consequences on the fiscal policy of this country. 
   I think this is a simple step on a simple bill that would allow the fiscal operations of this process to go forward in an appropriate and in a correct manner. So, I urge my colleagues to support the Flake amendment, should we get a vote on that. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Clayton W. Williams, Jr., on his receipt of the Conservation Champion Award from the Texas Parks & Wildlife Foundation. 
   Claytie, as he is affectionately known, is a favorite son of Texas, not only for his business acumen, but also for his unending generosity and tireless volunteerism. The Conservation Champion Award is but the most recent in a long list of honors that have been bestowed upon him for his philanthropic activities. 
   Throughout his life, Claytie has been at the forefront of the conservation movement. Recently, Claytie and his wife, Modesta, granted one of the largest conservation easements in Texas history: 60,000 acres spread across two ranches. By doing so, they have set aside this land for future development and preserved the land's unspoiled character, picturesque vistas, and natural habitat forever. 
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Claytie today, and my words are recorded in the Congressional Record. It is my wish that this small statement about his service will last as long as the gift he has given to Texas. I hope that in the distant future when we are all long passed away, someone finds these words and realizes that there was not always a movement to preserve open space and there was not always 60,000 acres in southwest Texas kept as pristine as they were 100 years ago. 
   The gift Claytie has given the people of Texas will last as long as our Union. We should remember this man of extraordinary vision and foresight for at least that long. 
   Through his leadership and actions, the State of Texas, and indeed, all of America, is more conscious of its natural heritage, more thoughtful of the land on which we live, and more interested in preserving all of it for the coming generations. 
   On behalf of my constituents of the 11th District of Texas, I want to express my thanks to Clayton and his wife, Modesta, for his lifetime of generosity, and to congratulate him on the  receipt of the Conservation Champion Award.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, the Preamble of the Constitution reads: ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' 
   On this day, 220 years ago, the 55 delegates to the Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia to hold their final meeting and sign a document that would change the course of history. Our Founding Fathers created a monumental plan to govern a sprawling young country dedicated to the idea that citizens were sovereign and should be as free from the tyranny of unchecked authority. 
   Constitution Day presents us with an opportunity to pause and reflect on what a magnificent job these 55 individuals did in crafting a compromise which has provided us with a unified and stable Nation. In their wisdom, they sought to protect the rights and liberties of individuals by dividing power and authority between States and the national government. The result is a system of shared roles designed to prevent any one element from gaining too much power. 
   Members of Congress have taken an oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and with that responsibility in mind it is vital for us to fully understand this sacred document. That is why today on the 220th anniversary of the signing of our Constitution I am introducing the AMERICA Act: A Modest Effort to Read and Instill the Constitution Again. 
   The AMERICA Act simply states that Members of Congress, Senators, and their respective staff read the Constitution annually. 
   Mr. Speaker, we Members of Congress are pledged to uphold this Constitution, to defend this Constitution, write the laws that implement this Constitution and from time to time propose constitutional amendments to change this Constitution. It is my hope that this modest yearly effort will renew and deepen our appreciation for the brilliance of the Constitution and the division and constraints on power contained within it. 
   The AMERICA Act is meant to be a reminder to lawmakers to stay within our country's founding framework as we conduct our legislative business. To our detriment, we often take the path of political expedience and ignore the limits so clearly written into the Constitution 
   Today, I call on all Members of Congress to join me and rededicate ourselves to our founding principles of limited, constrained governance as enshrined in our Constitution. By studying our founding document, we will continue the legacy of these great men and their groundbreaking ideas, as well as develop the habits of citizenship  that keep the Constitution alive and relevant for our new generation of Americans. 
   I urge you all to join me in cosponsoring the Support America Act and its vital passage

   Quite frankly, those sins are hard to deny, given the empirical evidence is there. We have spent a lot of money and raised the size of this government. 
   That being said, though, my colleagues' arguments seem to rest on the premise that, because the Republicans were spending more and screwing this thing up, that somehow this gives the Democrats, gives them some license to continue that process, to continue building on this growing government and spending more money in fiscal 2008 than we will bring in. 
   Now, we have heard some arguments that this is not deficit spending, but, quite frankly, there will be more money spent under this budget in 2008 than we will take in. In the simplest form, that is a deficit. 
   I am not, personally, a big fan of across-the-board cuts. I agree with some of the arguments said on the other side that it's mechanical, but, quite frankly, we need to start somewhere on the path to fiscal responsibility, and this is a modest start down that path.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, the amendment is pretty straightforward. 
   We have heard hours and hours today of debate on whether or not we should cut spending out of this proposed appropriations bill that has been brought forward. The elephant in the room that we don't talk about is, under the mechanics of the law under House rules, were any of these amendments that we will be voting on in a few minutes to pass, they would not actually reduce spending. The amounts would still remain within the 302(b) allocation and would be spent somewhere else within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. 
   What my amendment would do would be to say that, instead of that being the occurrence, the savings would actually go against the deficit; and should we ever have a surplus, it would actually include that surplus. 
   I intend to withdraw the amendment. I understand the point of order. But, before I do, Mr. Chairman, I want to make one other comment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am a Christian, and I take very seriously the instructions in the New Testament, particularly verses like Luke 12:48 that says, ``To whom much is given, much is required.'' I understand the parable of the sick and the unclothed and the jailed. But I see those instructions to me personally, to take my personal assets, my personal wealth, and deal with those issues for my fellow man. I see no instruction that tells me to take someone else's blessings and wealth to fix those problems. 
   So I would urge my colleagues to be very careful when they invoke those instructions. 
   Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment if I could have some help from the other side in working towards a solution that would allow spending cuts that actually are voted on and passed to reduce deficits and increase surpluses, rather than staying within the 302(b) allocation. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, for the past decade, within rural communities throughout the country, home water bills have increased faster than the rate of inflation, and it seems likely that this trend will continue. Currently, rural populations across America are being forced to comply with extremely costly regulations regarding standards that have been set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have rural constituents who are currently paying upwards of 770 percent more for water service than that of urban populations due to regulatory items and the inability to spread these costs over a wide basis. 
   As deregulations are implemented and aging infrastructures replaced, the affordability of water service in rural America will continue to be of great concern. Water systems, consumers, administrators and policy makers will need to focus on the ability of rural households to pay for public water service. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is not a solution to the underlying problem; it is a recognition of the issue and a step in the right direction. My amendment would simply add to the considerations for these grants recognition of water systems serving 10,000 people or less.

   Mr. CONAWAY. Yes, sir. This goes into the part of the bill that talks about additional consideration. The administrator has wide leeway in how they grant these grants, and I would simply like in the Record, in the law, that this is one of the things that administrator should take into consideration. This in no way binds or ties their hands to any particular size of community or use but allows good judgment by the administrator and in recognition that rural America is outnumbered on this floor. And having those words in this language will be particularly important to the constituents I serve who recognize that and understand that from time to time you guys have got us outnumbered. So it does not set up a preference, but it simply says, here is one other criteria to look at when you decide on these questions.

<DOCNO>Mr. CONAWAY. (WE NEED SPENDING RESTRAINT, NOT TAX HIKES -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the 2008 budget that the Democrats are putting together. In all likelihood, it will require a spending of $2.9 trillion. Let me put that money in perspective. That is $90,000 plus every second of the fiscal year. It is a lot of money. 
   Tax rates will be going up under current law unless this Congress acts to not do that. There is a myth being purported by the other side that we can somehow tax the rich and balance the budget. That is a myth. The top 10 percent of taxpayers already pay two-thirds of the taxes that are being paid in this country. 
   Spending restraint is far more impactful on balancing the budget than raising taxes. We have a spending problem, not a tax-raising problem. I urge my colleagues to work on spending restraint as the true measure of how we fix this deficit.
