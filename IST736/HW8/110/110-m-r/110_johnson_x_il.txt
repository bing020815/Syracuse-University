<DOCNO>Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the President's plan to deploy an additional 21,500 American troops in Iraq. I oppose this course of action and feel that contributing more troops to this war is not in the best interest of our country.  
   One only needs to look back on the timeline of events in Iraq to realize how much we have given that country. From the deposing of Saddam Hussein and his ruthless heirs, to the drafting of a constitution and free elections, the United States has fulfilled its role in liberating Iraq. However, the sacrifices our country has made must be met by an even stronger commitment by Iraq's leaders to face the challenges of a fledgling democracy and ensure the safety and freedom of its own people. 
   Our troops have served with tremendous bravery during this nearly 4 year endeavor. The resolution we are discussing today contains a pledge that Congress will ``continue to support and protect'' our courageous men and women who are serving or who have served in Iraq. This is a promise we must keep and I will work with like-minded colleagues to ensure that the members of the United States Armed Forces continue to have the resources they need while they are in harms way and after they return home. 
   However, I am in disagreement with the President on sending 21,500 more troops to Iraq because the time has passed for the leaders and citizens of Iraq to ascend and defend their country. The people of this country sent a message to the Congress a few months ago and my constituents have made it increasingly clear to me that they do not support the escalation of U.S. troop involvement amidst the seemingly endless sectarian strife inside Iraq. 
   Therefore, I rise in support of this resolution.
