<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CONSUMER ENERGY SUPPLY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I thank my colleague for yielding, and let me say to my colleagues, this is a joke. This is this week's answer to America's energy crisis. We are going to take 70 million barrels of one type of oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and we are going to replace it with another. It doesn't bring us any more supply. And as I said, this is just the latest excuse for not having a real energy bill on the floor. 
   We have got this bill this week. Last week we had Use It Or Lose It, another farce because it is already the law. We had another bill up that said, well, let's try to encourage the President to speed up the pipeline in Alaska. And let's make sure that we drill in the National Petroleum Reserve, which is already allowed. Nothing that is going to bring more supply. And it has been one excuse after another excuse when we actually could have a vote on a real energy bill that does all of the above. 
   I and my colleagues yesterday introduced the American Energy Plan that says we ought to have more conservation, we ought to have more biofuels, more incentives for alternative sources of energy. We ought to have nuclear energy; and yes, we ought to have more American-made energy. And whether that oil and gas comes from the continental shelf of Alaska or the Outer Continental Shelf, or from the oil shale that we have in Intermountain West, why can't we produce more American energy to bring down gas prices for the American people. 
   I'll tell you why, because they've done everything humanly possible to prevent a vote in this Chamber. The Speaker has gone through every hi-jinks, every legislative trick known to man to avoid allowing us to offer an amendment. That is why this bill is being considered under a suspension of the rules. We are not allowed to offer an amendment. That is why we have no appropriations, because my goodness, someone might offer an energy amendment on the floor of the House and it might pass. What does the Speaker have to fear in allowing this House to work its will? 
   And I think the American Energy Plan is something that the American people support. I think the votes are in this Chamber to pass that bill, but we are not allowed to vote. I thought that is what the American people sent us here to do, to represent their will; and the Speaker is standing in front of the will of the American people by refusing to allow us to vote. 
   Let's not vote for another excuse, another excuse to delay the actual vote for a real bill, a real bill that will bring down gas prices; and that is all this bill is, another excuse. It doesn't deserve our support.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, just as the Democrat leadership of this Congress is sticking its collective head in the sand when it comes to energy legislation, it is doing the same with the entitlement crisis that we face. 
   My colleagues, ignoring this crisis won't make it go away. But this is just what the measure before us will do, allow us to ignore this big problem for just a little while longer. 
   Earlier this year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services warned that if Congress doesn't act, government health care spending will grow to over $2 trillion by 2017. Medicare alone will account for almost one-quarter of this total. We can't afford that, our children can't afford that, and most certainly our grandchildren can't afford it. 
   But today, the majority is saying, well, we are just going to wait for the next generation of lawmakers to deal with this problem instead of doing what we should do now. The majority is also saying something else. They are saying thank you to their trial lawyer allies. This is something that they have said quite often during the last 2 years, as we all know. By not addressing the Medicare funding crisis in a comprehensive way, we are dodging fundamental liability reform that the entire health care system needs so sorely. Who gains? Trial lawyers. Who loses? Patients, doctors and taxpayers. 
   The majority leader said several months ago that he believed Medicare reform would be one of the most important issues for the next Congress and the next administration. Well, with the bill before us, it is clear that the majority leader meant what he said. But I think it is regrettable. It is irresponsible, and it is unfair to our children and theirs, not to mention the seniors who rely on this program today. They are going to bear the consequences of our refusal to step up and do the right thing. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat this. Let's have the courage to do what the American people sent us here to do: to solve this entitlement crisis in a fair and bipartisan way.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (RECOVERY REBATES AND ECONOMIC STIMULUS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Louisiana for his generous words and thank all of my colleagues for the generous spirit that we find in the Chamber today. 
   I think that the bill that we have before us that embodies an agreement that Speaker Pelosi and I came to last week, along with the administration, is going to help middle-class families that are in a pinch. Their cost of living is rising, whether it be the cost of health insurance, the cost of gasoline, energy, and at a time when their salaries and their incomes aren't rising. 
   And I think that what the American people want is they want solutions, solutions to the problems that we face in our country. And I believe that the bipartisan measure that we have will, in fact, help give a short-term boost to our economy. It will put money in the pockets of American families. It will give businesses reasons to invest in new equipment, to maintain and hopefully to expand their employment. 
   Is the bill perfect? No, it's not perfect. Republicans gave a little, the Speaker gave a little, and at the end of the day, we came to an agreement that I think represents what the American people expect of us. They expect us to find ways to work together, not reasons to continue to fight with each other. And the bill that we have before us is the way good legislation occurs. 
   I've said this many times before, if I look back over my career in Congress: The bills that I remember most, the most significant legislation that I've worked on, has always been done in a bipartisan way, whether I was in the minority or in the majority. And I want to thank Speaker Pelosi for her willingness to sit down and work together in a bipartisan way, in a constructive way. I want to thank Secretary of the Treasury Paulson for their work in helping to facilitate this agreement. And I look forward to this bill passing today and hopefully quick action in the Senate. 
   The sooner this happens and the sooner we get this relief in the hands of the American people, the sooner they can begin to do their job of being good consumers and investing this money in our economy. 
   Some people say it won't work, that it's too little, it's too late, and we shouldn't be doing this. You know, I've thought about that. I've got concerns about whether this package will, in fact, work. But I've got bigger concerns that if we do nothing, if we do nothing, we're just asking for our economy to slow even further. And what that will do to Federal revenues, what that will do to inflict pain on middle-class American families, frankly, is unacceptable. So, I think it's worth the chance and worth the opportunity for us to do this economic growth package and to do it now. 
   Now, having said that, we've got a longer term issue in terms of economic growth in America. Our economy, frankly, has been very good over, really, if you go back, over the last 15 years we've had a very strong economy. We've had a couple of slowdowns along the way, but when you look down the road, there are some clouds on the horizon that we ought to be concerned about. The idea that the tax relief that we put in place earlier this decade to help those who invest in our economy, those who pay taxes on our economy, the fact that that tax relief was temporary, it might come back, I think causes a lot of investors to wonder whether they should invest more in America's economy. And so, making that tax relief permanent is a very important part of our long-term economic growth. 
   Secondly, corporations in America pay taxes. And a lot of Members think corporations pay taxes. The entity pays taxes to the Federal Government, but corporations don't pay taxes, their customers and their employees pay taxes. And having a tax structure on corporate America that gives them reason to wonder should they locate here or should they locate somewhere else, I think, is, again, sending the wrong signal. If we want people to invest in our economy, our corporate tax structure has to be competitive with those around the world. And today, it is not. And it needs to be done. 
   The tax extenders that we've talked about in the past, especially the research and development tax credit that gives companies a reason to invest in research and development here in the United States, is critical to our long-term success. And why that hasn't been reauthorized as of yet is beyond me, but I hope it will be reauthorized soon. 
   Madam Speaker, many Americans, in my view, correctly believe that Washington is broken. I hope that this agreement in this bipartisan bill that we will move today gives Americans some hope that we really can begin to fix the problems, that we can begin to make sure that Washington works for the American people. 
   And so, I'm glad to be here today. I'm glad to join with Speaker Pelosi and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in hailing this agreement and moving it in a bipartisan way. And I am hopeful that the Senate can move very quickly.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and say to my colleagues that we don't have time to have a vote this week on our All-American Energy Plan that would actually bring down gas prices in America, but we've got time to regulate tobacco. 
   Now this bill has been hanging around here for 15 years. For 15 years, we've been trying to move this piece of legislation. We're going to charge the tobacco companies about $5 billion over the next few years to pay for a bureaucracy here in Washington so we can regulate tobacco. 
   Now, listen. Most of my colleagues know that I smoke. I know that smoking is probably not good for my health. Most people who smoke in America know that smoking is probably not good for their health. Do we need the Federal Government to tell us? Do we need to spend $5 billion of smokers' money for the government to tell us that smoking is not good for us? I don't think so. This bill has not been through the legislative process as everything was promised that it should be. Frankly, the whole idea that the Federal Government ought to regulate more and more and more of our lives just gets under my skin. 
   I have great respect for my colleague from Michigan. He is a great Member of Congress, and we've worked together on a lot of issues, but this is a boneheaded idea. I mean, how much is enough? How much government do we need? More and more and more. There is not a smoker in America who doesn't understand that smoking isn't good for you, but now we're going to have the Federal Government, a big agency, set up under this bill where the FDA is going to be required to have this whole bureaucracy. It will have all of these new buildings. It will hire all of these people to issue all of these regulations that the tobacco companies are going to have to comply with and that smokers will pay for so that we can, out of all of this, understand that smoking is not good for you. 
   We've already got labels on cigarettes. You've got some companies that might as well put a billboard on a pack of cigarettes so that you know that it's bad for you. I can imagine what will happen after we get more government regulations on this issue. I would just ask my colleagues: How much is enough? How much regulation and how much government and how much bureaucracy do we need before we finally say, Enough is enough? Let's stop. Let's vote against this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, the Democrat majority here in Congress just voted a few minutes ago to adjourn for the August district work period without bringing a real bill to the floor that will open up American energy for development. Instead, they have brought this sham bill up here, trying to blame speculators for the problems that we have with the lack of energy in America. 
   We have had a number of these bills over the last 4 or 5 weeks, use it or lose it. We have already had a speculators bill on the floor once that passed, and a number of other ideas that are nothing more than a way to try to divert attention from the fact that they refuse to have a bill on the floor that is supported by a bipartisan majority of this Congress that would allow energy development in America. 
   The American Energy Act that we introduced last week is our plan to do all of the above. It would ask us to do more in terms of conservation, more in terms of bio fuels, more in terms of incentives for the development of alternative sources of energy. It would streamline the application process and permitting process for nuclear energy. And yes, it would allow us to drill in America for more oil and gas in an environmentally sensitive way. But that bill is not on the floor, nor will it be on the floor because the Speaker has refused to allow a bill to come. 
   And so what do we have? We have another excuse. Kind of reminds me of the old political adage. ``Don't blame me; don't blame thee; let's blame the man behind the tree.'' 
   This is no substitute for a real bill on drilling, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. 
   I know this has been a difficult several days, but I just want to remind everyone that there are some serious process fouls that are going on. And the majority leader, the Speaker, members of the majority during 2005 and 2006 made significant efforts to be critical of the then-majority, some of it, frankly, earned. 
   But what is happening here, the process that's being used for the big housing bill, the process that's being discussed for the supplemental spending bill closes the minority out of any amendments and any motion to recommit. 
   I just hope that the majority leader and the members of the majority understand, and I think many of you who have been here for some time understand clearly, the grievance that we have. We don't have many ways to express our grievance on the housing bills because we have no amendment that we can offer. We have no substitute that we're allowed to offer, no motion to recommit. As a result, all we're asking for is to be treated fairly. 
   The gentleman will know, and other members of the majority and minority will remember, that in 1994 when we took the majority, some of our leaders wanted to treat the minority the way they had been treated. I argued to no end that we should treat the minority the way that we had asked to be treated when we were in the minority. I didn't always win, I'll be the first one to admit that, but I would suggest that given the statements that have been made in 2005 and 2006 about how the then-minority was treated, all I would suggest to you is just treat us the way you asked to be treated, simple as that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate my colleague for yielding, and Ohio State will be in the national championship on January 7. And we look forward to dealing with our colleagues from Louisiana. 
   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, there has been a lot said on the floor today about the national energy crisis that we face. We know that it jeopardizes our national security, we know that it jeopardizes our own economy and American jobs here at home, and this is an issue that the American people are very concerned about. We have got rising gasoline prices. We have got home heating oil prices and gas prices for this winter that are really going to hurt the American families' budget. So we have a crisis that deserves our response and our collective efforts. But what we have here today is a bill that was written in secret, written by a handful of people on the majority side in each Chamber that we didn't see until last night. Nobody knows what is in this bill because nobody has had time to read it. 
   One thing that is in here that I think is something that certainly will be useful is the CAFE agreement that Mr. Dingell and others reached that will give us more efficient cars in the future and done in a practical way to help domestic manufacturers and the consumers in America who are going to have to pay for this. 
   But we know what is not in it. There is nothing in here that is going to lower gasoline prices in America. There is nothing in here that is going to help American families deal with the heating costs they are going to have this winter. There is nothing here in this bill that is going to increase domestic production of energy. And at the end of the day, if we are very serious about solving the energy crisis in America, we have got to deal with conservation. We have got to deal with alternative sources of fuel. We have to deal with increased production here in the United States, and my goodness, why won't we talk about nuclear energy on the floor of the House of Representatives of the United States when we know that it is the cleanest source of fuel for our future? But it is not in here. 
   Now, I did find some other things that were in this bill. Earmarks. Oh, yeah, we have to have earmarks. If we are going to move a piece of legislation, we have to take care of a few people. So I found $161 million in here for the Plum Creek Timber Company's Montana land holdings for native fish habitat conservation. I didn't know that fish lived in trees. We have $2 billion earmark in here from our good friend from New York City to help New York develop a rail line from the JFK Airport to Lower Manhattan. That's something I am sure my constituents want to pay for. 
   One of the better issues in here, though, is the $3 billion slush fund, $3 billion of our money that we are going to give to cities and counties around America for green projects, except the definition is so wide that they can do almost anything, like some city can decide they are going to finance Al Gore's speaking tour to promote his book, ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' or maybe Beverly Hills will replace their police cars with Lexus hybrids. Certainly it would count if you look at the bill. We could be buying some energy-efficient hybrid snowmobiles for Aspen or Snowmass or any of those places. All that would be allowed under this provision. Or we can even use some of this money to finish the rain forest that we are building in Iowa. This is not where the American people want their money to go to. 
   Although this is not an earmark, what I really liked in the bill was the $240 tax credit that we are going to provide every 15 months for people who regularly ride their bike to work for the purchase, repair or storage of their bicycle. Now, amongst us, I know there is one of my colleagues that would probably benefit from this. I hope he is going to recuse himself when we vote. This is not going to solve America's energy problem. I think that we ought to get serious as a country about energy independence and saving our future and the future for our kids. 
   But while we are here dealing with this bill that doesn't frankly do much and will not solve our problem, think about what we haven't done. You know Christmas is right around the corner for some of you that haven't realized it. The majority leader said yesterday that we would be out by next Friday. The gentleman from Maryland yesterday, the majority leader, said we would be out by December 14. Now, first, I wanted to say ``Ha-Ha-Ha,'' but then I began to realize we are close to Christmas so I thought, well, ``Ho-Ho-Ho'' might be more appropriate. Now there is not a chance that that is going to happen. 
   We haven't dealt with the AMT problem. We are about to put 23 million Americans under the alternative minimum tax that have never been there before. We have not done anything to fund our troops or our veterans that are about to run out of money. Men and women in the military, in Afghanistan and in Iraq, are out there fighting to protect the American people. We have not dealt with that funding. We have not dealt with 11 of the 12 appropriation bills that should have been done by October but, you know, we were going to get them done by Thanksgiving, and here it is, December 6, my wife's birthday, RAY LAHOOD's birthday, December 6, and we still haven't done 11 of the 12 appropriations bills. Yet none of this is finished at a time when we ought to be getting serious about getting our work done. 
   So I would ask my colleagues, let's get serious about energy independence. Let's get serious about what we need to do as a nation to solve the future for our kids and theirs. And until we get serious, I think we should vote ``no'' on this bill. 
   But I would implore my colleagues to also realize that our constituents are looking for us, our families are going to be looking for us soon, and it is time for us to wrap up our work but get our work finished, because the American people expect it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Chairman, let me thank my colleague from California for yielding, and thank him and the members of the Education and Labor Committee for their work on this bill. 
   Let me also say it is nice to see the chairman of the Education and Labor Committee here, formerly the ranking member during the 5 years that he and I worked together. During those 5 years, this bill went nowhere. It went nowhere for a very good reason. 
   Over the last 75 years, the Federal Government, State governments and the National Labor Relations Board have provided law and case history to try to bring balance between the interests of employers and the interests of the unions. If you go down through this long history, there is a very tumultuous history. But throughout this history, the challenge was to bring balance, for workers and their employers. 
   Over the last 25 years, there is no issue I have spent more time on during my political career than working with the employer community and the employee community, mostly represented by the labor movement. 
   My goal throughout this last 25 years has been to maintain this balance that  I think works for employers and their employees, and what we have here today is trying to upset that balance, taking away the secret ballot election from workers in order to make their choice whether they want to be represented or not. 
   It is almost beyond my imagination that this bill is on the floor of the United States House of Representatives taking away the secret ballot election. Think about this for a moment. Think about the 2008 election day, and here we are. You don't get to go into a voting booth and vote for who you want to be President in the 2008 election. You don't get to go and decide in a secret ballot who you want your Member of Congress to be. You have to show up at a town hall meeting, raise your hand as to who you are going to vote for; let your neighbors know, let your opponents know, let your employers know how you are going to cast your vote for President or for your Member of Congress. 
   I don't think that is what the American people expect of us. Instead of I am looking up at the voting booth, you are going to be standing up in front of God and everyone and telling everyone publicly how you voted. That is not what we want of workers. 
   Think about this for a moment. This is what a 1990 Federal Court decision found, and I will quote: ``On average, 18 percent of those who sign authorization cards do not want to join the union. They sign because they want to mollify their friends who are soliciting, because they think the cards will get them their dues waived in the event that the union shop prevailed.'' 
   There was an earlier study by the National Labor Relations Board. It found that in cases where unions had cards signed by 30 to 50 percent of the employees, unions only won 19 percent of those elections. Or even when unions had cards signed by 50 to 70 percent of the workers, they won less than half of those elections. 
   Let's talk about what this really is all about. This bill today is not about protecting American workers. It is about upsetting the balance between labor and management. 
   But the real issue here is not taking care of workers, it is taking care of union bosses. We all know what is happening to the union movement in America. They represent about 8 percent of the private sector employees in the country, and that number has been dropping precipitously. This is an effort to help them get more members, to make it easier for them to sign them up and to intimidate them to sign cards. So there are no secret ballot elections. And whether they want to join a union or not, they are going to be forced to do it. That is not the American way. 
   My colleague from California, the sponsor of this bill, knows full well what this bill does and who it is meant to take care of and who it is meant to pay back to. It is not the American way, and that is not what should be happening in the People's House. 
   We, as Members of Congress, have a responsibility to do what we think is right on behalf of the American people, and I am going to tell you what I am going to do today. I am going to stand up and stand tall, and I am going to vote for every American worker and protect their right to have a secret ballot.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding and make clear once again that Republicans in the House want to pass a responsible extension of unemployment benefits. 
   We realize that there are people in America who are hurting, who need help. But the bill that we have before us is an irresponsible bill. And it's irresponsible for two reasons; one, it's not targeted to the States that have high unemployment. It says we're going to extend 13 additional weeks of unemployment in all 50 States regardless of what the unemployment rate is. I'll use the example I used yesterday. Oklahoma has a 2.6 percent unemployment rate. Why would we need an additional 13 weeks of unemployment in that State? And so it's not targeted to the States that need the help, and it could be targeted. 
   The second problem is the fact that we reduce--or basically eliminate--the work requirements. Under the current law, you've got to work 20 weeks in order to be entitled to unemployment benefits. Under this bill, you could work as little as 2 weeks and be entitled to up to a year of unemployment benefits. I just think that that's a poor use of our taxpayer funds. 
   Why aren't they thinking about the hardworking men and women in America, who go to work every day, they pay taxes, they do tough jobs, they have to give part of their money to us so that we can spend it on behalf of the American people to provide services? We should always remember that it's the hardworking people in America that provide the taxpayer funds that we spend. And our job is to spend those funds in a responsible way, and this is not, in my view, a responsible bill. 
   Republicans want to work with Democrats to pass a responsible extension of unemployment benefits. And we can do it together if we will just sit down and work it out. But we all know this bill is going nowhere. This bill is dead on arrival, the Senate is not going to take it up, it's going nowhere. And so instead of wasting all of this time having this debate about an irresponsible bill, we actually could have legislation on the floor today that allows us to produce more American energy. 
   I think the American people want us to achieve energy independence, and the only way we're going to get there is to do what I call, ``all of the above.'' We need to conserve more in America. We need biofuels; we need alternative fuels; we need to get serious about nuclear energy; and we need to produce more oil and gas here in the United States instead of depending on some 70 percent of it coming from foreign sources. 
   But over the course of the last 18 years that I've been a Member of Congress there have been 46 energy votes on the floor of this House that would allow us to produce more American energy. And guess what? Forty-six times I voted to bring more American energy to the market. The Speaker of the House got to vote over those last 18 years on the same 46 votes. Do you know how many times she voted in favor of American energy? Twice. 
   When it comes to American energy, it's pretty clear what party is in favor of bringing more American energy to the marketplace. Bringing American energy to the marketplace in an environmentally safe way is possible, and we ought to do it in order to achieve energy independence and bring down the price of energy and gasoline in America. It would be far more productive doing that bill on the floor today than doing the bill that we're doing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate my colleague for yielding and I appreciate the work he is doing bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   I came to Washington 17 years ago because I thought government was too big, I thought it spent too much and didn't think that it was being held accountable. And the reason I am here this afternoon on this bill is because this amendment offered by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Campbell will reduce the overall spending level in this bill to the President's request. 
   The President submitted a budget back in January that said we can balance the budget over the next 5 years without raising taxes. But to do that, it's dependent upon us holding the line on spending. Even at the President's level, there is an increase over last year, and I believe that bringing the level of spending down in this bill to what the President requested puts this bill in a position to actually move through the process and become law. 
   If you looked over the course of this year, our friends on the other side of the aisle have a budget that will balance over the next 5 years, but with the largest tax increase in American history. If we want to review the bidding on spending here in Washington this year, you go back to February with a CR that was some $6 billion over the President's request. And then we can look at the supplemental spending bill for Iraq and Katrina and other things that was $17 billion over the President's request. And now if we look at the appropriations process that we're in the midst of, we have an additional $20 billion over and above where the President is. 
   At the end of the day, the American people want to keep more of the money that they earn and want to send less of that money here to Washington. And I think to the extent we can hold the line on spending, we're protecting the taxpayers, protecting their wallets. 
   I think this is a modest amendment that reduces the spending in this bill by some $1.13 billion, it's the right move, and our colleagues ought to support the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (SOARING GAS PRICES -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, this quote from Daniel Webster appears above the Speaker's rostrum right up at the top of the Chamber. And it says this: ``Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers, build up its institutions, promote all its great interests and see whether we also in our day and generation may not perform something worthy to be remembered.'' 
   As families struggle with soaring gas prices, our Nation's energy solutions, I think, lie on Webster's words. House Republicans have offered a plan to  lower gas prices by developing the resources of our land in an environmentally safe way. This is an approach that is supported by some 60 percent of the American people in a recent Gallup poll. But the majority won't listen. 
   Instead, they let gas prices surge even higher by refusing to schedule a plan to break America's dependence on foreign sources of energy. Mr. Speaker, I think American consumers deserve better. It is time to develop the resources of our land and bring down gas prices on behalf of American families and small businesses. And that, as Webster said, would be ``worthy to be remembered.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Illinois for yielding time and make clear that I want to vote for a bill that extends unemployment benefits to those who have been laid off in areas where we have high unemployment. But the bill before us is not targeted at States where we've seen the spike in unemployment. I mean, we've got an unemployment rate in Oklahoma, as an example, of about 2.6 percent, or maybe you could go to, I think it's South Dakota, where the unemployment rate is about 2.4 percent. Yet, under this bill, it's a Federal mandate one-size-fits-all for all 50 States. I just think that if we're going to be serious about spending taxpayer money, we ought to target that money to those areas where we have high unemployment and where people need our help. 
   The bill also eliminates the requirement that individuals put in at least 20 weeks of work to collect extended unemployment benefits. And when this was put into the law, and when we extended this law in 2002, almost all the Democrat members voted to do this. And what it means is that some people could work as little as 2 weeks and receive up to 52 weeks of unemployment benefits. I don't think that's neither reasonable, nor is it a good use of limited taxpayer resources. 
   I'm open to extending unemployment benefits, but I think this bill that we have before us falls far short of what we need to do. It's neither fair to unemployed workers who truly need our help, nor to taxpayers who are going to fund it. 
   I think we can do better. And before we send a final version of this bill to the President, I hope that we do better. And I hope we will work in a bipartisan way to come to an agreement to extend unemployment benefits in a reasonable, responsible way. But in the meantime, this bill is not the answer, and I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and ask my colleagues what is it that we are doing here? We got 1 week before we break for the Memorial Day recess. Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, has said we have to have the funding for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   We know that come early June, layoff notices go out to contract employees who work at the Pentagon. Why? Because we can't seem to get this bill finished. And why can't we get it finished? Because we have a bill in front of us that has all types of unrelated spending beyond what is needed to fund our troops. 
   The gentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) earlier this week, introduced a clean troop funding bill, a bill that the President called for with the changes that were made up here to make sure that we got funding to the troops as quickly as possible. That is the bill that ought to be on the floor today, not a bill that handcuffs our generals, starves our troops and puts them in a position where they can't succeed in their mission in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   The bill also includes a $54 billion tax hike on small businesses around the country. And if there is a time when we don't need to be raising taxes on small businesses, it is now. They are the engine of new job growth in our country. And what are we going to do? We are going to put more taxes on them. 
   I think that what we are doing here is that we are playing political games on the backs of our troops. You know it. All this bill is going to do is delay the process for weeks and weeks and weeks while we play political games because you know the President is not going to sign this bill. 
   Why don't we move Mr. Lewis' bill? We can do it today. We can do it early next week. It is a clean troop funding bill that takes care of our troops and honors them on the eve of Memorial Day instead of playing political games on their backs.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I think the moment is here, a moment that we have been debating over the last 2 1/2 months and an issue that I think the American people care deeply about. 
   It is an historic moment, and I thought to myself this morning how will history judge what it is that we are doing on the floor of the House today. What will they write 50 years from now about the decisions that we are making here today? 
   When I handed Ms. Pelosi, our new Speaker, the gavel back in January, I said that the battle of ideas should be fought on the floor of the House, but as we do it, we should respect each other's opinion. We can disagree without being disagreeable. 
   I have great respect for Mr. Murtha and Mr. Obey, those that have brought this bill to the floor today, along with Mr. Young and Mr. Lewis, and we should respect all of our opinions and each other's opinions when we get into this difficult decision. 
   All of us wish that Iraq had gone better. We all wish that the mistakes had not been made and that the terrorists would not have shown up and made this a central front in our war with them.     
   The fact is, we are in Iraq. We are in the midst of a fight with an enemy that is just not in Iraq, that is all over the world, and we are there. You begin to think about the bill that we have before us to pay for the war in Afghanistan, and the war in Iraq. Somehow we have room for $10 billion worth of nonmilitary spending. 
   I don't need to go through all the details for the money for spinach, the money for the Capitol Hill power plant. That is a real emergency, things that don't belong in this bill. 
   But I think all of us know what the greater issue is here, and the bigger issue. That is that the ideas of our friend from Pennsylvania, to put his benchmarks in there, which are very different than the benchmarks that I proposed. The benchmarks I proposed were to measure progress, for trying to help ensure that we win. The benchmarks I see in this bill are intended to bring about failure, to bring about stumbles. 
   If you look at all of the handcuffs, all of the hoops and hurdles that are in here, I believe there is only one outcome, only one outcome if we support all this brings and the handcuffs, and that outcome is failure. I don't believe that failure in Iraq is an option. There is a lot riding on this. 
   Just think for a moment what signal, what signal this sends to our enemies. What does it say to them, we are not willing to stand behind our troops, that there is a hard deadline out there, that we are going to withdraw our troops; what signal does it send to them? 
   Our enemies understand what happened in Vietnam. When this Congress voted to cut off funding, we left Vietnam. We left chaos and genocide in the streets of Vietnam because we pulled the troops out and didn't have the will to win. 
   Our enemies know what happened in 1983 after the Marine barracks were bombed in Lebanon, and we pulled out. What did we see? Chaos and genocide all through Lebanon, and continuing to this day. Then in 1993, we decided to pull out of Somalia; left chaos and genocide in our wake that continues to this day. 
   Who doesn't believe, who doesn't believe that if we go down this path, we are going to leave chaos and genocide in Iraq, and we are going to tell our enemies all around the world that you can take on the United States, you can push them to the edge? At the end of the day, they will just go home. 
   The spread of radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our Nation and is a threat to the free world, not just in the Middle East. They are in Asia, they are in Europe, they are in Africa. Cells are growing right here in America, people dedicated to killing Americans, killing our allies, and ending freedom and wanting to impose some radical Islamic law on the entire world. 
   I ask you, what are we to do, just walk away from the fight? What message does this action that we take  today, what does it send, what kind of message does it send to our allies, to people who have worked with us over the course of the last 50 years, 100 years, to bring freedom around the world, to end tyranny around the world? What message do we send to them, that we are there as long as it doesn't get too tough? 
   Think about what Franklin Roosevelt must have felt like in the midst of World War II when things weren't going so well either in Europe or over in the South Pacific. I am sure there was a big debate here in Congress, the same way, same time. But Franklin Roosevelt knew that the world had no choice but to stop Imperial Japan and to stop Hitler's Germany, because he knew that the consequences of failure in World War II were going to lead to more tyranny and less freedom all around the world. He didn't shrink from that challenge. 
   But more importantly, think about what this message sends to our troops. Our troops are on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan doing their duty to protect freedom and to end tyranny. They are there watching this debate that we are having in the House today and wondering, will Congress do its duty? Will Congress stand up and support the mission that I am in? 
   Think about the soldiers right this moment who are on a mission somewhere in Baghdad trying to bring safety and security to those people while this debate goes on and this vote is about to occur as to whether we are going to support what they are doing. This is an important moment. 
   Our forefathers, our forefathers had this moment many times before. Whether it was George Washington or Abraham Lincoln in the middle of the Civil War, when it wasn't going very well, they had a decision to make. Was failure an option for any of them? No, it wasn't. 
   I know this is difficult, and I know there are deeply held opinions on both sides of the aisle and amongst both sides of the aisle, but I would ask all of my colleagues, is failure an option? Do we want to give victory a chance? 
   We sent General Petraeus over there, 84-0, was confirmed by the Senate. The plan is under way. What this bill will do will be to undercut his opportunity at success. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I am here to say to you that we have no choice but to win, because if we fail in Iraq, you will see the rise even further and faster of radical Islamic terrorism all around the world. We will see chaos in Baghdad. We will see genocide there. We will provide safe haven for our enemies. We will destabilize the moderate Arab countries in the Middle East. If anybody doesn't believe that this won't end Israel as I know it, you are kidding yourself. If you don't believe that these terrorists won't come here and fight us on the streets of America instead of the streets of Baghdad, I think you are kidding yourself. 
   So we have our moment of truth. We have our opportunity to do what our forefathers have done, and that is to stand up, support our troops and to win, because the outcome of failure is actually too ominous to even think about. 
   So I ask my colleagues today, let's not vote for spinach, let's not vote for more money for the power plant and all the other silly things in here. We all know what this bill is about, and it is about whether we have got the courage to give victory a chance, or whether we are just going to bring our troops home and give up.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CLEAN ENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me say to my colleagues that this is the seventh bill that has come to this floor that has not gone through committee, that has not had ample opportunity for amendment in subcommittee or full committee, no opportunity for an amendment on the floor on any of these bills, nor the opportunity for our side of the aisle to offer a substitute. 
   I am encouraged that the Rules Committee this week has organized and met, but I would note that as the Rules Committee opened, the first debate on the first rule where there was going to be a rule on the bill yesterday, the chairwoman of the Rules Committee made it clear before there were any witnesses before the Rules Committee, before there was any testimony, before there was any discussion, that this would be a closed rule, there would be no amendments, and there would be no substitute offered to the Members on our side of the aisle. 
   I come here today to talk to my colleagues. The gentleman from Massachusetts who is managing this rule for the majority knows exactly what I am talking about. We have had this discussion here for a long time. 
   I understand the need for the majority party to want to make its move, to make its first impression; and I understand the first couple of bills had to come flying right to the floor. But we are short-circuiting democracy here, and I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand that. 
   On the opening day, when I handed the new Speaker the gavel, the first woman in the history of our country to be Speaker, I said that the House needed to work in a more bipartisan way. Over the course of the last several years, I heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about the need to work in a more bipartisan way. 
   I said also on the opening day that we do have different ideas about how to solve America's problems and that we should cherish the differences that we have, we should debate them, that we can disagree here without being disagreeable. I also said that we should be nice. 
   What I didn't say is that we shouldn't be silent, and I won't be silent on behalf of our Members on this side of the aisle. 
   I think that there is a lot to be gained in bringing legislation to the floor that has been through the subcommittee process, that has been through the committee process, that has an opportunity for a real Rules Committee debate and an opportunity for Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments, to allow the minority the opportunity to offer a substitute. That is what the American people want. Our Members represent some 48 percent of the American people, and we are being silenced in this process. 
   I understand it is in the process. The new majority has only had the majority for 2 weeks. But I am here today to ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to live up to the promises that were made, to live up to the desire to be treated fairly. 
   When we took control of this House in 1995, we had a lot of Members in the new majority then who said we ought to treat the Democrats the way they treated us, and I argued vociferously that that was not the right thing to do, that we should treat the new minority as we had asked to be treated. We worked and I worked to be sure that we were living up to our commitment to treat the then-Democrat minority as we wanted to be treated back in the early nineties when we were making an awful lot of noise. 
   Over the last year, there has been an awful lot of conversation coming from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle when they were in the minority to make things more fair. 
   Let me quote one of the pledges: ``Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full and fair debate, consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute.'' 
   What we are asking for here is fairness, fairness in this process, so that all Members can participate in a deliberative process on behalf of our constituents. Our constituents are just as important as your constituents, and they have a right to be heard and their Members have a right to participate in this process. 
   So I ask my colleagues, when? When is the time going to come to live up to what you asked for, to live up to your promises, and to live up to your commitment?

   Listen, America's families and small businesses are suffering under the high cost of energy and the high cost of gasoline. High gasoline prices are crushing American families, they are hurting our schools, they are hurting seniors, and they are destroying jobs in America; and the American people expect us to do something about it. And over these last 10 weeks, what have we done? Nothing. 
   The gentleman's amendment offers the American Energy Plan, which is a comprehensive plan to encourage more conservation, more biofuels, alternative sources of energy, and, yes, more American-grown oil and gas. And all we're asking of the majority Democrats in this chamber is to allow us to vote. That's all we're asking. We're not asking you to vote for it. All we're doing is, allow us a vote.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today we begin an extended debate on a resolution criticizing the latest effort by American forces to win in Iraq. 
   There is no question that the war in Iraq has been difficult. All Americans are frustrated that we haven't seen more success and that we haven't seen it more quickly. 
   But war is never easy and almost never goes according to plan. Al Qaeda and their supporters in the region have been steadfast in their efforts to slow us down and frustrate our efforts to succeed. But because they cannot defeat Americans on the battlefield, al Qaeda and terrorist sympathizers around the world are trying to divide us here at home. 
   Over the next few days, we have an opportunity to show our enemies that we will not take the bait. 
   It is fitting that yesterday was President Abraham Lincoln's birthday. And not since the dark days of the Civil War has our homeland been a battlefield. Lincoln's leadership preserved the Union through a turbulent age that threatened to undo the American experiment. His belief in the promise of the United States, a promise enshrined in the Declaration of Independence that stated for the first time in history that all men are created equal, this is what drove him to pursue victory. 
   Surrounded by personal and political rivals, Lincoln could have given up. He could have recalled the Union forces and sent them home. But he didn't. 
   I think we need a similar commitment to victory today. 
   The battle in Iraq is about more than what happens there. This is one part of a much larger fight, a global fight against Islamic terrorists who have waged war on the United States and our allies. This is not a question of fighting for land or for treasure or for glory. We are fighting to rid the world of a radical and dangerous ideology. We are fighting to preserve and defend our sacred way of life. We are fighting to build a safer and more secure America, one where families can rear their children without the fear of terrorist attacks. 
   Lincoln famously said in 1858 that ``a house divided against itself cannot stand.'' I believe, as Lincoln did then, that we must choose sides on a very critical issue. Then it was whether we should abolish the evil institution of slavery. Today it is whether we will defeat the ideology that drives radical Islamic terrorism. Will we do what it takes to stand and fight for the future of our kids and theirs? Will we commit to defending the freedoms and liberties that we all cherish? Or will we retreat and leave the fight for another generation? These are the questions with historic implications that will be answered this week. 
   Many of my friends across the aisle think this is exactly what we should do, give up and leave. This nonbinding resolution is their first step towards abandoning Iraq by cutting off funding for our troops that are in harm's way. 
   And we know what al Qaeda thinks when America retreats from the battlefield. They think that we can't stomach a fight. This is why they haven't been afraid to strike us whenever and wherever they have had the opportunity to do so. 
   This war didn't start in Iraq. This war didn't start on 9/11. The war began with the Iran hostage taking in 1979, went on for well over a year. Then on October 23, 1983, the suicide attack on our Marine barracks in Beirut occurred, killing 241 American servicemen and injuring 60 others. On February 26, 1993, was the first World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more than 1,000 others. On June 25, 1996, the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia were bombed, killing 20 and injuring some 372 others. On June 7, 1998, the Kenya embassy bombing killed 213 people and injured 5,000 more. And on June 7, 1998, the Tanzania embassy bombing killed 11 people and 68 others were injured. On October 12, 2000, the USS Cole was attacked; 17 American sailors killed, 39 other sailors injured. 
   We all know what happened on September 11, 2001, when 3,000 Americans died for no other reason than they were Americans. 
   Do we really believe that if we pack up now, if we abandon Iraq and leave the country in chaos, that our enemies are just going to lay down their arms and leave us alone?     
   For too long, world leaders responded to terrorism by retreating and just hoping for the best. In a post-9/11 world, this is no longer an option. 
   God forgive us that it took such a loss of life to open our eyes, but our eyes are open. We are engaged in a global war now for our very way of life.  Every drop of blood that has been spilt in defense of liberty and freedom, from the American Revolution to this very moment, is for nothing if we are unwilling to stand up and fight this threat. 
   We didn't start this war. They did. Now we have got a duty to finish it, and, for the sake of our kids and theirs, to win it. 
   The nonbinding resolution before us today criticizes the new strategy for succeeding in Iraq implemented by General Petraeus. It ``disapproves'' of the strategy before it even has a chance to begin. The general's goal is to stabilize the Iraqi democracy, deny the terrorists a safe haven and ensure stability in the region. It is a prudent strategy that puts the performance of the Iraqi Government front and center. 
   I can't guarantee that this plan is going to work. I hope it does. Republicans have put forward a complementary bill aimed at helping it succeed. But I again can guarantee you this: If we cut off our funding for the troops that are in the field and we abandon Iraq, as many supporters of this nonbinding resolution want to, the consequences of our failure will be catastrophic. 
   Last year, Osama bin Laden issued this warning to the United States regarding the war in Iraq. He said, ``I would like to tell you that the war is for you or for us to win. If we win, it means your defeat and disgrace forever.'' 
   Now, think about this for a moment. Al Qaeda knows what the stakes are and it issued all of us a challenge. Now, tell me, what message does it send if we are afraid to meet that challenge? What message are we sending to North Korea, Iran, Venezuela and other enemies of freedom around the world? If we abandon Iraq, regional stability is going to be jeopardized. Iraq will become a fertile breeding ground for radical Islamic terrorists. Without a central government or other stabilizing force, Iraq's neighbors will be compelled to enter Iraq to protect their own interests. The consequences will be devastating and could easily lead to regional war. 
   If we abandon Iraq, the instability, coupled with the damning image of another American retreat, will embolden Iran and Islamic militants and endanger Israel. Iran's leaders and terrorist groups have made it clear of their intentions to wipe Israel off the map. We would be leaving a staunch ally in the Middle East with nothing but chaos and instability separating them from their greatest enemy. 
   If we abandon Iraq, those who seek weapons of mass destruction will know they have nothing to fear from a fearful America. Neither al Qaeda, North Korea or Iran are going to give up their quest for weapons of mass destruction if they know they are free to pursue these weapons, secure in the knowledge that America doesn't have the stomach to stop them. We will be leaving for our children, and theirs, a vastly more dangerous world. 
   During the Cold War, we took some small comfort in the idea of mutually assured destruction, that the Soviet Union wouldn't attack us because we could retaliate with equal devastation. There is no such comfort in a world where terrorist gangs roam free. It is the nature of our enemy to fight us wherever and whenever they can. Whether it is in Asia, in Africa or elsewhere, al Qaeda has supporters and sympathizers throughout the world. They have the ability to strike us at any time with their lethal force across the globe. 
   Right now, we are fighting them in Iraq. The battlefield is the most visible part in the global war against these terrorists, but it is but one part. If we leave, they will just follow us home. It is as simple as that. We cannot negotiate with them. We can't reason with them. Our one and only option is to defeat them. And this nonbinding measure before us today will only embolden them. 
   Now, it is important for this body to debate the important issues of our day. Last summer, the House held an extended debate on the war in Iraq and the global war on terror which gave all Members an opportunity to go on record. We worked closely with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to draft the language of that resolution, and I believe that we had a productive debate. 
   What we are dealing with here today isn't even a resolution to debate the war itself. It is a nonbinding resolution attacking a single strategy in the prosecution of a much larger war. ``Nonbinding'' means nonleadership. It is not accountable, and I don't think it is the right message for our troops. 
   This is a political charade, lacking both the seriousness and the gravity of the issue that it is meant to represent. And, as I said before, the question before us today isn't actually in this resolution. I think it is much more fundamental. The question is, do we have the resolve necessary to defeat our terrorist enemies? Will we stand and fight for the future of our kids and theirs? 
   As President Eisenhower once said, ``History does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid.'' Does Congress have the fortitude to do what needs to be done? Our soldiers do. The men and women of our military are the greatest force for freedom that the world has ever known. They are brave, they are committed and they can win this fight if we ask them to. I think the big question is, will we support them? 
   My colleagues, the world is watching. The question is, how will we respond

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and tell my colleagues that in 1992 I voted for this bill. In 1992, the chairman of the committee voted for the bill. In 1992, Mr. Hoyer, the majority leader, and Ms. Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, voted for the same bill. This is already the current law. 
   All this is is another excuse put up by the majority to not go after more American energy. That is all this is. And we have had more excuses. We going to blame it on speculators, we are going to blame it on the oil companies, we are going to blame it on OPEC, when there is only one group, only one group in this Chamber we ought to blame, and that is all the liberals in this House who have voted on for no energy each and every time over the last 18 years that I have been here. 
   Forty-six votes. Forty-six votes have been brought to this floor over the last 18 years that I have been here to produce more American-made energy. I voted yes 46 times out of 46. Ms. Pelosi, as an example, voted yes twice. Just twice. And how many times did the gentleman from West Virginia vote to bring more American-made energy to the market? 
   We are giving $600 billion a year to people in the Middle East, money that could be spent here in America if we were willing to bring more oil out of our ground in an environmentally safe way. 
   Republicans have put forward an all-of-the-above strategy. We need to conserve more of our energy, we need to develop biofuels, we need to develop alternative fuels, we need to have nuclear energy, and, yes, we need to produce more oil and gas here in America in an environmentally safe way. But all we get from the other side each and every time are excuses. ``Let's blame somebody else.'' 
   We are about to go home for our Independence Day district work period. We should not leave here until we take steps that will help us move our country toward more energy independence. Not more excuses, not more posing for ``holy pictures,'' as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee would say. We need to bring bills to the floor that will actually put Members on record whether they are for more American-made energy or not. 
   I am willing to show my constituents how I will vote. Let's let all of America  see how our colleagues will vote, for more American made energy, which is what we need to do to bring gas prices down in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and thank him for his work and thank the work of Mr. Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, and Members on both sides of the aisle who have worked together to bring us to this point. 
   We all know that we are in the midst of a financial crisis, and we all know that this crisis is about our neighbors. It's about our small businesses. It's about retirees whose savings are on the line. It's about the American people and their jobs. And we know that if we do nothing, this crisis is likely to worsen and to put us into an economic slump like most of us have never seen. 
   We've come together on a bill that is a much better bill than it was when it started. It isn't the bill that I would write. It's not the bill that any of you would write because this bill was done in a bipartisan way, where Members on both sides of the aisle came together, worked together to build a product that we thought would help avert this crisis. It certainly has grown in size, but to do nothing, in my view, is not an option. 
   The consequences of us not acting are overwhelming, and so I do believe that it's our responsibility to act. The American people sent us here to do our jobs on their behalf. They're counting on us. 
   I know that some of you will disagree with the bill that we have before us, and I understand and respect those views. But while we have an imperfect product, we have a responsibility to act and to act in a way that we will do our best on behalf of our constituents. 
   I have talked to a lot of Members on both sides of the aisle who were stuck in really difficult elections, and doing this bill in the middle of an election is complicated enough. And I've had Members worried about how this is going to affect their election. I told them that whether you vote ``yes'' or you vote ``no,'' you've got to go home and defend this. And it's a lot easier to defend your vote if you, in your own mind, will just do the right thing. 
   I'm going to vote for this bill today because I think it's in the best interests of the American people. That's what they sent us here to do, and that's what I'm going to do. 
   Above the Speaker's rostrum is our motto: ``In God We Trust.'' This is probably one of the most serious votes that any of us will ever cast. I've said my prayers this morning, like I do  every morning, so that I can understand and feel better about the vote that I cast. But even if we pass this bill today, let's not kid ourselves. We're in the midst of a recession. It is going to be a rough ride, but it will be a whole lot rougher ride if we don't pass this bill. 
   But I will say to all of you, when this bill passes today, remember those words, ``In God We Trust,'' because we're going to need His help.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3121, FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, posted on the Speaker of the House's Web site at this moment is a document entitled ``A New Direction for America.'' In this document, the following statement is highlighted: Bills should generally come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives. 
   Last November when Democrats were preparing to take control of this Chamber, I appreciated something that Speaker Pelosi said. And I quote, ``The issue of civility, the principle of civility and respect for minority participation in this House is something that we  promised the American people. It is the right thing to do. And I set forth, over a number of years now, principles and respect for minority rights. And we intend to implement them.'' 
   This statement was made almost a year ago at a press conference on November 20, 2006. Now, let's contrast those statements that were made and with what took place last night in the Rules Committee. 
   Seven Republican amendments were offered to the bill that we are about to debate, none made in order, including a bipartisan amendment offered by Mr. Garrett of New Jersey; 13 Democrat amendments were made in order. 
   Now, the last time the flood insurance bill was on the floor of the House, which was in the 109th Congress, six Democrat amendments were made in order, one bipartisan amendment was made in order, and nine Republican amendments were made in order. 
   And if this isn't bad enough that the Republicans were denied any amendments in the bill that we have before us today, the majority also, in its rule, has waived the earmark reform rule again. 
   Now, yesterday when we had the SCHIP bill on the floor, there were earmarks in the bill. They weren't disclosed, they weren't outlined, and there was no way for Members to get at a debate or an amendment on those earmarks that were in this bill. 
   What assurances do American taxpayers have that there isn't some earmark in this bill that we have today? Because there is no list. But yet, the Rules Committee felt obliged to waive the earmark reform bill that was put in place earlier this year. 
   Now, the problem we have with the underlying rule is really part of the bigger problem. Last night, our Rules Committee Republicans put together a report outlining the number of closed rules that we have had in this House. 
   I was here in the early 1990s demanding that the minority ought to be treated more fairly. And clearly, when Republicans took majority control of this House, it may not have been everything everybody wanted, but there was more democracy in the House than what we have seen this year. And I just want to implore all of my colleagues that the American people sent us here to work together to solve the problems of this country. And yet, all year, as I have put my hand out to try to find a way to work in a bipartisan manner, it gets slapped away. That is not what the American people want of us. It is not what they deserve. And I would ask my colleagues to understand, many of you were here in the minority; you know exactly what I am talking about. It is time to be treating the minority the way you asked to be treated when you were in the minority. 
   I would ask my colleagues to defeat this rule, send it back to the committee, and let's do this in the fair, bipartisan way that the American people expect.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the dean of our delegation for bringing this resolution to the floor, and thank my colleague from Cleveland, Mrs. Jones, for her enlightening remarks and lightening this up. 
   I was here earlier to announce Paul's passing to the House. I can remember the first time I met Paul Gillmor. I was a brand new State legislator. It was 1985, and it wasn't at the statehouse; it was down the street at the Pewter Mug. 
   Now, for those of us who served in the statehouse, we have all been to the Pewter Mug. That is where I got to know Paul Gillmor. He was the senate president; I was a lowly new house member, and Helen used to come over and wait on us. For those who came to the statehouse who went to the Pewter Mug, you would remember Helen, because you could never forget her, and she would never forget Paul. 
   But I got to know Paul Gillmor. In 1986, Paul decided to run for Governor in a Republican primary, and I was on his team. As a matter of fact, it might have been one of the first political checks I actually wrote was to Paul Gillmor when he ran for Governor. Unfortunately, he didn't win that primary election, but I really got to know Paul Gillmor. 
   He really was a public servant who enjoyed what he did, who enjoyed representing people, and someone that came to Congress right before I did. He came in 1988; I came in 1990. We have been close friends over the 17 years that we have worked here together. We worked on a number of issues. 
   Paul loved to understand what was happening around the world, and he certainly did his share of traveling to try to understand what was happening. But his work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, his work over in the Financial Services Committee will speak for itself. 
   But earlier this year, I think it was mentioned by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Barton, earlier this year we lost our majority, we lost a number of seats, and Paul Gillmor took the magnanimous step of relinquishing his seat on the Energy and Commerce Committee to take a seat on the Financial Services Committee to help make room for other Members. It was that kind of kindness and consideration that I think all of us will remember about Paul Gillmor. 
   Karen and the children, our prayers are with you. Paul was a great servant, a great friend, and someone who we will all miss.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness that I come to the floor today and inform all of my colleagues that our colleague from Ohio, Paul Gillmor, passed away suddenly overnight. 
   Paul was a good friend to all of us, a colleague of mine who served in this House for nearly two decades after a long, distinguished career in the Ohio Senate. He was from Ohio, born there, raised there, went to school there. He is going to be missed by all of us. 
   I want to make sure that we keep Karen and his children in our thoughts in this very difficult time. 
   We will notify Members of the arrangements when they are made, but I would expect that later this afternoon the Members of the Ohio delegation from both sides of the aisle will be on the floor for a tribute to our friend.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I'm proud to have introduced this legislation which marks the 35th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, and honors all Americans held prisoner of war in Vietnam. 
   On February 12, 1973, the first wave of the longest held POWs from Vietnam left Hanoi for their first taste of freedom, dubbed Operation Homecoming. Our colleague and my friend Sam Johnson was one of the men who flew out of Hanoi after nearly 7 years in captivity. 
   For me and any other American watching, Sam's return, and the return of all those heroes serving in Vietnam, was a bittersweet moment. Yet it was a moment that we must never forget because of what they did to defend the cause of freedom.     
   This resolution is just one more way for Congress and for our Nation to thank those who were held prisoner of war in Vietnam. And on a personal note, it gives me a chance to thank Sam, once again, for his service and his friendship. 
   Mr. Speaker, America owes our Vietnam POWs and all of those who serve a debt of gratitude, and it is only fitting that Congress today should recognize their heroic sacrifices today and every day.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   Let me say that my colleague from California, the former chairman of the committee, and the current chairman of the committee, Mr. Obey from Wisconsin, are two Members who spent their entire careers working through this appropriation process. They deserve the thanks and respect of all the Members. 
   The motion here to go to conference is not about the Labor, Health and Human Services bill. That is not the issue. The issue isn't whether we have omnibus bills. We have had omnibus bills long before I got here and they will be going on long after I have been here. The issue here is the fact that the plan is to move this bill to the Senate to get a conference report, to package the Labor, Health and Human Services bill with the Defense appropriation bill and the Military Quality of Life bill. 
   Why is this happening? Because our friends in the majority want to continue to play political games here in Washington, DC. We went through political games last week with the SCHIP vote, a bill that there was some attempt to work with us, but not really. No changes were made. We are going through the same process of having this bill vetoed again. Why? Because the majority refused to reach out and work with us in a bipartisan manner to resolve the few differences, the few differences we had in the SCHIP bill. But here we go again. Here we go again. 
   Madam Speaker, the majority knows and the President has made clear that he will veto this bill. To pass a bloated Labor, Health and Human Services bill on the backs of our troops and our veterans is not the right thing to do. It's a political trick. You're daring the President to veto this bill. Well, guess what? You know and I know that the President is going to veto this bill. Yet, here we go, playing political games once again. 
   As I said last week, I said last month, and probably the month before that, the American people are tired of all the political games. They want us to find some way to resolve our differences and to deal with the issues that they care about. There are a lot of important issues in the Labor, Health and Human Services bill that are very important to our country. There's a lot of important issues in the Defense appropriation bill. They help fund our troops and give them the tools that they need. Certainly, when it comes to the Military Construction Quality of Life bill, taking care of our veterans is very important. But you know and I know that this is not more than a political trick. 
   Let me tell you what; it makes me sick, makes me sick to watch this process continue, playing political games, and nothing gets done. Congress is at the lowest approval rating in history, and what is going on? We are continuing to play political games. That is why the American people are sick of this process, and it ought to stop.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Alabama for yielding and thank him for his words. 
   The gentleman, along with the chairman, have been through a tough period. And it's not just been the last week or 11 days; it's been really over the last year. And I want to thank both of them for their good work. 
   You know, the American people are angry, angry that this is happening to them, angry about their future. They're scared. And there isn't a Member in this room that isn't as angry as they are and not a Member in this room that isn't just as scared about where we are. 
   I've been here for a long time, a lot of you have been here for a long time; and we've cast a lot of tough votes along the way. I don't know that they get much tougher than this because nobody wants to vote for this, nobody wants to be anywhere around it. And I don't blame you, I don't want to be around it. 
   We have a bill in front of us that is a bipartisan bill. We've got Members on the Democrat side who have all kinds of things they want in this bill that aren't in here. I have a lot of my Republican friends who are irritated that this issue and that issue aren't in here, that we don't do more to attract private capital to help fix this problem. I understand that. 
   And so we have an imperfect product. But we have a product that may work, a product that may work if we can get the votes to pass it, which, I don't have to tell any of you, is in serious doubt. 
   I just want everybody to think about where we are. While there is a lot of risk to any Member who votes for this, both sides of the aisle, just think about what happens if we don't pass this bill.  Think about what happens to your friends, your neighbors, your constituents. Think about those retired people whose retirement income will shrivel up to zero. Think about the jobs that will be lost. If I didn't think we were on the brink of an economic disaster it would be the easiest thing in the world for me to say no to this; but I believe the risk in not acting is much higher than the risk in acting. 
   This Congress has to do its job. None of us came here to have to vote for this mud sandwich--I can describe it a lot of different ways, you all know how awful it is. I didn't come here to do this. I didn't come here to vote for bills like this. But let me tell you this, I believe Congress has to act, and that means each and every one of us have to act. These are the votes that separate the men from the boys and the girls from the women.     
   These are the votes. These are the votes that your constituents sent you here to decide on their behalf. They didn't tell you it was going to be easy. They didn't tell you that it's going to be black and white, you won't have any shades of gray. These are the kind of votes that we have to look into our soul and understand and ask ourselves the question: What is in the best of our country? 
   I believe what's in the best interest of our country, as I stand here today, is to vote for this bill. While imperfect, while not having everything everybody wants, I believe that we have to vote for this bill and do our very best to keep ourselves from the brink of an economic disaster that will harm all of our constituents. 
   So I ask all of you, both sides of the aisle, what's in the best interest of our country? Not what's in the best interest of our party. Not what's in the best interest of our own re-election. What's in the best interest of our country? 
   Vote ``yes.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, some of my colleagues probably are wondering why at 20 minutes to 1 we are still in the House Chamber debating this issue. I think all of us understand that there is a difference over the amount of money being appropriated in this bill and what is being allocated to all of the appropriation bills. 
   If we go back and review the bidding on the spending levels over the course of this year, we spent an additional $6 billion in the CR back in February. We spent an additional $17 billion over and above the President's request for the supplemental spending bill for Iraq, Katrina, and a whole host of other issues that many Members did not support. 
   When we look at the appropriation bills for the fiscal year 2008 beginning in October, we see that we are going to spend an additional $20 billion. So if you add those numbers up, you can see that we are spending tens of billions of dollars, well above what the President requested for not only this current fiscal year, but the next fiscal year. 
   If that isn't bad enough, let's also remember that this Congress in this first 5 months has already authorized some $105 billion of new spending in their proposals that have been brought to this floor and passed. So for many of us, at some point we have to say, enough is enough when it comes to spending. 
   The second issue involves the transparency and accountability with regard to earmarks. Last year I went through hell and high water to put into effect an earmark reform proposal that dealt with appropriation bills, that dealt with authorization bills and dealt with tax bills. It required full disclosure, it required names to be attached, and it allowed Members of this House, both on the floor of this House with an appropriation bill or authorization bill or tax bill, or a conference report with regard to an appropriation bill, tax bill or authorization bill, to move under a point of order or to strike that amount of money. 
   There are 435 of us in this Chamber who are well-equipped to deal with bringing the accountability into this process that all of us want. The Democrat majority in January, when they adopted their rules, gutted the earmark reform proposal that we put into effect last year, while at the same time saying that they were making it stronger. 
   The fact is, Members do not have access to these earmarks in these bills. We have all heard the stories tonight about what the chairman expects to do after we pass the appropriation bills, with these slush funds included in them, secret slush funds, which will later be allocated based on the decision of one person, one of the 535 of us. It is not right, and the gentleman from Wisconsin knows it is not right. 
   Now, the gentleman from Wisconsin says we haven't had time to do this. I can tell the gentleman from Wisconsin over the last 3 1/2 months we have, as he has often said, posed for holy pictures over the fight over funding our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. We had plenty of time to look at those earmarks, but we didn't do it because we were busy posing for holy pictures. 
   I can tell the gentleman that to bring a bill forward with no earmarks in it with a promise that we will all see them later is not good enough. I think the Members on our side of the aisle want real disclosure, want real transparency, and I think what the American people want most is real accountability. 
   Now, let me get to the last issue. For 6 years the gentleman from Wisconsin had the 10 o'clock rule. When we were doing appropriation bills, the majority on our side was not allowed to work after 10 o'clock. 
   Now, I happen to agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin, because I think working after 10 o'clock is not in the best interests of our Nation. For the nine out of 10 times that we have tried to work after 10 o'clock at night, my colleague from Wisconsin refused to operate after 10 o'clock and threatened all of us that if we worked after 10 o'clock, we would have all of these procedural motions, motions to rise, and we would not be here. 
   Now, I told the gentleman, I agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin. I go to bed at 10 o'clock. I don't think good work happens after 10 o'clock at night. So what I told the majority earlier today is that we weren't going to work after 10 o'clock at night because we were going to impose the Obey rule on the institution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate my colleague yielding. 
   There is no question that there was an agreement between Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Obey and myself to try to facilitate the movement of the appropriation process. During the time in the minority, the Democrats worked with us to facilitate that process; and over the course of the last 4 or 5 weeks I think that it has worked reasonably well. Maybe not to everyone's satisfaction, but reasonably well. 
   What's happened here is that we have the greatest expansion of government-run health care about to go out to the floor, where there's never been a legislative hearing in the Energy and Commerce Committee on this issue. The bill has not gone through committee. We're about, as the minority, about to have this thrust upon us, a 488-page bill that was in the committee that no one ever really had a chance to read; and to bring this in such a rush in the last week has caused concern amongst members in our caucus from every wing of our caucus. 
   Now I understand that the gentleman would prefer that we move the appropriations process quickly. But there was a discussion all of last year and the year before and a lot of promises made earlier this year about having a more open House, allowing Members the opportunity to debate, allowing the opportunity for the Members to bring amendments to the floor; and I and my colleagues on our side are very disappointed that not only have not all of those promises been kept, that we've actually regressed beyond the time that we were in the majority. And so it is unfortunate that we find ourselves at this spot. All that we've asked, all year, is to be treated fairly. 
   And I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I understand that we have differences. I'm a big believer that we ought to allow the House to work its will. But, at the end of the day, for us to work our will and for other Members to work their will, there needs to be more open debate. There needs to be more opportunities for amendments. And I will say, from the point of view of the minority, all we're asking is to be treated fairly. 
   In 1995, when we took the majority for the first time in 40 years, some of my colleagues in the Republican leadership wanted to treat the minority, the new minority the way we had been treated. I argued that we should never do that, that we should treat the minority the way we asked to be treated. And over the course of, again, the last several years, you have made your case about how you wanted to be treated and how the minority should be treated. You made it very clear. 
   We're there. And I think all we're asking, all we're asking is that you treat us the way you wanted to be treated. And if that, in fact, is the case, we can do our work. We can do what the American people sent us here to do. But we can't do it when our voices are stifled and our constituents are not allowed to be represented with their views on the floor of this House. 
   So I regret that it has come to this. It is going to be a tough week, but we are not going to sit here representing nearly half the American people and not allow their voices to be heard.

And I appreciate the announcement that we will have at least 20 more because our Members want to speak, and I will tell you why. 
   When a bill gets filed at 9:45 the night before and then it's announced it's going to come to the floor the next morning as the first bill up, a bill that no one has read, written in the dark of night, that won't do a damn thing about American energy. Enough is enough. 
   The Speaker of the House said this will be the most open and ethical Congress in history, that we would consider things in a fair and open way. And this is not going to be considered in a fair and open way. It shows up in the middle of the night, nobody's read the bill, and guess what? The Republican Members, who represent about 48 percent of the American people, we're not allowed to offer a substitute. We have no opportunity to offer our American Energy Plan that we've been on this floor talking about for 3 months nonstop. We don't even get a chance to offer the bill.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding. Let's just stop and think for a moment about what our constituents are dealing with tonight as we stand here. They have got concerns about the economy, concerns about keeping their own jobs. They have concerns about whether they are going to be able to put gas in their car tomorrow considering the high price of gas. Or we have the home heating crisis about to come to us as they are filling their propane tanks and oil tanks and looking at the heating bills that are coming this winter. 
   And what are we doing? We are sitting here tonight in the middle of the biggest hoax I have seen in the 18 years I have been in Congress. It is a sham, and everybody in this Chamber knows it is a sham. I know those are strong words and words that I don't use lightly, but I want my colleagues to consider this for a moment. 
   We have a bill here that purports to be a compromise, but I don't know one Republican Member who was involved in one meeting with regard to this compromise. It was written by the Democrat leadership that runs this Congress in the dark of night on a napkin. It showed up here last night at 9:45, a 290-page bill at 9:45 last night that no Member had ever seen; and guess what, as we stand here tonight, no Member has read. 
   All right, some Member, any Member stand up and tell me you have read this bill. That is what I suspected. Not one Member has read the bill that we are about to consider. No hearings on the bill, no committee action, no one has read, and the bill purports, purports to increase American energy. But I want you to consider this: 85 percent of the known reserves off of our coast on the Outer Continental Shelf, 85 percent at a minimum are locked up permanently under this bill. And of the 15 percent that are purportedly opened, the States would have to comply to open those Outer Continental Shelf reserves. But there is no revenue sharing to the States like there is in Texas and Louisiana and Mississippi and other areas. There is no revenue sharing, so the States have no incentive to want to open up the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   So how much new drilling will we get out of this bill? Zero. It is just zero. And there isn't a Member in this body who doesn't know it is zero. So when I call it a hoax or a sham, I think you all understand what I am trying to say. 
   No new nuclear plants in this bill, no new oil shale drilling in this bill. No clean-coal technology in this bill. We are the Saudi Arabia of the world when it comes to coal. We have clean-coal technology. Whether it is coal to gas, coal to liquid, we have ways to use our coal in a clean way. Nothing in this bill will allow it to happen. 
   What does it have in it? It has a big old tax increase in it; you can be sure of that. 
   What else does it have in it? It has a big earmark in it: $1.2 billion for the City of New York on behalf of one Member in this bill. Here we are trying to take some steps toward energy security, and we have to load it up with a big old earmark, $1.2 billion. 
   A compromise, huh? This is no compromise. The compromise might have been amongst a bunch of Democrat chairmen who wanted to have some bill, but there is no compromise here. 
   Let's just describe this bill for what it really is. It is nothing more than political cover on the eve of an election to say that we voted for an energy bill, except there is no energy in it. 
   Congressional approval today is at the lowest point in any time since polling began, and our Members wonder why.     
   And it's stunts like this that have the American people so cynical about their Congress. They expect that the Congress is going to do something about increasing energy security in our country; that we're going to do something about bringing down the high cost of gasoline; that we're going to do something about bringing down the high cost of heating oil or propane or natural gas this winter. 
   And what are we doing? 
   Playing political games on the eve of an election.  
   The American people understand that 70 percent of our oil comes from overseas. More than half of that comes from OPEC, who's considering lowering their production in order to maintain the high price of oil. We're just teetering, they're just teetering with us, kind of have us on a string because, over the last 30 years, my Democrat colleagues have stood in the way of more energy production in the United States. That's why we're in this box that we're in today. And we have a chance to do something. We have a chance to move in the right direction, but this bill isn't it, and there's not a Member in this Chamber who doesn't understand this bill doesn't do anything about bringing us any closer to energy security. 
   In a few minutes, we're going to have an opportunity for all of the Members on both sides of the aisle to do something of substance. The motion to recommit tonight will be the Abercrombie/Peterson bill. No changes. No tweaks, no nothing. And it's painful. And it may not be everything that I want, but let me tell you, this bill is a bipartisan bill worked on by serious Members from both sides of the aisle. It's a bill that does do all of the above. It gives us more drilling for oil and natural gas in an environmentally sensitive way off our coast. It does allow revenue sharing, revenue sharing to the States so they have an incentive to participate in helping to open up this area off our coast. It's got new nuclear in it. It's got oil shale drilling in it. It's got clean coal technology in it, and it's got a lot more money than the Democrat bill when it comes to putting money into renewables, trying to speed up their development to bring those renewables to market as soon as possible. 
   And so we've got a chance to do the right thing tonight for the American people. We can show them, once and for all, that we can work together across the aisle. We can show them that we can do something to move our country toward more energy security, because most Americans understand that energy security is paramount and is, in effect, our national security. 
   This bill that we're going to bring up under the motion to recommit will create a million new jobs here in America. And with all the talk about a stimulus bill, the greatest stimulus we could give our economy is to create a million new jobs, lower the cost of gasoline, lower the cost of heating oil, lower the cost of energy that will actually even create more American manufacturing jobs. 
   The question is, do we have the courage to do the right thing? Do we have the courage of our own convictions about doing what we know that we have to do as a country to move ourselves toward more energy security? Or are we going to show our constituents that, once again, Congress is up there playing political games with our future? 
   It's the American people. It's their jobs. It's their budget. It's their concerns. They send us here to represent their interests, and it's about damn time that we represent their interests. And by voting for the motion to recommit tonight we can show them that we're working in a bipartisan fashion on their behalf.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Washington for yielding and suggest to my colleagues that we are engaged in exactly what the American people are sick of, and that is political games here in Washington that are intended to be political games and to have no outcome. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have a bill that will be up soon. I don't know how many pages it is, because I haven't seen it yet. Of course, there is no Member of Congress who has seen this bill and no Member of Congress who has read it because it was introduced last night at 9:45. It's going to be up this afternoon, a bill that no one has seen, has been through no committee, written in the dark of night behind closed doors. 
   But what we do know about it is that it locks up about 88 percent of the known resources off our shores. We are the only country in the world that doesn't allow drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf, and this locks up 88 percent of it. 
   Is that a way to get to more energy? We have a bill that does all of the above on our side. But when you look at their bill, there is nothing about any nuclear energy in there, nothing about coal-to-liquids or coal to gas, nothing that is going to bring us, really, more American energy. 
   On top of all that, it has a big tax increase in it. If that isn't bad enough, we have an earmark in the bill, an earmark of $1.2 billion for the City of New York, for some railroad bonds. This is not the way the American people want us to get our jobs done. They want us to work together. They want us to listen to them, and they want us to do their will, and that's not what's happening today. If all this isn't bad enough, the rule that we are considering to allow this legislation to come to the floor doesn't even allow the minority, the Republican Members of the House, to offer a substitute, no amendments, no substitute. 
   Now, it was Ms. Pelosi, back when she was the minority leader, that called for this to be the most open and  fair and ethical Congress in history. She said that bills should come to the floor generally under an open rule that would allow us to offer amendments, but, no, there are no amendments allowed. 
   There is no substitute allowed. This is intended for one purpose and one purpose only, as this bill is coming to the floor, so that some of my colleagues in the majority, the Democrat party can say, we voted on energy. Didn't do anything. They know this bill that they are bringing has no chance of becoming law, and yet they are bringing it up under a scenario which is, frankly, unfair. There is not one Member, one Member of this Chamber, who doesn't understand that this is unfair. 
   This rule should be defeated. Let's go back to the drawing boards and do this right, and we can do it right in very short order and have this bill on floor yet this week.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House voted to override a bill that the President vetoed, except that it wasn't the bill that the House and Senate had passed. And rather than stop, try to determine what the problem was and then to work toward an agreement as to how we proceed, it didn't happen. As a result, we are now stuck in this quagmire of trying to determine how best to get this bill enacted into law. Yet, once again, instead of stopping, sitting down and working in a bipartisan way to understand what happened and how we ought to resolve this, the majority is continuing to just move vehicles to the Senate, hoping that they can sort it out. 
   Now, my colleague and friend from Minnesota says that this 1,768-page bill is identical, with exceptions, to the bill that the House passed. If I could ask the gentleman from Minnesota, did you read all 1,768 pages of this?

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Reclaiming my time, this bill, 1,768 pages, was introduced less than 1 hour ago. There are no Members who have read this. I doubt there is any staff that has read all of this, because you couldn't possibly have read all of this over the course of the last hour. 1,768 pages, $300 billion over the next 5 years, $600 billion over the next 10 years. Yet we are going to expect Members to come down here and cast a vote on this, not knowing what is in here. 
   We thought that when we passed the farm bill, it was the bill that passed the House and the Senate. The President thought the bill sent to him was the bill that the House and Senate passed. We thought it was the bill the House and Senate passed. But, guess what? It wasn't. Now we are being asked to vote on a 1,768-page bill that spends nearly $300 billion over the next 5 years, we have had the bill for less than an hour, and everybody is hoping, hoping, it is the same bill that we passed, except with some enrolling corrections. I think that is a real stretch. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   Most of my colleagues know that I opposed the farm bill when it originally came up, and I opposed it because it was filled with earmarks. There was a $250 million earmark for a ranch in Montana, there was an earmark for $170 million for salmon fisheries on the West Coast, and a number of other earmarks in the bill. And as has been pointed out, the more that this bill has lain around, the more that we have found other provisions in the bill that Members, let's say, it may have not caught their eye when it went through the House or the Senate. 
   The point that I am making is that given the commodity prices that we have in America, we can do better with this farm bill. 
   I understand the need for a farm bill and a need to ensure that America's farmers and ranchers have the kind of program that will ensure that America has a sufficient food supply and, frankly, a sufficient supply of food to export to many countries around the world. 
   But having said that, when we have over $5 a bushel corn, over $13 a bushel for soybeans, wheat in double digits, to be spending some $287 billion on this program I think is unwarranted. As I said when we considered the conference report on the farm bill last week, we can do better. This is the same old-same old that we have been doing for some 50 years. 
   While I appreciate the work that my colleagues put into it, I have worked closely with Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte for an awful long time, 18 years with my friend Mr. Peterson, 16 years with my friend Mr. Goodlatte. We have been through a lot of farm bills together and a lot of agriculture issues together. But at some point the American people look up and say, whoa, Washington, you are broken. And my point has been is that this farm bill is just another example; that at a time when we have got the highest food prices in the history of the country, we have the highest commodity prices we have ever had, we are continuing to go down the same old path. 
   The point that Mr. Flake brings up, something that I was unaware of in the  bill, something I think most Members were unaware of in the bill, is this new revenue assurance program that allows American farmers over the next 2 years to lock in at today's prices for the future. 
   Now I think that is the best deal in the world. How many Americans wouldn't like to say, I am going to lock my salary in for the next 5 years, guaranteed. No chance they would ever lose their job, no chance that their pay will ever get cut. Let me tell you, when it is too good to be true, it usually is. 
   Now if the farm bill isn't bad enough, the process that we are going through to try to rectify an error is--again, remember we have had this bill just over an hour. I am hurting my back trying to lift this thing, 1,768 pages, and just over 1 hour ago we got this. 
   I know the intent of the gentleman from Minnesota, the chairman, is that this be identical to the conference report that we passed. But nobody knows. Nobody has read it. Nobody has had a chance to read it. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Florida for yielding. 
   Let me just say that the gentleman from Wisconsin, the chairman of the committee, is a Member that I know well and have great respect for, and along with the gentleman from Florida and the gentleman from Pennsylvania, they have spent over 30 years doing everything they could to support our troops. But if you think that the debate that we are having tonight is something that we have heard before, it is. Over 40 times this year, we have had votes and debates in this house on the issue of Iraq. 
   Let me just say that my colleague from Wisconsin is known for his famous statement about Members coming to the floor of the House posing for ``holy pictures.'' Now, if there has ever been a case over my 17 years here in Congress of people posing for holy pictures, it is over this issue of Iraq. 
   When I came to the Congress in 1991 as a brand new Member, my first vote in this Chamber was on whether to go to war with the Iraqis in Kuwait. I remember coming here as a brand new Member, Members in the well of this House who had been here 30 and 40 years, tears in their eyes, talking about this being the most difficult vote they had ever cast. It was a very difficult moment for me and all of my colleagues. But we went through that, and we went through it successfully. 
   So when we have the issue of war debated here on the floor of the Congress, there is no issue, no issue that is more personal, no issue that is of greater significance to our country, than all of us casting our vote on sending our young men and women into battle anywhere overseas. So I understand the passion that we have on both sides of the aisle over this issue. 
   But I think we all have to understand that we are in Iraq for a very important reason. We went there to get rid of Saddam Hussein. I think everybody understands that. We went there to make sure that the weapons of mass destruction were gone. They are gone. Where they went, I don't think we will ever know. We went there to set up a democratically elected government, and, frankly, we have succeeded. 
   It was al Qaeda 3 years ago that made Iraq the central front in their war with us. We didn't start this war with al Qaeda. They did. And as the gentleman from Florida pointed out earlier, it didn't start on 9/11, it started back in the early eighties. And it persisted through the eighties and the nineties, and America and the rest of the world looked up, looked away, and just hoped the problem would go away. 
   Well, it didn't go away. After 3,000 of our fellow citizens died on 9/11, what was America to do? Look up, look away and just hope the problem would go away one more time? No. So we went to Iraq. But it was al Qaeda and it was Iran who have made this the central front in their war with us. 
   America has no choice but to succeed in our efforts in Iraq. We all know what failure in Iraq will bring. Failure in Iraq brings a destabilization of Iraq itself, a safe haven for the terrorists to operate from, a destabilization of the entire Middle East, the end of Israel as we know it, and who doesn't believe that if we leave Iraq and we leave in failure, that the terrorists don't follow us home and that we have to deal with the problem here on the streets of America? 
   This is not what America wants. America wants us to succeed, and it is success that we are having in Iraq. You all know the statistics. You have all seen the headlines over the last several weeks and the last several months. Our troops in Iraq are doing a marvelous job on our behalf. They are succeeding. They are training the Iraqi Army to take our place. The Iraqi Army is more  out in front than ever before. The amount of violence in Iraq is down significantly. Our troops, our troops, are dying in less numbers each and every day. Why? Because we are having success there. 
   So we ought to thank our troops, thank our troops for the great job they are doing, because General Petraeus put forward a plan that is working. 
   Now, I understand that a lot of my colleagues on the other side have invested all their political capital over the course of this year in failure in Iraq. It hasn't happened, thankfully, because for the good of our Nation, not today, not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but for my kids and their kids, success in Iraq is critically important. And I think all the Members in this Chamber understand just how important success is there. We are taking on an enemy that is growing in all parts of the world, and if we are not willing to take them on in Iraq, if we are not willing to draw the line and defeat them, where will we draw the line? Where will we stand up for America, and where will we stand up for American values? Iraq is the place to do it. 
   The bill that we have before us goes back to the same old tired plan, the plan for failure, if you will. That is what the bill that we have before us does. It ties the hands of the administration, it ties the hands of our generals, it ties the hands of our people on the ground, and it will lead to nothing other than failure. 
   We have been down this path. We have been down this path all year long. And I will admit to my colleagues, we have had plenty of mistakes that have been made in Iraq. There has never been a war when there haven't been a lot of mistakes made. You can go back to the Civil War and look at all the mistakes that were made. The First World War, the Second World War, Vietnam, there were a lot of mistakes that got made in wars, and mistakes have been made in this war. 
   But, ladies and gentlemen, you all know that we have no choice, no choice, but to succeed, and the plan that we have before us, to fund our troops for the next 4 months, will lead to nothing other than failure. 
   So I am going to ask my colleagues, let's stop the political games. We all know what is going on here. It is another political stunt, another political stunt trying to trap the President, trying to trap the generals and putting handcuffs on them. Let's stop it. 
   I think my colleagues on both sides of the aisle want us to succeed. Instead of playing these political games, what we ought to be doing is passing this bill cleanly. And we ought to be passing the Military Quality of Life Veterans bill, because our troops are coming home. We have got 3,000 troops that have been sent out of Diyala on their way home. We are going to have troops coming home all year. And if we don't pass the Military Quality of Life Veterans bill, the benefits they are entitled to, the services we ought to be providing to those veterans coming home will not be there. 
   So let's vote ``no'' on this bill. Let's find a way this week to make sure that the veterans bill is up on this floor and passed and in the President's hands.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, let me thank Mr. McKeon for yielding time and take a moment to congratulate Mr. Miller and Mr. Kildee, Mr. McKeon and Mr. Castle, the two Republican rankers on the committee, for a job well done. 
   We have been at this reauthorization for a number of years, and I think that the work that is represented in this reauthorization of Head Start is very important for our Nation's children. 
   Those of us who have worked in the area of education for a long time know that for low-income children, having some type of early childhood development is critically important to their success. Head Start is among a number of programs, both public and private, that are out there that supply this type of early childhood development for these children. The reforms that are included in this bill I think are critically important so that Head Start can really be all that many of us want it to be. 
   There are some tremendous Head Start programs around the country, I have visited a number of them, but there are also some programs that don't fulfill the promise that we're making to parents and to their children of what this program could be. 
   We all know that if we're serious about educating all of America's kids, we will never get there unless we find a way to help low-income children get the development they need that many of us take for granted, things that happen in our homes, for those who have means, things that happen in our communities that these children are not exposed to. And so to make sure that they do have an equal chance to get a good education, that early childhood development for these 3- and 4-year-olds is very, very important. 
   I do want to congratulate my colleagues for the bipartisan way this bill has come together. This is a great example of what Congress can do in a bipartisan way when it chooses to. 
   I have been on the floor a lot this year, being critical of the fact that there was some partisan bill on the floor of the House that was going nowhere. But here is an example of Members on both sides of the aisle working together for the interests of America's low-income kids, and I just wanted to come to the floor and say, job well done.

   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate my colleague for yielding. This is exactly what the American people are disgusted with. We can't balance the budget. We can't send the President appropriation bills that are within the budget. This bill is some $3.5 billion over the President's request. But having said that, we have all of these projects that didn't go through the House, didn't go through the Senate, that got air-dropped into a conference. And we wonder why the American people look at us like our heads have been cut off. 
   There is nobody in my district who would ever vote for any of these projects that got air-dropped into this bill. And we have this process, this point of consideration on these earmarks, on consideration of this bill, in exactly the time when we are supposed to have a better look at what these earmarks are. 
   All we have are these brief descriptions, if you can find them in the bill, because this bill should not be up on this floor until tonight. It is one thing to waive the 3-day rule, but the 24-hour rule, most Members believe, is almost sacrosanct. And yet, not even 24 hours after the bill was filed, it is on the floor of the House. Members don't know what is in it. That is why this point of order that we fought for this summer was put into effect. 
   I would urge my colleagues to vote for the gentleman's point of order to stop consideration of this bill so we have a chance to look and see what else is in here that we haven't seen, because this place is out of control.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, Leader Hoyer, my distinguished colleagues, welcome to you all. I would particularly like to welcome our new colleagues. It is an honor and a privilege to serve in this great institution, and I would like to thank you in advance for the sacrifices and contributions you will make to this body during your time here. 
   As colleagues, we owe a huge debt to those who have served before us. I would be remiss if I did not mention the enormous contributions of one of my predecessors, Gerald Ford. Former President Ford served in the House over 25 years, including 8 of those years as Republican leader from 1965 to 1973. He served his Michigan constituents and the American people with great distinction not just here in Congress, but as Vice President and as President of the United States. The thoughts and prayers of this House and those of a grateful Nation are with Betty and the Ford family. 
   This is an historic day. In a few moments, I will have the high privilege of handing the gavel of the House of Representatives to a woman for the first time in American history. 
   For more than 200 years, the leaders of our government have been democratically elected, and from their ranks our leaders have always selected a man for the responsibility and honor as serving as Speaker of the House. Always, that is, until today. 
   It is sometimes said the Founding Fathers would not recognize the government that exists here in Washington today. It has grown in size and scope far beyond anything they could ever have imagined, much less endorsed or advocated for our future. But today marks an occasion that I think the Founding Fathers would view approvingly. And my fellow Americans, whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or an Independent, today is a cause for celebration. 
   Today also, of course, marks a change in the House majority. Twelve years ago, some of us stood proudly in this Chamber as our former colleague, Dick Gephardt from Missouri, handed the gavel to the Republican Speaker, Newt Gingrich from Georgia. There were some great achievements during those 12 years that followed, and we are fortunate that the man who was the driving force behind many of those achievements will continue to serve with us: The gentleman from Illinois, Denny Hastert. 
   There were some great achievements during those 12 years that followed; there were also some profound disappointments. If there is one lesson that stands out from our party's time in the majority, it is this: A congressional majority is simply a means to an end. The value of the majority lies not in the chance to wield great power but in the chance to use limited power to achieve great things. 
   We refer to the gavel that I am holding as the Speaker's gavel; but like everything else in this Chamber, it really belongs to the American people. It is on loan from the real owners. This is the people's House; this is the people's Congress. Most people in America don't care who controls it. What they want is a government that is limited, honest, accountable, and responsive to their needs; and the moment a majority forgets this lesson, it begins writing itself a ticket to minority status. 
   The 110th Congress will write the next chapter in American history, but the American people will dictate it. 
   Today, the Democrat Party assumes the challenge and opportunity of majority power in the people's House. Republicans will hold the incoming majority accountable for its promises and its actions, but we also want to work with the incoming majority for the good of our Nation that we were all elected to serve. 
   Fundamentally, democracy is a battle of ideas. The battle of ideas, I believe, is healthy and is important for our Nation. But it is also a battle that can take place respectfully. Republicans and Democrats can disagree without being disagreeable to each other. Sometimes what people call partisanship is really a deep disagreement over a means to a shared goal, and we should welcome that conversation, encourage it, enjoy it, and be nice about it. 
   It is now my privilege to present the gavel of the United States House of Representatives to the first woman Speaker in our history, the gentlewoman from California, Nancy Pelosi.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, many of you have heard me say on numerous occasions that I think the American people sent us here to work together to get things done on behalf of our country. 
   Over the last couple of weeks, we have had an opportunity with the economic growth package to work in a bipartisan way on behalf of the American people, and I really think it showed our Chamber and our Congress at its best. But I don't think there is any priority that we have that is more important than protecting the American people. 
   For more than 6 months, we have reached out to the majority on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act because we want to give our intelligence officials all the tools they need to protect us. That bill that was passed in late July expired on February 1, and several weeks ago we provided an extension that runs out on Saturday. But for the last 6 months, as we have tried to come to an agreement on this bill, we have reached out to the majority, trying to find common ground, and we have been turned down at every turn. 
   This week, the President, the Senate, and, frankly, a majority of the Members of this House have said enough is enough, no more extensions. But instead of working with the Republicans and Democrats who are interested in working on this bill that would protect our country and protect the American people by passing the bipartisan Senate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance bill, the House floor is the scene of a partisan political stunt. 
   Yesterday, the majority leader said that this political stunt would occur today because we have space on the House schedule. In other words, we have space on the calendar today for a politically charged fishing expedition, but no space for a bill that would protect the American people from terrorists who want to kill us.     
   Madam Speaker, I think this is the height of irresponsibility. It is an insult to this House, and it is an insult to the American people. The actions on the floor of this House today will not make America safer. It will not help us protect Americans from being attacked. 
   Earlier today, the President announced that he would delay his trip to Africa, a long-planned trip. He would delay it so he could work with us to sign the long-term Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act modernization law into law. House Republicans stand ready to stay here as long as it takes to get this bill passed and get it to the President's desk. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we will not stand here and watch this floor be abused for pure political grandstanding at the expense of our national security. We will not stand for this, and we will not stay for this. I would ask my House Republican colleagues and those who believe that we should be here protecting the American people not vote on this bill; let's just get up and leave.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, we live in a dangerous world. If you have read the National Intelligence Report or if you have read reports of it, you understand the growth of al Qaeda not only in the Middle East but around the world. You have read about other organizations in other parts of the world, radical jihadist movements aimed at killing Americans and our allies both here and abroad. 
   Our intelligence capabilities are the first line in our defense of providing safety and security to the American people and information to our troops around the world who are out there on the front lines being the beacons of hope and opportunity for those who live in very oppressed areas of the world. 
   Today all of us know that we have a gap in our intelligence-gathering operations. I believe that the bill we defeated last night was the right move on behalf of the House because it would not have provided our intelligence agencies the tools they needed to protect the American people and to provide the information to help protect our troops and to give them the information they need to win the war against terrorists. 
   I believe that the bill, crafted by our colleagues in the Senate in a bipartisan way, that we are dealing with here tonight does, in fact, give our intelligence agencies the tools they need to help keep Americans safe, to help provide the tools for our men and women around the world as they are out there doing their job to protect the American people and to win the war against terrorism. 
   We all know there is an increased threat of terrorism here in our country. We all know that we are expected to be more vigilant. Why should we tie the hands of our intelligence-gathering capability at a time when we are facing an increasing threat? 
   I believe that the bill we have here before us does give our agencies the tools they need. This bill is only for 6 months. Six months. We have a lot of work to do to modernize the underlying bill in order to put in place a system that allows us to collect the information we need while protecting the rights of the American people. 
   We are dealing with the right bill tonight. It deserves the support of all of our Members, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL ETHICS--Continued -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. My colleagues, rebuilding the bonds of trust between those of us who serve in this institution and the American people should be our highest priority. And I think the American people have every right to expect the highest ethical standards of every Member of this institution, and I think it is our obligation to deliver on that commitment to the American people. 
   Clearly, the Speaker believes that we need to establish this Office of Congressional Ethics because the Ethics Committee process is broken. Let me say, I agree with her. It is broken. It didn't work under Republican control here for at least the last 5 or 6 years that we had the majority in this House, and the lack of evidence that I've seen over the last 15 months, it's not worked well under the Democratic majority either. 
   In December of 2006, as the Speaker was waiting to take her position, she and I sat down and we talked about this. I expressed to her at the time my serious reservations about some outside, independent group that was responsible to no one. And I mentioned to the Speaker at the time that I thought that our obligations, as the leaders of this institution, were to stand up to make sure that this process really did work. 
   I think every Member of this institution wants the Ethics Committee process to work fairly, to work honestly, and to work in a bipartisan fashion, because it is our obligation to the American people and the obligation of each and every one of us, for the future of this institution, to make sure that this process works fairly, honestly, and in a bipartisan way. 
   I was here in 1991. Some of you were. Most of you weren't. I was standing right on the back wall when I and some of my colleagues had information that we read in USA Today about Members of Congress bouncing 8,300-some-odd checks the year before at the House bank. Some of us wanted to know why or how, what was going on at the House bank. And before we could get to the microphones with our privileged resolution, the Speaker of the House was down here in the well of the House. The majority leader was down here in the well of the House. Even the Republican leader was here in the well of the House, and all three of them basically said the same thing: We didn't do anything wrong, and we won't do it again. 
   So, for those of you that have concerns about the habits of this institution to sweep these issues under the rug, I saw it, and I've seen it since on both sides of the aisle. 
   When we will not rise up to meet our responsibility as Members, to judge each other and to hold ourselves to a higher ethical standard, I know that tendency. And for those new Members that are here who want to bring this process and make it more transparent and make it more open, trust me, there's no one who will work more closely with you to make it happen. The Ethics Committee process, again, I'm going to say it again, needs to work fairly, it needs to work honestly, and it needs to work in a bipartisan fashion. 
   In 2005 and 2006, the then minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, the minority whip, Mr. Hoyer, castigated the majority to no end over the issue of, it might have been in 2004 and 2005, over the issue of making changes to the ethics process and the ethics rules in a partisan manner. And I agreed with them. And those changes were later rescinded by a vote in this House. 
   But over the last 15 months, three times we've had bipartisan, I mean partisan changes to the rules brought to the floor of this House and forced down Members' throats. Three times. Tonight is the fourth time, the fourth time that we've gone down the same path that people decried and decried. And I think all of us on both sides of the aisle know that if this process is going to work fairly and honestly and in a bipartisan manner, it needs to be written in a bipartisan manner. No other way around it. 
   The members of the task force, MIKE CAPUANO, the gentleman from Massachusetts, the other three Democrat members, LAMAR SMITH and the other three Republican members really did hard work and really tried to come to some agreement. But when you start to create this outside entity, as an excuse, as a way of saying we're doing something, instead of actually fixing the problem, that's where we could never come to an agreement. 
   I look around this House and I know that there are a majority of the Members of this House who are opposed to the creation of this Office of Congressional Ethics. I see you. I know who you are. You all know it. 
   We've been through this process. The 18 years that I've been here, we've been through this process of self-flagellating ourselves and introducing new ethics packages, passing them on the floor of the House, all of it, all of it under some rules of public pressure. 
   But what we really have never done is to create an ethics process that does work fairly and honestly in a bipartisan manner. I don't know what goes on down there, and I understand there's a reason for some secrecy, but to have some idea that something is moving in the ethics process would be helpful, to know that they are investigating case number whatever it is and that it will move. 
   But I do think that the proposal that we have tonight before us is partisan. I don't think it'll work. And I don't think it's in the best interest of the American people or this institution. 
   The current Ethics Committee is made up of five members appointed by the Speaker and five members appointed by the minority leader. It's bipartisan. The problem we have is that the process itself has not worked. And it's been frankly 10 years since it's worked very well. Now, there's a lot of ways to make it work. I think more transparency and more accountability. And I think Members could come to an agreement on making that process work, although I do believe the most important thing that will make it work is a commitment by the leaders on both sides of the aisle to say, we expect the Ethics Committee to work; we expect them to do our job. And the two leaders need to stand there and uphold those Members and the work that they do on behalf of this entire House. It can happen. 
   But the new proposal is three Members appointed by the Speaker and three Members appointed by myself and we have to come to an agreement. We have six Members that we could, six Members on this outside organization that we could agree on. 
   Now, the Speaker and I have come to some agreements here over the last couple of weeks, and it's been a very nice and wonderful experience. But to think that we can come to an agreement on six people to serve on this outside panel strikes me as a stretch. I can't imagine who in their right mind would want to serve on this outside panel because of the fighting that's going to occur, not by Members, but by partisan groups on both sides who are going to want to be filing frivolous complaints. And the problem with this outside process is that it does not have the secrecy and accountability that's necessary to ensure that Members' reputations aren't drug through the mud by some partisan charge that may have no basis in fact at all. None. 
   Now, if the bipartisan process that we have called the Ethics Committee doesn't work, why would we think that this bipartisan outside Ethics Committee is going to work any better? 
   I just want to say that this institution means a lot to me. It means a lot to, I think, all of us who serve. And before I came to the floor, I was watching the proceedings from my office, and I saw the new Member, the gentleman from Illinois, sitting here, probably was scratching his head wondering on his first day in Congress he's in the middle of this big partisan fight. It's not usually this way. But I've got to tell you that it really isn't usually this way. 
   What we're about to undertake here is something that will never be undone, if we do it. And if we do it wrong, which I believe it is being done wrong, it will be something that this institution and its Members will live with for a long, long time to come.     
   And I think there's only one real answer, and I want all of my colleagues to really seriously consider doing the right thing tonight. I think that we ought to defeat the previous question. I think that we ought to send this back to a committee that can, in a bipartisan way, find a way to make the Ethics Committee process work in the fair,  honest and bipartisan manner in which we all want it to work. Let's not paper over the problem. Let us go fix the problem, and the problem is the Ethics Committee process itself. 
   And so I would ask my colleagues to thank the great work of the bipartisan group of Members who tried to put this together, thank them for their job and the job they did for this institution. But let's also reject this proposal, agree that we will work together in a bipartisan way to do the right thing for our Members, our colleagues, this institution and for the American people. 
   Defeat the previous question.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, next Monday is Veterans Day, and I think all of us in America owe those who have fought for our country, given their lives, given their service to our country, we all owe them a great deal of gratitude. 
   But how is this Congress today, this House, going to give and show our veterans our gratitude? We're going to pass a military quality of life veterans bill, and we're going to attach a pork-laden, overstuffed Labor-Health and Human Services bill on the backs of this bill. 
   The Senate's not going to take this bill up in this form. They're going to split the two bills. The President's made clear he's not going to sign this bill combining these two appropriations bills. This is one of the most cynical and most political things I've seen in the 17 years that I've been here in Congress. 
   To know that the President is not going to sign this bill, to know that the Senate is not going to allow this two-bill pile-up to be considered in the Senate, and yet we're going to force the Members of the House today in a position where they shouldn't be. 
   We shouldn't play these political games on the backs of our veterans and our soldiers. I think that we should split this bill and do it the right way and show our veterans on Veterans Day that we really do appreciate their sacrifice and their service.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding, and say to my colleagues, the issue of competitiveness is an important issue in America. We are competing with countries all over the world and, as a result, real competition brings out the best in all of us. 
   When I look at the bill that we have before us, it really shows me everything that is wrong with Washington. This bill left the House with a $23 billion authorization. It comes back with a $43 billion authorization, creating 40 new programs. 
   Now, these are well-intentioned programs. I am sure there are some very good things in this bill. But when you begin to think about 40 new programs that are being authorized, there is no spending available for these. We authorize all kinds of bills, but then we have to go find the money to pay for them. 
   We know what the appropriations process is like, and I will just point out one tiny example. There are 208 math and science programs that are operated by 13 Federal agencies; 208 math and science programs, 13 different agencies. And guess what we do in this bill. We create five or six new ones. 
   Now, I have been trying to get my arms around this for about the last 5 years. Why can't we find a way to take these programs and the money that we are spending on them and try to do some coordinated approach that really will produce more math and science majors? That is not what we do. We just keep adding new programs. It happened last year. It is going to happen again this year. 
   It just reminds me of the old adage: If you throw enough mud against the wall, some of it is sure to stick. In Washington, that adage has been turned around: If you throw enough money at the wall, some of it is bound to stick. But at the end of the day I don't think that is what the American taxpayers want us to do. I think they want us to do things that pass the straight-face test. And adding five more or six more math and science programs to the 208 that we have makes no sense to me at this time. 
   If we are serious about competitiveness and serious about allowing our manufacturers and our companies, our software companies and others in our country to be able to compete, let's look at the regulatory burden that we put on our companies that doesn't exist around the world. We regulate things until it can't hardly breathe, and we wonder why our companies can't compete as well around the world. 
   Why don't we talk about extending and making permanent the tax cuts, giving companies in America certainty about the reasons to invest in the American economy, reasons to invest in their own future? And if we were to make those tax cuts permanent, people would have some feeling and some certainty about what the tax regime is going to be in our country so that we can in fact allow them to put greater investment here. 
   What about tort reform? Nowhere in the world do our companies get beat up by the courts and the trial lawyers and no place any more than here in America. If we want to be able to compete around the world, if we want to bring the cost of doing business down, why don't we do something about tort reform? 
   Let's talk about expanding free trade and markets around the world. We have got three or four trade bills that are laying around here languishing for countries in Central and South America. Again, we want to be competitive, but why don't we help work with countries around the world to reduce those barriers so that we have more markets for our companies to go out and compete in? 
   And, at the end of the day, if we are serious about being able to compete in a worldwide market, we have got to do something about educating our children. I think most of us that are here today know that we educate about half of America's kids. Maybe a little more than half get a high school diploma. Some of them can't read it. But the fact is that we have never been serious in this country about providing all of America's children a chance for a decent education. 
   And that doesn't mean that Washington has to drive all of it. But we as a country, as a Nation, need to get serious about finding ways to give every person in this country a chance at a good education. Because if we educate more of America's kids, we will have more math teachers, we will have more scientists, we will have more engineers, we will have more teachers. But we can't do that if we don't get serious about improving our schools and making sure that all kids have a chance. 
   This bill creates a lot of Washington bureaucracies and a lot of Washington bureaucrats, and the only thing competitive about this bill will be the competition for office space created by all the new bureaucrats that will be employed as a result of this bill. 
   I know there are some good things in this bill, and I know my colleagues worked hard at it. But at the end of the day, this looks too much to me like Washington as usual and, as a result, I am unable to support this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from California for yielding. 
   I come to the floor today to express my disappointment over where this process has led us and the fact that we are going to shut down the appropriations process and go to what we would refer to as martial law. 
   Now over the last several days it has become clear that our Members are concerned about what has happened to the process of due deliberation in the House. Over the last several days my name has been taken in vain over the fact that there was an agreement reached earlier this year between Mr. Hoyer and myself and Mr. Obey. And there was an agreement we would bring earmark reform to the appropriation process, and as part of that agreement that we would work towards a unanimous consent request on each of the appropriation bills. 
   I want to tell my friend, Mr. Speaker, tell my friend from Wisconsin that I feel as though I have kept my part of the deal. I have worked diligently with our Members to try to come to an agreement that our Members felt was fair. The gentleman outlined the number of hours that we have taken on the appropriations bills this year. There is no question that more time has been taken. And that is because we have had a change in the majority here in Congress. We have had a serious change in each of the appropriation bills in terms of the priorities of the new majority versus the priorities of the former majority. So one would expect that more time was going to be taken on these appropriations bills this year. 
   But what brought all of this to an end was the process by which the State Children's Health Insurance reauthorization was coming to the floor where our Members were shut out of debate, where we were presented with a 488-page bill at 11:30 one night and expected to be in committee the next day ready to have committee action on a bill that had never ever had a hearing. 
   Now as I mentioned to the gentleman the other night, all we seek on this side is fairness. And so the tactics employed on the Ag appropriations bill the other night was an opportunity for our Members to try to come down and talk about their concerns with the process and their concerns with that work product. 
   But the actions taken here today to shut the whole appropriations process down, lock it under a rule, self-execute six amendments into this process is unprecedented. I heard the gentleman over the last several years talk about process and how the minority ought to be treated. I heard it day after day. 
   And I might add to my friend that I had some sympathy for the concerns that he raised. But as I mentioned the other night, all we seek is to be treated the way you asked to be treated. That's all we ask. We could have had a discussion about trying to come to a unanimous consent request on the balance of this bill. We could have sat down and tried to work through the process on the Defense appropriation bill so we wouldn't have to go through this; but that opportunity wasn't presented. So I stand here today with regret that we have had to come to this point. 
   I am one who believes that there is a way we can disagree on our policy differences here without being disagreeable; that there is a way that the two sides can make their points without cutting the legs off the other side. 
   But the actions here that are being taken will do nothing more than stifle the ability of the minority to make its  case, the minority who represent nearly half of American people, to effectively make our case on this bill, and I think it is regrettable.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, this is disappointing, disappointing that the House has had to resort to a martial law to further stifle the voices of those of us in the minority who represent nearly half the American people. 
   We have had a debate on this rule. I have listened to the debate. I even participated in part of the debate and listened to my colleagues in the majority complain about the fact that we spent 3 or 4 hours the other day trying to debate a measure that we were not going to have much time to debate on because we didn't have a committee process, it was going to be brought to the House under a closed rule. And my colleagues pulled the bill and have been whining now for days that we spent 3 or 4 hours doing dilatory tactics. 
   Now, some of you were here in 1998 when the Ag appropriations bill was on the floor of the House, and that bill was held up for 9 hours by the then minority over the fact that there was an amendment that a Member wanted to have heard on the Foreign Operations bill. It just so happened it was the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) who wanted an abortion amendment on the Foreign Operations bill and wasn't sure she was going to be able to get her amendment; and, as a result, she and some of her colleagues held up the bill with dilatory tactics for 9 hours. 
   Now, who were those Members who held that bill for 9 hours on this floor? 
   It was the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), it was the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), it was the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), and it was who is now the distinguished Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi. 
   Nine hours of dilatory tactics over 3 days. So what did the Republican majority do? They went to the Rules Committee, and they got a rule. And do you know what they did in the rule? They told all Members any amendment that is filed will be made in order under the rule, and we came back to the floor and we spent 9 hours debating every amendment that Members wanted to offer, and we completed the bill. 
   Now, if you want to bring a rule out here, at least allow us to be heard, at least allow us to participate, at least allow the 202 of us on this side of the aisle to represent the millions of American people that have sent us here to do their work. 
   All I have asked and all my colleagues have asked all year is for fairness. All we want is fairness. I know how you wanted to be treated when you were in the minority. I say to my colleagues on the both sides of the aisle we have both been in a minority. We both know what it is like to not have many tools at your disposal. I, when I was chairing the Education and Workforce Committee, made sure that all of our members were treated fairly and treated honestly; and I think my work with the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) demonstrates that, while we had differences, we had a very fair process. 
   I understand that over the last 12 years some of my predecessors may have handled, may have handled, this floor in a less than delicate way. Over the last several years, my colleagues in the majority now complained that we  ought to have a more fair and open process here. I agreed with many of you, and you know it. And all I am asking for on behalf of the Republican Members, the minority Members here, is to be treated fairly and honestly. 
   The rule that we have before us that shuts us down is unfair, it's unwise, it's undemocratic, and it does not deserve the support of any Member in this House.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 3, a bill to expand taxpayer funding of human embryonic stem cell research. I support stem cell research with only one exception, research that requires the killing of human life. Taxpayer-funded stem cell research must be carried out in a way that is ethical and in a way that respects the sanctity of human life. 
   Fortunately, ethical stem cell alternatives continue to flourish in the scientific community. Earlier this week we learned that amniotic non-embryonic stem cells may offer the same research possibility as stem cells obtained through the destruction of human embryos. We have also seen stem cells from noncontroversial sources, like umbilical cord blood, be used to treat humans afflicted with more than 70 afflictions. I think we need to be funding the research that shows the most promise. 
   I am deeply disappointed today that Democrat leaders have pressed ahead with this vote, rather than having hearings and markups where breakthroughs like amniotic fluid cell research could have been fully examined. This research offers the potential for a new consensus approach to the difficult issue of stem cell research, and I am disappointed that the Democrat majority was not willing to allow time for this new development to be thoroughly examined. 
   We all know what is going to happen with this bill. This bill is going to move through the House. It will move through the Senate and go to the White House, where it was vetoed last year, and it will be vetoed again. 
   We have a bill that has been introduced by Mr. Bartlett from Maryland and Mr. Gingrey from Georgia that says, let's put more funding into amniotic stem cell research. This is a bill that I think the Congress can support, the House, the Senate and the White House, that really will provide new breakthroughs in medical science.     
   But that isn't going to be allowed today, and it is not going to be on the floor today. Instead, we are going to go through a political exercise that will get us nowhere. And for that, I am deeply disappointed. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The resolution, Mr. Speaker, will instruct the Ethics Committee to review the serious allegations and evidence against the gentleman from Louisiana and report back to the House whether the gentleman should be expelled for conduct that brings dishonor on this institution. 
   This resolution is not intended to cast innocence or guilt on the gentleman from Louisiana. It is intended to ensure that the Ethics Committee process, a process that all the Members of this House want to see work fairly and honestly, begin its deliberations of this issue. 
   This Ethics Committee last year, over a period of approximately 6 months, was looking into this matter, but as of today there has not been a subcommittee established to look at the facts of this case. The Republican pool was announced several months ago, and we have been waiting for the majority party to put their pool members onto the Ethics Committee so, in fact, this investigation could continue. And it is somewhat of a sad state that these members weren't announced until today and it took the indictment of Mr. Jefferson for the majority to outline to the House who the members will be that will make up their pool. 
   But the point I make is that all of us have been through a very difficult period in this House, and I think that I have made clear to my colleagues on the minority side of the House that I intend to hold our colleagues to a higher standard. And when we talk about the standard here, we all know that bringing honor on this House is a standard that all of us attempt to meet and make sure that there is no dishonor brought. And we are not talking here about a standard that is very different from that of a criminal plea or a criminal indictment. We are talking about behavior that brings dishonor on this institution. 
   So I believe that the Ethics Committee can, in fact, do its work. I think they can do it efficiently. And the purpose of this resolution is to ensure that the House speaks to our Ethics Committee to make sure that it is doing its job in resolving this case as soon as possible. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, the legislation that the gentleman refers to has been shown to us just moments ago. The gentleman, the majority leader, is well aware that legislation does not come to the floor without the cooperation of both sides. And to have seen this bill just moments ago strikes me as something that we never, ever, ever would have considered doing on the floor of the House without clear consultation and advisement of the minority. And so, I will look at the bill. I'm not quite sure what it says because, again, we have just received it moments ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I would yield to the gentleman from Missouri, the minority whip, for as much time as he may consume.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, if I could yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The gentleman referred to when our panel members were named, which was on May 1. The gentleman should be aware that our panel was picked and members had agreed to serve on the panel by the end of January of this year. We held the list, trying to work with our colleagues in the majority so that the panels on both sides could be named as soon as possible. And finally, right before Easter, we filed our 10 panel names and they were certified. That occurred on May 1. I am sorry that it is a fact that your panel members were not named until today, and not until after the indictment of a sitting Member. 
   So the fact that almost 6 months have gone by in this Congress without any work on the part of the Ethics Committee with regard to Mr. Jefferson's case I think is a sad record. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Speaker, I think the American people are entitled to see this institution held to the highest ethical standards. They clearly expect more of us than maybe they have in the past. And the reason to bring this resolution here tonight is to not profess innocence or guilt. It is to make sure that the process that we have in this House for protecting the House and protecting the institution and protecting our Members, we want to make sure that that process works the way it was intended. 
   So I appreciate the support of my colleagues for this resolution.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   The purpose of this remedy, a point of order on consideration of the conference report, is to deal with earmarks that may have not been considered by the House or the Senate, what we have come to term airdropped earmarks. There are cases where over the length of the consideration of an appropriation bill in the House and the Senate, circumstances may change and there may be a reason to put an earmark, if you will, in an appropriation. And to preserve the right for all Members to consider these earmarks, having the point of order on the consideration of the appropriation bill, we believed, was an appropriate way for any Member to bring to light one of these earmarks. There is 10 minutes of debate on each side, and then the House can decide whether to proceed with the consideration of the conference report or not.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, if the gentleman would yield further, we went through a great debate last year over this issue. As we all know, we have work to do, and to allow debate on a conference report on every individual issue, you get into a ping-pong effect of the House objecting to one issue, a Senate issue, we could send it over there, they would send it back, we would never get the bill finished. 
   The idea behind the point of order on the conference report is to bring this issue to light, and if you bring an issue to light that is of such substance, the House may in fact vote to sustain the gentleman's point of order and there is no consideration of the conference report. 
   But we have never been able to find a way to get to each particular item in a conference report, as the gentleman has suggested.

   Mr. BOEHNER. If the gentleman from Kentucky will yield further, the agreement that we have come to with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is that for 10 of the 12 appropriations bills, the earmarks will in fact be listed. 
   Traditionally, the Homeland Security appropriation bill has had very, very few earmarks in it. It won't be like you have to go through a whole laundry list to determine what is in it. Secondly, the bill that we expect to be before us tomorrow, the Military Quality-of-Life Veterans bill, it also has earmarks, but almost all of them have been scrubbed by the Department of Defense, and I think there has been an understanding that, given the time constraints, that these two bills would in fact move without earmarks but that the next 10 bills would have earmarks included in them.

   Mr. BOEHNER. If the gentleman would yield, if you raise a point of order on the consideration of the conference report and the House agrees with your point of order, the consideration of the conference report is stopped and what in real terms happens is the conference report goes back to conference where the issue that was brought to light is dealt with. 
   There are a lot of ways to deal with, let's say in your case, what you would call an objectionable earmark by bringing that point of order and having the House's support. Basically it goes back and you begin to deal with it.

And, yes, we on both sides of the aisle over the last number of years, the appropriators have worked through a unanimous-consent request to provide for the consideration of a lot of these bills, under an open rule. We still have an open rule. But the agreement has been, over the past several years, that we work through that process with the Members to make sure that Members have all the time they need to debate their amendment.

   The agreement we have reached with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is intended to preserve every Member's right to make additions, to make changes, to offer amendments to the bill. I think, how can I best describe this, that over the course of at least the last two or three years that I'm aware of, we've brought these bills to the floor under an open rule, and there have been bipartisan agreements, the unanimous-consent agreements, on how we're going to proceed. And the agreement that we have is basically to uphold what we've done in the past few Congresses. 
   And so as the gentleman pointed out, what we've agreed to is generally, the time limits, times that were used in the past, but it's general. We don't know what these bills look like, some of them yet. We're not sure what they may contain, and so I felt constrained in coming to an agreement on a specific time limit because we haven't seen the bills, but I think there are enough of us in this Chamber who've worked together, who trust each other to be able to come to a unanimous-consent agreement that gets unanimous consent because that's how it works.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Indiana for yielding, and thank he and his colleagues who have introduced this amendment for their work. 
   All of this talk about bringing back the fairness doctrine caused me to think about the whole idea of the Federal Communications Commission, set up in the 1930s to regulate the air waves and the spectrum that's out there so that we didn't have two radio stations on the same wave. This was set up in the 1930s. 
   And then in the 1940s we got into the idea that, well, there aren't that many options in TV and radio, and so maybe we ought to make sure that all of them, in terms of what they say, is fair. 
   Well, that might have been helpful in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s, but my goodness, we're in the 21st century, where people get their news from thousands of different sources. It could be radio, from hundreds and hundreds of radio stations. It could be from TV, where we now have hundreds and hundreds of stations. It could be from the Internet. It could be from the newspapers. There's lots of places for people to get their news. 
   And at the end of the day, as I think about the fairness doctrine, I think about those of us in Congress. We get elected based on our constituents and what we're for and what we're against, whether they like us or they don't like us. And if they like us, they might vote for us again. And if they don't like us, guess what, they get to go punch the ballot for somebody else. 
   Well, when it comes to the issue of the fairness doctrine, when we're dealing with radio, they can go a lot of different places. And I think that the best way is to let the judgment of the American people decide. And they can decide with their finger. They can turn it off or they can turn it on. They can change channels or they can decide to go to their computer and read it on the Internet. 
   And the idea that people are calling for the fairness doctrine to be called back reminds me, once again, of why I came here. I came here because I thought government was too big, it spent too much, and no one was holding the government accountable. 
   Let's trust the American people to do what they think is best. Their finger can make all the decisions, all that they need to make on their own behalf. Let's trust them to do the right thing.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Washington for yielding. 
   My colleagues, several years ago when the current Speaker, Speaker Pelosi, had my job as the minority leader, she said that bills should generally come to the floor under a fair and open process with amendments allowed and substitutes allowed. 
   And yet here we are today once again violating the very words that she said how the minority should be treated by bringing a bill to the floor, a Senate bill with amendments crafted by the House with no opportunity for amendments, no opportunity for substitutes. And no opportunity to vote straight up or down on the bipartisan bill that came over from the Senate. 
   I think that what we have seen here is just a pattern of we are for this, we create rules that allow the minority the opportunity to be fairly heard, and yet they are routinely violated. 
   And so the only way we can have a straight up-or-down vote on the Senate bill that passed the Senate 68-29, the only way we can have a vote on that is to defeat the previous question. Why do we want to deny the Members of the House to vote on the bipartisan Senate bill? I can probably tell you, that's because it would pass. A majority of the Members of the House of Representatives are in favor of the Senate bill. But House leaders are standing in the way of the opportunity for House Members to actually vote on that bill. 
   We can get into the merits of the changes that were made to the Senate bill that are being debated here. I think they handcuff our intelligence officials. I think that they open up a wide avenue for trial lawyers to hold communication companies at bay and threaten their very willingness to help us in this very serious business of tracking down those who would want to do Americans harm. 
   And so I would ask my colleagues to defeat the previous question. Let's have a chance to vote on the bipartisan Senate bill and let's allow the House to work its will.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker and my colleagues, on behalf of all my Republican colleagues, I want to welcome my Democrat colleagues back to the House. 
   Five weeks ago, after the protest of the minority, you adjourned the House without a vote on the American Energy Act, H.R. 6566. You and your fellow Democrats left town for five weeks, but Republicans refused to leave. And we were here each and every day during the August recess talking to thousands of Americans that were coming through the Capitol, and we stood here every day asking for a vote on our bill that does all of the above, the American Energy Act; a bill that the American people want us to vote on. And that's all we're asking for is a vote. 
   And today, instead of allowing a vote on our all-of-the-above plan, there are rumors that there is going to be a bill coming to the floor quickly that no one has ever seen, that does some of the above, maybe a little of the above, but clearly not what the American people want, which is ``all of the above,'' some bill that's being written in the back room in the dark of night that no one has yet seen. 
   Now, listen, the American people don't want a sham. They don't want a hoax. They have suffered all summer long in the face of high gas prices and high energy prices, and they are demanding a vote here in this Congress on a plan that does all of the above, not some of the bill, not a little bit of the above, but all of the above. 
   Madam Speaker, you promised that this would be the most open and accountable Congress in history. And in that light, I respectfully ask you now give the American people a vote on the American Energy Act, H.R. 6566. Will it be on the floor this week? Will you commit to giving the American people a straight up-or-down vote on a plan they want, the all-of-the-above plan, the American Energy Act? 
   Madam Speaker, this is the U.S. House of Representatives. As all of my colleagues have known, we all refer to this as the people's House because none of us got here without being elected by all of the people in our districts. Why  not let the House work its will? Why not allow the Congress to decide the future of our energy security here in America? And I don't think the American people are going to rest until Congress takes action on energy that does all of the above. 
   So, Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend my motion to recommit to include the text of H.R. 6566, the American Energy Act.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Reclaiming my time. And then this latest round of stories that the gentleman from New York was kind enough to share with all of us raise serious questions, serious questions. 
   And I just--the point of the letter that was sent yesterday was to ask the gentleman if he would step aside until the Ethics Committee had time to investigate this. 
   I believe that the Ethics Committee needs to do its job, not just in this case, but in all cases. And I've been concerned for some time that the Ethics Committee has not been a functioning committee of the House. I understand the current circumstances. We all understand the current circumstances. 
   But I don't want to condemn the gentleman. I've never convicted the gentleman, nor would I, because he is my friend. But just because he's my friend doesn't mean that I can excuse him from the rules of the House or the law of our land. 
   And so I ask my colleagues to work with us. I believe, like Charlie does, that we, as a Congress, have to find a way to get beyond what's gone on around here over the last 7 or 8 years, that we have to find a way to work together. 
   If you look at the issues that Charlie and I have worked on, George Miller and I have worked on, and a lot of other Members that I've worked on on both sides of the aisle, the big issues of our country will not get done by one side or the other. They will only be addressed in a bipartisan way if we're going to be successful. And we know we have big issues facing this country that are being ignored because we're too busy clawing at each other. 
   My intent here is not to claw at my friend from New York. My intent here is to have justice and to have all of us live by the rules of the House. 
   I'm sorry that I had to do it, but I have a job to do on behalf of my colleagues in this Chamber. I believe all of us are being held accountable and should be held accountable. 
   Yes, I've made mistakes, and I've paid for them. I just think that the sooner we get this cleaned up, the better. 
   But, in the meantime, in fairness to the Members of the House, that stepping aside would, in fact, be the right thing to do.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, the State Children's Health Insurance Program was created 10 years ago by a Republican Congress, along with our Democrat colleagues and a Democrat President. It clearly was a very bipartisan process from the beginning, and as we reauthorize this important program that Republicans, Democrats, the White House, everyone supports, I am saddened that we are here today with a very partisan bill done in a very partisan way. 
   I thought in this reauthorization process, I know on our side, Mr. Barton, Mr. McCrery, their respective committees, wanted to work with our Democrat colleagues to develop a bill that we could all vote for. But that process never even got started. While there may have been some hearings in the Ways and Means Committee on this bill, there were no hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We were presented with a 488-page bill the night before the markup. Now we have brought this to the floor without a markup in committee, no amendments allowed to be offered by the minority and a limited time for debate. This saddens me and disappoints me. It did not have to be this way. 
   The result of this flawed process is a bill that expands government-run health care beyond anything that any one of us could have imagined over the last 10 years. I really do believe that Republicans and Democrats can work together to reauthorize this program in a way that will receive bipartisan support. 
   Last November, the American people sent us a message here in Congress, but I don't think that message was, ``I want you to cut my Medicare and I want you to raise taxes. I did not want you to raise my taxes.'' 
   When you look at the bill that we have before us, we have $193 billion worth of cuts to Medicare, a program to provide health insurance for our seniors. We are going to cut this $193 billion over 10 years, and we are going to raise tobacco taxes, which affects the poorest of America's citizens, and lay more of this tax burden on their backs.     
   In my district alone, some 14,267 seniors are going to have their Medicare costs increased, and about 73 percent of that number are likely to lose their Medicare Advantage Program altogether. 
   That is not what the voters sent us here to do; and, believe me, the seniors in my district who take advantage of this very valuable program don't want to lose their benefits which will result from the passage of this bill. 
   And so I say to my colleagues, we have a flawed bill on the floor today; and the flawed bill is the result of a flawed process. As I said last night to all of my colleagues, we represent nearly half of the American people. We have a right to be heard. We have a right to participate. And through the process over the last couple of weeks we have been denied the right to be involved in the process, denied the right today to be involved in trying to amend the bill to a point where we can have a bipartisan product to send to the other body. I am disappointed by that. 
   Later today, Republicans will offer a motion to recommit this bill, the only option that we have. And that motion to recommit will do this: It will reauthorize the SCHIP program for 1 year. There will be no Medicare cuts involved in this program, no benefits will go to illegal immigrants, and we will see to that in the motion to recommit. 
   Fourthly, it will have a sense of the Congress that this bill should go back to the committee and, over the course of the next year, have the Republicans and Democrats on the respective committees work together to produce a bipartisan product that the President can sign into law. I think that is a responsible course of action, given what we have dealt with here over the last couple of weeks. 
   I would ask my colleagues to reject the underlying bill and vote for the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, here we go again, a higher spending, higher taxes, and people don't think there is a difference between the two major political parties. One only has to look at what's happened so far this year. We have the continuing resolution that was passed in February, there was $6 billion worth of excess spending in it. 
   Now we have got an emergency supplemental to fund our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq that has another $22 billion worth of excess spending in it. If you look at the discretionary spending levels in this budget for this next fiscal year, we have another $22 billion worth of additional spending that's outlined. 
   Now if that's not bad enough, we are only 4 1/2 months into this calendar year, and my friends across the aisle have authorized an additional $62.5 billion of additional spending. How much spending and how many taxes do we want to impose on the American people? 
   We all know that the tax cuts of 2001 and the tax cuts of 2003 have led us to one of the most robust economies that we have seen in our history. Why? Because we lowered tax rates, we gave people reasons to invest in our economy. Jobs were created, 5 million new jobs were created, more people were earning money, raising their families, paying their bills, and, guess what else they are doing? They are also paying more in taxes.     
   That is why revenues to the Federal Government over the last 3 years have increased at over 12 percent per year. They are likely to do the same again this year if we don't impose upon this economy the largest tax increase in American history. It is coming. There is $200 billion worth of tax increases needed to fill this hole. There is this reserve fund, all these promises: If we can raise taxes somewhere, we will give you this extra spending. And so we are going to see the largest tax increase in our Nation's history once again. 
   I was listening to this debate earlier in my office and I began to ask myself, what is the essence of this? Let me go back to the 1970s. 
   I grew up in a household with 11 brothers and sisters; my dad owned a bar, and we were Democrats, all of us. And I remember starting a new business in 1975; I remember paying taxes. I remember not owing many taxes because I was starting a new business. But in 1978, as my small business was beginning to grow, the top tax rate in our country was 70 percent. That means 70 cents out of every dollar over that minimum, which was about $75,000, 70 cents of every dollar I got to give to the Federal Government. That is when I began to realize that maybe I wasn't a Democrat any longer. 
   Here I was trying to grow a small business; I was a subchapter S, so everything that my business made, I had to pay taxes on personally. That meant I could only leave 30 cents of every dollar in my business to help make it grow. And even under those tax rates that were suffocating, I was able to succeed. 
   But let's think about the last 25 years. When Ronald Reagan got elected in 1980, in 1981 in a bipartisan way we started a process of lowering tax rates. Over the last 25 years, by and large we have lowered tax rates dozens of times, only a couple of bumps, a couple increases along the way. The result of all of that over the last 25 years has been a growing economy. Better jobs in America, more jobs in America, and more revenues to the Federal Government. It is a prescription that has worked. 
   Look again at the 2003 and the 2001 tax cuts. We reduced tax rates, and the result was more investment, more jobs, and more revenue to the Federal Government. 
   Now, at some point there is a point of diminishing returns, but I will suggest to all of you that we are nowhere close to it yet. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, I became a Republican and I came to Congress because I thought that we paid too much in taxes and that government was too big. The heart and core of who I am and why I am here is to fight for a smaller, less costly, more accountable government here in Washington, D.C. This budget represents every reason that I decided to become a Republican, and every reason I decided to come to Washington and to do something about it. 
   The big difference is simple right here. My friends across the aisle believe that government knows best what to do with the American people's money. More of my colleagues on my side believe that the money that the American people earn is theirs, and that they can make better decisions on behalf of themselves and their family and their future if we allow them to keep more of the hard-earned money that they make. 
   I can't just sit back and be quiet about higher taxes and higher spending. This is the largest tax increase in American history. This will in fact disinvest money from our economy, will put people out of work, and put us on a path to higher deficits. 
   And if the largest tax increase in American history isn't the saddest part of this bill, I will tell you what it is: No entitlement reform. 
   There is an economic tsunami coming at us; it is Social Security, it is Medicare, and it is Medicaid. And while Republicans over the last years have made several attempts and made some changes, and I would argue not nearly as many changes as we should have, there is no entitlement reform in this bill. That means that the amount of debt that will build up over the next 5 years, as outlined in this budget, will far surpass the debt that accumulated over the last 5 years. 
   You all know what is happening. There is not a Member in this Chamber that doesn't understand that if we don't deal with entitlement our kids and our grandkids can never afford the benefits that we have promised ourselves. We can look the other way, we can act like it doesn't exist, but we have made promises to ourselves as baby boomers that our kids and grandkids can't afford. And yet, we see the tsunami coming at us, we can measure it; we can measure the speed and the size of it, and yet we do nothing about it. 
   My colleagues, this is not the direction that I believe we should go in. I would ask all my colleagues to stand up and do the right thing and to say ``no'' to this budget resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' CARE, KATRINA RECOVERY, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 110-31) -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, the President was right to veto the bill that we have before us. And I believe that the House today will sustain the President's veto because the bill that we have before us that is purportedly there to pay for our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and other issues, in my opinion, ties the hands of our generals and our troops on the ground and almost mandates failure in Iraq. 
   I think it is time for us to work across the aisle to produce a clean bill that the President can sign into law to sustain our efforts in Afghanistan and in Iraq, and to make sure that at the end of the day we have victory. 
   The fundamental question that we are all dealing with in this Chamber and elsewhere is, why is Iraq important? Why is winning in Iraq so important? 
   In my view, and in others, al Qaeda has made Iraq the central front in their war with us. Those aren't my words, those are their words. They started this war when they attacked us all through the 1990s and when they attacked us in New York City on 9/11. 
   And while we went to Iraq to take out Saddam Hussein and to help build a more stable, democratically-elected nation in that part of the world and bring more stability there, it has turned into much more than that. 
   According to the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a nonprofit organization funded by a grant from the Homeland Security Department, Iraq today is home to 77 different terrorist organizations. They have made this, they have made Iraq the central front in their war with us. 
   We all know that there is a growing movement around the world of radical Islamic terrorists that want to kill Americans and want to kill our allies. They are operating all over the world and they are attacking people all over the world. Just think about where they have been over the last several weeks, whether it was Bangladesh last night or elsewhere. They are continuing their efforts to try to gain control of the world, and part of that effort is aimed directly at us. Americans, freedom loving people, up against people who don't want freedom for people, that want to impose radical Islamic law on all of us. And so they have made Iraq the central front in their war with us. 
   And if we walk out of Iraq, if we don't give this plan a chance to succeed, we encourage the terrorists. We will encourage them. They will be able to recruit new people all over the world. They will have a safe haven in Iraq itself. We will destabilize the entire Middle East, including the very existence of Israel. And who doesn't believe that if we don't deal with the terrorists in Iraq, that we won't be dealing with them on the streets of America? That is why Iraq is important. And if we are not willing to stand up to the terrorists and defeat them in Iraq, when and where will we draw the line to protect the American people, our ultimate responsibility? 
   We have a serious responsibility, and there is no greater responsibility for those of us who serve in this Chamber, than to provide for the safety and security of our constituents and our people in our country. 
   So tell me, if we are not going to stand up to them in Iraq, if we are not going to take them on in Iraq and defeat them there, when and where will we do it? 
   And the fact is, is that our troops are doing a great job in Iraq under very difficult circumstances. They deserve the support of all the Members of this House. 
   And so I say to my colleagues, it is time for the games to stop, it is time  for the political points to be taken off the board, and it is time for us to sit down as Members on both sides of the aisle and give the President a clean bill that funds our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, that furthers our effort to take on the terrorists and defeats them, and doesn't do it with some $20 billion worth of excess spending that has nothing to do with this bill. 
   I urge my colleagues to sustain the President's veto.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (SSI EXTENSION FOR ELDERLY AND DISABLED REFUGEES ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise to support the bill that we are working on to extend SSI benefits to really a vulnerable group. 
   But I also rise to express my disappointment in the opportunity that we had last night to pass a bipartisan energy bill that would in fact do all of the above. I am concerned that the bill that did pass last night will do none of the above in terms of moving us toward more energy security. 
   Frankly, I don't think that the bill that passed last night has any chance of moving in the United States Senate. I do believe if we were to pass the bipartisan Abercrombie-Peterson bill, that it was very likely the Senate could take the bill up and move it quickly, a bill that would create a million new jobs, that would lower gas prices and lower energy prices. But that didn't happen. 
   But I rise today to say we are not going away. There is an awful lot of talk moving around here that later on this week we may have to take up a stimulus bill, a lot of well-intentioned, well-meaning money, taxpayer money that we would be sending around the country. 
   I can't think of any better stimulus bill than to pass a bipartisan energy bill that would in fact create 1 million new jobs, would in fact lower gas prices, lower energy prices, help our manufacturers all around the country, and a bill that the American people desperately want. 
   While gas prices came down temporarily, we saw them shoot up in the midst of the hurricane because there is no additional supply. There is no relief valve, and if anybody sneezes around the world in the energy market, what happens? Our gas prices go up. And while oil prices were coming down in the short-term, we all know how vulnerable we are. So taking a real honest step toward preserving America's energy security I think is critically necessary. 
   If we really want to help the American people, help create jobs in our country, why not pass a bipartisan bill that will in fact do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding. 
   And I come to remember my good friend and our good friend, CHARLIE NORWOOD. 
   I met CHARLIE in October of 1994 when he was a candidate for Congress for the first time and had dinner with him one night before we went off on a 16-city tour. I didn't think it would ever end. But at dinner that night, I looked at CHARLIE and I asked, Why are you running for Congress? 
   And he said, That OSHA, that OSHA, they did this to me and did this to me. 
   And for every day that CHARLIE NORWOOD served in this Congress, he was all over OSHA, to have rules and regulations that met the straight-face test. 
   I was the chairman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, and CHARLIE was one of my subcommittee Chairs for the 5 years that I was the chairman. Clearly the most difficult member I have ever had to try to manage. And whether it was the Patients' Bill of Rights, whether it was OSHA, or a host of other issues, when CHARLIE got that bone in his mouth, you could not get it out of his mouth. He was the most dogged, persistent Member I have ever worked with. As a matter of fact, I might even say he might be the most dogged persistent person that I have ever met with because when CHARLIE picked up a cause, he was never going to leave it alone until he accomplished his goal. 
   And I am sure that CHARLIE is watching over us today, wondering why the Patients' Bill of Rights isn't law. Mr. Linder just talked about it. CHARLIE fought about this on more occasions than you can ever imagine, as did JOHN and a lot of other Members. But CHARLIE truly believed in that piece of legislation. He put his heart and soul into it. 
   We are going to miss CHARLIE around here. We are going to miss that dogged persistence that he brought to this floor every day and in the committee rooms every day. 
   But to Gloria and his family, our prayers are with you. 
   And, CHARLIE, may your soul rest in peace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I remind my colleagues that we created the SCHIP program 10 years ago in a bipartisan way to help insure low-income children who did not have access to high quality health insurance. Republicans continue to believe that we ought to have this program and that we ought to find a way to ensure low-income children have access to the kind of quality health care that our children enjoy. 
   This move today to delay the override of this veto is the most partisan political activity I have seen in this Congress all year. If you're really serious about trying to help children get access to low-cost health care, make sure that they have the insurance they need, we would have the veto override today, we would have it right this minute, and then we would start to sit down in a bipartisan way and work out our differences and ensure that we get low-income kids the kind of health care that they need. 
   Madam Speaker, yes, there are differences over this program. Some believe that having adults, and in some States, almost half the people involved in the program are adults, let's make sure that low-income kids, the target of this program, is met. But, no, we are not going to do that, unfortunately. We are going to do what the American people have said they are sick and tired of; we are going to do political games. That is what this delay is intended to do, to allow more time for the political games to go on, exactly what the American people have said they are sick and tired of. 
   Madam Speaker, I think we should have the vote today. Let's just go ahead and have the vote. We are going to sustain the President's veto. Then let's sit down together and do what the American people expect of us, and that is to make sure that this program is continued and children's health care in America is taken care of.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   On the opening day of this Congress, the Speaker of the House said, let's have partnership, not partisanship. And over the course of this year, I have been looking for that partnership to occur. There is probably no better example that the partnership has never occurred over the course of this year than this bill. 
   On this bill, there were no hearings in the relevant committees. There was no markup through the regular legislative process in the Energy and Commerce Committee. And then the bill was brought to the floor in what I would describe as a very partisan way. The majority prevailed, but there was  a significant number of people opposed to the bill. 
   And we are talking about the Children's Health Insurance Program. We are talking about a program that was developed by Republicans and Democrats together to go out and serve the needs of the working poor in America. And yet over the course of the 10 years, I think the program has gone astray. We are starting to put more adults in a program than we did children. And what Republicans and I think Democrats want to do is reauthorize this program in a way that meets the needs of poor children first. That hasn't been happening, and I think all the Members know it hasn't been happening. 
   And so after this veto the first time was upheld, we began some bipartisan talks trying to find common ground to see if we couldn't reauthorize this program in a way that the American people expect of us. They expect us to come here, work together, and find a way to get this program reauthorized. 
   We had Members locked in a room for 2 months, a lot of conversation, a lot of very descriptive things that had to happen. We weren't expecting miracles. And at the end of the day, my Members looked up and said, there is no movement. No movement at all. And I think that this deadlock that we find ourselves in is unfortunate, because there is a population in America that need this program. We could have resolved the differences in this program in 10 minutes if the majority wanted to resolve the differences. 
   But as we see again tonight, there is no attempt to resolve the differences. This has become a partisan political game that we are involved in. The motion that we are debating here is to move the vote on overriding the President's veto until January 23. Hello. And this happens to be about 6 days before the President is going to come and give the State of the Union address. 
   We can have this vote right now and the outcome is certain. But no, no, we can't have an outcome that is certain; we have got to continue to play political games. That is exactly what the American people are disgusted with when they look at this Congress and we see the approval ratings where they are. 
   I think it is time for us to resolve our differences in a bipartisan way and reauthorize this program and make sure that poor children in America have the kind of health insurance that they deserve.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Texas for yielding and thank him and all of you for, once again, to have an opportunity to come and speak on the floor on this resolution. 
   The resolution before us is nonbinding, but it is the first step down a very treacherous path, a path that, if followed, will endanger Americans for generations to come. 
   Iraq is the central front in a global war between the United States of America and radical Islamic terrorists, a war that began long before the horrific events of 9/11, a war the American people did not seek and did not start. 
   It is mind-boggling to consider how fanatically committed our enemies are to destroying America, even at the cost of destroying themselves in the process. Our enemies recruit young people, fill them with hate and rage, and then send them on suicide missions to kill innocent victims. We face an enemy that loves death more than it loves life. 
   As Americans, we cherish freedom and democracy. Ours is a way of life. Theirs is a way of death, of murder, of suicide. 
   The global reach of radical Islam stretches from North Africa, through the Middle East, to South Asia, to Indonesia and to the Philippines. 
   The other side wants Americans to believe that the war in Iraq is different from the war on terror. They even say that we are not fighting al Qaeda in Iraq, ignoring the fact that al Qaeda has made it the central front in their war against America. 
   According to the experts, and according to their own words, radical Islamic terrorists will never stop fighting until much of the world is under Islamic law. 
   In 2004, Osama bin Laden said the following about the conflict in Iraq: ``The whole world is watching this war and the two adversaries; the Islamic Nation ..... and the United States and its allies on the other. It is either victory and glory or misery and humiliation.'' 
   And our enemies are watching this debate, and through the Arab media we know what they are saying. 
   Recently, the second-in-command of al Qaeda issued a warning to moderate Muslims in Iraq and Afghanistan who are working and dying to build peace and security, and he said this: ``These traitors in Iraq and Afghanistan must face their inevitable fate, and face up to the inescapable facts. America is about to depart and abandon them, just as it abandoned their like in Vietnam.'' 
   The consequences of failure in Iraq would be catastrophic for America and the world. 
   Last month, General Petraeus spoke of the very real possibility of Iraq's neighbors taking sides in sectarian violence. 
   Failing in Iraq would jeopardize Israel and greatly benefit Iran, a nation governed by a fanatic and actively building nuclear weapons. 
   The battle we fight in Iraq is the biggest part of our global war, and if we leave, the fight will, in fact, follow us home. And what we will leave behind is chaos, the same kind of chaos we left behind in Vietnam, the same kind of chaos we left behind in Lebanon, and the same kind of chaos that we left behind in Somalia. 
   Who does not believe that we will not see chaos in Iraq, destabilizing the Middle East and jeopardizing the very safety and security of the American people? 
   As Americans, we are fortunate in so many ways. We have so many blessings, including a great and proud history to inspire us. Earlier this week, I talked about President Lincoln and the challenges he faced during some of America's darkest days. During the Revolution, America faced down what was then the most powerful empire in the world, with a rag-tag army. We survived a Civil War that would have permanently divided any other Nation. 
   After a crippling depression in the 1930s, we defeated Japanese imperialism and Hitler in Germany. We then defeated the Soviet Union and their communist empire in a test of wills that lasted for a generation. 
   The greatness of America is exemplified in a simple short letter about duty and sacrifice. The letter was written by Marine Staff Sergeant Daniel Clay, the husband of my former staffer, Lisa Bell Clay. 
   Sergeant Clay was one of 10 Marines who were killed in Fallujah a little over a year ago, and he left behind this letter to his family in case he did not come home. 
   In it, he said, ``What we have done in Iraq is worth any sacrifice. Why? Because it was our duty.'' He says, ``That sounds simple. But all of us have a duty. Duty is defined as a God-given task. Without duty, life is worthless.'' 
   Our troops are not the only Americans who have a God-given task. If a noncommissioned officer can understand his duty, then certainly Members of Congress can understand theirs. 
   Congress has a duty to protect the American people now so that the next generation can enjoy prosperity and freedom. 
   Congress also has a duty to the men and women in uniform when we send them into harm's way, a duty to provide them with the full support and resources they need to accomplish their mission and return home safely. 
   My friends on the other side have described this nonbinding resolution as their first step. It is a first step. It is the first step in a plan to cut off funding and reinforcements for American troops in harm's way. 
   The next step is to micromanage the war through the budget process. To quote the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), who said yesterday, ``They won't be able to continue. They won't be able to do the deployment. They won't have the equipment, they don't have the training and they won't be able to do the work.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, at this very moment American troops are fighting radical Islamic terrorists thousands of miles away, and it is unthinkable that the United States Congress would move to discredit their mission, cut off their reinforcements and deny them the resources they need to succeed and return home safely. 
   The American people will not support a strategy that involves pulling the rug out from under American troops in the combat zone by cutting off their reinforcements and forcing them to face an enemy without our full support. 
   This resolution is nonbinding, but it is the first step toward a tragic, unthinkable goal. 
   Four years ago, this body agreed that fighting this war was a worthy cause. There have been setbacks where Members on both sides of the aisle are rightly dissatisfied with the results. But this is war. We face a sophisticated, determined enemy who wants to annihilate our way of life.  
   We have a duty to stand and fight against those who seek to destroy America and the freedom that defines us. Our troops are committed to fighting and winning this global war. We owe them our unfailing support. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand with the marines, the soldiers, the sailors and the airmen and vote down this resolution. I urge my colleagues to think about our duty, our duty to support our troops, our duty to protect the American people, and our duty to leave for our kids and their kids a safe, free, and secure America. Our soldiers are dying around the world to protect us, upholding their duty. Do we have the courage to uphold our duty? 
   Vote ``no'' on this resolution.

   Mr. BOEHNER. I want to thank my colleague from Virginia for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution recognizes tomorrow, September 11, as a day of remembrance. We extend the profound sympathies of this body to those who lost their loved ones in New York, at the Pentagon, and in the fields of Pennsylvania. This resolution also honors the firefighters and first responders who willingly risked or gave up their lives to save others on that fateful day. We also honor the sacrifice and heroism of our Armed Forces: the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard, and the Marine Corps. Those men and women stand on the wall of freedom, and they are bravely fighting a determined enemy in the war on terror. They deserve our respect and our backing. 
   I can still remember how blue and peaceful that east coast sky was the morning of September 11, 2001, and how that peace was shattered by the attacks on our country. They say every generation of Americans has its challenge. The challenge of this generation became clear to all of us on that day. It was a day that forever changed us and the way we look at the world. 
   America was brutally attacked without mercy and without warning. We will never, ever forget those that we lost on that day. Republicans and Democrats must work together to ensure that our children and their children never have to live through another day like September 11, 2001.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, what are we doing? What in the world are we doing? The President asked for funding for our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq to meet our commitments to bring freedom to those people and to protect the American people, and here we are with a bill that has some $25 billion worth of spending over and above what the President asked for. And if that is not bad enough, we handcuff our generals and we handcuff our troops and we go about this backhanded way of trying to end the war in a backhanded way because the votes are not there to do it in a straight-up fashion. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are sent here by the American people. We have grave responsibilities to them and to our allies around the world, and I understand that there are deeply held differences over what is going on in Iraq. But all of us understand what we heard today from General Petraeus. All of us understand what we have heard over the last few months coming out of Iraq. 
   The real battle in Iraq today is not with the Iraqis. The real battle in Iraq today is with al Qaeda that has made this the central front in their war with us. And let us remember, we did not start the war with al Qaeda; they did. 
   It is al Qaeda that has made Iraq the central front in their war with us, and if we are not willing to take on al Qaeda in Iraq today, when will we? When will we stand up to radical Islam that is spreading all over the world, endangering our allies and endangering our citizens? When will we stand up and fight? We did not do it like other world leaders for some 20 years because America, like the rest of the world, looked up, looked away, and just hoped the problem would go away. It is not just going to go away. 
   People who are raised to believe that killing Americans and our allies and killing freedom and hating freedom is the answer to get to Allah is not just going to go away. And so we can look up and we can walk out, we can walk out of Iraq, just like we did in Lebanon, just like we did in Vietnam, just like we did in Somalia, and we will leave chaos in our wake. 
   Now, if dealing with al Qaeda is not enough of a reason to finish the job that we have in Iraq, what about the issue of the Iranians? The Iranians are trying to spew their hate all over the Middle East and elsewhere. You see Iranians who are bringing new devices into Baghdad to kill Americans and our allies. It is Iranians who are bringing funds and doing training to stir up sectarian violence in Baghdad. Are we just going to look the other way again? 
   I say to my colleagues, and I have said this before, every generation of Americans has had their obligation. Every generation of Americans has had their obligation to stand up and to protect our country, not for just today but for tomorrow and for the next generation. 
   After looking away for 20 years during the 1980s and 1990s, what was America to do after 3,000 of our citizens died on 9/11? Just all hope it goes away, hope they do not care anymore? 
   I say to my colleagues that we have a solemn obligation to the American people to finish the job that we started. And while Iraq may not have started out as the central front in our war with al Qaeda, it may not have started out with a fight against the Iranians, all of us in this Chamber today know, all of us know that this is the central front in our war with al Qaeda, and this is the battleground with Iran. You all know it. You know it as well as I do. 
   And the question is, are we going to stand up and fulfill our obligation to the American people? Are we going to fulfill our obligation to the Iraqis who are struggling to create a government of the people, by the people and for the people? 
   I think they are on clear notice that they have got a job to do on their own, but if we step out today, we are ensuring that they will fail. We are ensuring that we will leave chaos in our wake. We will embolden our enemies, and it is our kids and their kids who will pay a very, very steep price. 
   This is not the right thing to do, in my opinion. I respect those who have opinions that are otherwise, but as I stand here as a Member of Congress, we need to think seriously about what we are doing, think seriously about the message that we are sending to our enemies around the world and ask ourselves, is this what our forefathers would have done? Is this the message that we want to send to the world? I would suggest to all of you it is not. We should vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague for yielding, and let me thank him for his work, the majority leader Mr. Hoyer, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rangel 
   It's not often that on a major bill that with as much controversy as we've had with this bill that we can come together and work as a Congress on both sides of the aisle and come to a compromise. The gentleman from Wisconsin outlined the provisions of the bill. I might have described them a little differently than he did. But a compromise is that. It's a compromise. You know, there are 435 of us. Any one of us could write this bill in a way that fit our own interests. 
   But at the end of the day, I think there was cooperation on both sides to come to this agreement. And I believe that at the end of the day, it's a victory for our troops, it's a victory for American families, it's a victory for our veterans, and for those in need who are unemployed. 
   Now, we could get into the whole issue of Iraq. I'm glad we're there. I wish it had gone better. I wish it had gone quicker. I want our troops to come home as soon as possible. But I want our troops to come home having succeeded in Iraq. The effort, the fight that's going on in Iraq, it's not about tomorrow, it's not about next month or next year. It is about the future for our kids and theirs. 
   Our soldiers in Iraq have brought more security to that country, the political process is working better, and building a democracy in a part of the world that's never known it, there is no price. There is no price that we can put on what that may mean for the future for our kids and theirs. 
   I know it's been difficult. It's been difficult for all Americans. And it's certainly been difficult for our troops and especially for those troops that have given their lives in defense of our country. But it's a price for freedom. And I think freedom for our kids and theirs is why a lot of us are here. And so supporting our troops that are in Iraq and Afghanistan is important. 
   I could criticize the majority that this bill should have happened a long time ago. There's no reason to get into that. But I think we're doing the right thing for our troops in this bill finally. I think the expanded GI benefits in this bill, while they may not be exactly as I would write them, taking care of our veterans should be our highest priority and making sure that they have the kinds of educational benefits that will help not only them but also their families will help us retain more of our soldiers, and help give them the benefits that they and their families deserve. 
   When it comes to the unemployment benefits that are included in this bill, I think it's a reasonable provision to require 20 weeks of work, which is current law, and to extend 13 additional weeks for all 50 States. I wouldn't have done it that way. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) knows that. We had a discussion about it. But again, a compromise is a compromise. 
   I want to thank my Democrat colleagues for working with us to get to this point. And I want to thank them for this commitment that this is the bill, this is the bill that will end up on the President's desk. 
   And so I would ask all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote for this. You may not love it, but this is one of those moments when you've worked together, you've worked out a compromise, that Members need to just suck it up and vote ``yes'' because it's the right thing to do for our country.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, we just finished a vote several minutes ago on the override of the farm bill, except that the override vote occurred on a bill that had never been considered by the House or the Senate, since the bill that we voted to override apparently is missing one title of the bill--or the conference report--that passed the House and the Senate. I am concerned about the procedures, the process, and the constitutionality of what we've just done. 
   I would like to ask the majority leader if he can help myself and the other Members understand just what are we dealing with here.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Reclaiming my time, we may have transported to the President a portion of the bill that passed the House and Senate, but we did not send to the President, apparently, the farm bill conference report as passed by the House and the Senate. 
   I think what's of grave concern to me is, yes, I understand that mistakes do happen in this process, but before the consideration of the override debate and vote, we were aware of the problem. And I just think that in deference to all Members, we could have waited before consideration of the override so that all the Members would understand just what we're dealing with and the problems that are contained therein. I just think that in the rush to move this override vote, we don't know what precedents of the House we may have stepped on and what constitutional problems that we may have. I would remind my colleague that there was a very small mistake made in the Deficit Reduction Act several years ago that's been the subject of a lawsuit and privileged resolutions and moral outrage from some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, which, frankly, the Deficit Reduction Act error pales in comparison to what we have here. 
   So I would ask my colleague, I think we need to get to the bottom of what happened.     
   I don't know that the override that we just cast--we voted to override a bill that had never been considered by the House or the Senate, and I don't know how that is constitutional. 
   I would be happy to yield to my friend.

I don't know how we can proceed with the override as it occurred, nor do I think we should proceed with some attempt to fix it until such time as we all understand what happened, what are the precedents of the House, and how do we move forward. 
   As a result, I really believe that there ought to be a motion, I may make the motion, to vacate the vote that has occurred until we all understand better about what it is that we are dealing with.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I appreciate my colleague for yielding, and I'm not going to talk about the farm bill. 
   I'm a little concerned and have serious doubts about the process that we're  using to bring this bill considering that the bill that the President vetoed is not the bill that the Members are being asked to override. 
   Remember, there were 12 titles in the farm bill that we sent to the President. The bill that we have, that we're overriding, contains 11 titles. Title III of the bill is missing. 
   Now, the reason I rise is because I have got doubts about the process that we're engaged in, and I have doubts about the constitutionality of what it is that we're doing. And people were in such a hurry to bring this bill up here to the floor that no one would take the time to consider what is it that we're doing; is it constitutional, and should we proceed under the conditions we find ourselves. 
   We don't know why title III of the bill that we sent to the President is missing in the document that we're considering right now. 
   So it is not just me as a Member. I think there are other Members on both sides of the aisle that are wondering should we proceed with this and is what we're doing constitutional, is it breaking precedent with what we've done in the past. I would just ask my colleagues, and especially ask the majority, why we couldn't take some time to understand what happened in this process, why title III isn't included in the bill that we're moving to override. 
   And so until there are answers to this, I would suggest to the majority that we ought to consider suspending activity on this until such time as we know we have answers to the questions that Members on both sides are going to have.     
   I would be happy to yield to my friend.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Florida for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's my honor to join Speaker Pelosi in celebrating the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel. This is just the first opportunity for us to honor the foundation of the Jewish State leading up to its anniversary on May 14. 
   After 60 years, Israel may not be our oldest ally, but there is no doubt that it's among our most treasured. Since its establishment 6 decades ago, Israel has been a pillar of strength, integrity, freedom and, above all else, friendship.     
   They're not simply allies by chance. Our friendship has flourished over the last 60 years because we share the same values. First and foremost, we recognize that we would not exist if not for the grace and power of God. 
   Faith forms our Nation's very foundation and is reflected in everything we do. We value liberty, and recognize how precious it is in a world where it's not only rare, but often under attack. And we recognize the responsibility we have to defend our freedom. That's why we have stood beside our Israeli allies for the past six decades and why we are taking the fight to those committed to destroying the Jewish state and, for that matter, destroying us. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bonds of trust between Israel and America have never been stronger or more important than they are right now. Our Nation will stand firmly beside our Israeli friends over the next 60 years just as we've done over the last 60. And with a shared faith in God, a respect for liberty, and a commitment to its defense, our friendship will only grow deeper. 
   May God bless the Jewish State of Israel on this anniversary and all of those that will follow.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (PERMITTING DELEGATES AND THE RESIDENT COMMISSIONER TO CAST VOTES IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE -- (House of Representatives - January 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague from Washington for yielding. 
   I remind my colleagues that when the session started, as every session has started, we raise our right hands and we swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. That is our solemn obligation. 
   The Constitution outlines who has the right to vote here in the House. It clearly spells out that the Members from the States have the right to vote. Over the years as Delegates came to this House, they were granted the privilege of voting in the committee. That is not something spelled out in the Constitution. 
   I could describe what is going on here today is an outrageous grab of power by the new majority; a breach of the trust of the Members here. That is if it weren't such a silly idea. 
   To say to the Delegates that you can vote as long as it doesn't count, but if your vote counts, we are going to revote it, I think that diminishes the stature of the House, diminishes the stature of the Delegates, quite frankly, to say that they have a vote, but only if it doesn't count, because if it counts, there is an automatic revote under this rule that is outlined today. 
   I think it does demean the House. I think it undermines our responsibility to the American people. And I think that this should not be on the floor today. 
   The process by which this bill came to the floor, no committee hearings, a short Rules Committee hearing. We heard earlier today about the problems with the rule and how it was crafted. And here we are having this debate once again. 
   I was here in 1993 when this issue was brought to the House the first time. The debate was probably more rancorous then than it is today. 
   But it saddens me that there was no discussion about this with the minority. There was no advance notice of it until last Friday when the majority leader outlined the schedule for this week. So here we are, no opportunity to have a real conversation between the majority and the minority party about doing this. 
   Over the course of the last 3 weeks, and actually before that, going into December, I have done everything I can to reach out to the Speaker and the majority leader to try to work here in this House in a bipartisan way on the issues the American people care about. And it seems, though, over the last 3 weeks that more we reach out and offer our hand of bipartisanship, it is slapped away. 
   It happened last night up in the Rules Committee on the rule that brought this to the floor, and I am saddened by it. We have an opportunity to work together. We have an opportunity to do what the American people expect of us. But if we are going to do it together, we need to live up to our promises, and we need to live up to our commitments. 
   I don't think that what we are doing on the floor today helps that process at all. And so while it would be easy for me to describe this as a power grab, I could if I thought this meant something, but it means nothing. This is symbolism at its best. And in the process of creating symbolism for a few, I think we diminish our roles as serious legislators here on behalf of the American people.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (RESTORE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, in August the Congress passed the Protect America Act. Before that bill passed, our intelligence officials did not have the tools they needed to protect our troops and to detect and prevent terrorist plots. This was made clear in a story we read about just last month about our, how our FISA laws failed our soldiers who were kidnapped in Iraq, and I think these outdated laws actually hampered their rescue. That is because our FISA laws in place before the Protect America Act entrusted government lawyers, not our intelligence professionals, to protect our troops and our security. 
   Yet the bill we are considering today only makes this problem worse. It reopens the terrorist loophole and doesn't ensure that we can act quickly on vital intelligence to protect our troops and the American people. I think it would be a boon to trial lawyers who could take actions against third parties who assisted our government at our request after 9/11. It is yet another example of a troubling pattern of behavior on the part the majority, a pattern of behavior that is undermining our national security. Let me just give you a few examples. 
   The majority want to extend habeas corpus rights to terrorists. The majority has had over 40 votes in the Congress trying to force retreat in Iraq. The majority wants to close down our Guantanamo detention facility and move those terrorists into American communities. The majority, in their intelligence authorization bill and appropriation bill, are diverting key intelligence resources away from terrorist surveillance to study global warming. 
   In August, all the Members of this House succeeded in modernizing FISA and closing the terrorist loophole. We did so because terrorists were plotting to kill Americans and our allies, and there is no nice way of saying that. So why on Earth would we tie the hands of our intelligence officials again and open up this loophole that allows terrorists to jeopardize the safety of our troops and jeopardize the safety and security of the American people? 
   Our country is safer today because of our efforts, and Republicans want to work with Democrats to make the Protect America Act permanent. We were very close to a bipartisan agreement on this bill just about 5 weeks ago, very close. As a matter of fact, there was an agreement in principle until the ACLU got ahold of it and blew the entire bipartisan process up. I think the American people want us to do everything we can to make sure that they are safe and secure. The bill that we have before us will once again tie the hands of our intelligence officials and make America less safe. This is not the bill that I want to vote for.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and thank him and the chairman of the committee and the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member of the Trade Subcommittee for their work on this Peru trade bill and the other trade bills that I hope that we will see on the floor soon. 
   When you look at America's economy today, I think we have to recognize that 95 percent of the consumers in the world live outside of the United States.     
   And as the U.S. economy, and certainly in certain sectors, is softening, the one area where our economy is doing very well are on our exports around the world. 
   And if you look at what's happened in some recent trade agreements, let's point out the facts. In Jordan, since 2001, our exports have risen some 92 percent. If you look at Chile, a trade agreement that was passed, but since 2004, we've had a 151 percent increase in our exports to Chile. Australia, since 2005, we've had a 25 percent increase in our exports. 
   If I look at my home State of Ohio, Ohio's export shipments in 2006 were $37.8 billion, up 36 percent, up 36 percent since 2002, thanks in part to many of the trade agreements that have been signed. And what this means, in terms of these increased exports, to consumers around the world are more jobs here in the United States. 
   In my own part of Ohio, Proctor and Gamble is a major employer. Right near my home are a number of their research and development facilities which have continued to expand employment, doing basic research, doing product research, doing marketing and doing sales efforts that support their sales and their development of new products all around the world, which means new jobs for people who live in my part of Ohio. 
   I understand that there's displacement in our economy; and we ought to be doing everything we can to retrain and train workers for the new economy. But that's going to happen regardless of whether we pass this. 
   When you look at this Peru Trade Agreement, in particular, we have, or they have open access to our market today. What this trade agreement does is allow us freer access to their economy, increasing our exports to Peru and to the rest of South America. 
   I'm a big believer that trade has benefited our country in a very significant way. And when you look at the fact that two out of five jobs in America, two out of five jobs are dependent on our ability to export products and services elsewhere in the world, you can begin to understand why opening markets for our companies around the world is so critically important to America's future. 
   So I want to congratulate my colleagues for their work on this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker, I express my disappointment in having to oppose the gentleman's bill. 
   I know Members on both sides of the aisle have worked hard over the last few years, including efforts on my own behalf when I was chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, to help make college more affordable for more of America's students. 
   Most of us wouldn't be here had it not been for a chance at a decent education and a college education to allow us the opportunity to be all that we can be here in America. 
   I think all of us agree that we want these opportunities for all students.  That's why 18 months ago, when we passed the Deficit Reduction Act, we fundamentally reformed the college loan system and saved some $16 billion. 
   In that same bill we offered benefits for students, low-income students who would enter into an agreement to study math and science at 4-year institutions. I thought this was a sound bill, and we made sound efforts. 
   When I look at the bill before us, there are a number of concerns that I have. First is that the cuts to the private sector loan program that are involved in this bill, I think, will cripple the private sector loan program. 
   When you look at what the private sector has brought to students and their parents across the country, they have brought a lot of innovation. They have brought new ideas, new techniques to help more students and their families be able to afford a college education. 
   To cripple that, in my view, is an effort to drive more of those families and students to the direct loan program, this government-run program that, in my view, is misguided. I didn't support it, as my friend from California well knows, didn't support it when it happened some 16 years ago. 
   As we look at the direct loan program, it looked like a government-run program, with very few benefits for students and, clearly, not very cost-effective as well. That's my first concern. 
   My second concern is that we all around here, over the 17 years that I have been here, pledged fiscal responsibility. We have got to be careful about how we spend the taxpayers' funds. 
   When we look at the bill before us, we create five new entitlement programs. These are the programs that get put on automatic pilot. While they may be paid for here in the first 4 or 5 years, some of the provisions in this bill will cost 10 to $20 billion over the next 10 years that's not paid for. That's according to the CBO. 
   While we pledge fiscal responsibility, at the end of the day, we have to stand up and do it. You know, the American people send us here to make decisions on their behalf, and fiscal decisions on their behalf. 
   We ought to make those real decisions. But when you look at the real long-term cost of this program, I think it's not paid for, it's fiscally irresponsible. At a time when we are trying to balance the Federal budget, this is a step in the wrong direction. 
   I applaud my colleague from California, the chairman of the committee and my friend. We have worked together for a long time on these issues. I applaud him for his tenacity in putting this bill together. 
   There is no surprise to him nor me that we would disagree about the benefits of this bill. He sees his glass as half full; I see it as half empty. I really see it empty when it comes to the issue of being fiscally responsible and standing up to do the right things that the American people sent us here to do. 
   I would ask my colleagues, these are the hard decisions, well-meaning bill, well meaning, well intentioned, but, long term, I think it's a real mistake for students and taxpayers here in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding, and let me thank him for bringing this amendment to the floor. 
   All this amendment says is that we are going to reduce the level of spending in this bill to last year's level. It's overdoing. We are not whacking away  at everything, and I think that the gentleman has a very good point. I do that because excessive spending makes it more difficult for us to balance the Federal budget.     
   It takes money away from our children and our grandchildren. An across-the-board cut is another way of being fair and simple, but it gets us back to last year's level. 
   Now, the spending in these appropriations bills is one issue. But let's make sure we review the bidding on what's happened here thus far this year. In February, when the supplemental spending bill came through, the CR to fund the government for this year came through here, it had $6 billion of spending over and above the President's level. 
   And then we had the budget come through with an additional $20 billion worth of domestic discretionary spending included in it. 
   And then just last month we had the supplemental spending bill for Iraq and Katrina that had an additional $17 billion over and above what the President has asked for. 
   If you look at all of that, $1.1 billion in the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill that's already passed, another $1.9 billion in this bill, you begin to add all this up, and it's real money. And at some point, somebody has to pay for it. And that's the real crux of the issue here. 
   Most of us came here to make sure that we had a government that was affordable, so that we could keep the American Dream alive for our kids and theirs. And the more that we spend and the more that we mortgage their future, the harder it is for them to have the same chances in life that many of us have had. 
   And if the spending that we've talked about isn't bad enough, if you look at the budget that my friends across the aisle passed last spring, there's no entitlement reform. My colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, will soon rise and talk about the $4 billion or $4 trillion worth of debt that's accumulated over the last 6 years. 
   We know that we have to deal with entitlements. I'm trying to help you give your speech, Mr. Obey. We have to deal with entitlements. Over the course of the 12 years that Republicans ran the House, we dealt with entitlements some three times, not as often as we should have, not as aggressively as we should have. 
   But we have made promises to ourselves, those of us who are baby boomers, promises that our kids and our grandkids can't afford. And at some point we, as responsible stewards of our government, need to grab a hold of these entitlements and begin to change them. 
   Several years ago we made a modest effort, some $40 billion in entitlement reductions over 5 years, a step in the right direction. But to bring a budget out here that says we're not going to deal with entitlements for the next 5 years, I think, is totally irresponsible. And so if we're serious about making sure that our kids and their kids have a real chance at the American Dream, we've got to say no. 
   The American people sent us here to make decisions about how to best spend their money. And if we just keep adding more money, guess what? We never have to make a decision. That's not what the American people expect of us. They expect of us to have a government that's affordable, that's accountable, and something that they can afford in their family budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from Wisconsin for yielding and congratulate him and the Republican members of the Budget Committee for a job well done in putting this budget together. 
   I also want to thank our colleague from South Carolina, Mr. Spratt, the chairman of the committee for their budget. Although I'll be critical of it, still, the gentleman did his work, and the House is considering the budget at the time of the year the House should be considering its budget, in March, and in early March, which has not always happened. 
   When we think about our budgets, it's not as complicated as people think. It's about revenue coming into the Federal Government and revenue going out of the Federal Government to provide benefits for the American people. And it's not just about numbers for this year. It's about numbers for next year and over the next 5 or 10 years that we need to look at so that there is a balance between revenues and expenses. 
   Clearly, over the last 40 years, there's been a big imbalance between what goes out and what comes in. And the fact is that in 36 of those 40 years, the Federal Government has run a deficit, at least 36. I think 36 of the 40 years we've run a deficit. We balanced the budget in the late 1990s when Republicans controlled the Congress by holding the line on spending while revenues to the Federal Government were growing in a healthy economy, held the line on spending at or near the rate of inflation, and revenues surpassed expenses for the first time in some almost 30 years. 
   But here we are again, back in a situation where we're spending more than what's coming in, mostly as a result of the attacks of 9/11, the aftershocks to our economy. But if you look at the revenue over the last 5 years, revenues have grown at 11 percent annually in each of the last 4 years, going back through 2006. And even in 2007, revenues to the Federal Government grew, estimated to grow at about 8 to 9 percent. And so revenue growth to the Federal Government, I think, has been healthy since we reduced taxes on capital gains and dividends, per child tax credit, and relief for the marriage penalty back in 2001 and 2003.     
   And so you can see that reducing tax rates doesn't mean less revenue to the Federal Government. Matter of fact, you can look back over the last 27 years, other than a couple of small exceptions, there has been a significant effort to lower tax rates, income tax rates, capital gain tax rates; and as a result, there has been more economic activity in our country, more people employed in our country, and more people paying taxes. 
   And so if you look at the marginal tax rates today as compared to 1980, you see that those tax rates are significantly lower. Yet the Federal revenue, the taxes that American families pay, continues to come into Washington at very high levels of growth on an annual basis 
   I would argue that making the capital gains tax rate permanent, making the rate on dividends permanent, would give more people reasons to invest in America's economy allowing those rates of growth in revenue to the Federal Government to continue. 
   And so Washington doesn't have a revenue problem. Washington has a spending problem. And when you look at the Washington spending problems, it really rolls down to several things: one is controlling the growth of domestic discretionary spending. I think, by and large, if you look at the budgets that we've seen over the last 15 years, we've done a fairly good job of controlling domestic discretionary programs and the spending that goes there. There are some exceptions, and there is certainly some room to eliminate some of what I would call wasteful Washington spending. But if you look at the increases, most of it has gone into the area of defense. 
   The real problem that we have is that we continue to have an older America. The number of Americans over 65 continues to grow and will grow significantly as I and other baby boomers begin to retire. 
   And so when you look at the problem today in terms of the spending problem, it is in the entitlement area. And the underlying budget that the majority has put forward does nothing to reform entitlement spending. I came here in 1990 because I thought that programs like Social Security and Medicare were unsustainable unless Congress was willing to act to protect those programs. 
   And here we are in my 18th year. We've nibbled around the edges of a couple of these programs, but have never really done anything that would make these programs sustainable for tomorrow and for succeeding generations. As I have said hundreds of times on this floor, our generation has made promises to ourselves that our kids and grandkids can't afford. 
   So if you look at the budget being presented by myself and our Republican colleagues, we assume that the capital gains rate of 15 percent will be made permanent. We assume that the rate on dividends at 15 percent is made permanent and the per-child tax credit is put in permanent law as is the marriage penalty, the tax cuts that were put in place on a temporary basis in 2001 and 2003. 
   So our budget balances over the next 5 years, and it balances because we go in and actually do something about the spending side of the equation. 
   Now, if you look at the Democrat budget, they assume that the 15 percent capital gains rate goes back to 20 percent. They assume that the 15 percent rate on dividends goes to whatever the marginal tax rate for that taxpayer would be, probably an average tax rate of about 30 percent on dividends, or double that tax, that the marriage penalty comes back in for all Americans and that the $1,000 per-child tax credit goes away. 
   And I forgot one, of all things: the death tax that we want to see go away completely in 2010. The death tax, under the Democrat proposal, comes back in full force putting the Federal Government back into a competition with the heirs over the balance that we have in people's estates. 
   But the real issue in the Democrat budget is spending. If you look at the chart I'm holding here, the Democrat budget assumes all of these tax cuts go away. So you have a $683 billion tax increase in their budget, the largest one in American history; and they have it in because if you look at their spending levels, they do nothing about reforming entitlement programs or putting a lid on the growth of domestic discretionary spending. 
   So I think that the budget that the Republicans are putting forward here is a responsible budget, and I think, frankly, a majority of the American people would agree with me. We ought to keep tax rates low. We ought to encourage economic activity and more economic growth in America that would provide more opportunity for more jobs and better paying jobs in America, and to get the balance, do something constructive about Social Security and Medicare, especially, to modify those programs so that we can save them for future generations. 
   At some point, we are going to have to ante up to the piper, and the sooner we begin to address the long-term problems in Social Security and Medicare, the better off we will be. 
   So I would encourage my colleagues to look closely at the budget put together by Mr. Ryan and his Republican colleagues on the Budget Committee, and I ask all of our Members to consider supporting it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (THE AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Well, Mr. Speaker, let me say ``welcome'' to my Democrat colleagues. ``Welcome back to the House.'' You all left here without a vote on the American Energy Act, and as I look at this week's schedule, it looks like we're going to take another week of vacation because there is not much on the schedule. 
   While you all were out, I and my Republican colleagues were here each and every day with the lights dimmed, with the microphones off, with no one in the chair, and with the cameras off. We were talking to the visitors who were coming through the Capitol about our plan to produce all of the above. 
   You know, the American people are tired of high gas prices. Small businesses are having a difficult time with high energy prices. We've got school districts around America that are trying to figure out how they're going to operate their buses this fall with the prices of gasoline and of diesel where they are. Yet Congress has failed to act. What we've been proposing for the last 3 months is the buildup of do all of the above. We need to have more conservation in America, and we need to have the incentives to produce more conservation. We need renewables. 
   To my colleague from Washington who was just here, I'm in full support of all of these renewables, but many of them are not going to be ready next year or the year after or, for that matter, some of them not for 10 or 20 years. 
   So, in the meantime, we've got to find a way to produce more energy now, and that means using coal in a clean way whether it's coal to gas or coal to liquid. We can use coal, and we're the Saudi Arabia of the world when it comes to coal, and there is no reason for us not to use it in an environmentally sensitive way. We also need nuclear energy, the cleanest form of energy. Today, it's a 15-year process to get a nuclear permit and to go through all of the steps. It costs billions of dollars, and maybe at the end of 15 years you will get a permit to actually operate. 
   Even if we do all of that, we've not done all we can do to maximize our energy security and to maximize the amount of energy we can produce to take a big step toward energy independence. That's why producing more American-made oil and gas in an environmentally sensitive way has to be part of this bill. 
   Now, this bill has been out there. It does all of the above, and I think the American people are demanding that we do all of the above, but the Speaker, before she became the Speaker, promised this would be the most open and accountable Congress in history. In that light, I respectfully ask the Speaker: When will you give the American people a vote on the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566), our plan to do all of the above? Will it be on the floor this week? 
   There are rumors floating around that we could have an energy bill this  week. Nobody has seen one yet. It hasn't been scheduled, but these rumors are out there. If we're going to have a vote on a little bit of the above or on some of the above that the majority might produce, why not give a large group of Members in this House who want to do all of the above just a chance to have a debate and to vote on our competing proposal? 
   That's what we're looking for. We want a fair and open debate. We want a chance to have a vote. Anything less than that, frankly, is unacceptable, and the Republicans in this House will continue to force the Democrat majority to allow a vote on doing all of the above because it is what the American people want. It is what they sent us here to do, and we are not going to leave until it gets done.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2419, FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I have been around the House Agriculture Committee for nearly 18 years. The chairman and I came together. We are good friends, and so is the ranking Republican, Mr. Goodlatte. And I know they have worked hard to produce this bill. 
   But clearly, most Americans think that Washington is broken. And this farm bill frankly is another example of that. I know there is some reform in this bill. But when you begin to step back and look at the bill, we didn't get anywhere near the reform that I think most Americans would expect. 
   At a time when we have got the highest commodity prices that we have seen in a generation, you would think that we would take a slightly different approach to the farm bill. But unfortunately, because of the process, because of the negotiations, it didn't happen. I just want to point out what I would describe as the most egregious part of this. 
   I, or one of my designees, will have a motion to recommit this conference report. And it is no secret that politicians have traditionally used and abused the farm bill for their own pet projects. There are three pet projects in this bill that I am going to single out in my motion to recommit. 
   One, it would strip out the ``Trail to Nowhere,'' a land swap that was airdropped into the bill by the senior Senator from Vermont. The language would require the U.S. Forest Service to sell portions of the Green Mountain National Forest exclusively to Vermont's Bromley Ski Resort. And believe it or not, to accommodate this obscure demand, portions of the Appalachian National Scenic Trail may  have to be moved. They are actually going to move the Appalachian Scenic Trail, possibly have to move it, because we are going to sell this land to a ski resort. I don't think the taxpayers ought to have to bankroll this boondoggle. 
   Secondly, our motion will strip out a $170 million earmark for the salmon industry that was airdropped into this bill in secret. The provision was never considered in the House. It was never considered in the Senate. One hundred seventy million dollars to bail out salmon fisheries. Now you should also note that after Hurricane Katrina, when the entire gulf coast fishing industry was annihilated, they actually only got $126 million from the Federal Government to fix their fisheries. I don't think taxpayers ought to be required to put up the money for an airdropped earmark that was brought into this bill never having been considered in either body. 
   Finally, our proposal would strip out a $250 million earmark secured by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, the gentleman from Montana. This earmark, incredibly enough, is targeted for forests to house fish. Yes. We are going to target a forest that houses fish, incredibly, what we would call ``forest fish.'' Only one forest in the country happens to have fish in it. And it just happens to be based in Montana, located in Montana where the Senator is from. I don't think the taxpayers ought to have to pay $250 million to take care of forest fish. 
   Listen, the American people are struggling with the high cost of living, whether it is the cost of gasoline, the cost of food, trying to make sure that they have got health care, concerned about whether they have a job tomorrow or will be able to afford their home mortgage. And here we are moving a farm bill that has earmarks in it that just don't pass the straight-face test. 
   And so I would ask my colleagues, if you think that this is a wise use of taxpayer funds, you can go ahead and vote against this motion to recommit. But I would invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if you think that taxpayer funds could be spent more wisely, vote for the motion to recommit, and let's make this bill a better bill. We can do better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, welcome back to Washington. Most of us were home in our districts over the August district work period and heard from our constituents and heard from many others. 
   Clearly, as we get into the fall, there are a lot of very important issues that Congress is going to deal with. On the issue of what happens to Iraq, I would hope my colleagues would wait and listen to what General Petraeus and Admiral Crocker would have to say before we make up our minds and outline our strategy for where we are going to go. 
   Secondly, the issue of spending and taxes is clearly going to be coming up in October, and I would urge all of my colleagues to take a real serious look at just how much of the American taxpayer's wallet we are willing to get into and how much we really need to spend. 
   There are a host of other issues that we are going to deal with this fall, and I would have one more request of all of my colleagues: let's listen to what the American people had to say over the August recess. Let's find a way to reach our hands across the aisle and work in an honest way together to deal with what the American people expect of us, and that is to deal with the issues that face our country and to do it in a bipartisan way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and say, thank goodness that we're finally here. 
   Mr. Speaker, over 100 days trying to come to an agreement on how to do the right thing for our men and women in the military fighting for our freedom and our safety and our security right here at home. I ask myself, why? What have we done over the last 100-plus days, and why has it taken this long? And there is one image that keeps coming back to me, and it's from my friend, the chairman of the committee, and it is his favorite saying: There are a lot of Members who have been posing for holy pictures over the last 100-plus days. The gentleman knows exactly what I'm talking about. 
   Put yourself in the shoes of our men and women fighting in Iraq, fighting in Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. And think about the message that we have sent them over the last 100-plus days. We sent them there to do a job. We sent them there on a mission. And yet, for the last three and a half months we had a debate going on here that has undermined their efforts, lowered their morale and clearly sent the wrong message to our allies and to our enemies. But thank goodness that we're finally here. 
   We have no artificial deadlines. We have no surrender dates. We have no shackles on the generals and our troops on the ground. We are going to give our generals and our troops what they need to win in Iraq. And winning in Iraq is important for our country. I don't believe that there is a Member in this Chamber who doesn't understand that winning in Iraq is important to our country. It has been difficult; mistakes have been made. But think about why we went to Iraq. We went to Iraq to get rid of a brutal dictator who was a threat to his own population and to all of his neighbors. We succeeded. 
   We went to Iraq to eliminate weapons of mass destruction. Of course they were shipped somewhere else. But we know that they were used against their own Iraqi people. But they are not there. We went there to help install a government to build a basic democracy in a part of the world that has never known it. We are in the midst of it, and we are succeeding. 
   It is al Qaeda, the sworn enemy of the United States, who wants to kill us, who made Iraq the central front in their war with us. If we don't take on al Qaeda in Iraq and defeat them, where will we draw the line? Will we draw the line when they go into Saudi Arabia? Will we draw the line when they try to decimate Israel? Or are we going to wait and draw the line when we are fighting the terrorists here in America? 
   Think once again about those young men and women in our military out there doing their duty for us. We, the Congress of the United States, authorized the President to go to Iraq and to do what I've just outlined. We sent them there. And this last 100 days, we've questioned whether in fact we really should have done it. I think it is far too late. They are there. They are on the ground. They deserve our support. And, finally, tonight they are going to get the resources they need to try to win the battle in Iraq. 
   Now let me just say something about the rest of this bill, the second part of this bill that has some $20 billion worth of additional spending, probably some $8 or $9 billion of nonmilitary, nonveteran spending that does not belong in this bill. It may be well-meaning. It may be well-intentioned, but it doesn't deserve to be put on the backs of our men and women in the military serving our country. It deserves to be done in a regular order. 
   When it comes to that part of the bill, I am going to have to vote ``no.'' To load this bill up with not only all the additional spending, but we've got a half a dozen pension issues. We've got a minimum wage issue. We've got a whole host of other issues that don't deserve to be put on the backs of our men and women in the military. It is a sneaky way to do business. I wish it was not in there. And on that portion of the bill, I will vote ``no'' tonight. 
   But I am glad that we're here. I know that there are differences in this Chamber, Members on both sides of the aisle who feel differently about our mission in Iraq and our chances of success there. I know when I came here and every 2 years since I've been here, on the opening day, we all stand here; we raise our right hands and swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. There are a lot of my colleagues that have heard me make the statement that I didn't come here to be a Congressman. I came here to do something. And I think at the top of our list is providing for the safety and security of the American people. That's at the top of our list. After 3,000 of our fellow citizens died at the hands of these terrorists, when are we going to stand up and take them on? When are we going to defeat them? 
   Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you, if we don't do it now, and if we don't have the courage to defeat this enemy, we will long, long regret it. So, thank you for the commitment to get the job done today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, let me thank my colleague for yielding, and I rise today to support the gentleman's amendment. 
   The bill before us spends some $10 billion more than the President requested, $7 billion more than what this bill spent last year. And what the gentleman seeks to do is reduce the overall amount of spending in this bill to the level we spent last year. 
   Now, our job as Members of Congress is to make decisions, decisions about spending, and when we keep increasing spending and increasing spending, guess what? There's no reason to make a decision. We don't have to make the tough choices because we just keep spending more. 
   Now, this bill is some $7 billion more than we spent last year. This will be on top of the bills that we've already spent this year, spending some 10 to $12 billion more than the President asked for and above last year's levels. 
   On top of that, there's $6 billion of additional spending that was in the continuing resolution in February; $17 billion more in the supplemental spending bill for Iraq and Katrina, over and above what was needed in those theaters. And the appropriation process is not finished yet. 
   What's happening here is we're continuing to spend more. We've got the largest tax increase in American history coming, and I thought we were here to ensure that our kids and their kids had a better chance in life than what we had. I mean, every generation of Americans has been proud of the fact that they left the country and left opportunities for our children and their children that were better than what we had. And I think it's our obligation to make sure that our kids have a better chance at the American Dream than what we had. 
   But we're not doing that. We're mortgaging our children's future by continuing to raise taxes and increase spending. We've done it all year, and we're not even to the end of the year yet. Now we're only in July and we've got numbers that will add up to close to $100 billion of additional spending. How much is enough? How much is enough? 
   I think that the gentleman's amendment is a good amendment, just to bring the spending level in this bill down to last year's level, and let's make the tough choices that the American people sent us here to make.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, in January, when this Congress began, there were promises of the most open and ethical Congress in the history of our country. Over the last several weeks, I have been up on numerous occasions talking about the problems of how I believe the minority had been treated, only asking for fairness. 
   What happened last night not only disenfranchised minority Members, it disenfranchised Members of the majority party as well who had an interest in voting for that measure. I regret what happened last night. I think that it is very unfortunate. But it has been a pattern of activity that has gone on all year. 
   I think my colleagues on the majority side understand what I am saying. There were promises made, there were commitments made; and not only has none of it happened, but some of the actions taken by the majority over the last 7 months were actions that had never even been contemplated during the 12 years of Republican rule. 
   Now, I understand there were times when Republicans did things that were heavy-handed, and, in fact, I can understand why the minority was aggrieved at the time. But when you think about the opening several weeks, when we had one rule covering six bills, no amendments, one motion to recommit for six bills, things that we would have never even dreamt of doing have happened. But it has been time after time after time. 
   When we look at the activities of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, how there were no hearings, the size of the bill and then the conditions under which it was going to be brought to the floor, I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back. At least, I thought it was the straw that broke the camel's back, until last night. 
   The resolution that we are debating takes this issue and sends it to the Ethics Committee. As we all know, that is the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct that is referred to. Now, that, to me, does not appear, on the surface, to be the right place to send this issue. We all know about the problems of the Ethics Committee. Sending it to the Ethics Committee is sending it into what most people would describe as a ``black hole.'' 
   Back in January, I suggested in a private meeting with the Speaker that I wanted the Ethics Committee to work, and the only way it was going to work was that if she and I locked arms and told our Members and told the American people that we are going to ensure that the Ethics Committee work. 
   That hasn't happened. The fact is, the productivity, I don't know whether  there is productivity or lack of productivity in the Ethics Committee, because we have not seen anything out of the Ethics Committee thus far this year. 
   I would suggest to the gentleman that if you are serious about getting to the bottom of what happened and serious about preserving the integrity of the House and ensuring that there is no disenfranchisement of Members on either side of the aisle, that a conversation between the two of us, or the two leaderships, might be a better course of action for the entire House. 
   I have a privileged resolution that I have drawn up that would set up a select committee of Members to deal with only this issue. It may be, I think, a wiser course of action. I would be happy to discuss this with the gentleman. 
   I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that what happened last night happened last night, and that if we could have a commitment of getting to the bottom of what happened last night, that we ought to proceed with the business that the American people sent us here to deal with. 
   Now, I know that there are those on my side of the aisle, and probably some on the other side of the aisle, who would rather fight all day. But at the end of the day, our responsibility is to the American people. This is the people's House. 
   I accept the regrets offered by my friend from New York. Having been in the chair myself, I understand how it can happen. He and I are friends. In fact, he is one of the fairest Members who could ever be in the chair. But we need to have some understanding early today, if in fact we are going to proceed today in an orderly fashion, that we are going to do it in a way that dignifies this institution and dignifies our responsibility to the American people to do their work. 
   So I would ask my friend if he would consider withdrawing the resolution that he has on the floor, allow us an opportunity to sit down and discuss this, and see if we can't come to some mutually agreeable way to proceed on the issue of what happened and how we preserve the integrity of the House and the rights of all Members.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think the resolution that I offer outlines pretty clearly the promises that have been made and the promises I believe that have been broken over the course of the last 7 months. What we seek here is to understand exactly what did happen last night and to what extent changes in the rules need to be made to ensure that all Members are treated fairly. 
   As was stated in the resolution, myself and my colleagues in the minority believe that, in fact, we won the motion to recommit last night. We asked to bring this resolution that a select committee do, in fact, be impaneled, three Members from each side of the aisle to understand clearly what happened, but also to understand whether there are any changes in the rules that need to be made in order to ensure that all Members are treated fairly. 
   I and others have begun to believe that there's been a pattern of abuse that has occurred over the last several months. In many of these occurrences it appears the Chair is operating on their own, with little regard to the recommendations of the Parliamentarian. The Parliamentarians are here to preserve the precedents of the House and to ensure that all Members are treated fairly. 
   And as we watched the tape from last night, we watched from activities earlier this week, watched activities, frankly, earlier today that a pattern of activity continues to occur, and I believe that it's important for this select committee that, if it is created, to not only understand what happened last night, but to understand clearly are there any other changes that need to be made to ensure that all Members' voices are, in fact, heard. 
   We outline a select committee, we outline a timing for an interim report, but it's something that I believe would be in the best interests of the House, and I would urge my colleagues to support the resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Last night, when the gentleman from New York was in the chair and beginning to call the question and the electronic board moved to 215-213, my observation of the well of the House is that there was no one in the well of the House attempting to vote at that moment. It's why my colleagues and I, many of us, believed that we won. I think it's fair to say, many of my colleagues and I feel as though the vote was taken from us. 
   I understand the disagreement, and I appreciate the gentleman coming to an agreement on this Select Committee to get to the bottom of it. 
   But this morning's conversation was, well, we will talk about it. I am sorry, we could be talking about it for months. 
   I wanted to bring this resolution to the floor tonight so that there could be real action on this issue. We don't want to sit around here for months and months and talk about it and never come to some agreement and it's all over and done with. I think our Members want to get to the bottom of it as quickly as possible, and I am glad that the gentleman has agreed with us. 
   If the gentleman would like to work out some resolution dividing the question on the resolution before us, I would be happy to do it. Because at the end of the day, what we want is we want to get to the bottom of what happened and are there any necessary changes that need to be made in order to protect the rights of all Members. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield to the minority whip, Mr. Blunt.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for yielding, and  make it clear that when there was a suggestion made about changing the date from the bill that had been introduced on its way to the floor, I, and my staff, believed that it was not in the best interest of the House to change this bill in the hour before it was to come to the floor. And I appreciate my colleague from Maryland, the majority leader's working with us to put the date back to where it was with the introduced bill. 
   But having said that, I talked last week on the floor about my concern about how the House was proceeding. I understand the Six for '06 and the need to move the Six for '06 agenda right out of the gate. But as I said on the floor last week, I would hope that we would get back to regular order. 
   Now, we are not on bill number six or bill number seven or, for that matter, bill number eight. I think we are on bill number nine. And as I reiterated on the floor last week, when we took the majority in 1995, there were many of my colleagues on our side of the aisle that said that we ought to treat the other side of the aisle the way they treated us. I stood my ground for months and months and months suggesting to my colleagues that, no, we should treat the minority, the then minority, the way we asked to be treated. And I think the real concern here is that what we have seen today on the floor over this bill is exactly the point we have been trying to make about going back to regular order. 
   The committee process in this House does work, and I think the gentleman from Maryland clearly understands that, because Members on both sides of the aisle can pinpoint flaws and problems and correct those. And then there is a Rules Committee that has hearings. There is an opportunity for Members to offer amendments, hopefully, to be made in order so that the House can work its will. 
   And so I would ask my colleague from Maryland, the majority leader, to just treat us the way you have been asked to be treated. My colleagues on this side of the aisle want to participate. We want to work with the majority in the best interest of the American people, and we can do that together. But the only way to do that is to go through regular order. And I think the gentleman from Maryland understands, and I thank him for his time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (RECEPTION OF FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Good morning to all of you and welcome back for the 37th annual Former Members Day. I look around the audience and see a lot of familiar faces. I just want to say thank you. Thank you for your service to the institution and thank you for what you are continuing to do. 
   I presume that some of you know, but of your colleagues, Bob Walker's, wife passed away several days ago. Our prayers are with Bob and his family. Bob and I served together. His wife was a great influence on him and on his career, and it's sad to see her go over a fight with cancer that had gone on since last summer. 
   I had to come today, one, to see all of you, but to see my good friend Bob Dole. Bob and I got to know each other in 1994, when I was this bomb-throwing new Member, relatively new Member--Sarpalius remembers--and then in 1995 after Republicans took the majority, Bob and I sat in many bicameral leadership meetings together. And for some young whippersnapper who didn't know the ways around here, not that I always agreed with Senator Dole, but I always had great respect for him. Especially now, looking back those 12, 13 years ago, I realize how much I learned from Bob. I think Bob represents all that we would expect of ourselves in his demeanor, the way he did his business here. He represents an entire generation of Americans, the World War II generation, and I couldn't miss this opportunity to come and say hello to him. 
   Now, all of you know that Bob would tend to sit on his porch and work on his tan. Then he would run off to Florida on the weekends and work on his tan. And one night when we could still fly airplanes, private airplanes out of National, I ran into Bob one day as we were going somewhere, he was coming back, and he looked over at me and says, ``Hey, tan man.'' And so this has been a running joke between the two of us, because if there was somebody who always had a better tan than I did, it was Dole. 
   I could tell other stories, Bob, but I think I'll stop there. Let me just say welcome. Welcome back to all of you. Thank you for what you did for this institution to keep it alive and healthy for our generation. I just hope that those of us who have some guiding hand in where this institution is going today can do as good a job as all of you have in terms of leaving the institution in a stronger way for the next generation of leaders. Thank you and welcome.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, 94 days ago, the President of the United States sent to the Congress an emergency supplemental spending request to fund our activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. He asked for, in round numbers, $100 billion, which has now turned into some $20 to $23 billion more than that. But we have been through that fight. The President vetoed the bill, made it clear what he would sign and what he would not sign. 
   I was at the White House last week after the bill had been vetoed by the President, and there was an agreement in the room, bipartisan, bicameral agreement in the room that we would sit down together and try to resolve the differences that we have over funding our effort to take on al Qaeda and other terrorists in Iraq and in Afghanistan. 
   What we have seen over the last 10 days or so have been token meetings. There has been no honest attempt to work together, as we all committed to. There have been no meetings where we can actually sit down and discuss our differences and try to bring some resolution to those differences. 
   So when I heard earlier this week about this plan that was going to be brought to the floor today, I thought to myself, why? Why do we have to play more political games? The President of the United States has made it clear that he will veto this bill. The Senate leaders, Democrat and Republican, have made it clear that this plan has no chance in the other Chamber, but yet here we are playing political games while our troops are fighting for our freedom and our safety in Iraq. 
   Now, I am not going to go through all the reasons why Iraq is important; I have been through them before. I think every Member of this Chamber understands that Iraq is important to the safety and security of the United States. But I want to remind all of my colleagues that all of our Members in this Chamber, except one, all of our Members in this Chamber, Democrat and Republican, except one, voted to send our troops to Iraq. There they  have been locked in a battle for the safety and security of Americans, helping to try to build democracy to bring more stability to the Middle East. And here we are tonight divided, once again, about whether we should support our troops that are out there fighting for our safety. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, our soldiers are doing their duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world, a duty that we have sent them on. And yet we sit here playing political games. That is not what the American people sent us here to do. Now they asked us to come here, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences and to make sure that we are helping our troops. And I think every Member here understands that we have to support our troops. And I think every Member here knows that, at the end of the day, we are going to pass a clean supplemental that doesn't have all this excess spending riding on the backs of our soldiers, that will in fact fund the activities in Iraq. The question I ask tonight is, how long are the games going to go on? 
   Ninety-four days we have been at this; 94 days since the President asked for this money and we are still playing games. That is not what the American people expect of us. They understand that Iraq is important. They understand that their safety and security is dependent upon what happens there because the consequences of failure in Iraq, which this bill will bring about, are too ominous to think about. 
   This bill is designed to bring failure to Iraq. Failure in Iraq means chaos in Iraq. It means genocide in Iraq, and it means we are jeopardizing the safety and security of the American people. It is not what the American people want. We should reject this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Louisiana for yielding. 
   Let me say with all the gratitude I have, I love the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He knows I do. I think he and the gentleman from Louisiana, the ranking Republican on the committee, do a marvelous job together. But as much as I love our chairman, there is one thing about his chairmanship that we have a big disagreement over, and that is the issue of raising taxes. 
   So far this year we have had $100 billion of new tax increases that have been passed by this House. Thankfully, none of them have become law. And, hopefully, none of them will become law. This is $81 billion in another tax increase. This is a warmup for the $3.5 trillion tax increase that is coming that was introduced this last week. And so, Mr. Rangel, as much as I love you and think the world of you, when it comes to the issue of taxes, I am opposed. 
   I came to Washington because I thought government was too big, it spent too much, and took too much out of the pockets of the American people. So I don't vote for tax increases. I think it is wrong. If you look at what has happened in our economy over the last 4 years, think about this: we cut tax rates in 2001, we cut tax rates in 2003. And what has happened in the last 4 years, Federal revenues, total revenues to the Federal Government have increased at over 10 percent per year in each of the last 4 years. As a matter of fact, it is over 11 percent in each of the last 4 years. This year we expect Federal revenues to rise another 7 or 8 percent. 
   So anybody who believes that we have a revenue problem I think is mistaken. We have a spending problem, and we will not stand up and take on the spending challenges that we have. We all know we have to step up and do it, we just can't quite find the courage to get it done. 
   What is even more irritating about the bill that is on the floor today is that it is a temporary tax patch to prevent a tax increase from going into effect for 1 year, paid for by a permanent tax increase. I am sure that the chairman of the committee would rather not do it this way, but that's what this bill does. All we are doing again is putting a permanent tax increase into law. 
   Now this law and this bill that we are debating is never going to become law. It is never going to become law because the Senate has made it pretty clear they are not going to do this bill this way. They are not going to have this tax increase in this bill. The White House has made it clear that they are not going to sign a bill that raises taxes. 
   So here we are playing political games once again and running out the clock. Running out the clock on whom? Running out the clock on the IRS and running out the clock on those 50 million Americans who are going to get a refund next year because, as we all know, this bill will probably not be done until Christmas. And the confusion that is going to reign next January, February, and March as people are trying to fill out their taxes, not knowing whether the alternative minimum tax is going to apply to them, is going to be confusion enough. 
   And it gets worse because what is going to happen is that the refunds that Americans, 50 million of them, are going to expect, are going to show up 2 or 3 months later than what they expect. And at a time when our economy is slowing and people are trying to hold onto their homes, a delay in their refund is going to put a real crimp on American families. 
   Now why are we having this big disagreement? This whole issue of PAYGO, how is it that we are going to extend the current tax rates, the current tax system for another year, and yet we have to have an $81 billion tax increase to pay for it? 
   The tax system we have today is going to be the same tax system we have next year, and yet we have to find some way under these crazy rules to pay for it. 
   Now, this is nothing more than a tax increase. For those who believe bigger government and higher taxes and believe government is the answer to virtually everything, I can understand why you want to raise taxes. But I don't believe the American people want their taxes increased. 
   At the end of the day what I am really confused about is if the Senate is not going to have this tax increase, and the White House is not going to sign it and it is not going to become law, why do you want to take your Members and walk them out on this plank only so it can be sawed off behind them? I wouldn't do that to my Members; I would hope you wouldn't do it to your Members. 
   American middle-class families are already under the gun. They are paying higher energy costs and higher health care costs, higher gasoline prices at a time when their incomes are not rising. The last thing they need is another tax increase from Washington, DC. 
   I would hope my colleagues would join me in voting ``no'' on this bill, making it clear to the American people that we understand the pain that they are dealing with and we should be here to help them, not to hurt them with higher taxes.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. 
   Let me just take a moment to congratulate both Mr. Smith, ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, and Mr. Hoekstra, the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, and all of their staff, who have worked closely with our Democrat colleagues, both in the House and Senate, to craft a bill that will help protect the American people. 
   Madam Speaker, America cannot afford to have a pre-9/11 mentality when it comes to national security. I think that's why this bill is so critical and why Members and staff have been working so hard to craft it. I recognize the serious threat that we face, and it keeps our Nation on offense when it comes to protecting the American people. 
   Our intelligence officials must have the ability to monitor terrorists suspected of plotting to kill Americans. This measure ensures that the tools that they need will be there to help keep America safe. They have retroactive liability protections for firms that have aided the government and have worked with our government at our request to help detect and prevent attacks. We should protect those companies. 
   I think it also protects the civil liberties of all Americans. This is an important piece of legislation. It has taken an awful lot of time to get there. 
   But just like yesterday, when Members on both sides of the aisle work together, we can come to an agreement. We can come to a compromise that's in the best interest of our country. 
   Two days in a row we have had two great examples of how we can craft very good bills by working in a bipartisan manner. I want to congratulate all the Members on both sides of the aisle and their staffs who have worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. I want to thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Madam Speaker and my colleagues, if you feel as though we've been here before, it's because we have. 
   Last week, we had a vote to override the President's veto. The votes were here to sustain the President's veto. I said during that debate that Republicans and Democrats had created this program together; Republicans and Democrats want to reauthorize this program together. The issues that separate us are not that great; we can sit down and resolve those issues. That has not happened. 
   As has been pointed out during this debate today, there are differences. There were some attempts to address those differences; but by and large most of them, as my colleague from Texas pointed out, were just painted over, little tweaks with words here and little tweaks with words there. And you've already heard about the deficiencies in this bill. 
   But that's not why I rise. Why I rise is because this doesn't have to be this way. There is no reason why we, on both sides of the aisle, can't come together and resolve the few differences we have in this bill that are well known now. 
   This bill is not being brought up today in a rush, delivered by 7:30 last night, a 293-page bill with all kinds of changes in it. We're not debating this bill today to pass it. We're debating this bill again today to play another political game. You know it; I know it. I sat with the majority leader yesterday, along with the minority whip, to say, Mr. Majority Leader, we can resolve these differences. We can fix this and we can reauthorize this program. We were turned down. 
   The chairman of the Democrat Caucus stopped my staffer and said, We don't care whether you'll give us the votes to pass this or not because if you don't, we'll just pull this bill and we'll wrap it around your necks in the next election. Political games, political games, political games. Exactly what the American public are sick of, and you all know it. Everyone knows this is nothing more than a political game, trying to score political points, getting ready for the next legislation. I thought the American people sent us here to deal with their problems. I think they sent us here to work together to deal with their problems in a way that we can be proud of. 
   Nothing has happened this year in this Congress. You think about it. Step back over the course of this year, nothing has happened yet. And let me tell  you, we've got another 14 months left in this Congress and nothing is going to happen. Why? Because all the majority wants to do is play political games and not reach across the aisle and get things done. 
   My promised accomplishments over the 17 years that I've been here, three big legislative projects that I've worked on, were all done in a bipartisan manner. Members from both sides of the aisle that played a significant role in coming together, dealing with issues like education reform, dealing with issues like financial services modernization, dealing with issues like the Pension Protection Act that we did last year, we did it together. 
   And when you think about the little bit of differences in this bill, you begin to wonder once again why Congress' approval rating is at a dismal 10 or 15 percent. Why? Because people are tired of watching this process not work. 
   This bill is not going to become law. The votes are there to sustain the President's veto; the President has made it clear he is going to veto it. How long are we going to play the games before we get serious about resolving our differences? 
   This is a sad day. And I think a lot of my friends on both sides of the aisle realize this is a sad day when we can't come together and deal with the issues the American people want us to deal with and deal with them like adults, adults that are willing to sit down and work together and to resolve those differences. 
   So I say to my colleagues, even those of my colleagues who voted for this, if you're tired of the political games, if you're tired of Congress' approval rating being at these ridiculous levels, let's all just vote ``no.'' Let's vote ``no'' and stop this bill. And then we can sit down and resolve the differences we have, and we can do it in a bipartisan manner and show the American people that we can, in fact, work together on their behalf.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I am disappointed that we have reached this point. I think all of us know that Democrats want to renew the SCHIP program and Republicans want to renew the SCHIP program. We haven't been afforded the opportunity to sit down and work together to resolve the differences we might have in order to keep this important program alive and available to children in America who deserve and need good health care coverage. I hope that that opportunity to sit down and work together comes today after this vote. 
   In 1997, Republicans and Democrats worked together to create the State Children's Health Insurance Program. We worked to ensure that low-income children without health insurance come first. But I think all of us know that is not what has happened. 
   Today, there are 500,000 eligible low-income children for this program who are not covered. Yet there are some 700,000 adults around America who are covered under the Children's Health Insurance Program. I think the numbers speak for themselves. In Minnesota, 87 percent of the people on the Children's Health Insurance Program are adults. In Wisconsin, 66 percent of the people on the Children's Health Insurance Program are adults. 
   Madam Speaker, what we have been working towards is trying to find a way to say that we ought to insure poor children first. I know States have all kinds of ideas about how to expand this program, but let's not let this become another Washington program that starts with one principle in mind and then becomes something for everyone. Why can't we refocus the program to ensure that we help those poor children who do not have health insurance before we get into insuring adults and people beyond the low-income folks that we are trying to help? 
   I think the President vetoed this bill because, frankly, I think the majority sent it to him to ensure that it was vetoed. There were no conversations in this House between Democrats and Republicans on what this bill would ever look like. I don't think there was ever any intention that this bill be sent to the White House to be signed into law. 
   It is a point that I have made here before, and I am going to make it again: the American people are tired of all the political games. They want us to find some way to work together to resolve our differences and to help move America forward. What we have seen over the last several months on this bill, and especially the last two weeks, is an example of the political games that the American people are tired of. 
   Madam Speaker, when you begin to look at Congress's approval ratings, it shouldn't come to anyone's surprise in this Chamber that they are very low. And why are they low? Because I think Americans are tired of the rhetoric, they are tired of the political games, and they want us to find some way to work together to address their needs and their concerns. 
   Two weeks ago, when the President vetoed this bill because we didn't put poor children first, we could have had this vote right then and there. We could have had the override vote. Then we could have sat down and begun to resolve our differences. By now we could have had them resolved and we could actually be here today on a new bill that makes sure that the poor children who don't have health insurance actually get it. 
   Madam Speaker, what I would say to all of my colleagues is that I would hope that the political games will come to an end. 
   On behalf of House Republicans, I again extend this invitation to all of you: let's sit down and work together in a bipartisan manner to resolve our differences. Secondly, let's make sure that we put poor children first.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for yielding and thank my colleague from Maryland for his comments. 
   I rise today in opposition to the plan being put forward that I think would bring government cost controls to a program that is widely popular and is working. We all know that, about 4 years ago, Congress passed a prescription drug benefit for seniors. In that bill, we make it clear that this benefit is to be provided by the private sector, and some 40 plans across the country are out there competing with different types of plans for seniors with different needs. And so the number of choices out there is overwhelming, but the fact is that the number of plans out there are also bringing competition; competition for better quality drugs, more access to drugs, bringing down the cost of this program by 30 percent. The program costs 30 percent less than what we thought it would cost when Congress passed it. 
   More importantly, some 80 percent of seniors appreciate their plan. They have a choice of their doctor; the doctor has the choice of prescriptions that they can offer to their beneficiary, to their patient; and the patient can go to their local pharmacy, they can talk to their local pharmacist, which all those choices are probably why we have an 80 percent approval rating for this program. 
   So what do we have here today? We have here today that says the government must go out and negotiate directly with drug companies. The fact is these 40 different plans that are operating around the country have been negotiating with drug plans over these last several years. Why do we think the cost has come down? It is that competition in the marketplace. 
   And I appreciate my colleagues on the other side for their ideas that the government ought to go out and directly negotiate this. It is one of those big dividing issues that we have between Members here in Congress. Some believe strongly that government ought to do it. Government ought to do it. We ought to order government to do it. While many of us believe that competition, competition and using free market principles will in the long run produce better results, lower costs, higher quality and more satisfaction among seniors. And that is exactly what we have seen with this plan. 
   Many people believe that the plan here would begin to look something like the plan that we have over at the Veterans' Administration where they do in fact negotiate with drug companies, although veterans that are taking those benefits have one-third the choice of drugs available to them that Medicare recipients have. I don't think there is anything we want to do today that would limit the ability of doctors to prescribe the correct drugs for their patients. 
   Secondly, the veterans' program in many cases requires the prescription to be delivered by mail order. Now, this is a growing move in the marketplace, but a lot of seniors want to go talk to their pharmacists, and I and many believe that the passage of this bill could lead to less choices for our seniors when it comes to where they get their drugs. 
   And so Republicans will offer a motion to recommit that simply says that we should not reduce the choices available to seniors, they ought to have those choices, and they should not be reduced at all; and secondly, that they should also have a choice in terms of where they get their drugs. Those are the two issues in the motion to recommit. 
   And so I would urge my colleagues to reject the idea of big government price controls and to support the motion to recommit that will in fact preserve choices for our seniors who rely on this very important program.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Madam Speaker, let me thank my colleague for his very nice words and thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have worked diligently to get this bill passed. 
   This economic growth package is an important victory for middle-class American families and small businesses. With the rising costs of energy, health care, college, housing and taxes, we put a real strain on the family budget. But the American people want us to work together to provide solutions to these problems. And I think this bill begins to move us in the right direction. 
   The bipartisan measure will help our economy get moving in the quickest and most effective way possible. It puts money back in the hands of middle-class American families. It will give businesses incentives to create new jobs and help grow our economy. And I think the package we have before us also clearly is a genuine compromise. Republicans gave a little, Democrats gave a little, the House gave a little, and the Senate gave a little. But perhaps most importantly, it is simple and it is straightforward. And it does not increase taxes or increase unrelated spending. In other words, it will empower individuals, not the Federal Government, to help grow our economy. 
   With this short-term growth package behind us, I think it is now critical that we focus on the longer term economic future of our country. I think that raising taxes in this environment would be the worst thing that we could do. I think that we need to begin to focus on how we make the tax cuts that we put in place earlier this year, earlier this decade, how we make them permanent. What do we do about the corporate tax rate that is driving American businesses out of the U.S.? We need to have a corporate tax rate that helps keep American businesses here. There is one thing that we really can do to help ourselves, and that is really to put our arms around spending, especially wasteful spending, and put a stop to it. We have got to get our fiscal house in order. 
   Many Americans, I think correctly, believe that Washington is broken. And I am here tonight to say that Washington does have its share of problems. And I am hopeful that this agreement we have been able to come to will help us on a path that shows the American people that we understand the problems that we have here in Washington and that we can, in fact, work together to solve the problems the American people sent us here to solve. 
   I couldn't finish this without also saying something very nice about our Speaker. Over the course of last year, the Speaker and I didn't have a policy conversation. I can tell you that we have had about 25 over the last several weeks. And for the health of our institution, I think it is good to come together and find common ground where we can. And I am glad that we were able to find common ground on this economic growth package, and I am hopeful that we will continue to try to find places where we can work together to solve problems that the American people expect us to solve.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague from California for yielding and thank all of the Members for what has really been a very serious debate about our efforts in Iraq. 
   When we think about what we went through this past spring, the fight over funding our troops that went on for about 112 days here in the House, I had thought that we had come to some resolution. Forty-eight days ago we sent to the President of the United States a bill passed by this House, passed by the Senate and signed into law that would fund our troops through the end of September.     
   That same bill, we asked General Petraeus to report back to the Congress on July 15 his interim report and asked him to give a more complete report by September 15 of this year. And here we are some 48 days later saying, we give up. 
   One can only imagine why this bill is on the floor today. If Members were serious about this bill, we would have seen it come through committee, come through the Rules Committee. No, no, this bill showed up Tuesday night about 9 o'clock out of thin air that we were going to have this debate this week. One can only look at what is happening on the floor of the House and describe it as a partisan political stunt, because that is exactly what it is. 
   This House voted to support our troops, to fund our troops, and to fund our effort in Afghanistan and in Iraq. And here we are, once again, back here posing for holy pictures, as our good friend from Wisconsin would say. 
   This bill that we have before us makes our troops pawns in a partisan political battle. I don't think that is what anyone wants. I think this bill on the floor today undermines General Petraeus and undermines the mission that he has to help make Iraq and America safe. 
   So what we have here is not leadership; it is negligence. My colleague, the majority leader, my friend from Maryland, and the Speaker of the House both say we want to fight the terrorists; we want to fight them where they are. Well, who is our biggest enemy in  Iraq today? Who is the biggest fight that we have in Iraq today? It is al Qaeda. Al Qaeda is losing, and that is why we see the bigger bombs going off and the bigger demonstrations and the bigger casualties, because they are losing and trying to influence public opinion here in the United States. 
   But what surprises me about what we are doing here today is the willful ignoring of the consequences of failure in Iraq. If we fail in Iraq, we know what happens, we make America less safe. We know that we will provide a safe haven for al Qaeda to operate around the world out of their new safe haven that they will have in Iraq. We will destabilize the Middle East, we will endanger Israel. We will embolden the Iranians even more than they have already been emboldened, and we will allow al Qaeda to be stronger and to be able to recruit more people to kill Americans and our allies around the world. These are serious consequences for the American people and our allies around the world, and we can't shrink from our responsibility here. 
   General Petraeus is making progress. Not as much progress as we would all like for him to make, but he is making progress on the ground, as he reported in the report that came out today. The Iraqi government has made some progress. Not nearly enough, but to just pull the rug out from under General Petraeus, to pull the rug out from under our troops that are in Iraq fighting for our freedom and fighting for the freedom of the Iraqi people at this moment is absolutely the most negligent action that I have seen this House take yet on this issue. 
   Why can't we sit back and allow General Petraeus's plan to have a chance to succeed? Why can't we wait until September 15, as we had all agreed, for his final report to come forward and to assess the progress that is being made and what, if any, new direction ought to be taken? 
   I believe, and I think the American people believe, that we ought to allow the generals on the ground in Iraq to make those suggestions to us and not sit back and let politicians here in Washington make decisions about our future and about our safety. 
   But while we are sitting here debating this meaningless bill that we have before us, we could be acting on serious legislation to help make America safer. There is a giant loophole in the terrorist surveillance program that means that activity between terrorists overseas cannot be acted upon and cannot be listened to by this government. There is information that would help make America safe, that would bring more terrorists to justice; information that is being left on the table because of partisan political games in this House. Why don't we bring the FISA modernization bill to this floor? Why don't we give the NSA the terrorist surveillance program and other agencies the ability to track these terrorist activities and these terrorist phone calls and information movement that we know today that we can't touch and we can't use? 
   We all know through reports over the last couple of days that al Qaeda has increased in its strength. We also know from news reports over the last couple of days that there has been increasing chatter among terrorists around the world. And yet here we are debating a meaningless bill that undermines our troops, ignoring the fact that there is information that could help keep America safer that we can't touch because this House will not act. I think that is negligent, and I think it is irresponsible. 
   I would urge my colleagues to let's let General Petraeus and the troops have a chance to succeed. Let's help them in their mission to help make Iraq safer and to make America safer, and the way we do that is to take this bill that we have before us and defeat it.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (FARM, NUTRITION, AND BIOENERGY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me first congratulate Mr. Peterson and Mr. Goodlatte and the bipartisan group of members on the Ag Committee who have brought this bill to the floor. 
   Unfortunately, the several tax increases contained in the bill I think are problematic, and we will deal with that later in this process. 
   But the amendment that I bring to the floor today aims to fix a problem that has been identified by the administration and others but has not been addressed in the bill that we have before us. This bill would extend a policy that permits farmers to receive loan deficiency payments based on a daily posted county price, and I think that would allow a mistake to continue. 
   If we are going to continue loan deficiency payments, I think we need to address the situation that allows farmers to lock in an LDP when prices are low and then to sell that crop when prices are high. LDPs are a valuable tool for farmers, and in order to preserve this valuable tool, we need to fix this problem. 
   Loan deficiency payments enable farmers to receive financing early in the harvest season, preventing farmers from forfeiting their crops to the government and allow commodities to be marketed in response to market demand. As I said, they are a valuable tool, and if we do not preserve their integrity, I think they are likely to blow up and to be eliminated entirely. 
   This amendment would replace the daily posted county price with a monthly posted county price. The monthly PCP would be the average of five daily PCPs on preset days during the previous month, taking out the high price and the low price for that month. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns included this provision in his farm bill recommendations. 
   The problems with calculating LDPs based on the daily posted county price were highlighted in the days after Hurricane Katrina. Because of the hurricane, transport of grain on the Mississippi River was stopped for several days. This caused a short-term precipitous drop in market prices which then triggered a number of farmers to go in and trigger their LDP payments. The farmers who locked in these artificially low LDPs were simply using the program to increase payments that they received from the government. 
   This was not the purpose of the marketing loan program or the LDP program. Marketing loans and LDPs are intended to allow farmers to receive financing early in the harvest season to allow commodities to be marketed in response to demand.     
   If we want to increase subsidies for farmers, let's be honest about it. If we allow the marketing loan program and LDPs to continue to be used in this manner, we'll be undermining their integrity by allowing them to game a pricing system that reacts to daily natural disasters. 
   I think supporting a good farm policy is important, but exploiting catastrophic natural disasters cannot stand. So I believe we need to make this change if we're going to preserve LDPs and the integrity of our good farm policy. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of our time. 
   In the days after Katrina, and just several days after Katrina, when we had the precipitous drop in prices, it cost the Federal Government $3.5 billion in extra LDP payments. So what we're talking about here is sound agricultural policy and sound policy with regard to America's taxpayers. 
   Think about the fairness of the farmer who sold his crop the day before Katrina. Think about what he felt like when several days later his fellow farmers ended up with hundreds of thousands of dollars more in extra benefits from the government because they just happened to sell a day or two before Hurricane Katrina hit.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Reclaiming my time, I served for the last 17 years with Mr. Peterson on the Ag Committee. I'm on leave, and I know all my colleagues on the Ag Committee are glad that I'm on leave. But the fact is that marketing loans and loan deficiency payments were there to facilitate the marketing of a crop. They weren't there to make or set up a system to allow or to put farmers in a position where they become day traders, and the current system does, in fact, allow that. 
   So instead of looking at a daily posted county price, if you looked at a monthly posted county price where you take out the high for the month and the low for the month and pick 5 days, you've got a fair price for all farmers. You've got a fair system that prevents people from gaming the system because of some abnormality in the market that may occur on one or two days. 
   This is a commonsense amendment. I would urge my colleagues to adopt it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Alabama for yielding, and let me say to my colleagues that I'm disappointed in the bill that we have before us. And I'm disappointed in the fact that the White House has indicated that they will sign the bill that we have before us. Everybody in this Chamber knows that we need to take responsible steps to restore the financial condition of our credit markets and our institutions. 
   Clearly, the housing market needs some stability. But the bill, I believe, that is before us falls well short of that goal by placing taxpayers on the hook for billions and billions of dollars. And how do we do this? We do this by creating a new tax--of course they will  call it a fee--on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a new tax on them of about $1 billion a year, so that we can use that money to give to the FHA to bail out scam artists, speculators and banks who made bad loans. 
   Listen. There is nobody in this Chamber that isn't there to help innocent victims of this housing crisis. But as the gentleman knows, and I think everybody in this Chamber knows, there is no way to help the innocent victims without, at the same time, helping the scam artists and speculators and the financial institutions who provided the loans to them. And what will happen is that the worst loans held by these financial institutions are going to be taken in by FHA. And who is going to pay the bill? The American taxpayers. I don't think they can afford it. 
   Secondly, as I said, we're going to charge Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac some 800, 900, almost $1 billion a year in new taxes that are going to be used to help fund all of this over the next 3 years. After that, what is going to happen to that money? It's going to go to local housing groups. Now, I can tell you that there has been more money wasted in these groups than about any kind of money that we have ever spent. But the idea of charging two institutions that we are trying to save, we are going to charge them a tax of about $800, $900 million a year on one end, and then on the other end, we're going to provide a possible taxpayer bailout. It makes no sense to me. 
   And then we get to the issue of GSE reform. The GSE reform, the new regulator in this bill I think is of good prospect, and is a good piece of work. I think the FHA modernization in this bill is good work. But when you look at the GSE part of this, we're going to have a new regulator. They're going to require more capital. They're going to hold Fannie's and Freddie's and the others' feet to the fire for a while. But to what end? What do we do 4 or 5 years from now when these institutions are supposedly healthy? We're in the same box that we're in today. We have a private company with a product with a Federal guarantee. It used to be that this was an implicit guarantee that the Federal government would back up these loans. But now it's clearly an explicit guarantee because the Treasury Secretary has made it clear that we're going to stand behind these two institutions. 
   So we have a private company that has a product with a Federal guarantee. I just have to ask my colleagues, we have an opportunity here to make real reform and to make real decisions about the future of these institutions.     
   We leave the question hanging. I am not quite sure what the answer really is. But to have this public-private quasi-partnership, and it is a private company with a board of directors, they make decisions and pay themselves salaries, and have a product, though with an explicit guarantee by the Federal Government, is a recipe for disaster, as we have found. 
   There are other problems with this bill. We have $4 billion in here for cities and States to buy up foreclosed properties, which I think will only increase the number of foreclosures in those jurisdictions that get the money. 
   It is a bill that I wish I could support. It is a bill where clearly the market needs support, but this is not a bill that I can support. I am disappointed that we couldn't do better. I am even more disappointed that the White House will sign this product. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''

<DOCNO>Mr. BOEHNER. (RELATING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5724, UNITED STATES-COLOMBIA TRADE PROMOTION AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from California for yielding, and say, Mr. Speaker, and to my colleagues, that our economy is struggling. Families and businesses are dealing with the rising cost of living, and certainly the job market has slowed. At a time like this we should be working together. And as the Speaker said, she and I came together and our Members came together on both sides of the  aisle earlier this year to pass an economic growth package. The checks will be going out to Americans here beginning in the middle of May and will occur, continue to go on through the end of July. These checks, again, are not out in the marketplace. We hope they'll be out there soon, and we hope it will help revive our struggling economy. 
   But the action that's being taken here today is going to do nothing more than to hurt American businesses and American workers. 
   The Speaker earlier went on about the fact that the typical protocol here was not followed; that the President send this bill to the Congress without the approval of the Speaker of the House. 
   Now I think it's time to set the record straight on exactly what has occurred. There have been hundreds and hundreds of meetings over the last 15 months trying to come to an agreement on how this bill shall be considered. There have been changes made. There have been side agreements that have come forth as a result of this. 
   And over the course of the last six or eight weeks, there have been serious conversations between the administration and the Speaker of the House about the consideration of the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. And the reason this bill was sent up here this week was because, not one time over these 6 weeks, has the Speaker agreed or made a commitment to the administration that this bill will be considered this year. The President's been willing to work with the Congress. The conversations, again, have gone on for 15 months. But not one time during that 15 months was there ever a commitment by the Democrat majority to bring this bill to the floor for a vote in the House. 
   I don't think the President had any choice but to bring, to send that free trade agreement to the Congress and force Congress to act. 
   And so what do we do? We don't go try to work to see if we can get the votes. We don't try, in a bipartisan way, to move this agreement. No, we're going to go in and cheat. We're going to change the rules under which the consideration of this free trade agreement should operate between the House and the Senate. We're not even going to give it a chance. 
   And anybody that thinks that well, we're just going to push this off for a couple of months, that is nonsense. This vote today is a vote to kill the Colombia Free Trade Agreement, nothing more and nothing less. 
   The Speaker points out, well, the President did this and, frankly, there are other priorities in the House. 
   Let me tell you what. When we passed the Andean Trade Preferences Act earlier this year, virtually everything that comes from Colombia to the United States comes here duty-free. The Colombian Free Trade Agreement would allow U.S. manufacturers, and U.S. workers who produce these goods, to send our goods to Colombia virtually tariff-free. 
   We're doing nothing here but hurting American workers and American businesses. Why? 
   I think the Speaker made it very clear. This action today is nothing short of political blackmail. The Speaker made it clear that she has her agenda. She wants the President to deal with her on her agenda, and we're not going to move this bill until the President deals with her agenda. That is not the way to deal with our trading partners around the world. 
   I've listened to candidates that are running for President, especially candidates on the Democrat side, who have talked about the fact that the United States needs to be more willing to engage the rest of the world, that we need to listen, that we need to reach out to countries around the world. There's probably no place that's more important for us to reach out than South America. 
   Here we have a country in South America that's doing their best to fight off terrorists in their own country. A message that we could send, not only to Colombia, but to the rest of South America that we want to engage in them, exactly as many of these contenders for the Democrat nomination, points that they have made. 
   What does this say to Colombia? What does it say to South America? And what does it say about free and fair trade around the world? 
   This is a precipitous step in the wrong direction. We're sending a very bad message for our partners around the world, all in the name of election-year politics. I think that it's regrettable, it's despicable. 
   If we're going to have a vote here, why don't we put the Colombian free trade bill up for a vote and let the House work its will on that bill, because the fact is, I think it would pass.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. 
   I think all of us understand that American families are struggling with the high costs of food, health care, and yes, the high cost of gasoline. Small businesses are struggling. And what Americans are about to see in the coming months is that the cost of fuel is in virtually everything that we buy and everything that we use. And when we begin to see these giant price increases in the coming months, the squeeze on American families and small businesses is going to get a lot worse. 
   That's why I and my Republican colleagues have been supporting a plan that says, Let's do all of the above. If we're serious about energy independence, we're serious about wanting to help our economy, help families, and help small businesses. We know we need to conserve more fuel, more energy in America. That's why many of us voted to increase CAFE standards to get higher fuel mileage for American cars. We also need to continue to promote biofuels, and whether it's cellulosic ethanol, whether it's regular ethanol, biodiesel, there's still room to grow in the biodiesel area. 
   We also need to have alternative sources of energy, whether it be wind, whether it be solar, geothermal, hydroelectric. All of these alternatives are out there. But we ought to make sure that the incentives that we have are sufficient to help bring these alternatives to market as soon as we can. 
   But we also need to be serious about nuclear energy. France produces almost 80 percent of its electric from nuclear energy. In America, we've put such a stranglehold on the ability to construct a nuclear plant that it takes over 15 years and billions of dollars to maybe, maybe get one sited, much less build it and to operate it. We can meet all of the safety concerns of nuclear energy in a much more efficient way that would allow people to bring these plants on and save the oil, gas, and coal that is used today. 
   But even if we did all of these, we haven't done enough. We haven't done enough to take the step toward truly helping Americans be energy independent. And that's where we need to drill. We need more American-made oil and gas. And we can do this. But a lot of people on the other side continue to say no.  
   1989, when the ANWR bill was on this floor, George Miller, my colleague and friend from California, said, We shouldn't pass this. Because even if we passed it, we wouldn't see any oil or gas out of ANWR for 10 or 12 years. Well, let's see. I'm not the greatest mathematician, but that was somewhere around the year 2000 we would have started to see a million to a million and a half barrels of oil a day coming out of ANWR. 
   The House has passed ANWR drilling legislation 10 or 12 times. It's the Senate that continues to block it. But in 1995, the Senate actually came along. We passed an ANWR drilling bill. We sent it to President Bill Clinton. And he said when he was vetoing the bill that well, even if this were to become law, we wouldn't see any oil or natural gas out of ANWR for 10 years. Well, let's see. That's 2005. So for the last 3 years we would have been getting a million to a million and a half barrels of oil a day. 
   Now, my colleagues on the other side want to make all kinds of excuses. They want to blame the speculators, they want to blame the oil companies, they want to blame everybody other than who they should blame. Get the mirror out. Look in the mirror, because it's my colleagues on the other side over the last 20 years who, over 85 percent of the time, have voted to block more American-made energy. Every single time. 
   Now, we've been having this debate the last several months about having a pro-energy vote here on the floor of the House. Right here. Right here in the people's House. Why can't we vote? Why can't we have a debate? Why can't we let the American people see where their Congress is, where their Members are? What do we have to fear? Oh. We have to stop the appropriation process because oh my goodness, somebody might offer an amendment that would lift the moratorium on offshore drilling. We can't expose our Members to a vote like that. They might vote the wrong way. 
   Why can't we have a vote right here on the floor of the House on drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a 19-million acre plot of ground and where we would use about 2,000 acres to actually do the drilling? Now, if you want to look at that, that's the size of a postage stamp on a football field. That's how much of ANWR would be affected by oil production up there. 
   Why not have a vote? Why not let the Members make a decision. Offshore oil drilling. How about oil shale in the Intermountain West? Why can't we have a vote here to have more energy production? 
   But I'm going to say it one more time. We need to do all of the above if we're serious. And we can drill in an environmentally sound way, and that's what we should be doing. 
   Madam Speaker, I support the gentleman's motion to instruct, and I would tell my colleagues on the other side we're not going to leave here for the August recess until we get a vote on having more American-made energy. 
   And I see my friend, the majority leader, coming down. Maybe he can promise us that we will get a vote over the next 3 weeks on having more energy produced right here in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOEHNER. Let me thank my colleague for yielding and thank my friend from Wisconsin for his kindness. 
   Here we are, we have a bill where we're going to spend $800 billion of taxpayers' money, a bill that has not been through the committee, a bill that if there's a Member who's read it I would like to know who they are. 
   And the reason I bring the point up is that the appropriations process is not working. It's broken, and I think on behalf of all of our Members that we need to make a commitment to make this process work the way it was intended to work. I know appropriators on both sides of the aisle want it to work. I think Members on both sides of the aisle understand that this process needs to work because when it doesn't work, the kind of transparency and accountability that we owe to our constituents gets done behind closed doors. 
   There are billions of dollars worth of earmarks in this bill that no one's ever seen. Maybe sometime we'll see them. I guess we could go back here and root them out and try to find them, but nobody knows what they are, how the money is really being spent, and that's why we have a committee process. That's why we need the committee process to work, and we need it to work for appropriators and Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. 
   Having said that, I really wanted to rise because there's a significant achievement in this bill, and that is the elimination of the ban on offshore drilling and the ban on drilling for oil shale in the inner mountain West. These bans have been in place now for 25 years that have held up a lot of American energy, and we have had a battle in this Chamber for the last 4 months about bringing about an all-of-the-above energy plan. 
   Now, this isn't all-of-the-above, but let me tell you what, it is a very big step forward that we will, in fact, lift these bans and allow American companies to drill for more American-made oil and gas in an environmentally responsible way. 
   It's a joint victory, and I didn't want to miss an opportunity to come down and congratulate Members on both sides of the aisle who stood up and said, enough is enough, we need to go after American energy if we're going to help ourselves. 
   Now, there's a lot more to do in the energy arena, and if we're serious about helping the American economy, doing all-of-the-above will create almost 1 million new jobs, will reduce gas prices, reduce energy prices, and this is a big step. But there's a lot more to do, and we ought to do it before we leave here. 
   Right up here above the Speaker's rostrum is a quote from Daniel Webster, and I will just quote the part of it when he says, ``Let us develop the resources of our land.'' That was written a long time ago. Those words were said even longer ago, and I do think the American people want us to develop the resources of our land to help improve our energy security because most Americans understand, without more energy security, our national security and our economy is threatened.

   Mr. BOEHNER. Mr. Chairman, let me thank my colleague for yielding. 
   We are having a debate here about whether we should cut spending. Most American families go through a process of trying to decide what it is they can afford in their family budget. The American people send us here to make the same kind of decisions. But when we just add spending and add spending and add spending, which we have done all year, guess what, we don't have to make decisions. 
   That is exactly what is happening here. The majority wants to denigrate this amendment because they think it is frivolous. They think it is an across-the-board 1 percent cut; you don't have to think. 
   The point I am trying to make and my colleagues are trying to make, we are sent here to make decisions; and if the majority isn't going to make decisions, we are going to try to make the decisions easier. Let's just have a 1 percent across-the-board cut, bring this budget in line with what the President requested on behalf of the American people. 
   I have been hearing all year from my friends on the other side that we heard the electorate and we heard the message they sent to us. Well, I have to tell you that one of the messages they sent to us is that we here in Congress need to be more fiscally responsible. 
   We are going to have a debate over spending all summer. We are going to have a debate over spending all fall. Because, at some point, how much government do we need? How much of the American family budget to we need to take in taxes? 
   I think my colleague has a very good amendment here. I urge my colleagues to support the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the gentlelady from Ohio, knows I have deep respect for her and the other members of the Ethics Committee and Mr. Hastings. They do a good job on behalf of our Members, and it is thankful from the Members, but it is a very unwelcome job that you have; and we do appreciate your work. 
   With what the House did in early January, in terms of adopting a new ethics package, it is clear that the responsibility of the Ethics Committee has expanded significantly. Members supported that, and I think it is long overdue. 
   Now, we all know, and I am not going to talk about the amendment that was offered last night, but there is insufficient money in the budget for the Ethics Committee to do what we have charged them with doing. 
   Now, we do this with Federal agencies all the time and can look the other way. If we want Members to abide by the rules that we have adopted, we have to have an Ethics Committee that can provide services to those Members so they understand the rules, they understand the limits, what they can and can't do. The concern that we have is that because there is insufficient money for the Ethics Committee in this resolution that Members are going to be charged with living under new rules and not having the service component necessary from the Ethics Committee to carry out our job.
