   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in support of the underlying bill. And I commend the gentlelady from Florida for her inspiring words. 
   This bill is on the right track by extending shuttle operations, giving NASA the option to extend shuttle operations beyond 2010. Taking away the artificial 2010 deadline and allowing NASA to finish all the flights currently on the manifest will give NASA more flexibility and provide needed transportation to the International Space Station and help lessen the severity of the gap. 
   However, I want to underscore that this bill does not fix the problem established by this administration. And my hope is that the next administration and the next Congress will fix this problem of putting NASA and the United States in a situation where we will be dependent on the Russians to put our astronauts into space for possibly longer than 5 years. 
   The Government Accountability Office recently testified before a congressional committee indicating that there are a number of technological challenges facing the Constellation program, the program to replace the shuttle, and that delays in the program could occur and could lengthen this gap beyond the 4 1/2 to 5 years that it currently is. 
   History has shown time and time again that complex technological problems often lead to delays, and that attempts at closing gaps can often be frustrated. Therefore, it is my opinion that the only way to assure that we do not get a lengthening of the gap, and the only way to make sure that we eliminate this gap is to extend shuttle operations. 
   Now, I was very disappointed in the Statement of Administration Policy on this bill that whoever was responsible for drafting this thing, they chose to dig up the canard that it is unsafe to extend shuttle operations beyond 2010. The truth is that the last shuttle that flies in 2010 will be the same shuttle that flies in 2011 if we extend shuttle operations. And if we are to argue that it is unsafe to fly the shuttle beyond 2010, you could just as easily argue that it's unsafe to fly it today. The truth is, after the improvements that have been made after the Columbia and the Challenger disasters, the shuttle that flies today is the safest shuttle that we have ever flown. And yes, going into outer space has its risks, but we choose to do so because we are a Nation of explorers, and we feel that the risks are justified for the benefits of space exploration. 
   I just also want to point out that relying on the Soyuz vehicle--supposedly because it's safer, as the administration is implying in their statement--is not exactly correct. We just recently saw a situation where the returning Soyuz vehicle was thrown off course into a dangerous ballistic reentry, exposing the astronauts on board, including a female astronaut, Peggy Whitson, to very dangerous G forces.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. This bill is a step in the right direction. It gives NASA the ability to extend shuttle operations. And I want to just point out, there is a very important scientific mission, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer mission. We spent $1.5 billion building that piece of machinery, and NASA's current plan is to leave it on the ground. This bill correctly calls for launching that mission, and it is the right thing to do. To spend all that money to build that thing and then to never launch it is just wrong. 
   However, I do want to underscore that the future Congress and the next administration is going to have to wrestle with the issue of getting the funding in the appropriation process. But I just want to say that, based on current economic growth, over the next 5 to 7 years 1 trillion additional dollars is going to come into this U.S. Treasury. 
   This is a matter of priorities. The American people support our space program. It's the right thing to do to keep the shuttle flying beyond 2010.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to commend Chairwoman Lowey for working diligently on this bill. She has produced a fairly good product here, and I want to commend her more for working with Mr. Wolf and myself to address many of our concerns. 
   She has produced a bill that is good in many respects. I appreciate the efforts as well of the staff that have worked very hard on this bill. A great example of working together is what my colleague from New York, Mr. Israel, was talking about in dealing with Darfur. I want to commend Mr. Wolf for his passion on that issue and his passion for the issue of human rights throughout the globe. I also want to commend Ranking Member Wolf and Chairwoman Lowey for their work on Colombia, and I am very pleased with the final product that they have there. 
   I am also very pleased that we have included language dealing with better accountability for the Global Fund to provide greater transparency. I commend Chairwoman Lowey for including the language that I introduced, the amendment, to get a better understanding of why the participation of faith-based organizations in the Global Fund appears to be significantly underrepresented. Numerous faith-based groups have been on the ground providing health care in many of those these countries for decades. In recent decades they have been on the frontlines in fighting against the spread of AIDS. 
   I saw the critical role that many of those faith-based groups provided firsthand when I visited Africa twice in recent years. I can tell you what part of the problem is, and it is really spelled out very nicely, and I will include for the Record this brief 3-page article from Catholic News Services, ``African Churches Find Global Fund Money Fairly Inaccessible.'' 
   Basically, what I feel is going on here with those faith-based groups is relatively simple. They are small. They are out there. They are going into these villages on foot and on mopeds. They don't have the ability to apply for grants with multi-billion dollar organizations in Geneva. It is going to require the Global Fund to reach into these countries, identify the groups, the church groups, the faith-based groups, that are doing the work. Frequently, they are on the pointy end of the spear. So I commend the gentlewoman for that language. 
   I know there are a few issues that we disagree on. The Mexico City policy language, we will have amendments to address that. Certainly, I understand that the gentlewoman has tried to reach out on this issue. 
   For me personally, the issue is an organization that is not only maybe providing abortion but as well is actually actively lobbying to overturn pro-life laws in many of those countries. We should not be supporting them even indirectly. 
   Finally, let me just close on the PEPFAR language. I played a role in getting the President's plan through the Congress, the authorizing language and the appropriations language. To me one of the most important things was the requirement that a portion, actually a small portion, I think it is 20, 25 percent of the preventive dollars go to abstinence education and abstinence training. 
   I want to make it very clear to my colleagues the reason why I felt so strongly about that and why I feel that we should continue the requirement that abstinence education be included in the preventive dollars is my experience in going into Uganda. Uganda lowered its AIDS incidence from 18 percent to 6 percent, a two-thirds reduction in AIDS. 
   The Global Fund didn't exist. PEPFAR did not exist when they did this. They did not do this through distributing condoms and comprehensive sex education. They did it through what they called ABC, abstinence before marriage, be faithful in marriage. We all know, you can't expect everybody to comply. But what is amazing to me is when you educate people on this thousands of people comply. 
   I just want to share with my colleagues that I had a meeting just 2 weeks ago with a Parliamentarian from Uganda who was an epidemiologist and a physician who was there from the ground up, and he verified just what I said, that people responded to the message. 
   Let me just finish up on that. Last July, southern African AIDS experts met and they officially listed ``reducing multiple and concurrent partnerships'' as their number one priority for the prevention of spreading HIV. It was not distributing condoms and comprehensive sex education, it was reducing concurrent and multiple partnerships. That is what this is really all about. 
   Let me just close and again commend the gentlewoman for a bill that has a lot of good in it. I am focusing on some of the things I disagree with. But for everything I disagree with, there are 10 to 20 different things that are good in it. 
   The spending level, I am very concerned that the President may veto this bill. I know there are a lot of worthwhile programs covered in the spending. I certainly would like to see us get a bill enacted into law. I think that would be to the credit of the chairwoman and the ranking member, the good gentleman from Virginia.  
   African Churches Find Global Fund Money Fairly Inaccessible  
   NAIROBI, KENYA (CNS)--In Kenya churches provide about 40 percent of all health care in remote and impoverished areas with no government services, but for their AIDS programs, churches receive no money from The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. 
   ``Since the inception of the Global Fund, the Kenyan bishops' conference has not accessed any direct funding from the Global Fund, even after applying to all the rounds,'' said Titus Munene, an HIV/AIDS program coordinator for the Kenyan bishops' conference. 
   ``It isn't rocket science to say if 40 percent of the health care is in the church system in Kenya, you would think a good portion of (Global Fund money) is going to go to our operational system. But unfortunately, it isn't that way,'' said Maryknoll Father Ed Phillips, who runs seven community-based health care clinics. 
   The Geneva-based Global Fund, established in 2002, is a partnership among governments, civil society, the private sector and affected communities. 
   The Catholic Church alone provides more than 25 percent of all AIDS care in the world, according to Caritas Internationalis, the Catholic aid network. All faith-based organizations combined have received just 6 percent of the Global Fund's money since the first disbursements in 2002. 
   The Southern African Catholic Bishops' Conference, which represents South Africa, Botswana and Swaziland, has almost stopped applying for Global Fund money. 
   More than 18 percent of adult South Africans are HIV-positive, and the church is the largest health care provider after the government. But church bodies have been unable to access Global Fund money either directly or through the South African National AIDS Council, which coordinates South African applications to the Global Fund. 
   ``I have sat on SANAC, the South African National AIDS Council, which is also the CCM (country coordinating mechanism) for the Global Fund. It has not been a helpful process,'' Dominican Sister Alison Munro said in an e-mail from Pretoria, South Africa. 
   ``The Global Fund process is too large and too cumbersome for the churches,'' said Sister Alison. ``If they (the churches) could apply directly to the Global Fund, some would. They can't because of the procedures. ..... The work involved is too much for any church group other than a national structure or a group with lots of capacity.''  
   While many nongovernmental organizations employ grant application experts, church-based agencies have tended to regard such functions as wasteful of donor money. 
   Munene said when the churches do not get Global Fund money it weakens the fight against AIDS among some of the poorest Africans. A lack of international and Kenyan-government funding has forced mission hospitals, clinics and dispensaries to charge some of the poorest people in Kenya for AIDS treatment and services, while relatively well-off people in the cities are accessing free services. 
   Munene said when church agencies charge for health care it ``means some of the poor cannot access services, since there are no government facilities in those rural areas.'' 
   The 6 percent of Global Fund money going to faith-based organizations translates into $325 million spread over five years in dozens of countries. The Global Fund recognizes the number is too low, said spokesman Oliver Sabot. 
   ``Given the essential role that they play in health care in many countries, particularly in Africa, we would like to see the amount of funding to FBOs (faith-based organizations) increase,'' Sabot said. 
   Part of the problem has been that churches have not done enough to fulfill conditions that might be expected from major international funders, such as making detailed applications for funding and monitoring expenditures to the satisfaction of donors, said Father Robert Vitillo of Caritas Internationalis, the Vatican's most prominent adviser on HIV/AIDS policy. 
   ``Each of these funding mechanisms comes with its own set of challenges for (faith-based organizations), which are more expert in providing support, care, treatment and prevention education than in completing such complicated funding applications and then in monitoring and reporting on the funds received,'' said Father Vitillo. 
   Even if it is a lot of red tape, church organizations have to be willing to fight through it in order to continue delivering effective AIDS prevention and care, said Father Phillips. But the Global Fund also has a responsibility to help churches through the red tape, he said. 
   ``The churches have to get more proactive,'' said Father Phillips. Sabot said the Global Fund has taken steps to ensure that faith-based organizations are able to apply for money. But by relying on countries' coordinating agencies or mechanisms, the Global Fund has become subject to the politics of Africa. 
   ``This hands-off approach does mean that bias at the country level is sometimes reflected,'' said Sabot. He said sometimes faith-based groups are excluded from country proposals ``either because of deliberate efforts by the government or other groups, or simply because they are less experienced with applying for international aid funding, and not enough outreach and support was provided to them'' by country coordinating agencies. 
   ``We have taken steps to help correct both these problems, but there is still more to be done,'' Sabot said. 
   Father Phillips said more than bureaucratic bias is involved in shutting churches out of national applications to the Global Fund. 
   ``The church was considered in some of these countries to be the opposition to the government,'' he said. ``Naturally, if they are considered to be opposition, well, they're (government mechanisms) going to make sure they're not going to target a lot of money'' for the church. 
   Father Phillips said African bishops must get tough and vocal about demanding that they be represented fairly in national applications to the Global Fund, but Munene said the churches may be talking to a brick wall when they demand fair representation. 
   ``The Kenyan bishops have made frantic efforts to meet the minister of health on several occasions, and even his excellency, the president. And promises were given, but to date the pledges have not been fulfilled,'' Munene said.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a supporter of the State Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which focuses on covering children in families at or below 200 percent of the poverty level ($41,000 per year). I have voted to extend this program and to provide additional resources to ensure that those living in families below 200 percent of the poverty level ($41,000) have access to affordable health insurance through the SCHIP program. 
   What I cannot support is the Democrat's SCHIP bill, because their bill: 1. Fails to place a priority on first enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year (200 percent of the federal poverty level); 2. Expands government subsidies to those making nearly $80,000 per year; 3. Spends half of the additional SCHIP dollars to enroll children in the government SCHIP program who were otherwise enrolled in private insurance; and 4. Virtually eliminates all funding for SCHIP beyond 2012 because they have no way to sustain funding for SCHIP beyond that date. 
   It is fiscally irresponsible to expand this program by enticing millions of children in families earning as much as $82,000 per year to drop private coverage and enroll in the SCHIP program that cannot be sustained. In August, House Democrat leaders forced an earlier version of SCHIP through the House that cut over $150 billion from Medicare and moved that money into SCHIP so that they would have a way to pay for millions of new SCHIP enrollees over the next ten years, including millions of currently insured children from middle and upper middle class families. 
   Their plan to cut Medicare was rejected not only by Republicans, but by the U.S. Senate,  and most importantly by the public at large. But now the bill before us is simply a bait and switch. They have brought a bill before us today that nearly triples the size of SCHIP over the next five years--including enrolling millions of children currently ensured by private plans--only this time they have chosen to hide from the public how they plan to pay for the program for the next ten years. They ramp up the annual budget of SCHIP to nearly $14 billion a year, and then they simply leave it to a future Congress to find a way to continue paying for the massively expanded SCHIP program. It turns out that their nearly tripling of the federal cigarette taxes still leaves them tens of billions of dollars short. Americans should be on notice that in 2012 the Democrats will ask for another $180 billion to continue SCHIP for another ten years. 
   Particularly troubling is that by significantly expanding SCHIP enrollment eligibility those in families making upwards of $80,000 per year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that millions of new SCHIP enrollees will be children that move from private coverage to the SCHIP program. By moving children from private insurance onto the government program, this bill essentially enrolls five uninsured children for the price of ten. Enticing millions of children to drop private coverage and sign up for SCHIP is short-sighted and fiscally irresponsible, particularly given that it goes bankrupt in 2012. 
   What we should be doing is focusing this program on enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. Mr. Chairman, our children and the American taxpayers deserve better that what the Democrat leadership has put before us today. 
   In February of this year, states that had overspent their SCHIP funding grants came to Congress begging for more money to ``insure uninsured poor children.'' The root problem in many of these states was the fact that they had use their federal grant to enroll children in the SCHIP program who were neither poor nor uninsured. New Jersey, for example had used their grant to enroll children in families with incomes of more than $72,000, even though there were and still are over 150,000 children in New Jersey in households earning less than $41,000 who are uninsured. 
   I offered an amendment in February that would have refocus SCHIP to make sure that children in families under 200 percent of the poverty level were covered first. My amendment was rejected by the liberal majority on the Committee, who stated that they had no intent to refocus SCHIP on lower income children. Rather, they planned to continue expanding the program to those well above the poverty level--to include adults and illegal immigrants--as a step toward universal government-run health care. In today's Washington Post, liberal columnist E.J. Dionne Jr., removes any doubt of this goal by writing: ``This battle [over SCHIP] is central to the long-term goal of universal coverage.'' 
   While the press releases about today's bill focus on uninsured low-income children, the language in the bill is about much more than uninsured low-income children. If the bill before us was focused on low-income uninsured children, I would be voting for it. The bill before us does the opposite. It repeals recent rules requiring states to ensure that at least 95 percent of those under 200 percent of the poverty level are insured under their state SCHIP programs. Democrats leaders in Congress have responded to the rule by arguing that there is no way to ensure a 95 percent enrollment rate of uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. They argue that since they cannot achieve the goal we should simply expand the program to those in households earning more than $80,000 or more a year. 
   They use budget gimmicks to say that their bill is balance and paid for through higher cigarette taxes. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that the amount of money Democrats estimate they will raise from higher cigarette taxes comes up billions of dollars short and that over the next 10 years they will have to find 22 million new smokers to bring in the amount of cigarette tax revenue they hope to raise. (It is also noteworthy that lower-income Americans pay a higher percentage of cigarette taxes, but it is middle-income Americans that will receive most of the expanded SCHIP benefits under this bill.) 
   I am also concerned over provisions included in the bill that repeal the requirement that individuals must prove citizenship in order to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP. This opens the program to fraud and the enrollment of illegal immigrants. In 2006, the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 46 states allowed anyone seeking Medicaid or SCHIP to simply state they were citizens. The IG found that 27 states never sought to verify that enrollees were indeed citizens. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that repealing this requirement will cost $1.9 billion. 
   And finally from a Florida perspective, Florida taxpayers come up short. Florida taxpayer will send $700 million more to Washington than we will receive back in SCHIP allocations. Where will Florida taxpayer dollars end up going? Residents of California, New York, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and New Jersey will be the biggest recipients of Florida tax dollars. Yet, Florida has a higher rate of uninsured children that several of these. 
   Florida voters will also be asked to foot part of the bill for a $1.2 billion earmark inserted into the 300-page bill at the last minute by the powerful chairman of the committee for his home state of Michigan.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to the bill as a physician who practiced medicine for many years prior to coming to the House. And, indeed, I still see patients once a month at the VA clinic in my district. 
   I always considered it very, very important not only to help my patients with illness but as well to give them hope and to give them real hope and not false hope. And one of the things I've always been concerned about in this debate for the last 7 or 8 years since we've been conducting this debate is that the advocates for more funding, Federal funding, for embryonic stem cell research; and we are funding embryonic stem cell research, we're just not funding more research that involves destruction of human embryos; have been contending, the advocates of this have been contending for years that this has the greatest potential. And in reality, there are no phase 1 clinical trials with embryonic stem cell research. There are no phase 2 clinical trials. There are no phase 3 clinical trials. Embryonic stem cells have never moved beyond animal research because embryonic stem cells have never been shown to be safe. 
   Embryonic stem cells form tumors when you put them in animals, whereas adult stem cells, cord blood stem cells, not only have been shown to be safe, but they're in phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. They are in clinical trials in heart disease, I think about 28 clinical trials, FDA-approved clinical trials. They're in clinical trials on treating a whole host of blood-borne diseases. And just very recently we saw published research, amazing research in phase 1 diabetes, juvenile diabetes research. 
   Indeed, I've been saying for years that medical science is going to move beyond this debate. And we saw a preview of that today published, that skin cells can be converted, possibly, back to forming embryonic-like cells. Science is going to move beyond this discussion. I don't think, being that millions of Americans believe in the sanctity of human life, that we should be funding research involving the destruction of human life.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   This bill before us today entitled the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, is better entitled the ``Human Clone Implantation Prohibition Act.'' Essentially what it does is make it a crime to implant a cloned human embryo in the uterus of a woman. 
   While the gentlewoman from Colorado has said this is a very different bill from the Greenwood substitute, it is true if you sit down with the two of them and read them, they read differently; but the net effect, let's be serious, is the same. It is the goal pursued by many research scientists, who I assume do not ascribe to a belief in the sanctity of human life, that they want to begin experimentation on human embryos produced through the process of human cloning. 
   My position when we began debating this issue 5, 6 years ago, remains the same. There are a host of problems with this, not the least of which is that I and millions of Americans like me believe that human life is sacred and we should not be wholesale producing it to be experimented with in the lab and then discarded when the experimentation is done. 
   Are we really trying to say to the American people we want to make the human embryo the lab rat of the 21st century? 
   I will add, this is going to create a huge demand for human eggs. It has been very surprising to me to see so many people on the left who claim to be great champions of women's issues, it is going to create a lot of pressure for more human eggs. And the way you get human eggs, it is not a simple, overnight procedure. You have to give women a powerful medication that produces something called superovulation. It has the potential for complications, depression in some 25 percent of the women who get these drugs, possible significant complications requiring hospitalization called the superovulation syndrome. 
   And who will be donating their eggs to all these research labs? We all know who it will be, it will be women who really need the money. You will probably have problems and complications, suicides from depression. What will end up happening is they will end up going overseas to Third World countries where they can't bring litigation. 
   This is why many leaders in the feminist movement chose to support the Stupak-Weldon bill over this alternative. It is just down right bad policy. 
   Let me say as well, the lady said previously that the women could, under my previous bill, could be criminally prosecuted. I disagree wholeheartedly. I thought the language of the Stupak-Weldon bill was very clear, that the criminal act would be the creation of the human embryo through the process of somatic cell nuclear transfer. That is the way they created Dolly; that is the way this process begins. 
   Let me just say in closing, the process by which we have undergone this, when we were in the majority, we had committee hearings. We allowed a substitute. And to rush this to the floor on the suspension calendar is an inappropriate way for us to deal with a very, very significant issue. 
   This, ladies and gentlemen, is a profound slippery slope. They will not be satisfied with doing research on human embryos. The next target will be the human fetus itself, creating human models of disease so research scientists can do research on certain forms of human disease by doing research on human embryos and fetuses. That is the direction we are going, patenting some of those diseased human embryos. 
   I say this is a place where we should be drawing the line. We should defeat this on the suspension calendar. I believe if you brought it forward under regular order, it would go down under regular order, and I encourage all of my colleague to vote ``no'' on this piece of legislation.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   I just want to say a few words about marijuana. First of all, it does cause cancer. I have seen it. I have seen people with lung cancer, no risk other than they were chronic marijuana smokers. 
   Additionally, the last time we were debating this bill, I called one of my former colleagues in my medical practice who is an oncologist, I had three oncologists, and I asked him for the latest information on cannabis, or THC. He again informed me this is available in pill form. You can actually get it in pill form. Additionally, it is not a very good antiemetic and not a good appetite stimulator. There are about 18 different products legally available that doctors can prescribe. 
   By and large, most of the people who want to use this want to get high and there are consequences to letting this move forward. 
   Saying that this State and this State allows this, we need to remember something: States govern where you practice medicine. If I want to practice medicine here, I have got to get a license in the District of Columbia. If I want to open a satellite office, I have got to get a license in Maryland or Virginia. But the Federal Government regulates prescribing, for obvious reasons. If the patient comes in to see me here and lives in Virginia, they are going to go over to a pharmacy there. So the Federal Government has always regulated this. 
   There are significant consequences to making this product widely available, and that is what this amendment will do. This is a very, very bad amendment. Marijuana has been implicated in railroad accidents. It has been implicated in car accidents. It is documented to have an adverse effect on memory. 
   Jeepers, we have people dying in this country from the effects of cigarettes. We have people dying in this country from the effects of alcohol. We have people in this body wanting to ban cigarettes and ban smoking. And now we are going to take action to allow another dangerous substance on the market? And there is an agenda of the people who are behind these kinds of amendments.     
   They want to legalize marijuana, and they want to make another dangerous product available to our society. I think that this is a bad direction for us to go in. This a bad amendment and a dangerous amendment. I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentlelady for yielding, and I want to commend her on a very thoughtful amendment. As I understand it, the majority is going to be willing to accept it. 
   I had two amendments that dealt with this very same issue that specifically dealt with the SCAAP program and the COPS program, denying funds to any of the sanctuary city or sanctuary community jurisdictions. 
   As I understand it, her language covers both of those things, and I am going to be looking forward to working with the gentlelady in the years ahead to make sure that these sanctuary cities do not have access to these funds.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to commend him and Chairman Mollohan for fully funding the exploration initiative. These are the funds that will allow us to continue to operate the shuttle and as well to continue to develop a replacement for the shuttle. And, importantly, that replacement, the Orion capsule, will be a safer and less expensive space vehicle, and so it is very important that we keep funding on track. 
   I want to commend Chairman Mollohan for bringing up the important issue of the gap in human space flight. I would simply point out that when the President originally put forward this proposal, I shared Chairman Mollohan's criticism that this gap in human space flight is not good for America, and I am certainly anxious to work with the administration and with the committee to see if it will be possible for us in the years ahead to reduce that time where Americans will be relying on the Russians, essentially, to put our astronauts into space. 
   While I certainly share the concerns raised by Ranking Member Frelinghuysen about the veto threat against this bill because of the excessive spending, I just want to go on record regarding the spending increase concerns raised by the administration in the aeronautics account. 
   I am very concerned about our air traffic control system and its ability to handle the ever-increasing volume of commercial air traffic, and that we are falling behind on this critical investment of modernizing our air traffic control system. 
   Additionally, I want to comment on the accounting changes in the NASA account that Chairman Mollohan has championed. While I agree that they represent perhaps a more elegant way for us to keep track of NASA funding, the 90-day time window he has provided NASA to implement this new initiative may not be physically feasible for the agency, and I am certainly hoping that he is willing to work with NASA officials in the years ahead. 
   And then, finally, I just want to comment on two other important issues. One, I am very pleased that both the chairman and the ranking member are seeking to protect the census account. This is a very important account. It is probably one of the few constitutionally mandated responsibilities in this bill. I know that the census account is frequently used as a piggy bank by Members seeking to increase various sections of the bill, and I am pleased and I would want to continue to encourage both the chairman and the ranking member to protect the census account. 
   Then finally, I want to comment on two amendments that I am offering in the bill. I have two amendments that deal with the issue of cities and municipalities that create sanctuaries for illegal aliens who basically say that we are not going to enforce Federal laws in our jurisdiction, and then they turn around and apply for grants in this bill to help them with the responsibility of dealing with criminal illegal aliens. In my opinion, that is inappropriate, and if they want to have access to the money, they shouldn't be creating sanctuaries. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thought freedom was worth fighting for. I thought, when we saw all those Iraqis risk their lives to go and  vote and establish a government and establish a Constitution and to have, possibly, freedom of speech, that was something worth our level of effort. If you actually go over there and talk to those people, you find out that it is a minority that is trying to break the will of this body. That is what is going on. 
   What I object to in this bill is the way you have brought this to the floor. You have got subsidies for spinach. You know, my constituents are asking, who put that in the bill, Popeye? Why don't you let us have a vote on whether or not we want to attach funding for peanut farmers and funding for spinach farmers to a war supplemental? 
   Yes, why don't we have a vote on the Murtha language? Why are you denying us an opportunity, this body, a Democratic institution, the ability to say collectively as a majority, we think this kind of language is what we want to have? 
   I don't deny the gentleman from Pennsylvania, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Defense, to put forward his plan. Even though he is not the Commander in Chief, the way I read the Constitution, he can do that. But the way I also read the Constitution and the Federalist papers, we are supposed to have some kind of a vote, and you are just bringing this thing forward under a closed rule. 
   I personally think that is a disgrace, what is going on here. I am going to vote against this bill. I hope, as we move forward in this process, democracy, which the Iraqis are willing to risk their lives for, will someday be reinstituted in this body here.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (WATER QUALITY FINANCING ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise today to express my opposition to H.R. 720, the Water Quality Financing Act of 2007. This bill is the third water bill brought to the floor this week. These three bills are filled with excessive spending, propose no way to pay for the increased spending, create duplicative bureaucracies, and impose requirements leading to inefficiencies that will lead taxpayers to getting less work for each Federal dollar spent. H.R. 720 is fiscally irresponsible. 
   The fact is, Madam Chairman, we already have a program in operation designed to help State and local communities with water and sewer projects--The State Revolving Fund (SRF). The SRF is a fiscally responsible program that provides Federal assistance through loans and other cost-sharing arrangements to help States assist municipalities with high priority projects. I support the SRF and believe it strikes an appropriate balance between Federal and State responsibility with respect to improving water systems in communities across the country. While today's bill authorizes SRF funding, the Congressional Budget Office has determined that in total the bill will actually suck about $49 million over 5 years away from the SRF to be used in two new and less effective grant programs created in H.R. 720. Unlike SRF funds, these no-strings-attached grants do not have to be repaid and, in my estimation, will encourage States and municipalities to rely too heavily on Federal funding for improving their communities. 
   Unfortunately, creating more government bureaucracy and undermining an existing loan program is not even the worst of this bill. H.R. 720 also amounts to a kickback to special interest labor unions. This bill imposes on States costly Davis-Bacon labor rules. Democrats are telling the American taxpayers that inserting special provisions for their political base is more important than fiscal responsibility. Under Davis-Bacon, any project funded  through this bill will cost American taxpayers a 15 percent surcharge. This mandate effectively reduces the number of projects that can be completed under H.R. 720 by 15 percent. Adding a 15 percent surcharge will only serve to delay projects addressing water supply shortages and sewage treatment problems. The Davis-Bacon provision also discriminates against smaller--often minority owned--businesses that don't have the means to comply with its owner requirements. 
   Finally, Madam Chairman, H.R. 720 raises taxes--$256 million over 5 years. 
   In short, today's bill is an excellent case study for the new Democratic Majority's priorities: More expensive bureaucracy, a kickback to labor at taxpayers' expense, creation of duplicative government programs, and a hidden tax increase on ordinary Americans. 
   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 720.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to address H. Con. Res. 63, disapproving of the decision of the President announced on January 10, 2007 to deploy 20,000 additional United States combat troops to Iraq. 
   This resolution essentially has, by my interpretation, three sections. It has the first section, which speaks in support of our troops; and then it has the second section, disapproving of the mission of 20,000 of the troops, which is a little bit of an inconsistency. We are saying we support the troops, but we don't support what you are trying to do. 
   But the most important part of this resolution is the third section shown here in white. There is nothing there. No plan. 
   So the authors of this resolution are essentially saying, we don't approve of the President's plan but we have no plan to deal with this challenge. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, we won the war in Iraq. What we are struggling to win now is the peace, establishing a peaceful government that can run this country. And we have very determined opponents seeking to make sure that chaos reigns in that country and we do what this resolution is leading us to do, which is essentially to leave. 
   Indeed, a senior member on that side of the aisle recently said in the press that, ``This is the bark, and the bite is coming.'' We supposedly support the troops, but what is next is no funding for the troops; that this Congress under this new leadership is going to exercise the power of the purse and cut off the flow of money. 
   But, ladies and gentlemen, my colleagues, this is not Vietnam. The war in Iraq in not going to go away. It is going to continue to be a problem. If we do withdraw our troops, as many in this room want us to do, the war on terror will continue. 
   We had a meeting today with the Ambassador from Jordan and the Ambassador from Egypt asking us not to withdraw; that we have to stay and persist and to try to establish a peaceful regime there. And they have their reasons, because they know this is a component of the war on terror. And the war on terror is a bad term; it is a war on radical fundamentalist jihadist Islam. And these jihadists are not going to stop coming at us. Indeed, since over the last 4 years, there have been attack after attack after attack in Bali, in Spain, in London, and they are going to keep coming after Western interests, because their goal and their agenda is to defeat the West, to defeat everything we stand for, and to ultimately establish a global fundamentalist Islamic regime. 
   I oppose this resolution. I am going to vote against it, and I encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the same. The President's plan was recommended to us in the Iraq Study Group. It is amazing, many of the people who are saying they are going to vote for this supported the Iraq Study Group, and the Iraq Study Group recommended many of the components that are in the President's plan. We need to give this time to work. I know the American people are losing patience in this conflict, but I also know the stakes in this conflict are huge. And if we fail, the consequences could be huge to the region, they will be huge to the world, they will be huge to the American people and our children and our grandchildren. 
   So I strongly encourage a ``no'' vote on this resolution

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (ENERGY MARKETS EMERGENCY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 26, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. There is a reason why there's so much speculation in the oil commodities market, and it is because supply is less than demand. This happens in any commodities market. Where demand is exceeding supply, the speculators dive in. And you can try to encourage the CFTC and you can pass new regulations on speculation, but as long as supply is less than demand, the speculators are going to move in. 
   And I will say further, that if you try to regulate this market so much that it becomes dysfunctional, it will just go overseas. And the reason the speculators are getting in is because they know that this Congress does not want to open up American sources of energy. 
   I sit on the Appropriations Committee, and outrageously, today, we had the Interior bill before us, and we had three amendments: one to open up ANWR, a huge source of oil; one to open up our offshore assets of natural gas and oil, which can be done safely with today's technology; and the third is to open up shale. We have more hydrocarbons in shale than the Saudis have oil, but amazingly, the Democratic leadership didn't want to vote on those things. They don't want to open up those sources. 
   That is the political position of the majority, the Democratic majority in this Congress, no increased domestic oil production, and that's why the speculators are pouring in. And there's going to be no relief for price at the pump, no matter what we do in this body, if we do not address the issue of supply. 
   We have domestic energy. We can access that domestic energy safely and cleanly, but people are standing in the way in this body and the Congress of the United States. 
   I predict that this bill is going to have absolutely no impact. We're going to do two more bills that probably will have no impact, and prices will probably continue to go up. 
   I thank the gentleman for yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Chairman, I rise to express my concerns about H.R. 3685, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA). Unfortunately, this bill goes far beyond simply providing protections against discrimination. If that had been the sole purpose of H.R. 3685, the authors would have closely tracked the Civil Rights Act. The fact that they chose not to follow the Civil Rights Act, but instead create a whole new statute belies their true motives. Because H.R. 3685 does not consider the rights of other protected classes by giving them less protection than have already been provided for them under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, I believe this legislation is unfair and unwise. 
   Again, as has become the common practice with the new majority, this bill is on the floor with little review, no committee hearings, and little input from religious organizations and employees that will feel the largest impact from this legislation. Having a one-sided piece of legislation rushed to the floor is no way to pass legislation whose implications will be deeply felt by all Americans. This haste to the House floor, fear of constructive criticism, and failure to model this bill after other successful Federal civil rights legislation, is unwise and is plagued with pitfalls. 
   The Committee summarily rejected amendments to (1) broaden the exemption for religious schools not covered by the definition in H.R. 3685 to make it consistent with Title VII exemptions; (2) strike the vague and confusing ``perceived'' sexual orientation language; (3) prohibit retaliation against employees who may not agree with employer policies relating to this bill on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs and; (4) remove the provision making it unlawful to condition employment in a State in which a person cannot marry a person of the same sex. One wonders why in the quest to protect one group, the authors of this bill are so willing to infringe and discriminate against the rights of others. In fact, I do not believe it is going too far to say that the authors of this bill are willing to infringe on the consciences of others in their attempt to create new protections. 
   H.R. 3685 contains a much narrower religious exemption than is provided under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which broadly exempts religious corporations, associations, societies, and educational institutions. There is strong evidence to suggest that non-denominational independent religious schools will not be exempt from complying with H.R. 3685 even though they are under Title VII. This issue has been glossed over by the Democratic leaders even though Congress specifically amended the Civil Rights Act in 1972 to forthrightly protect the mission-critical hiring rights of religious organizations. 
   A significant concern over H.R. 3685 is its inadequate protection for religious employers and those with deeply held religious convictions. Under Title VII, religious corporations, associations, societies and educational institutions are given broad exemptions. H.R. 3685 contains insufficient exemptions for religious organizations and companies with sincerely held religious beliefs. While houses of worship, missions, and some religious schools would be exempt, H.R. 3685's definition of ``religious organizations'' is a two-part test to determine if an educational institution qualifies for an exemption. In light of the broad exemptions provided in Title VII and the successful management of competing protections, why does H.R. 3685 feel it is necessary to subject religious organizations to intrusive snooping of the Federal Government to investigate if the organization is ``religious enough?'' This requirement indeed constitutes an excessive government entanglement with religion in violation of the First Amendment, and it is doubtful that it would survive scrutiny by the Supreme Court. 
   H.R. 3685 is vaguely drafted to prohibit employers from discriminating against an individual's actual or ``perceived'' sexual orientation or the actual or ``perceived'' sexual orientation of a person with whom the employee associates. Again, someone's ``perceived'' status is not included in any other civil rights legislation, including Title VII, which protects race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Employers will now be subjected to claims and potential liability based on the highly subjective standard of someone's perception. With this legislation applying to essentially every company in the country with more than 15 employees, exposing employers to the threat of liability based on ``perception'' seems highly unwise and will create a lawyer's bonanza. This will force employers to defend themselves in claims and litigation by having to prove a negative--that they weren't able to perceive someone's sexual orientation. I'm sure this is welcome news for the nation's trial bar who will welcome vague loopholes to create Title VII claims to litigate. We should not open employers up to lawsuits because they were unable to ``perceive'' a person's sexual orientation, but that is what this bill does. This is especially an unfair burden on our small business owners, who will not be able to afford lengthy and costly litigation. This bill allows individuals to file suit, if their claims aren't resolved by the EEOC, for punitive damages up to $300,000. 
   H.R. 3685 will also needlessly create hostile work environments, as religious employees protected under Title VII will have their right to free religious expression challenged by the new rights created in ENDA for individuals based on their ``actual or perceived sexual orientation.'' The balancing of these two will lead to an impossible balancing test of which law to follow and which to violate. 
   While I strongly oppose intentional discrimination in the workplace to anyone, H.R. 3685 would favor some classes of citizens over other already protected classes. I cannot support a bill that does not provide adequate and equal protections to religious organizations, especially religious educational institutions that will be forced to act against their consciences if this legislation becomes law.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Speaker, many of my constituents have called and written me in opposition to the current plan to deal with the Nations financial crisis. I consider this to be one of the most serious and important issues I have dealt with in my 14 years in the House. 
   My father was born in 1919 into a poor working class family in New York City. During his most critical formative years from the time he was 10, until he went off to fight in WWII, all he knew was the deprivation of the great depression. He and his brothers and sisters regularly went to bed hungry, on many nights dinner consisted of a choice of either a ketchup or a mustard sandwich. 
   He was a good student, nonetheless had to drop out of school at age 15 so he could go to work, often making only pennies a day, but his family needed food. After the war he met my mother and had a family and was never able to go back to school. 
   One of the things that emerged from his experience was a tremendous amount of appreciation for having a good job and the importance of saving and preparing for retirement. Those enduring values he passed on to me. 
   Today, our Nation is faced with what is being described by many economists as the worst financial crisis since the great depression. With the decline in the housing market there are many banks and other financial institutions that have been adversely effected. This has caused many of these banks to have to stop or reduce lending money. Many banks have gone bankrupt. 
   There is no question that this problem was started by the Federal Government's efforts to modify lending rules to allow those with lower incomes and poor credit scores to purchase homes, often with no money down. The inappropriate and meddling actions by the Government-sponsored entities Fannie May and Freddie Mac laid the groundwork for this crisis and it was made worse by unscrupulous Wall Street Bankers and mortgage brokers. 
   What started as a housing market decline has now become a credit crisis effecting global finance, and it is beginning to affect the retirement savings of millions of Americans and our national economy. Many companies are starting to find it difficult to get financing and we are starting to have leaders in finance and business tell us that if this is not contained we may begin to see spreading business failures and unemployment. 
   It is against this backdrop that Treasury Secretary Paulson and the head of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke originally proposed a plan that calls for the U.S. Treasury to purchase with cash many of these mortgage backed securities held by these banks. Many of the assets are backed by real estate, but because there is no market for them today the bankers are being told they are worthless under the new accounting rules put in place after the Enron scandal. 
   Banks loan out money at a ratio of 10 to 1. For every 100 dollars of assets they have on their books they are able to make $1,000 in loans. The banks that now hold these mortgaged backed securities have seen the value of many of these plummet to zero which has wiped out hundreds of billions of dollars of capital from their balance sheets. This has taken trillions of dollars out of the capital markets because of this 10:1 ratio. If you were a bank and on your balance sheet was a $100 million dollars worth of mortgage backed securities that the accountants are telling you it is worth zero then you can't do $1 billion in loans. 
   The Paulson Plan called for purchasing these mortgage-backed securities with cash. I was not happy with the original plan put forth by the Secretary. It called for providing him unfettered access to $700 billion.  
   The bill I voted for on Monday September 29th and which failed to get a majority was a significant improvement over Secretary Paulson's original proposal. It reduced by half the amount of cash he could access without coming back to Congress. It required that he also develop an option other then asset purchase that included offering insurance to back up the value of these mortgage securities. It also had strong restrictions on excessive executive salaries for many of these troubled companies. No golden parachutes. 
   Despite the improvements in the bill it did not get my support because I liked it. I voted for it because I was concerned that inaction was too risky. My preferred approach was that proposed by former FDIC Chairman William Isaac. This plan was never given a vote. 
   Since that failed House vote, the Senate took up the bill and it has added some good things. There are several extensions of existing tax breaks that help families and businesses that were due to expire. Two important items are the coritinuation of sales tax deductibility for the people of Florida and the increase of FDIC insurance to $250,000. It also has a provision to modify the alternative minimum tax. If this provision is not enacted over 20 million families in America will be saddled with huge tax increases next year at a time when they can least afford it. 
   Unfortunately, the Senate put in several unnecessary items as well such as earmarked tax breaks for special interests. Despite the many flaws in this bill it is the only bill that I will be given a chance to vote on by the Democrat leadership. In light of the very serious problems in our economy, I will give it my support with a yes vote. 
   I realize that there are many like-minded conservatives in District 15 of Florida and around the country that disagree. I am reminded at this time of the great controversy surrounding the drafting of the Constitution and its ratification at the birth of our Nation. 
   Today, the Constitution is revered and it has served out Nation well for over 200 years. But the debate surrounding its drafting and ratification was highly controversial with many patriots at the time being strongly opposed to it. 
   Time will determine if this financial rescue package will serve our Nation well. I am concerned that we are heading into a recession. This package if it works well will likely not allow us to avert a recession, but may allow us to avert a depression.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (FLOOD INSURANCE REFORM AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I am very concerned about the need to enhance access to affordable storm damage insurance, particularly for those living in communities like the one I represent in Florida. Indeed I have cosponsored and authored legislation that would do just this and compliment the steps that have already been taken by the State of Florida to address this issue. 
   Asking American taxpayers to assume $19 trillion in potential liabilities under a program that the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has already deemed insolvent just does not make good common sense. If an insolvent private company came before the regulators asking the regulator to further expand their liabilities, as is being done in H.R. 3121, the regulators would reject the application outright. 
   Increasing the potential liabilities of the National Flood Insurance Program, NFIP, as is done in H.R. 3121--without first paying off the NFIP's $19 billion debt--is unwise. Furthermore, the GAO and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, admit that the $2 billion in annual premiums that NFIP takes in each year makes it virtually impossible for the NFIP to pay off this debt. No rational person would buy insurance from a private company who was $18  billion in debt or has borrowed from the U.S. Treasury (taxpayers) 14 times just to keep from going bankrupt. 
   Forcing H.R. 3121 to the floor while blocking amendments from Republican Members of Congress, especially from Members from Florida and other States who deal with hurricanes on a regular basis, does not speak highly of the integrity of this program. 
   As a father, I worry greatly about the burden we are passing onto our children. With reckless abandon, this Congress is rushing headlong into the future without any thought of what the ramifications of our decisions will have on our children and grandchildren. With every indication that Social Security will be bankrupt by 2042, with the Medicare program $17 trillion short already, the House passed another massive spending program with unfunded liabilities estimated at $180 billion this week in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP. In the college student loan bill that we passed earlier this year, this Congress added tens of billions of dollars in potential liabilities. Today this House is going to ram through another massive spending program where, as stated in a study by actuaries Towers Perrin, payouts to insurers for wind damage in a given storm could be $100 to $200 billion. 
   The GAO estimates that the current unfunded liability that our children face is over $46 trillion, amounting to nearly $375,000 per full time working American. Adding the additional potential liability of $19 trillion in this bill would raise that to more than $500,000 per full-time working American. We need to face reality and begin to think about our children and the America that we are going to leave them. 
   As we think about the type of America we are creating for our children, I am reminded of a warning given years ago: 
   A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largess from the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy . . . 
   That is what this bill before us today does. It votes largess today, for political gain, while saddling our children with the debt. In good conscience I cannot do that. We owe it to future generations of Americans to turn the corner here and put their interests above our own. 
   As the Comptroller of the GAO stated in his testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee in 2005, the United States is on an unsustainable fiscal path and our future standard of living will be gradually eroded--if not suddenly damaged--if we continue on this path. 
   Reforming the NFIP is necessary, and this bill includes some important reforms, such as a phase-in of actuarially determined rates for some currently subsidized property owners. However, this bill does nothing to address the concerns raised by the GAO in the 2006 report that outlines the management and accountability problems after hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
   The easy thing to do would be to simply vote for this bill and put the burden of paying for it on our children and grandchildren, much like Washington has done already with dozens of other insolvent federal programs. But that would not be the right thing to do, and it is for that reason that I cannot vote to further burden our children with costs that we are not willing to pay for ourselves today.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (FEDERAL PRICE GOUGING PREVENTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - May 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to price gouging. 
   The good news for Florida consumers is that the state of Florida already has the ability to protect consumers from price gouging. 
   Florida law finds that gouging has occurred when a commodity's price represents a ``gross disparity'' from the average price of that commodity during the 30 days immediately prior to the declared emergency. This applies unless the increase is attributable to additional costs incurred by the seller or to national or international market trends. In fact, Florida law enforcement fully investigated over 58 cases of alleged gouging after Tropical Storm Rita. 
   Violators of Florida's anti-gouging law are subject to civil penalties of $1,000 per violation. In 2005, the State of Florida enacted criminal penalties for those who engage in price gouging. 
   In addition to the protections that Florida consumers already have in place through State law enforcement, the Federal Trade Commission has the authority to investigate and bring charges against those that engage in price gouging. 
   In a significant departure from previous legislation addressing this issue, Floridians who are gouged would not receive a rebate. Instead, H.R. 1252 would direct any fines collected from gougers to a program that largely benefits the Northeast and the Midwest. Previous legislation on this matter directed that any fines collected from price gouging be returned to the State where the gouging occurred so that the consumers could be reimbursed. H.R. 1252, however, directs that all of these funds instead be placed in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance, LIHEAP, fund. Unfortunately for the residents of Florida, this is a fund that they get little benefit from. The primary beneficiaries LIHEAP grants are those living in the Northeast and Midwest. While New York and Florida have populations that are nearly equal, New York received 10 times the amount of LIHEAP money that Florida received ($247 million for New York vs. $26 million for Florida). Other large beneficiaries include: New York, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Illinois. In fact, on a per capita basis, no state does worse than Florida when it comes to  LIHEAP. The bottom line is that if Florida consumers get gouged, those living in the Northeast and the Midwest get the rebate. 
   This bill is more about show than about substance. Even the comprehensive investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, in the aftermath of hurricane's Katrina and Rita found no gouging or anti-trust violations. 
   The real driver of price for gas is the growing global demand for energy. The rapid growth in the worldwide demand for crude oil is being driven primarily by economic growth in China, India and the United States. 
   Ironically, during a Congressional hearing on this bill, the proponents of the bill offered some bizarre testimony. When asked if the oil companies were engaging in collusion--which is already illegal--a proponent of the bill offered that what was being engaged in is ``conscious parallelism.'' He then offered that you cannot prove ``conscious parallelism'' in court, so this bill does virtually nothing to address that. Another advocate for the price-gouging bill testified before the committee that ``drilling [for oil] will do nothing to lower the price of oil.'' I am concerned that these individuals are so dedicated to an ideology that they defy common sense. 
   The most important thing we can do to lower the price of gas for American consumers and to ensure our energy independence is to expand domestic energy production, expand refining capacity in the U.S. by reducing excessive burdens, encouraging more nuclear power, fostering the development of renewable energy, and encouraging conservation. Unfortunately, it took us 12 years to end the Democrat filibuster that kept America from developing more oil and gas off the Outer Continental Shelf, OCS. Last year we were successful in opening a small portion of the OCS to oil and gas recovery, and I hope that we can build on that success. Also, last year we secured passage of legislation that allows for greater production of oil and gas from Federal lands. Unfortunately, Democrat leaders have introduced legislation and are holding hearings to close off those sources of domestic energy production. We streamlined regulations for nuclear power plants, yet Democrats are considering injecting new regulations into the process. I was also pleased that we were able to secure passage of renewable energy tax credits. I have cosponsored legislation to extend these tax cuts for renewable energy and conservation so they are not allowed to expire. 
   The Democrats expression of ``outrage'' over gas prices is a bit ironic given that they are the ones who have consistently proposed higher gas taxes, higher energy taxes like the proposed BTU tax, and who are presently moving forward with ``cap and trade'' global warming legislation along the lines of what has been adopted in Europe. As the Washington Post pointed out last month, this cap and trade system has led German consumers to pay 25 percent more for electricity than they did two years ago, while German utilities are making record profits. This higher cost for electricity has made it difficult for some European countries to compete with cheaper foreign imports, resulting in European workers losing their jobs. 
   The rhetoric simply does not match the policies being advocated by the Democrat majority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise today in opposition to the Progressive Caucus budget. 
   This debate today could be described as a debate about the good, the bad, and the ugly. A kinder way you could describe it is the responsible, the irresponsible, and the reckless. 
   We are going to have the House Republican budget brought forward on this floor today, brought forward by our chairman, Mr. Ryan, a responsible budget, a good budget, a budget that comes to balance in 5 years without raising taxes and tries to address the challenge that we face in the category of entitlements. 
   We have the Democrat leadership budget that is going to be brought forward, a budget that has the biggest tax increase in our Nation's history, and a budget, I might add, that not only includes significant increases in spending, but as well makes no effort to deal with the challenge of entitlements. I will just quote from the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Chairman Bernanke, who said, ``Without early  and meaningful action to address entitlements, the U.S. economy could be seriously weakened, with future generations bearing much of the cost.'' 
   Now, the budget alternative that we have right now in front of us I would describe as the ugly or the reckless or the completely irresponsible, because not only does it include the biggest tax increase in our Nation's history and significant increases in spending; it runs up entitlement spending even further. And the part that I think is the most egregious, it actually calls the effort of our brave women and men fighting in Afghanistan, fighting in Iraq to establish a beacon of liberty in that dark area of the world, it calls that effort the single largest waste of taxpayers' money and the biggest current drain on the U.S. Treasury today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this alternative budget and vote ``yes'' on the Republican budget.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - March 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my objections to the budget put forward by the new majority in the Congress. Their budget proposes the largest tax increase in American history and it presses the accelerator on government spending. 
   What Washington has is not a revenue problem, but a spending problem. Revenues from taxes flowing into the U.S. Treasury have been flowing at record levels. Even when you factor in the $1 trillion dollar tax relief that was enacted by President Bush and a Republican Congress, the taxes that came into the Treasury in 2006 were exactly what the Congressional Budget Office projected they would be back in March 2000--nearly 9 months before President Bush proposed such tax relief. Clearly, Washington's problem is not a revenue problem. Washington has a spending problem. 
   Yet the Democrat budget plan fails to recognize this and instead they choose more taxes and more spending. They fail to extend important tax relief that has given Americans more control over their lives and businesses. It will put the breaks on the economic expansion that has put the United States in the enviable position of having the most vibrant and growing economy over the last 4 years. We have led the developed world in the creation of new jobs over the past 4 years--creating 7.6 million new jobs for Americans. 
   Not only does the Democrat budget impose the largest tax increase in our Nation's history, but it also puts spending on an upward trajectory that will further imperil our children's future, saddling them with even more debt. Not only does the Democrat budget fail to address the growth of entitlement spending that is imperiling our children's future, but also it makes the problem worse by putting off needed changes and by increasing domestic discretionary spending at a rate that exceeds the rate of inflation. 
   With regard to tax increases, Democrats had a time during the House Budget Committee meeting to adopt amendments protecting the tax relief that Americans are enjoying today. The Democrats voted lock step against each and every amendment that would have protected the tax relief that Americans are currently enjoying and that is spurring our economy. 
   Don't take my word for it, just look at the Washington Post. They sum it up in today's paper:  
   ``Democrats say they want to preserve key parts of Bush's signature tax cuts, they project a surplus in 2012 only by assuming that all of the cuts expire on schedule in 2010.'' 
   ``But the [Democrat budget] proposal, set for a vote today, requires either that millions of middle-class families be hit with higher taxes next spring or that somebody else pay an extra $50 billion. . . . That stark choice is the result of the inexorable expansion of the alternative minimum tax, a parallel tax structure that adds $6,800, on average, to a family's tax bill. Next month, an estimated 4.2 million Americans will pay the tax. Next spring, that number will balloon to 23 million unless Congress takes action.  
   Sadly, the Democrat's budget has no plan for addressing the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). Someone will face a $50 billion tax increase under the Democrats budget--we will have to see who is next on their hit list as they have already taken aim to repeal most all of the tax relief provided to Americans since 2001. Just what tax increases are already in store for Americans? 
   The Florida sales tax deduction is repealed in this budget. Floridians will be hit harder than most Americans by the Democrats tax plan, as Floridians will no longer be afforded the opportunity to deduct sales taxes. While resident's of states that have a state income tax can deduct those costs from their taxes, Floridians have no such deduction, so I was pleased when we were finally able to give Floridians equal treatment by allowing a sales tax deduction--about $650 dollars for a family of 5 earning $40,000 per year. The Democrat bill repeals this tax deduction. 
   Taxes on dividends will increase. This will hit senior citizens the hardest as they often rely on safe and secure investments to supplement their Social Security benefits in their golden years. 
   The child tax credit is cut in half falling from $1,000 per child to $500 per child as if the cost of raising and caring for children is going down. 
   Democrats resurrect the marriage tax penalty forcing married couples to pay more in taxes that those living together out of wedlock. 
   The death tax will be resurrected making it difficult for mom and pop businesses to be handed down to their children. 
   Marginal tax rates will increase for all Americans. The lowest wage income tax payers will see their tax bill increase by 50 percent, paying a 15 percent tax rate rather than a 10 percent tax rate. 
   Capital gains tax rates will be raised significantly. For any student of the recent economic growth in our Nation knows that the capital gains tax cuts have been a significant driver of economic growth in the U.S. over the past 4 years. And, the stimulative effect that the cut in capitals gains has had on our economy has actually resulted in more revenue flowing into the U.S. Treasury than would have flowed with out the cut in capital gains taxes. Raising these taxes, as the Democrats are doing will put the breaks on our economy and slow economic growth. 
   If there is any doubt about where the heart of the Democrat party in Congress lies on taxes and spending, only consider the votes that we just held. Over half of the Democrats in the House of Representatives just voted for the substitute budget offered by Representative KILPATRICK. That budget proposal raised taxes by more than $919 billion--more than 2 times the amount in the underlying Democrat budget. This is not really surprising given that the underlying Democrat budget is still $200 billion below the amount of increased taxes they will need to carry out their spending plans in their budget. So, Americans should be prepared, this proposed $400 billion budget that the Democrats are poised to approve today is just the opening shot. More tax hikes are in store. 
   I would like to briefly address the spending side of the Democrat budget. Their budget favors higher spending. They put both entitlement spending and spending through annual appropriations bills (known as discretionary spending) on a path to receive automatic increases each and every year.  
   Earlier this year, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued their report on the financial status of Medicare. They stated that Medicare will go bankrupt in a couple of years. Yet, rather that seeking to address this issue, the Democrats simply ignore the realities and pretend that this problem does not exist. It is irresponsible for the Democrats to simply stick their head in the sand and pretend that Medicare will not run out of money, but that is the path they have chosen--their budget does nothing to address this looming bankruptcy. I believe our seniors deserve better. If we simply allowed entitlement programs to grow at 4.1 percent a year rather than the 4.7 percent a year proposed in the Democrats budget, we could save Medicare and Social Security for future generations. 
   Their PAYGO rules continue not only to favor automatic increases in spending and higher taxes, but they also allow them to spend now and pay for the spending later. By spending now, they also increase the baseline budget so that it is easier to continue increased spending in future years. 
   The Democrat budget also eliminates the domestic emergency reserve fund contained in the current law, and provides no criteria for domestic emergency spending--which is exempt from budget disciplines. Absent a reserve fund, Democrats are destined to repeat in 2008, what they just did this month--designate another $28 billion in ``emergency spending'' bypassing all of the budgetary discipline rules. If there is any doubt about the Democrats' lack of budgetary discipline the fact that the majority of their caucus just voted for substitute budgets that increase taxes by between $950 and $717 billion. That is more than twice the tax increase in their base bill. And on the spending side, these alternative budgets would have increased spending by hundreds of billions of dollars more. 
   Another unrealistic assumption in the Democrat budget plan is their assumption that they will receive over $392.5 billion in new tax revenue that they will be able to use for spending and reducing the deficit by closing the mystical tax gap. Yet The Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service has testified the IRS could collect, at best, about $20 billion of these taxes 5 years after implementing specific policies recommended in the President's budget. 
   The Democrats remove the firewall between defense and non-defense spending enabling them to cut the defense spending further and spend the money on other programs. 
   If there was ever any doubt about that Congressional Democrats are the party of ``Tax and Spend'' those doubts are put to bed today, as they have come out in spades for both.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise to speak about an amendment that was introduced by me in the committee, and overwhelmingly adopted by the committee by voice vote. And I rise mainly to address the concerns being raised by members of the American Academy of Pediatrics and other members sending letters to the Congress from the public health community. 
   Let me state from the outset, as a physician, I strongly support vaccinating children and adults. Indeed, I gave a lot of vaccines. Immunizing kids against the flu is a particularly good idea. It prevents the kids from getting the flu, but it also, because children have bad personal hygiene and they tend to spread the flu around if they get it, by vaccinating kids and preventing them from getting the flu you actually prevent adults from getting the flu. 
   Certainly I believe the American Academy of Pediatrics is a great organization, as are the public health officials who do the work in administering these vaccines, even though they are complaining about my amendment.  
   Let me just state from the outset, my amendment simply implements the policy that the American Academy of Pediatrics established in 1999, when they stated, The Public Health Service, the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers agree that thimerosal-containing vaccines should be removed as soon as possible. My amendment does nothing more than implement that policy. 
   Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that is toxic. If I brought some thimerosal to this Chamber, spilled it on that table, we would have to evacuate the Chamber. That is how toxic it is. 
   Now, in 1999, the manufacturers, in coordination with the AAP, the CDC and the drug industry, removed all of the mercury from all of the childhood vaccines in 18 months. They removed it from the DPT and the hepatitis B. Eighteen months after adopting that policy in 1999, all of the pediatric vaccines had been produced and manufactured without any mercury in them. And then in 2004, a decision was made to add flu vaccine to the vaccine scheduled for children. And since that time it has been very difficult for me to get the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC and the manufacturers to take this issue seriously and get the mercury out of the childhood vaccines. 
   And let me just also add, this is a bipartisan issue. I have a bill that I've introduced with Representative Carolyn Maloney from New York to get all this mercury out. There are many Democrats and many Republicans on this bill. 
   Now, some of the people who are opposing my amendment are actually claiming that children who were not vaccinated last year who got the flu died, and if there's not enough flu vaccine available, that more children may not get vaccinated and there may be more deaths. I would like to just simply point out that one of the issues here is public confidence in the vaccine program, and that many of these parents who didn't get their kids vaccinated maybe didn't get their kids vaccinated because they were concerned about the mercury in the flu vaccine. And, indeed, you might ask the question of the deaths that occurred last year, might some of them not have occurred if we had a mercury-free vaccine on the market? 
   Now, I want to refer to this chart briefly because I think this basically says it all. 
   In 2004, we were producing a little bit over 80 million doses of flu vaccine, and today we're producing over 130 million doses. But yet, officials have made no attempt to increase the amount of mercury-free vaccine that is being produced in this country. Mind you, the Europeans are producing more than enough mercury-free to vaccinate their kids. They have figured out how to do it. Mind you, I said earlier 18 months was all it took to get the mercury out of all of the other childhood vaccines. And why, after all these years, year after year, they say they want to get the mercury out of the childhood vaccines and they're not doing it. They're got getting it out of the flu vaccine. And they can do it and they will do it. 
   What this really boils down to, my colleagues, is an issue of leadership. CDC, AAP, the public health community has not exercised proper leadership on this issue, and it falls to us to do the right thing. 
   The language that I put in this bill is not covering this flu season, it's covering next flu season. They have more than a year to address this issue. I think they can. And that's why I put that language in the bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE COOPERATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concerns about H.R. 980. Unfortunately, this bill, like many under the new majority has come to the House floor under a closed process that prevents Members of Congress from offering any amendment to this bill. 
   Florida is a right-to-work State, and while the proponents of the legislation argue that this bill does not preempts states rights, the details of the bill simply do not match the rhetoric. 
   This bill, which is opposed by the National League of Cities, has the effect of forcing thousands of State and local governments to recognize union officials as the exclusive bargaining agents of public-safety officers. Under the process established in this bill--even in right to work states--if union organizers win the representation of 50 percent of workers plus one, they are recognized as the sole bargaining representative of each and every public safety officer. This preempts State laws and strips tens of thousands of police and firemen of their freedom to negotiate directly with their employer. This is tantamount to compulsory unionizing. The bill amounts to an unprecedented federalization of collective bargaining; an area traditionally left to State and local governments. This issue was succinctly stated by R. Theodore Clark who testified on behalf of the National Public Employer Labor Relations Association during the Committee hearing on H.R. 980 when he said:   
   [My] opposition to federal collective bargaining legislation such as H.R. 980 is not because I oppose public sector collective bargaining, but rather because of my firm belief that the enactment of a federal collective bargaining law would severely limit the demonstrated innovative and creative abilities of the states and local jurisdictions to deal in a responsible manner with the many complex issues that the public sector collective bargaining poses.   
   Finally, concerns have been raised that H.R. 980 might endanger public safety by decimating volunteer fire departments that currently protect countless small communities across America. A fact well understood and opposed by small community mayors and volunteer firefighters across the country. 
   Our local cites and States are the best deciders of how to provide vital services to our citizens. We should not tie their hands by establishing a ``one size fits all'' Federal pattern that cannot hope to account for the unique conditions and structures that our states and localities face. It is for this reason and the decision by the majority leadership to deny the ability of members of Congress to address these shortcomings that I could not vote for final passage of H.R. 980.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (COLLEGE COST REDUCTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in support of efforts to make college education more affordable for more Americans. Indeed earlier this year I voted in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. I believed that bill took some positive steps and was pleased to support it. 
   I am very disappointed that the bill before us, H.R. 2669, falls far short of its goal. While those who drafted the bill assert that it is a comprehensive solution to making college more affordable, H.R. 2669 fails to address the core problem of access to U.S. colleges and universities: sky-rocketing rates of tuition and room and board. In just the last 7 years, yearly inflation has increased on average 2.7 percent. However, higher education costs for students has increased an average of 4.2 percent--a rate that is 55 percent higher than regular inflation. This bill makes it easier for students to borrow more money to face these costs, but it does nothing to fix the root problem. And, the end result will be that under H.R. 2669, the average college student graduating from college 4 years from now will still face a higher college debt than those graduating this year--even with all of the billions of dollars included in this bill. Why is that the case? Because this bill does nothing to address the core problem facing college students: uncontrolled growth in tuition, room and board. 
   Under H.R. 2669, those attending college in the future will be able to borrow more money and perhaps pay a lower interest rate, but with college expenses growing at a rate that far exceeds the annual inflation rate, students will end college with a significantly larger debt. By failing to address this fundamental problem, this bill avoids the major issue facing families and college students. It is due to this obvious omission that I could not vote for final passage of this bill.  
   H.R. 2669 will enable students to take on more debt which will further burden them for many years past graduation. In 2006, the Higher Education Price Index, HEPI, calculation showed that inflation for colleges and universities jumped to 5 percent. This is 30 percent higher than the regular inflation rate. When colleges and universities know that students have access to more funds through financial aid, loans, and grants they have simply seen this as an opportunity to raise costs for students. This was the case in the past and it is likely to happen again. 
   This bill does nothing to discourage colleges and universities from further inflating their tuition rates. In fact, it will do the opposite. If we truly want to help our students go into the world with a good education and saddled with less debt, we should hold colleges and universities who take government aid more accountable and not allow them to continue their excessive increases in college costs. Our students deserve better.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concerns about the substance of the legislation before us as well as the manner in which it is being considered. 
   The bill before us will have virtually no impact on those living and working in the state of Florida. Florida voters 3 years ago approved a ballot initiative setting a minimum wage rate higher than the federal rate and indexing it for inflation. Assuming enactment of this bill later this spring, it is important to note that the federal rate is not likely to catch up to Florida's minimum wage until mid-2009 only to once again fall behind in January 2010. 
   Just six months ago, I joined 230 of my colleagues, including 34 Democrats, in passing a bill that increased the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour while also providing important tax relief to help small businesses transition to the higher wage. Unfortunately, that bill was filibustered by Senate Democrats. This marrying of a minimum wage increase with small business tax relief was modeled on the successful approach we took in 1996 when a bipartisan coalition of 160 Republicans and 193 Democrats, including now Speaker Pelosi. I am pleased that Senate is pursing a bipartisan approach and building on this past success. 
   Unfortunately, the Democrat leadership in the House has chosen to break with tradition, choosing partisanship over partnership, by bringing to the House floor a minimum wage bill that excludes tax relief to help small businesses transition to the higher wage. Congressional Quarterly lamented on January 8 that ``House Democrats have established rules for floor debate ..... that will block Republicans from offering any amendment. .....'' The Congressional Budget Office puts cost of this bill at over $16 billion for small business and nearly $1 billion for the federal government. Once again, Democrats break their opening day promise by excluding this $1 billion from their ``pay-go'' promises. 
   What has been absent from today's debate is a discussion about what the real downward pressure is on U.S. workers wages--illegal workers. After the federal government cracked down on illegal immigrants working at meat processing plants across the U.S., the company was forced to pay American workers a higher wage. Cracking down on illegal immigration, rather than granting amnesty to over 11 million illegal immigrants will do more to improve the wages of the working poor than a law increasing the minimum wage. 
   Finally, some have suggested that raising the minimum wage is the best approach to helping those living in poverty. There are much better and more targeted approaches to assisting the working poor, a minimum wage increase is a very blunt tool in doing that. Consider these facts: 
   The average minimum wage earner lives in a household with income above $50,000/year 
   Less than 1 in 25 minimum wage earners are single parents who work full-time--very few families rely on minimum wage job to support a family. 
   Only one in five minimum wage earners lives below the poverty level. 
   The least skilled and most disadvantaged workers are the first ones to lose jobs when the minimum wage is increased. 
   68 percent of Americans live in states that have a higher minimum wage. 
   67 percent of minimum wage earners get a raise within the first year of employment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my concerns about the bill before us (H.R. 3221 and H.R. 2776). While there are a number of good provisions in the bill, including the incorporation of several renewable energy provisions from legislation that I have cosponsored, these bills also contain seriously objectionable provisions. 
   As a member of the House Renewable Energy Caucus I am supportive of many of the renewable energy provisions in the bill. I have been very supportive of securing funding for solar and hydrogen energy research nationally and in my congressional district. 
   I also believe that conservation is important and am pleased that several important conservation provisions are included in the bill. Certainly conservation remains an important part of meeting our future energy needs and energy independence. I am disappointed, however, that while pursuing conservation initiatives this bill takes unnecessary steps that hamper our Nation's domestic energy production. 
   I am disappointed that this bill not only does very little to enhance domestic energy production but is counterproductive in that it takes a number of steps that will raise the cost of energy on the American people and American businesses. One provision in the bill will cost Florida consumers alone, over $4 billion. Furthermore, through its restrictions and higher taxes on domestic production of fossil fuels, this bill will result in increased imports from overseas. 
   At this time when American consumers and businesses are being taxed due to higher energy prices the Democrat bill that is being brought to the House floor will actually exacerbate this problem. It is also troubling that the Democrats have denied Members of the House the opportunity to offer and discuss over 100 amendments that they filed to this bill. Furthermore, of the 23 amendments that were allowed to be considered under the Democrat rules only five of them were offered by Republicans. The American people deserve better. 
   This bill: Locks up additional reserves so that we cannot extract oil and natural gas; 
   Raises taxes on domestic energy suppliers--giving foreign oil and gas producers a competitive edge over U.S. producers; and 
   Raises the costs of all energy projects undertaken in this bill--costing billions of dollars--by applying Davis-Bacon wage requirements for any energy project undertaken through this bill. 
   Additional specific provisions in the bill that will do nothing to increase domestic energy supplies and in fact increase energy costs for the American people include: 
   A $15.3 billion in tax increase on domestic fossil fuel producers; 
   Sunsetting tax credits for refined coal at the end of 2008; 
   Banning natural gas drilling for 4.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Roan Plateau in Colorado; 
   Applying Davis-Bacon (union wage) requirements to all projects resulting from the tax credit bonds authorized under this bill--raising labor costs on such projects by 20 percent-30 percent; 
   Giving New York City $2 billion to use for any transportation project of their choosing--the Chairman of the Committee represents New York City; 
   Phasing out the tax credit for hybrid vehicles after more than 60,000 of them have been sold--discouraging further production and purchase of the most popular hybrid vehicles; 
   Raising taxes on oil and gas companies for the costs of oil and natural gas exploration; 
   Restricting the tax credit on biodiesel produced in the U.S.; 
   Creating a $1 billion foreign aid program for energy efficiency programs in developing countries; 
   Allowing individuals to sue the Federal Government for damages caused by global warming; 
   Giving bureaucrats a longer time period in which to approve oil and gas drilling permits; 
   Imposing Federal building energy codes on States; 
   Permanently authorizing the expenditure of $125 million a year for a grant program; 
   Creating a new global warming bureaucracy in the U.S. Department of State that will cost American taxpayers $750 million; 
   Putting the government in the role of picking winners and losers which leads to serious inefficiency; 
   Directing the U.S. Government to negotiate costly global warming treaties with developed countries--leaving developing countries like China and India free from such costly mandates on their competing industries; 
   Cutting $1.2 billion from agriculture producers and shifts it to already subsidized biodiesel companies; 
   Spending an unlimited amount of money on a cap-and-trade program whereby Federal agencies can purchase greenhouse gas emission offsets--already proven to be very expensive for consumers in Europe; 
   Making it more difficult to develop oil and gas on Federal lands by closing down Bureau of Land Management offices; 
   Slowing the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, tar sands leasing program; and 
   Including dozens of additional costly mandates on businesses and individuals that are essentially hidden taxes. 
   It is no wonder that this bill is opposed by a host of organizations, including businesses, seniors, and energy organizations. This bill  does little to relieve the high energy costs that consumers and businesses are paying today, and in fact; it raises the cost of energy for consumers, businesses, State governments, and the Federal Government. This bill does nothing to enhance our access to oil and natural gas. It does nothing to enhance the development of clean coal technology--a supply of which we could meet our nation's energy needs for the next 200 years. The bill does nothing to enhance our use of nuclear energy--a source of energy that produces zero greenhouse gases. 
   It is important that we not view this bill in a vacuum. We must consider it along with other steps the current Democrat majority has taken that hamper our ability to move toward energy independence. 
   Earlier this year the Democrat majority voted to prohibit the Department of Interior from issuing oil shale leases in Utah and Wyoming. They defeated an amendment that would have permitted offshore drilling. They voted to shut down the state of Virginia's plan to allow for drilling solely along their own coast. They voted against allowing drilling for oil in a small portion of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, ANWR, which has oil deposits large enough to replace our imports from Saudi Arabia. 
   I urge that this bill be rejected and that provisions that hamper our energy independence be removed. The President has said that he will veto this bill because it ``would lead to less domestic oil and gas production, higher energy costs, and higher taxes .....'' 
   Higher energy costs for American consumers will tax the family budget and will jeopardize American jobs by making it more difficult for American businesses to compete in an increasingly competitive international marketplace.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise to say while I am pleased with many of the provisions in this bill, and I certainly want to commend the chairman particularly for a hard-fought negotiation with the other body on the issue of getting a toxic substance, mercury, out of the injections that we give little babies, I have to vote ``no'' on this conference report. I want to make very clear that there is an important, I think, distinction. There has been a lot of discussion back and forth about how we had combined appropriations bills in the past as the majority is doing today. At least my recollection of the facts in the past, we were forced to combine appropriations bills typically because there was a problem getting these bills through the other body because they wanted more spending and we wanted less spending. 
   The purpose of the combination here tonight is to achieve more spending. Now, I saw a poll recently, and it truly amazed me, if you asked the American people a question, do you think the Federal Government taxes and spends too much, you get about 85 percent of Americans agree with that statement. Indeed, a majority of Democrats feel that we tax and spend too much. This bill increases spending $21.2 billion over last year. 
   Now, the majority has been very quick to point out this is less than what we will spend in 2 months in Iraq and Afghanistan as if we can't deal with those problems and we can walk away from them. I think we have all agreed in this body, we have to try to see the war on terror and the challenges we have there through. But the important point with those conflicts is they will some day end; whereas, the money that is going in this bill will be incorporated in the baseline, and next year, all of these dollars will be increased another, I don't know, what, 3, 4, 5 percent. Depending on how you do the calculations, this $21 billion of increased spending could be $200 billion  in 7 years, 10 years, and in my opinion, we have a responsibility to make tough decisions. And this bill is an attempt to achieve additional spending over and above the President's request. In my opinion, it just goes too far. 
   I also want to just mention one other item. There are a lot of items in this bill. We cut the Department of Labor 20 percent that oversees our unions. When I first got on this committee, I have to say, I was shocked to see the loose degree of regulation and oversight that we have. The unions have to file a document called an LM-2, which details all their spending. And I saw a document from one union. It was a big union. They had taken in about $78 million. It was one page on one side. The reason it had gotten so bad is because, under the previous administration, oversight had been very, very lax. And this administration, because it is the union workers' money, and how it gets spent needs to be monitored because sometimes it is abused, and it is funneled into political operations inappropriately, this bill reduces that level of oversight. Now, I think that is taking us in a wrong direction. 
   While there are a lot of features in this bill I think are good, I am forced to vote ``no'' on the conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2272, AMERICA COMPETES ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my concerns about the final conference report on H.R. 2272. 
   There are many good provision in the bill, and as a medical doctor, I share the goal of increasing participation in math and science education and in fostering research in these critical areas. In particular, I applaud funding for the National Science Foundation. 
   However, I am concerned about the level of increase that is in this bill for the National Science Foundation--amounting to a 12 percent increase in each of the next four years. The NSF bill that the House approved earlier this year, and which I voted for, provided about an 8 percent annual increase for NSF. I was concerned over the fact that because NSF and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) compete for the same pot of money, increasing NSF by more than this amount might cause problems for our national space program. Now that the bill has come back from the Senate and the House-Senate Conference Committee with a 13 percent annual increase for NSF each year through 2011, I am very concerned about the threat this poses to our human space flight program. 
   While this bill says that it is the sense of the Congress that NASA should be funded at the 2005 authorization level in FY08, the Democrat Majority could not even accomplish this goal for FY07 when the new Democrat leadership cut over a half a billion dollars for the space exploration account and funded NASA at only $16.2 billion--$1.7 billion below the authorized level. In addition, the House-passed Commerce State Justice Appropriations Bill for FY 2008 actually funded NASA at $17.6 billion--$1.2 billion below the authorized level. So, while H.R. 2272 includes nice rhetoric about fully funding NASA, the authors of H.R. 2272 know that such rhetoric is empty. 
   Additionally, I am concerned that the bill creates 40 new federal programs, 20 more than were in the House-passed version. Many of these new programs are duplicative of over 200 existing federal science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs and will siphon money away from research in order to fund bloated bureaucracies. 
   My belief is that there is no program that inspires interest and study in math and the sciences like our nation's space program. So recognition of this fact should follow with adequate and fair funding levels. This bill jeopardizes that and, unfortunately, I cannot support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise in opposition to this bill. 
   If this bill becomes law, it will establish a new precedent for our government. For the first time, we will be funding researchers who are knowingly destroying human embryos in the course of their research, and that is really what this debate is essentially about. 
   This Congress enacted legislation over 10 years ago, and President Bill Clinton signed it, specifying that no Federal funds will be used for research that involves the destruction of a human embryo. This piece of legislation takes us down a path that overturns that. 
   Now, the advocates for this legislation assert that this is necessary because of the great potential of embryonic stem cells, and I rise essentially as a physician and a concerned American to challenge that notion based on  my understanding of embryonic stem cells. And by the way, we have heard it said repeatedly that embryonic stem cells have only been studied for 8 years. They have been studied for 25 years in the mouse. Eight years in the human model, but 25 years in the mouse. 
   All embryonic stem cells form tumors. All of them. Indeed, if you are in the research lab, that is how you determine you actually have an embryonic stem cell. You put it in an animal, and it forms a tumor called a teratoma.     
   They have never been shown not only to be really good and therapeutic, but they have never been shown to be safe. Before an embryonic stem cell therapy could ever be approved by the FDA, it would have been to be shown to be both effective, which embryonic stem cells have never been shown to be; and as well, safe, and the very nature of embryonic stem cells renders them unsafe. 
   So why is this such a critical debate? Why is this such an important debate? It is simply because this is not necessary and it is morally wrong. It is morally wrong because it takes us down a path where we will be saying certain forms of human life are expendable and can be discarded. And it is totally unnecessary, because they have never been shown to be therapeutically useful. 
   Furthermore, we were just amazed to discover that in the amniotic fluid are cells that behave just like these embryonic stem cells, but they don't form tumors. It is not ethically controversial to use them, and they have all the potential that embryonic stem cells have been shown to have in the lab. 
   So I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this legislation. Support the President of the United States, and just remember, just remember, that there are absolutely no restrictions on this research in the private sector. This is all about Federal dollars and how they are going to be used.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this motion to recommit, and I would encourage all of my colleagues to vote for it. Why are we offering this motion to recommit? It is really very, very simple. This institution, the House of Representatives, is previously on multiple occasions on record being in opposition to human cloning, both human cloning for the purpose of creating a baby and human cloning for the purpose of creating embryos for research purposes. 
   Why do we bring this up? Why do we offer this motion to recommit in its current form? Well, it is very, very simple. Some of the labs that are going to get the money under this bill are currently pursuing an agenda of human cloning. I would encourage you all to go to the Harvard medical school Web site. You can pull this down. I have it right here. I would be very interested to share it with any of my colleagues how they are pursuing, through the process that they refer to as Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer, which is human cloning, an agenda to create disease-specific cell lines for embryonic stem cells. That is their agenda through the process of cloning. 
   Now, we are on record wanting to make it illegal, make it criminal, to do human cloning. This motion to recommit doesn't do that. This says something much milder than that, and this is why I think most people in this body should be very, very comfortable with this motion to recommit. It simply says, we don't want to be using Federal dollars in a lab that is engaging in human cloning. If we can't get through the Senate a ban, a total ban on human cloning, at least let's make sure that, as we move forward in this brave new world of using human embryos in research and discarding them, that at least we are not incentivizing cloning. 
   I commend my colleague from Texas and the staff for developing this motion to recommit, and I would just again remind all of my colleagues, we are out of step with the civilized world. Canada, France, Germany and Italy have all completely banned embryo cloning. All the other G-8 countries have serious restrictions on it. This is a restriction on human cloning, a simple, mild restriction that we won't allow Federal dollars to be going to a lab that is doing cloning.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (STEM CELL RESEARCH -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this summer has been a breath-taking one for stem cell researchers around the world, but not because of embryonic stem cells or cloning. Building on important work published last year showing that it is possible to reprogram an adult cell back to its primitive embryonic-like state, researchers led by Doug Melton at Harvard University have done what was thought impossible only a few short years ago. Melton and his team used mice to show that it is possible to directly reprogram support cells or exocrine cells of the pancreas into insulin-producing beta cells without ever removing any cells from the pancreas. Amazingly, it appears that one adult cell type has been directly and specifically transformed into another adult cell type. In other words, a simple injection of three critical reprogramming factors successfully produced insulin-producing beta cells and gave patients with diabetes and their families new reason to hope in the power of regenerative medicine. 
   Melton and his colleagues have brought us one step closer to what many have called the ``holy grail'' of regenerative medicine. He has shown that, in principle, it is possible to induce the body to heal itself by reprogramming one cell type into another. Imagine that; your beta cells can no longer make insulin and you are diabetic, perhaps because of immune destruction of your insulin-producing cells like in Type I diabetes, or perhaps because, like in Type II diabetes, your insulin-producing cells have just given up. 
   If the work Melton describes can be reproduced in human patients, diabetes patients would have to receive a simple injection, maybe two or three times, and with that, their pancreas could resume producing insulin and they would be cured of their diabetes, no longer requiring insulin injections, no longer requiring painful pinpricks. 
   Of course, Melton's work is a long way from the clinic. Mice are not people, and some of the details must be modified to ensure that the injection is safe and won't cause tumors. But this work represents an enormous step forward and should be pursued with all of the resources NIH can provide. 
   This exciting news comes on the heels of another announcement also this summer, that researchers from Harvard and Columbia have used the reprogramming protocol to create 21 disease-specific stem cell lines that will enable researchers to intimately study diseases such as Lou Gehrig's disease, Type I diabetes, Parkinson's and muscular dystrophy. And it is important to note that this technique also does not require the creation, destruction or even the presence of human embryos. These cells may not be ready to transplant into humans in the near term, but they will be available for research today and for use in screening for drugs. 
   So in a few short months, the promise of regenerative medicine comes closer to reality. Just last year, scientists and cloning advocates told us that we had to do human cloning--or at least to create cloned human embryos--so that we could accomplish these two goals that were deemed essential for moving regenerative medicine forward; creating disease-specific cell lines, and regenerating stem cells that could be a perfect match for patients affected by these diseases. 
   Both of these goals have been accomplished with the reprogramming protocol; no cloning, no human embryo stem cells required. To say it another way, there is no medical reason to proceed with research into cloning human embryos for their stem cells because that science is obsolete, it is more cumbersome, it is more expensive. We have a better, quicker, easier way to do it. 
   Now, I will note that these researchers who were involved with these breath-taking breakthroughs have done the politically correct thing and have said we still have to move forward with embryo stem cell research for compelling reasons. What those compelling reasons are I do not know. And I disagree with them. It cannot be denied that research is moving forward at a breakneck speed, and the Bush policy is still fully in place. 
   This work also lends more support for all the adult stem cell work that we have been talking about in this body for years. For years, embryonic stem cell research advocates have claimed that only embryonic stem cells can be transformed this way. Now we have direct evidence that it is not necessary. Science is moving beyond the debate. Science is taking us in a direction of ethically responsible research.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND MEDICARE PROTECTION ACT OF 2007--Continued -- (House of Representatives - August 01, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I rise to express my opposition to the bill before us. As a physician who still sees patients I find this piece of legislation to be completely unacceptable and extremely irresponsible. 
   The Democrat majority--under the guise of providing insurance to uninsured lower-income children--has chosen to expand the State Children Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) far beyond its original intent of insuring low-income children. What is worse, they've chosen to pay for it by cutting benefits for Seniors and other Medicare beneficiaries by more than $157 billion. 
   They have rushed this 500-page bill to the House floor without first allowing the committees of jurisdiction to fully debate and amend the bill. They introduced their bill last night just before midnight. Shortly after midnight, they added a 45-page amendment. This morning they made this available to Members of the House. Now they have only allowed two hours of debate and denied Members of Congress any opportunity to offer amendments to the bill. In fact, they are brazenly complaining that by giving Members time to read the bill, it would unnecessarily delay moving this bill forward. 
   What is so offensive about suggesting that Members of Congress have an opportunity to read the bill before being asked to vote on it? Why the rush? Why the secrecy? Why are they shutting down the legislative process and rushing this bill through before anyone can read it? 
   It is because they don't want the American people to know what they are doing until it is too late. And they don't want Members of Congress to know what they are voting on and what the true effects of the legislation will be. 
   They don't want the 780,000 seniors in the state of Florida--including over 40,000 seniors in my congressional district--to know that their Medicare benefits will be cut in order to provide health insurance to non-U.S. citizens, including illegal immigrants, and millions of children who already have health coverage. 
   They don't want 8 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans across this Nation to know that their benefits are being cut so that the SCHIP program can be expanded to subsidize health care benefits for adults in states like New Jersey, some with annual incomes of $80,000 per year. 
   They want to hide from America's seniors the fact that Medicare benefits are being cut in order to subsidize health care benefits to a new group of ``children'' who happen to be between 18 and 25 years of age. 
   They don't want seniors to know that budget experts in Congress estimate that nearly one-half of the children who will be signed up to the SCHIP program after this bill passes--using money that is being cut from Medicare--are simply dropping their private health care coverage in order to get the federal subsidy under the SCHIP program. 
   Earlier this year, I was troubled by the fact that Democrats planned to significantly expand the SCHIP program and I offered an amendment in the House Appropriations Committee that would have focused the program so that states would first be required to ensure that all children in homes earning below 200 percent of the poverty level were covered. My amendment was rejected by the Democrat majority in that Committee who said they opposed it because my amendment would focus the program on serving uninsured children. They made it clear that they had no intent of focusing this program on lower income children, but rather planned to expand the program to those well above the poverty level and to include adults and non-citizens. 
   What else is in this bill that they are trying to hide from the American people? 
   They repeal the requirement that individuals must prove citizenship in order to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP. This opens the program to fraud and the enrollment of illegal immigrants. In 2006, the Inspector General (IG) of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 46 states allowed anyone seeking Medicaid or SCHIP to simply state they were citizens. The IG found that 27 states never sought to verify that enrollees were indeed citizens. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that repealing this requirement will cost $1.9 billion. 
   The bill provides a bonus payment to states that choose not to implement an asset test for those enrolling in SCHIP. In other words, a family could hold assets of as much as $1 million (a house, car, mutual fund) but could still qualify for SCHIP if their income for that year fell within the amount allowed for SCHIP enrollment. For example, a family of four living in a $1 million home in New York with an annual income of $80,000 could qualify for enrollment in SCHIP. And if New York does this--they get a bonus! 
   It is my understanding that this 500-plus-page bill imposes a tax on private health insurance. Certainly, they want to hide that from the American people. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that they don't want the American people to know that they are creating a massive new entitlement program just at the time when the financial strains of the Social Security and Medicare entitlements are being stretched as Baby Boomers retire. They are putting this Nation on a path to bankruptcy by creating a huge new entitlement program that they have no way of sustaining long-term. This is the wrong time to be saddling the American taxpayers with a gigantic new program. 
   Additionally, I am concerned that this bill fails to secure the senior's long-term access to quality physicians. The 1997 Budget Act (a bill I voted against) created a formula that has resulted in payment to doctors being cut. As a result, today some doctors (typically the best doctors with the busiest practices) are starting to refuse to see new Medicare patients. This SCHIP bill does not fix this problem. It provides doctors with a 1 percent increase over 2 years then cuts doctor reimbursement by 12 percent in 2010 and 12 percent in 2011, or 23 percent over 2 years. The effect of these cuts could be devastating with many doctors facing the possibility of losing money when they see Medicare patients. The result will be seniors will not be able to see a doctor. 
   Mr. Speaker, I could go on about the additional cuts to Medicare, including cuts to the following Medicare benefits: home health, end stage renal disease, oxygen therapy, imaging services, dialysis, and skilled nursing facilities. 
   By cutting Medicare and spending the money elsewhere, this bill will make the challenge of securing the long-term solvency of Medicare even more difficult. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is disappointing that the Democrat leaders have chosen to pit health care benefits for America's senior citizens against those of children. There is a better way. Had the Democrat leadership chosen to consider this bill under the regular legislative process, we could have worked through this in a bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI has chosen to put politics before prudence. This bill goes far beyond the bill passed by the Senate, and the President has vowed to veto the House bill. This bill should be sent back to committee and debated in regular order. America's seniors, uninsured children, and the American taxpayer deserve better.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I will be brief. I want to thank you for rising as you have tonight and acknowledging this time for me, my retirement from the U.S. Congress. It is extremely kind and very nice of you to do this. We couldn't be busier than we are today, and for you, JOHN MICA, to take a moment to acknowledge me and as I understand it, you are also going to say a few words about some of the other retiring Members, I think it speaks very well of you. 
   I want to thank you for you being my big brother. I got elected in 1994. I came right out of my medical practice. The delegation or Newt Gingrich assigned you to make sure that I would be able to find the restroom and things like that. Of course I am being silly on that point. You gave me a lot of excellent advice on how to be a good servant  of the people. I want to thank you for that. 
   Certainly I am going to be missing people such as yourself, obviously a man very dedicated to fighting for good Republican conservative principles here in Washington; but really more importantly, American principles of freedom and democracy. So you have been an 
   outstanding role model for me. 
   There will be a replacement for me in a few short months, and perhaps you can take that new congressman under your wing and provide them continued leadership as you have done in the past. 
   I also want to thank you for all you have done for the State of Florida on the Transportation Committee. Your work has been very, very helpful to my constituents and I really think to the entire State. So thank you, JOHN MICA, for all you do. Certainly I extend my thanks to your wonderful wife, Pat. It has been great getting to know her over the years. I am hoping this is not good-bye, that I will be in some capacity involved to the degree I will be able to see you and your family in the months and years ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Well, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I wanted to stay and linger and listen to the direction of your special order here. And I couldn't help but feel the need to come down here and ask you to yield time, and I thank you for doing that. 
   I sat on the Financial Services Committee from 1996 through to 2002. And one of the first things that was brought to my attention, once I got on the committee, was the concern that many of us had on the committee about the rapid growth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two very, very large government-sponsored entities--they call them GSEs. It was sort of a mongrel creation that was somewhat free market, selling stocks and bonds. And then, nonetheless, it had a Federal backing to it creating an impression that it was an arm of the Federal Government. 
   And the concern was, essentially, that it was not a properly regulated entity. There was this very small agency within Treasury called OFHEO, which was given the responsibility, very small staff, very limited number of examiners, to monitor these two gigantic entities that had assets into the trillions--not billions--but trillions of dollars. And the concern that many of us, many of the Republicans had on the committee was that if one of these entities had significant problems, that it could be a major, major hit to our economy. 
   And we got tremendous resistance from the left, from the Democrats. They were telling us there is nothing wrong with Fannie and Freddie. Indeed, what I found to be particularly objectionable whenever we would bring up the thing that we were most concerned about, which was giving loans to people who had limited ability to pay back their loans and the potential systemic effect that that could have on our economy, we were accused of being racists. And low and behold--and thank you for mentioning President Bush. 
   President Bush repeatedly brought bills forward saying Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac represented a significant risk to our economy and that we needed to regulate them better. Of course, the President was rejected by the other side of the aisle in his initiatives, and you can never get anything like this through Congress if you can't get Democrats in the Senate on board because of the cloture rule over there. So we were essentially never able to really move forward in this. 
   And low and behold, it was discovered in 2004 there were significant problems with fraud, abuse, executives getting--cooking the books, getting huge multimillion dollar payoffs. Some of these--a lot of these people were former Clinton administration people. And then low and behold, we come to today where we have this huge meltdown in the real estate market and the Federal Government literally has to step in and take over both of these entities. 
   And the important thing that is worth mentioning, we now have a credit crisis, and the reason we have a credit crisis is we have all of these banks holding stocks and bonds in Freddie and Fannie, a lot of it which is now worthless, and so they're seeing their balance sheets very negatively affected by that. And banks, of course, lend out money on a 10-1 ratio. For every $1 of deposits they have, they can loan out $10.     
   They're seeing hundreds of millions of dollars of their holdings in mortgage-backed securities collapsing in value, and so, therefore, of course, we have a systemic credit crisis and, as a result, one of the toughest economic times that we've had in years and years and years, and a lot of it goes back to failure. 
   And I really appreciate the gentleman doing this because there were many Republicans on that Financial Services Committee, and I was one of them, who wanted to get better regulation, strengthen OFEO so that they would become a better regulatory agency and actually reduce the size of Fannie and Freddie. 
   And I will say this, those two entities should never be allowed to be resuscitated. The good assets they have  should get sold off to private investors. The money, the revenue that comes in from that should be used to repay the taxpayer for the lost taxpayer money that's going to result from us having to bailout Fannie and Freddie, and they should never be allowed to occur again. 
   I'm all for helping lower-income people who have the resources to pay for a mortgage to get into a mortgage, but we shouldn't be doing it to the extent that we did do, and the result now is some of the economic problems we're having today. 
   So thank you, JOHN MICA, for bringing this up. This is an important issue, and I again applaud you for your work on the Government Reform Committee because I know you have been working this issue as well for years.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I want to commend the authors of this piece of legislation, and make very clear that I am a strong supporter of the National Science Foundation. Indeed, I have an undergraduate degree in a science field, biochemistry. I did basic science research as an undergraduate, and I fully recognize the need for this country to make a significant increase in our investment in basic science research as the kind of research that comes through the National Science Foundation. 
   My concern before the committee today is that the National Science Foundation is in the same budget category as NASA; and already, the new majority this year has chosen to significantly cut funding to NASA.  
   Specifically, over one-half billion dollars was reduced out of the NASA budget to fund the replacement for the space shuttle. The replacement for the space shuttle is badly needed. Our shuttle fleet is aging, and indeed we are looking at a scenario in the early part of the next decade where we will not have the capability of putting men and women into space. And we, the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, will be relying on the Russians to put our astronauts into space for many, many years. And, that the further reductions in NASA that will put forward by the new majority have the potential to lengthen that period even further, and possibly perhaps permanently cripple our manned space flight program. 
   So my amendment is very simple and very straightforward. Basically what it says is that we are not going to cut NASA for the purpose of plussing up the National Science Foundation. I believe we need to fund both of these programs, and that is my goal and that is the purpose of my amendment. 
   I think one of the things that the authors of this bill keep talking about, which is very revealing and I think very important to the debate we are having right now, they talk about the importance of training kids in math and science, and that we are falling behind in our international competitiveness. But I can tell you, when I talk to teachers all across the country about what motivates our young people to study math and science, it is not the level of grants that are coming out of the National Science Foundation, it is actually our space program and an enthusiasm for the possibility or the chance that they might some day be able to participate in the space program, the manned space flight program in particular that motivates our kids. 
   So I think these two programs are really linked at the hip, and I think it is important that we do not fund one at the expense of the other. The current language in this bill has the potential to create that climate, and so I think it is critically important that the point of order be waived and that my amendment move forward and be approved by this body.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I wish to be recognized on the point of order. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that it is inappropriate to exercise a point of order on this amendment. It's quite clear that the NASA budget and the National Science Foundation are within the same budget category, function 250, and that there's a strong relationship between increasing the National Science Foundation that it can have a negative impact on NASA. 
   Furthermore, as my friend from Georgia just indicated, we have moved several bills through this body. Just today we did one where multiple points of order were waived. And the bottom line here, in my opinion, is NASA a priority for the new majority in this Congress. I don't believe it is. I don't believe it's a sufficient enough priority, and I ask that the point of order not be sustained. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The Chair is prepared to rule on the point of order, seeing no other Members who wish to be recognized. 
   The gentleman from Washington makes a point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida is not germane. The test of germaneness is the relationship of the amendment to the pending portion of the bill, section 3. 
   Clause 7 of rule XVI, the germaneness rule, provides that no proposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under color of amendment. One of the central tenets of the germaneness rule is that an amendment may not condition the effectiveness of legislation pending an unrelated condition. Examples of this principle may be found in the Deschler-Brown Precedents, chapter 28, section 30. 
   The amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida proposes a condition on the level of authorizations contained in section 3. The condition relates to funding levels for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The activities of that separate entity are not related to an authorization for the National Science Foundation. As such, the amendment proposes an unrelated condition. 
   The amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida is, therefore, not germane. The point of order is sustained.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Democratic majority pays lip service to their support of religious people and faith-based groups, but now they are here today, in this House, enacting a piece of legislation that I believe is a shot across the bow to all faith-based organizations that are involved in social services in this country. The Head Start bill today says that if you participate in the grant process, you will not be able to hire like-minded people to work in your child-care facility. 
   The Democrats are saying that a bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., has more wisdom to decide who you can and can't hire than the hundreds, thousands of small businesses that run these Head Start programs. The Democrats are essentially saying, with this legislation, while we thank you for your tireless dedication and recognize that you are an integral part of this process, we don't trust you to make fair choices in the employees that you hire. 
   Don't be misled. This is in direct contradiction to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Supreme Court, both of which came to the conclusion that faith-based organizations had the right to hire employees on a religious basis. Faith-based organizations such as churches, synagogues and other faith-based charities are a central part of the fabric of communities all across America. Many of these organizations provide assistance and services to the neediest members of society, offering a helping hand to the less fortunate among us. Many faith-based organizations can and want to make a vital contribution to the Federal assistance programs. 
   The landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act explicitly protects the rights of religious organizations to take religion into account in their hiring practices. In fact, the Civil Rights Act made clear that when faith-based organizations hire employees on a religious basis, it is an exercise of the organization's civil liberties and does not constitute discrimination under Federal law. 
   The freedom to hire those who share religious beliefs was upheld in a unanimous 1987 Supreme Court decision, Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, in which the Court observed, ``A law is not unconstitutional simply because it allows churches to advance religion, which is their very purpose. For a law to have forbidden 'effect' ..... it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence.'' 
   Now, in an attempt to appease Republicans and conservative Democrats, an alternative amendment will be provided by the gentleman from North Carolina. This amendment, in effect, praises the work of faith-based organizations, but tells them they have to give up their right to hire who they want to hire to participate in Head Start.     
   Current Federal law protects the Civil Rights Act hiring protections for faith-based organizations and providers. And, indeed, as was stated earlier by a previous speaker, President Bill Clinton signed four laws protecting religious organizations in this context. 
   Now, I want to close by just pointing out a very, very simple fact. There is a reason why on the floor today the amendment to correct this problem will not be allowed, and the reason is because it will pass. A majority of this Congress, Republicans working with Blue Dog Democrats, would pass the Fortuno amendment which would protect these faith-based religious organizations. We had many of the Blue Dogs vote with us on this issue in the past. But, alas, under this rule, and it is why I am imploring my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote ``no'' on this rule, that amendment will not be allowed and we will be asked to stifle the freedom of religion in the United States.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would like to address some of the lemonade that the gentleman from Illinois was referring to, the impact on NASA in this omnibus continuing resolution. 
   The Democratic majority rejected my request to be permitted to offer an amendment addressing some of the devastating cuts to NASA that are included in this bill. The Democrat majority has chosen, I believe, partisanship over partnership. The rhetoric about an open process transparency partnership is nothing but a sham. There is no transparency, there is no openness. 
   This House passed a NASA budget. We passed $16.7 billion for NASA. Nearly all of the increased funds in that bill went to fund the replacement for the shuttle. Now, this bill drastically reduces those funds. It will result in delays in producing the vehicle to replace the shuttle, the need to continue the shuttle beyond 2010. In my opinion, these cuts in the NASA budget will lead to billions of dollars of increased funds needed in the outyears to keep the Orion Project on track. 
   There is only one way to interpret this, my colleagues, and that is to say this is a back-handed way to destroy  the manned space flight program, to destroy the work that is going on in places like Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Flight Center. 
   And to say that there are no earmarks in this bill, in my opinion, is a little bit tongue in cheek. Within this budget is a huge transfer of funds that the administration did not ask for. I don't know what else you can call it other than an earmark.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (WATER QUALITY INVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my concerns about the bill that is before us, H.R. 569. At the beginning of the 110th Congress, the Democrat majority talked about the need for fiscal responsibility and with much fanfare passed the pay-go rules. Yet, for almost every bill that has been considered thus far this year they have waived the pay-go rules. They do so again today. 
   The bill they have brought to the House floor authorizes $1.8 billion in increased federal spending over the next five years for state and local sewer programs. This $1.8 billion price tag is more than a half-a-billion more than what the Republican majority put forward in the last Congress when it was seeking to reauthorize this program. 
   The bill under consideration today is anything but music to taxpayers' ears. Essentially, the Democrats are proposing a no-strings-attached taxpayer handout to states for local water sewer projects without responsible cost-sharing arrangements provided in currently existing programs. 
   Furthermore, Florida communities would receive very little, if any, assistance. The state of Florida has already addressed many of the problems associated with mixed storm water and sewage systems and would thus receive very little benefit. So, this largely creates a new program for which Florida taxpayers will pay on others' behalf. 
   A more equitable and fiscally responsible approach is to not divert funding from the State Revolving Fund program as is proposed in this bill. The SRF already helps states and local communities fund various water improvement projects. However, it does so in a more equitable and fiscally responsible manner by providing low-cost loans and other cost-sharing arrangements that encourage states and local communities to take ownership of high priority projects. 
   Today's bill undermines this responsible approach and would incentivize states and local communities to become more dependent on federal subsidies for short- and long-term financing of their water sewer systems, rather than on the existing SRF. This bill simply hands money to the states, who then pass it on to local communities, without requiring them to have a detailed financing plan in place, and without cost sharing. 
   For these reasons I am not able to support H.R. 569.

   It was obvious, I think, to all people watching the news coverage during the recent Hezbollah-Israel war that it was standard operating procedure for Hezbollah to place its soldiers that were firing rockets into Israel, in housing projects, in housing areas where there were civilians, and the only way  that Israel could respond to that rocket fire involved risking the lives of the women and children who lived in those areas. It was disgraceful and it was a violation of international law.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1615, Securing Aircraft Cockpits Against Lasers Act of 2007. I commend my colleague from Florida who serves on the Judiciary Committee for bringing this bill forward from that committee. 
   This is an important step in furthering aviation security. We have already taken a number of steps since 9/11 to make our skies safer for the flying public and this is one more important step in that direction. 
   This bill establishes a new Federal crime for anyone who aims a laser pointer at an aircraft or the flight path of an aircraft. This new statute will enable Federal law enforcement officials to pursue cases that it would not otherwise be able to pursue. Those prosecuted under this new law would face fines and time in prison. 
   Establishing these penalties will help address an issue that threatens public safety, pilots, and aviation security. When aimed at aircraft, lasers can cause not only discomfort, but they can also cause temporary or permanent visual impairment at critical stages of take-off and landing. The National Transportation Safety Board has already documented instances in which pilots sustained eye injuries and were incapacitated during critical times of flight. Furthermore, the Judiciary Committee report on H.R. 1615 highlights the findings of a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation that since 1990 there have been over 400 reports of lasers being pointed at aircraft. 
   In the aftermath of 9/11, the FAA took steps to require that air traffic controllers immediately notify pilots about laser events. The FAA is also to immediately notify local law enforcement and security agencies. This will enable police to act in a more timely manner to identify and prosecute those shining lasers at aircraft. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this bill is a good step in helping protect the flying public and pilots.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (PERSONAL EXPLANATION -- (House of Representatives - May 22, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, while I believe that Government Sponsored Enterprise, GSE, reform is absolutely necessary, I cannot support H.R. 1427, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act, in its current form. 
   It is important for Congress to promote home-ownership for all Americans by giving citizens access to affordable housing. However, this bill, under the Affordable Housing Fund, AHF, section, requires that GSEs set aside nearly $3 billion over the next 4 years into a special fund. H.R. 1427 essentially represents a $3 billion tax on those seeking to purchase homes. These new fees will simply be passed along to those purchasing homes. I'm not sure how a $3 billion tax increase is going to make homes more affordable. When given the opportunity to ensure that these costs would not be passed along to homeowners, supporters of the AHF voted against the amendment that would have protected homeowners. Clearly, this is designed to be a hidden tax on homebuyers. 
   This newly created AHF would make grants to states and Indian tribes, which would then make grants to third-party housing-related entities. H.R. 1427 fails to provide adequate oversight of these third-party grantees and the funds could easily fall into the hands of politically motivated groups. Also, while using grant money for lobbying or other political activities is not permitted under the bill, there is nothing preventing groups from displacing their other funds for these activities while still receiving grant money. One such third party group that stands to benefit financially from this new grant program is ACORN. ACORN is notorious for partisan voter registration drives. Allegations of voter fraud have plagued ACORN political activities in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota, New Mexico, Missouri, Michigan, Colorado, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and North Carolina. Yet, the Democrats' plan is to create a slush fund to funnel millions of dollars in grants to ACORN and similar partisan groups, freeing up money for partisan political activities. 
   Adding more layers of bureaucratic waste and pandering to left-leaning groups will not help low-income buyers purchase the homes of their dreams. While we need GSE reform, we should not be forced to sign onto a $3 billion tax on homeowners. There are better, more financially responsible ways to address affordable housing.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 2669, COLLEGE COST REDUCTION AND ACCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in support of efforts to make college education more affordable for more Americans. Indeed, earlier this year I voted in support of H.R. 5, the College Student Relief Act of 2007. I believed that bill took some positive steps. 
   Unfortunately, the bill that is being brought before the House today for consideration, H.R. 2669, is full of budget gimmicks, creates five new entitlement programs, spends tens of billions of dollars, and shifts from the private sector to the taxpayers the potential liability for billions of dollars should student loans borrowers default. 
   I am very disappointed that the bill before us, H.R. 2669, falls far short of its goal. While those who drafted the bill assert that it is a comprehensive solution to making college more affordable, H.R. 2669 fails to address the core problem of access to U.S. colleges and universities: sky-rocketing rates of tuition and room and board. In just the last 7 years, annual inflation has increased on average 2.7 percent. However, higher education costs for students have increased an average of 4.2 percent--a rate that is 55 percent higher than regular inflation. This bill takes a pass on addressing that fundamental issue, and simply makes it easier and more likely that students will borrow more money and accumulate a larger debt by the time they graduate from college. H.R. 2669 completely ignores the root problem. The end result of this bill will be that the average college student graduating from college 4 years from now will still face a higher college debt than those graduating this year--even with all of the billions of dollars included in this bill. 
   Under H.R. 2669, those attending college in the future will be able to borrow more money and perhaps pay a lower interest rate for a short period of time, but with college expenses growing at a rate that far exceeds the annual inflation rate, students will end college with a significantly larger debt. 
   This bill creates five new Federal entitlement programs, costing tens of billions of dollars. In an attempt to feign compliance with the pay-as-you-go rules adopted by the current Congress, the Democrats include a provision that sunsets these new entitlement program. This is a budget gimmick designed to fool the American people. Does anyone really think that when these programs expire and students are half way through their college education, they will simply be allowed to expire? Of course they won't, and taxpayers will be forced to hand over tens of billions of additional dollars to continue these programs. Incidentally, this will come at about the same time when the House-passed state children's health insurance program, SCHIP, funding dries up and Congress will be looking for tens of billions of dollars to extend that program. Creating five new entitlement programs and spending tens of billions of dollars puts this nation on a path to financial ruin. 
   The bottom line is that H.R. 2669 enables students to take on more debt which will further burden them for many years past graduation. In 2006, the Higher Education Price Index, HEPI, calculation showed that inflation for colleges and universities jumped to 5 percent. This is 30 percent higher than the consumer price index, CPI--the regular inflation rate. When colleges and universities know that students have access to more funds through financial aid, loans, and grants, they have simply seen this as an opportunity to raise costs for students. This was the case in the past when college loan limits were significantly expanded and it will be repeated after this bill is passed. 
   The bill takes a pass on encouraging colleges and universities to put a lid on uncontrolled tuition increases. But it's not surprising given that this is the same Democrat majority that created a massive $100 million lobbying loophole for public universities. If we truly want to help our students go into the world with a good education saddled with less debt, we should hold colleges and universities who take government aid more accountable and not allow them to continue their excessive increases in college costs. Colleges and universities have an obligation to exercise fiscal responsibility rather than simply seeing these new student loans and grants as an opportunity to shift more of their fiscally irresponsible costs onto the backs of students and taxpayers.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (SPUTNIK 50TH ANNIVERSARY -- (House of Representatives - October 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take the opportunity to recognize the importance to our Nation of what happened 50 years ago today. 
   On October 4, 1957, Russia launched Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite to successfully be placed in orbit around the Earth. On that day, Americans were shocked, and many believed that we were no longer the technological leader of the world. 
   On that day Americans realized that, like never before, our homeland was threatened. This was significant, because the leader of the Nation that launched Sputnik, Nikita Khrushchev, less than a year earlier had aggressively delivered to America the now-famous threat, ``We will bury you.'' 
   To many Americans, Sputnik was a major step showing how the Russians were starting to make good on their promise, and it was a promise that America had to counter and nullify before it was too late. The reverberations of Sputnik and its launch were felt many years thereafter. 
   Thankfully, our Nation got busy after October 4, 1957, to ensure that our space program became second to none. We began an aggressive effort to educate and train a new generation of engineers and technicians, and we began the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs and ultimately, of course, putting Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin successfully on the Moon and bringing them home safely. 
   Since then, of course, we have built the most versatile and complex machine ever made by man, the space shuttle. We have constructed the International Space Station. 
   I am proud of what we have accomplished with our space program, and now we are moving forward with the next step in human space flight, the Constellation program, which will, again, carry us back to the Moon and, with international cooperation, on to Mars. But we are, today, facing another watershed moment in the history of our space program. 
   By 2010, the space shuttle is scheduled to end its over quarter century of operations. While this is a sad time for many, it will also allow us to continue on into the future with the Constellation program. Unfortunately, Constellation is not set to begin space flight until 2015. 
   What will America's manned space flight program be doing to put men and women into space between 2010 and 2015? Quite puzzlingly, we will be asking the Russians, the country that agreed to bury us 50 years ago, to launch our astronauts into orbit. 
   Now, I supported President Bush's announced plan in 2004 to someday retire the space shuttle and replace it with a new, safer and less expensive system to operate that could go back to the Moon and on to Mars, but I was critical of the President at the time, with his notion that we retire the shuttle in 2010 and not launch the new system until 2015, and that we rely, of all places, on Russia to launch our astronauts into orbit. Yet, today, that is what we are planning on doing. 
   What is very troubling about our relationship with Russia, while we have had good cooperation with them in recent years, there have been problems, problems with proliferating weapons of mass destruction to rogue nations such as Iran. Indeed, this body passed the Iran Nonproliferation Act, and then we had to go back and amend it to allow our current cooperation with the Russians. 
   Then, of course, more recently, the Russians have engaged in a number of behaviors that I consider to be very ominous for our future relationship with them, placing a Russian flag on the bottom of Arctic Circle and claiming the Arctic bottoms resources for Russia. 
   The Russians have bitterly opposed our deployment of missile defense systems to protect us against Iran in Europe. The Russian leader, President Putin, has claimed that it will lead to a new missile race, and he has, indeed, threatened to specifically target European capitals. Is Russia trying to bring back the Cold War? It has reinitiated its bomber patrols, patrolling our NATO allies.  
   I think if you add up all of these things and their recent abrogation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, which placed restrictions on conventional forces, I think this does not bode well to our continued reliance on the Russians in the years ahead, and we need a new plan to deal with our manned space flight program in the years ahead.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my concerns about legislative amendments related to permitting drilling for oil or natural gas off of our Nation's Outer Continental Shelf (OSC). 
   I want it to be very clear what I support with regard to offshore drilling. I believe it is important to ensure that we can adequately protect Florida's shoreline and I believe that the legislation approved last year by the Congress more than protects Florida's shoreline. I support a 100-mile buffer of protection for our beaches when it comes to drilling oil wells. Additionally, I am not opposed to allowing natural gas only wells at a distance closer than 100 miles, particularly in those States that want to permit natural gas wells closer to their coasts. 
   The current Federal moratorium on offshore drilling bans natural gas wells not only along the Florida coast, but also along southern, central and northern California; Washington; Oregon; and the North Atlantic, including Virginia. The State of Virginia has indicated that it would like to permit drilling off of its shore. The Democrat Governor of the State has asked for the ability to allow drilling off of Virginia's shore. The Republican legislature of Virginia has asked the Federal Government to remove the barrier to drilling off the coast. The Federal moratorium in the Interior and Environment Appropriations bills stops this policy asked for by the State of Virginia. 
   Additionally, with regard to Florida, I would like to clarify some confusion on this issue. Some have suggested that without the Federal moratorium rider on the Interior bill drilling would be allowed within 3 miles of the Florida coast. That is just simply not the case. The Presidential moratorium would remain in place protecting Florida. Additionally, President Bush has pledged to ensure that Florida is permitted to maintain at least a 100-mile protective buffer. Moreover should the Presidential moratorium be removed, the Congress must enact legislation directing the Department of the Interior on where to permit Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases. This is not a one step process. 
   Some have suggested that allowing natural gas wells will do little to address the energy costs in the United States. This claim simply is not based on sound economics. As many of my colleagues know, over the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the use of natural gas to produce electricity. Switching to natural gas for electric power generation has been a very quick and cost effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. According a 2005 report from the Florida Public Service Commission, in 2003, 26 percent of Florida's electric power was generated using natural gas. By 2013, just 6 years from now, the FPSC projects that over 50 percent of Florida's electric power will be generated using natural gas. The cost of natural gas for electric power generation has more than doubled since 2002 from about $3.00 per thousand cubic feet to more than $7.00 in 2007. Clearly, Florida is increasingly relying on natural gas to meet our everyday energy needs and ensuring a longer term affordable supply of natural gas will make Florida consumers' power bills more affordable. 
   When you consider this growing reliance on clean burning natural gas along with price increases we have seen, it is clear that Florida consumers will continue to pay higher costs for electricity if we don't expand our natural gas supply. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that Florida has an adequate protective buffer while looking to meet our constituents' long-term clean energy needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to explain the purpose of two amendments I submitted to H.R. 3093, the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill of 2008. While I had planned to offer these amendments, I was disappointed that just prior to offering my amendments to the bill on the House floor, was informed that the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science was going to object to my amendments and insist on a point of order against them. After discussion with the Parliamentarian, who said the point of order would be upheld on a technicality, I decided to not offer my amendments. I am disappointed that the Democrat majority chose to object to my amendments on a technicality, particularly when you consider that technical objections were waived for a host of other provisions in  this same bill. I believe if is important to explain here and get on the record the substance of these amendments and why they are critical to securing our homeland. 
   My first amendment (No. 14) would have tied funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to whether recipients are complying with the federal prohibition on sanctuary policies. Sanctuary cities have been prohibited under Federal law (8 U.S.C. 1373 and 1644) for more than 10 years. Yet, there is no enforcement mechanism and no penalty for those cities that choose to disobey the law. 
   My amendment would have prohibited COPS funding from going to State or local governments that have sanctuary policies which prevent cooperation between local or state police and federal immigration authorities or prevent local or state police from enforcing immigration laws. 
   Terrorists know all about sanctuary cities and the concealment that such cities provide. The 9/11 terrorists are a case in point. Two of the 19 hijackers on September 11, 2001, ran afoul of police months and days before the attack. 
   Mohammed Atta was ticketed in Broward County Florida in the Spring of 2001 for driving without a license. Atta was in the U.S. on an expired Visa and was in the U.S. illegally. If the local or state police had looked into Atta's immigration status, the leader of the 9/11 attacks would have been departed 5 months before the attacks took place. 
   In addition, of the 48 Al Qaeda operatives who operated in the U.S. between 1993-2001, including the 9/11 hijackers, almost half were illegal aliens. Sadly, jurisdictions with sanctuary policies would not only prohibit their apprehension, it would also prohibit the police from informing federal officials of their immigration status so that they could commence deportation proceedings. Three of the Fort Dix Six--the men who tried to pull off a terrorist incident at Ft. Dix, NJ--were pulled over by local police for traffic violations. Three of these individuals had run-ins with police 75 times, but no one ever checked their immigration status. They were all in the U.S. illegally. The jurisdiction in which they were charged supposedly had a sanctuary policy ... which explains why they were never reported to federal immigration officials. 
   We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that terrorists do not know about these sanctuary jurisdictions... so harboring illegal aliens creates an environment where terrorists can easily hide and not be found out. I want to be clear that I do not believe that all illegal immigrants are terrorists. Very, very' few illegal immigrants are terrorists. But those few who are terrorists can kill thousands of innocent Americans, as only 19 did on September 11, 2001. 
   Obviously, the COPS program adds to our arsenal in combating crime by increasing the number of police in our communities. But funding increased police presence while at the same time not reporting known illegal immigrants to federal authorities, as is the policy of jurisdictions with sanctuary laws, is contradictory and self-defeating. If we simply allowed our law enforcement officers to follow Federal law by requiring them to inform immigration officials of violations of immigration laws, we would likely need fewer police officers to enforce our laws. 
   Why would we need fewer officers? Because requiring local jurisdictions to cooperate with the Federal agencies to quickly and efficiently deport illegal immigrants, particularly those engaged in criminal acts, would help reduce the size and capabilities of criminal gangs. A large percentage of those who populate violent criminal gangs, including MS-13, are illegal immigrants. Violent criminal gangs are making these communities unsafe. FBI Director, Robert Mueller, has even declared MS-13 as the top priority of the bureau's criminal-enterprise branch. 
   Even more, the gangs that are populated by illegal immigrants have increased the threat to our homeland. Honduran Security Minister, Oscar Alvarez, even stated that Al Qaeda might be trying to recruit Central American gang members to help terrorists infiltrate the US. Additionally, Salvadoran President Tony Saca echoed this theme, saying he could ``not rule out a link between terrorist and Central American gang members.'' 
   My second amendment (No. 15) would have tied funding for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) to whether recipient jurisdictions are complying with the federal prohibition on sanctuary policies (8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;1373 and 1644). The amendment would have given priority in SCAAP funding to those communities that are cooperating with federal immigration officials in deporting illegal immigrants, rather than State or local governments that have sanctuary policies and simply release criminal aliens back onto U.S. streets. 
   My amendment says if you expect to get federal money for incarcerating illegal immigrants you must also report them to federal immigration authorities so that they can be deported, rather than 
   being released back on to U.S. streets. If a community cannot live by this policy, it is only right that they not get a taxpayer subsidy. 
   What's amazing is how much money sanctuary cities are raking in from the Federal Government. During fiscal 2005, the Justice Department distributed $287.1 million in SCAAP payments to 752 state, county and local jurisdictions. Seventy percent of SCAAP funds went to just 10 jurisdictions: the states of California, New York, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Massachusetts; New York City; and two California counties, Los Angeles and Orange. 
   Many of the largest recipients of SCAAP funds are sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with Federal authorities on immigration enforcement. Some of the largest sanctuary cities and counties that received SCAAP money in 2005 include New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Houston, and Seattle. 
   It seems as if we did not learn anything from 9/11 about the need to treat illegal immigration seriously and recognize that the failure to enforce our immigration laws can endanger our national security? 
   Some of America's most important cities are sanctuary even though it is prohibited under Federal law. And it is time that the Federal Government stops turning a blind eye to sanctuary cities. If a community chooses to be a sanctuary, they should no longer expect to receive the largess of taxpayers from across this country. 
   Once again, I am disappointed that the Democrat majority would not permit these amendments to be considered for all up or down vote. However, I will continue to work to address this serious national security concern.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (THE ELON PEACE PLAN -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Speaker, today I rise to bring to the attention of the House an important new plan that seeks to bridge the longstanding divide between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The plan is titled ``The Right Road to Peace,'' and it is a comprehensive proposal for finding an avenue to peace, as well as addressing the humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people. 
   As we know, the Palestinian people have, for nearly three generations, languished in U.N.-run refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, Gaza and the West Bank. The author of the proposal, Mr. Binyamin Elon, a highly respected member of Israel's Knesset, he, at the heart of this plan, has offered an innovative approach for providing opportunity, housing and education to a population which, for a long time, has lived as a ward of the international community. Mr. Elon's proposal would end the cycle of dependence that long has shackled Palestinian development. 
   Madam Speaker, I will include a summary of the document entitled ``The Right Road to Peace'' into the Record after my remarks. 
   Today, there are approximately 1.3 million registered Palestinians being cared for in 59 camps run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, or the U-N-R-W-A, sometimes referred to as UNRWA. 
   Nearly 60 years after the first of these camps were established, virtually nothing has been done to return this population to a settled existence. The 1.3 million Palestinians living in these camps live in a world of poverty, their day-to-day existence solely reliant on international handouts. 
   The history of Palestinian refugee problems clarifies why the Elon peace plan is so needed at this time: 
   Following the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced. At the time, hundreds of thousands of Jews fled also or were ousted from their homes in Arab lands. The U.N. established the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in 1949 to care for the Arab/Palestinian refugees. The U.N. has never created an agency solely to serve the interests of one displaced group of people. 
   Many of the refugees do not even have historical roots in the territory now known as Palestine. Many of those residing in the West Bank are descendants of those who came from Syria and the Trans-Jordan area. 
   While the displaced Jews of the region settled in Israel and were integrated into the Israeli society, the Palestinians remain sequestered in these refugee camps. Why the Arab community that perpetually talks about the welfare of the Palestinians does nothing to relocate these people out of these camps is strange and, for many, it's considered no mystery. Many of these regimes fought against Israel in 1948, seeking to destroy Israel, and their desire is to perpetuate the camps and to perpetuate the terrorism the camps breed. 
   This, in my opinion, is unfortunate, and UNWRA is a U.N. agency established purportedly for the benefit of the refugees. However, in my opinion, it serves to perpetuate the terrorism problem. 
   While UNWRA lets camp residents run their own activities, under its own oversight, the camps have become centers of terrorism, lawlessness, and crime. This further victimizes the Palestinians in the refugee camps who have no involvement in these criminal activities. Palestinian terrorists operate freely in many of these camps, coordinating attacks against innocent Israeli civilians and Palestinians who oppose their terror agenda. 
   In 2004, the UNWRA commissioner, Peter Hansen, admitted in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the agency employs individuals who are members of groups like Hamas, a group the U.S. Government considers to be a terrorist organization. 
   Madam Speaker, it is high time that the truth be told and that the UNWRA mandate come to an end. In its place, a proposal should be adopted that would  truly resolve the Palestinian refugee question, regardless of whether there is ever a formal resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 
   There is no reason why generations of Palestinians must continue to subsist in squalor and deprivation just so regimes in the Arab world have a diplomatic foil with which to attack Israel. 
   The Elon plan is simple. Working cooperatively with nations around the world, Israel and the international community will assist the Palestinian refugees to find new homes outside the camps. 
   Why should Palestinians continue to languish? Support the Elon plan.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2082, INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   I rise to commend the majority for including, under the rule, the amendment that will be offered later by Mr. Hoekstra, the ranking minority member, former chairman of the committee, to strike section 407 of the bill. This is the section of the bill that so many people have commented on so far today that will now task our national intelligence resources to start looking at the issue of climate change. 
   To me there is a great irony in this happening here today because for many years we have heard criticism from Democrats over and over again on the so-called inefficiencies, inadequacies of our national intelligence capabilities, specially as it related to WMD in Iraq and their failure to get an accurate picture of that. And now we see today an expansion of their duties and responsibilities. 
   I believe most Americans look for our intelligence agencies not to be engaged on the issue of climate change but more directly to be involved in the business of protecting American safety and security, protecting our national assets, protecting the American people. 
   Furthermore, one of the other things that strikes me as greatly ironic about this is, we have an extensive array of Federal agencies currently studying this issue. We have NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which has a wide array of satellites and scientists that are constantly studying both short-term and  long-term implications of climate change. 
   We have, additionally, NASA engaged on this issue, with three major Earth-observing satellites on orbit studying the issue of the Earth's climate. 
   And as well, there are multiple programs run by the National Science Foundation; they have the Geosciences Directorate (GEO), the Office of Polar Programs (OPP), the Atmospheric Science Subactivity, the ATM. And, ladies and gentlemen, I haven't even touched on the EPA and all the work that they are doing on this issue. 
   To me, this issue is controversial. There is a sizeable number of Americans who feel that the severity of the problem of climate change does not justify some of the extreme actions that many people in the radical environmental community are trying to propose today, and I just can't help but feel this is a political issue to try to hijack our intelligence assets to get them on the global warming bandwagon so we could have draconian changes in American policy that could adversely affect our economy and our Nation. 
   So I thank the majority for putting the Hoekstra amendment in order. Mr. Hoekstra, the former chairman, now ranking member, is very knowledgeable on intelligence policy. 
   I intend on supporting the Hoekstra amendment. I encourage all my colleagues to listen carefully to that debate.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our veterans. 
   This Sunday is Veterans Day. As a veteran myself and the son of a combat-wounded veteran, I believe it is very, very important that we as a nation take time and honor those who have served in our armed services. 
   It is a fact that we all understand that freedom comes at a price and that it is those who put on the uniform and serve that preserve freedom for us and so many others around the world. 
   It's unfortunate that I have to rise as well and express my concern over our failure to move a veterans bill through this body to fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. Thanksgiving is less than 2 weeks ago, and as a physician who volunteers his time in a veterans clinic in his congressional district, I can say that I know that we can put our partisan differences behind us, put them aside, and we can come together and finally pass a veterans funding bill. I regret that we have not been able to do that today so late in the year right before Veterans Day. 
   Let's see if we can get that work done next week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise in strong opposition to this rule, and very strong opposition to the underlying bill. 
   And let me just say from the outset that I used to take care of AIDS patients before I came to this Congress back in 1994. I was one of only two physicians in a county of 400,000 people that was seeing AIDS patients. And I have announced my retirement, my intent to leave the House of Representatives at the conclusion of this Congress, and I will most likely go back to seeing patients in January. And I may, indeed, be seeing AIDS patients again. 
   Let me additionally say that I'm very concerned about the situation in Africa. Indeed, I have gone to Africa twice in my term of service here in the Congress specifically to look at the issue of helping in Africa with the issues of AIDS and malaria and TB, and so I think I have credibility to be able to say I care, I'm concerned. But this underlying bill and this rule that restricts any cutting amendments, in my opinion, is just excessive. 
   Years ago, when the President originally came up with PEPFAR, he came to me and asked me to help him with his plan, and I did. And I actually thought his plan was very, very generous, $3 billion a year. And when he gave his State of the Union message just a few months ago indicating that he wanted to double the size of this from $3 billion to $6 billion a year, I personally thought that was excessive. When you look at all the problems we have with health care access for Americans, the problems that we have with transportation infrastructure, the problems that we have in fighting the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, the homeland security issues, I thought to take this program from $3 billion a year to $6 billion a year was excessive and over the top. 
   But now we have before us today an underlying bill to not increase it by 100 percent, which is what the President was asking for, but to increase it by over 200 percent. That's the underlying bill. And the Democrat leadership of the House under the Democratic Rules Committee is saying, well, no, we don't want any cutting amendments. 
   Now, let me tell you a little bit of why I am so passionately upset about it. Yesterday, NASA announced that, with the retirement of the space shuttle, they are going to be laying off over 6,500 people in east central Florida, my congressional district. That is a huge amount of people. It has a huge economic impact on the State of Florida. And for us to be putting our astronauts on Russian rockets, we're going to have to sign a contract with the Russians for the construction of these rockets, we're essentially going to be laying off people in Florida and hiring people in Russia with U.S. taxpayers. 
   Now, this Congress, under this Democratic leadership, is saying that we have no choice, we cannot afford to continue to fly the shuttle in 2011, 2012, 2013. We cannot afford to bring the new rocket system online any sooner than 2005 or 2006, we don't have the money, while we have all this money to send $50 billion to Africa for AIDS. Now, again, let me just say, I understand this is a terrible problem. I don't even mind increasing the Africa AIDS account. And what, to me, is insult on top of injury, my staff has informed me that they have $1 billion in this account unspent that they are working to try to spend. So, they can't even spend all the money that we're sending them over there, and we want to send them a 240 percent increase? 
   Now, I know every Member of this House can get up and give a speech like this; they have water projects in their district, they have health care clinics in their district. In my particular case, it's pretty significant. We've got over 6,000 people who are going to get a pink slip. So, for us to say we can't fly the shuttle beyond 2010 because we can't afford it, but that we can somehow find $50 billion to send to Africa, to me is just way over the top. I can't justify that back home. 
   I'm opposing this rule. I'm going to vote against the underlying bill. And I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I appreciate it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   As a physician who practiced medicine for many years prior to coming to the House, I dealt with the issue of the uninsured on a daily basis. Indeed, I used to see it regularly, up close and personal. And certainly I think it is a noble endeavor for this body to try to address this issue. 
   But I would have to say I think it is really shameful and disgraceful the way the majority has proceeded in this whole process. The first time they brought the bill forward they gave it to us at the 11th hour with no opportunity to amend it. They did it the second time. They did it the third time now. Never, as I understand it, sitting down and seriously trying to discuss this issue with the President. The President needs to sign it. 
   And people keep coming to the floor and saying we need to do this for the children. What about the children who have to pay for this? I mean, let's talk about all of the children. The way this bill is crafted, the nonpartisan CBO has estimated it will migrate 2 million kids in middle-class families who currently have insurance onto the government payroll. And, jeepers, we can't afford Social Security. We are told that that is going to be insolvent. We can't afford Medicare. Under the current Medicare formula, doctors in this country are supposed to get a 10 percent cut in reimbursement. And now we are going to expand this program. 
   And the other thing I just want to point out, we are really creating a new entitlement. And one of the very reasons I came here is that this body year after year was creating entitlements that it didn't have the ability to pay for. And all I can say is here we go again. We are expanding this program, we are making it like an entitlement, and we are saying over and over again we are doing it for the children. 
   What about the tens of millions of children, the hundreds of millions who are going to have to clean up this mess? 
   I am against this rule. I am against this bill. I'm going to vote against it again.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - October 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise as a supporter of the State Children's Health Insurance Program, SCHIP, which focuses on covering children in families at or below 200 percent of the poverty level, $41,000 per year. I have voted to extend this program and to provide additional resources to ensure that those living in families below 200 percent of the poverty level, $41,000, have access to affordable health insurance through the SCHIP program. 
   Before sharing my concerns over the bill that was vetoed by the President and that we are voting on today, I would like to share with my colleagues an overview of the SCHIP reauthorization bill that I am joining in introducing today. Our bill will provide families with health care choices, health care transferability and health care security. 
   The bill I have cosponsored would ensure that all children between 100 percent and 200 percent of poverty are eligible to enroll in SCHIP. In addition to being able to enroll in SCHIP, these families could also decide to use their SCHIP credit to pay for the additional costs of enrolling their children in the parent's employer provided health plan. For those making between 200 percent and 300 percent of the poverty level, our bill would provide a $1,400 per child health care tax credit. This credit would be refundable for those who have tax liability less than the amount of the credit. Parents could use this credit to pay the additional costs of enrolling their children in an employer provided health care plan or in another state licensed health care plan. This plan borrows from the proposal put forward by a broad range of organizations that run the political spectrum--from the liberal Families USA, to the Chamber of Commerce, and the American Medical Association, AMA. 
   The biggest question remaining after this vote is taken today is whether or not our House Democrat colleagues will do something that they have by and large failed to do so far with regard to SCHIP: invite House Republicans to participate in developing the legislation. To date, House Democrat leaders have abused the rules of debate to totally shut Republicans out of the legislative process. 
   Two weeks ago, rather than having an up or down vote on the President's veto, the Democrat majority chose to put off the final vote for two weeks in order to engage in political posturing and partisan attacks. Today we are holding that vote and the outcome today is no different than what it would have been two weeks ago. So, why the delay? Solely for partisan posturing. Madam Speaker, our children deserve better and it is time to stop using them as political pawns. Unfortunately, recent press reports are filled with quotes from Democrat leaders stating that they want to keep this alive as a political issue, calling for ``repeated votes'' and temporary extensions of SCHIP over the next year, rather than approving a long-term bipartisan bill that secures SCHIP coverage for those it was intended for--children in low-income households with family incomes of less than 200 percent of the poverty level. 
   I would now like to address once again, why I cannot support the bill before us. This bill: 1. Fails to place a priority on first enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year, 200 percent of the federal poverty level; 2. Expands government SCHIP subsidies to those making far more than the Federal poverty level; 3. Spends half of the additional SCHIP dollars to enroll children in the government SCHIP program who are already enrolled in private insurance; and 4. Uses budget gimmicks--like booting millions of children off of the program in 2012--in order to fool the public into believing they can fund the program for the next 5 years. 
   It is fiscally irresponsible to expand this program by enticing millions of children in families earning far above the poverty level to drop private coverage and enroll in the SCHIP program that cannot be sustained. In August, House Democrat leaders forced an earlier version of SCHIP through the House that cut over $150 billion from Medicare and moved that money into SCHIP so that they would have a way to pay for millions of new SCHIP enrollees over the next 10 years, including millions of currently insured children from middle and upper middle class families. 
   Their plan to cut Medicare was rejected not only by Republicans but by the U.S. Senate, and most importantly by the public at large. The bill that the President vetoed is a bait and switch. This nearly triples the size of SCHIP over the next 5 years--including enrolling millions of children currently insured by private plans--only this time they have chosen to hide from the public how they plan to pay for the program for the next 10 years. They ramp up the annual SCHIP budget to nearly $14 billion a year, and then they simply leave it to a future Congress to find a way to continue paying for the massively expanded SCHIP program. And they hand the bill to future generations of Americans. It turns out that their nearly tripling of the Federal cigarette taxes still leaves them tens of billions of dollars short. Americans should be on notice that in 2012 the Democrats will ask for another $180 billion to continue SCHIP for another 10 years. 
   Particularly troubling is that by significantly expanding SCHIP enrollment eligibility to those far above the poverty level, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates that millions of new SCHIP enrollees will be children that move from private coverage to the SCHIP program. By moving children from private insurance onto the government program, this bill essentially enrolls 5 uninsured children for the price of 10. Enticing millions of children to drop private coverage and sign up for SCHIP is shortsighted and irresponsible, particularly given the multibillion dollar SCHIP budget shortfall that hits in 2012. 
   What we should be doing is focusing this program on enrolling uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. Madam Speaker, our children and the American taxpayers deserve better than what the Democrat leadership has put before us today. 
   In February of this year, States that had overspent their SCHIP funding grants came to Congress begging for more money to ``insure uninsured poor children.'' The root problem in many of these States was the fact that they had used their Federal grant to enroll children in the SCHIP program who were neither poor nor uninsured. New Jersey, for example had used their grant to enroll children in families with incomes of more than $72,000, even though there were and still are over 150,000 children in New Jersey in households earning less than $41,000 who are uninsured. 
   I offered an amendment in February that would have refocused SCHIP to make sure that children in families under 200 percent of the poverty level were covered first. My amendment was rejected by the liberal majority on the Committee, who Stated that they had no intent to refocus SCHIP on lower income children. Rather, they planned to continue expanding the program to those well above the poverty level--to include adults and illegal immigrants--as a step toward universal government-run health care. A recent op-ed in the Washington Post, by liberal columnist E.J. Dionne Jr., removes any doubt of this goal by writing: ``This battle [over SCHIP] is central to the long-term goal of universal coverage.'' 
   While the press releases about today's bill focus on uninsured low-income children, the language in the bill is about much more than uninsured low-income children. If the bill before us was focused on low-income uninsured  children, I would be voting for it. The bill before us does the opposite. It repeals recent rules requiring States to ensure that at least 95 percent of those under 200 percent of the poverty level are insured under their State SCHIP programs. Democrat leaders in Congress have responded to the rule by arguing that there is no way to ensure a 95 percent enrollment rate of uninsured children in households earning less than $41,000 per year. They argue that since they cannot achieve the goal we should simply expand the program to those in households earning more than $60,000 a year or more. 
   They use budget gimmicks to say that their bill is balanced and paid for through higher cigarette taxes. The Heritage Foundation has estimated that the amount of money Democrats estimate they will raise from higher cigarette taxes comes up billions of dollars short and that over the next 10 years they will have to find 22 million new smokers to bring in the amount of cigarette tax revenue they hope to raise. It is also noteworthy that lower-income Americans pay a higher percentage of cigarette taxes, but it is middle-income Americans that will receive most of the expanded SCHIP benefits under this bill. 
   I am also concerned over provisions included in the bill that repeal the requirement that individuals must prove citizenship in order to enroll in Medicaid and SCHIP. This opens the program to fraud and the enrollment of illegal immigrants. In 2006, the Inspector General, IG, of the Department of Health and Human Services found that 46 States allowed anyone seeking Medicaid or SCHIP to simply State they were citizens. The IG found that 27 States never sought to verify that enrollees were indeed citizens. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that repealing this requirement will cost $1.9 billion. 
   And finally from a Florida perspective, Florida taxpayers come up short. Florida taxpayers will send $700 million more to Washington than we will receive back in SCHIP allocations. Where will Florida taxpayer dollars end up going? Residents of California, New York, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and New Jersey will be the biggest recipients of Florida tax dollars. Yet, Florida has a higher rate of uninsured children than several of these. 
   Florida voters will also be asked to foot part of the bill for a $1.2 billion earmark inserted into the 300-page bill at the last minute by the powerful chairman of the committee for his home State of Michigan. 
   Madam Speaker, let's open up the legislative process and develop a strong bipartisan bill. It is time to end the politics around this issue and ensure that low-income children have access to this program.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is very different from the campaign promises that were made just a few short months ago by the Democrats. Counter to the arguments made today by Democrats in support of their bill, experts in the field, including the Democrats' own past and present budget directors, say that this bill will not save seniors or the government money. The bottom line is that this bill is more about politics and partisanship than it is about partnership and lowering prices for prescription drugs. 
   Rather than the ``Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act,'' a more appropriate name for this bill might be, ``The Government Price Control and Limited Access to Drugs Act.'' Price controls, which supporters of this bill advocate, lead to shortages and denial of access to many drugs. 
   Robert Reischauer, appointed by Democrats as the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) from 1989 through 1995, had this to say recently about the Medicare Prescription Drug plan and the Democrats' proposed legislation (H.R. 4):   
   People said it's going to cost a fortune. And the price came in lower than anybody thought. Then people like me said they're low-balling the prices the first year and they'll jack up the rates down the line. And, lo and behold, the prices fell again. And the reaction was, ``We've got to have the government negotiate lower prices.'' At some point you have to ask: What are we looking for here?   
   In other words, Mr. Reischauer, who now works for the liberal-leaning Urban Institute, says that we have already achieved in the current plan what the Democrats say they want to achieve with H.R. 4. 
   Further undermining the Democrats' claim is the January 10, 2007, cost estimate and analysis of their bill by the CBO concluding that H.R. 4 would not save seniors or the government money. The Democrats had hoped to use any savings for additional government spending. The problem is CBO says there will be no savings. Quoting from that analysis:   
   ..... the Secretary would be unable to negotiate prices across the broad range of covered Part D drugs that are more favorable than those obtained by PDPs under current law. [PDPs are the current private plans available to seniors under Part D.] [T]he Secretary ..... would lack the leverage to obtain significant discounts in his negotiations with drug manufacturers. ..... [P]rices for covered Part D drugs would continue to be determined through negotiations between drug manufacturers and PDPs. ..... PDPs have both the incentives and the tools to negotiate drug prices that the government, under the legislation, would not have.   
   CBO, economists and Republicans understand basic economics: When you have no tools at your disposal at the negotiating table, you have no leverage and no ability to achieve your goals. The Democrats removed from their bill the most important tool in lowering prices. This is the very tool that PDPs have used very effectively--their ability to establish a formulary for their plan that includes some drugs while excluding others. Absent the ability to exclude some drugs from their prescription drug plan, the government has no leverage to achieve lower prices. When seniors were told that the Democrats were planning to establish a plan that excluded some drugs, 89 percent of seniors said they would object to such a plan. It was this strong reaction from seniors that led Democrats to drop this plan. 
   It is this ability to exclude hundreds of drugs that enables the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), Dept. of Defense (DOD) and Medicaid to negotiate prices with manufacturers. The VA also saves money by requiring that over 80 percent of VA prescriptions be filled by mail order and by limiting access to local pharmacies. The VA approved drug list includes less than 40 percent of drugs approved by the FDA since 1990, and less than 20 percent of drugs approved by the VA since 2000. VA drug prices also do not include the costs of administering the program or paying for pharmacy services. The tradeoff for those in these programs is that they have access to far fewer than the 4,300 drugs currently available to seniors across the Medicare drug plans. Eighty-nine percent of seniors do not want the government to apply such restrictions to Medicare. 
   The good news for seniors is that currently there is negotiation for drug prices by those who have the leverage and tools at their disposal to secure better prices for seniors and the government. The various Medicare Part D [PDP] plans do negotiate with drug manufacturers for drug prices and they do so in a vigorously competitive environment. Each of these plans has a drug formulary (list of drugs available to enrollees in that plan) and manufacturers know that if they do not provide Part D plan with a reasonable price, their drug will not be offered in that plan resulting in the loss of drug sales for their drugs. These Part D private plans have the ability to leave the negotiating table and exclude drugs from their plan and this has lowered drug costs significantly. Medicare recently released a study showing that estimated costs of the Part D program have fallen by over $100 billion, primarily due to the ability of plans to negotiate savings. 
   Under the current program, once these plans have completed their negotiations, seniors are able to review the plans to see which plan best meets their needs in terms of drugs, including copayments, deductibles, and other factors. My constituents in Florida District 15 have dozens of different plans from which to choose. 
   There is a saying that, ``You don't fix what ain't broken.'' Given that over 80 percent of seniors are satisfied with their current plan, it is safe to assume that it isn't broken. Unfortunately, for Part D beneficiaries, the Democrats' bill amounts to choosing partisanship over partnership. Now-Speaker Pelosi said of the Republican Medicare Drug Plan back in 2003: ``The Republican plan is a plan to end Medicare. I urge my colleagues to reject this raw deal for America's seniors.'' Contrary to her dire prediction, it has turned out to be a very good plan for seniors as the average senior is saving hundreds of dollars per year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I commend her for calling this Special Order. 
   We have concluded now the first complete week under the Democrat majority rule, and I think it is worth talking about what their accomplishments have been. And I am very glad you brought up the issue of stem cells. 
   I am a physician, as you pointed out. I practiced medicine for 15 years before coming to the House. Indeed, I still see patients. Internal medicine. Many of my patients had Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the diseases that these folks claim they are going to cure with embryonic stem cells. 
   And to me I think it is really very unfortunate what they have been doing. It is really creating what I feel is false hope. Indeed, it is a deception to tell people that embryonic stem cells have that kind of potential. 
   And the reason I say that is embryonic stem cells have never been shown to be safe in animal studies. They have never really been studied in humans, whereas adult stem cells and umbilical cord blood stem cells have not only been shown to be safe in clinical therapeutics, but they have also been tested not only in animals and shown to be safe, but they have been given to human beings and shown to be effective and to work; whereas embryonic stem cells have a chronic problem, you might say. They form tumors, a specific type of tumor called the teratoma, in every animal study in which they have been used. And before embryonic stem cells could ever be used in any clinical application whatsoever, they have to first be shown to be safe. And for them to be shown to be safe, somebody has to turn off this property that they have to form tumors. And yet we saw person after person parading down to the floor saying these embryonic stem cells are going to cure this and cure this and cure that. And lo and behold, it is quite possible they will cure absolutely nothing. 
   Indeed, what is very, very interesting, and this just came out this past week, the week that the Democrats, in my opinion, are putting this deception forward on the American people, is it has been shown that amniotic fluid is filled with stem cells that have all of the properties of embryonic stem cells. They can do all the things and they behave just like embryonic stem cells, but they do not form tumors. And, of course, these cells are plentiful. They are noncontroversial. You don't have to kill a human embryo, which is what you have to do to get embryonic stem cells. You have to kill a human life. You have to kill a human embryo at its earliest stages to get those stem cells out, whereas amniotic fluid-derived stem cells behave just like the embryonic stem cells. They do all the things the embryonic stem cells do, but they don't form tumors. So they have tremendous potential application in clinical therapeutics. 
   So to me it was unfortunate, the deceptive messaging that went out from this body. And, indeed, it seemed to me like the bulk of the American press corps buys it hook, line, and sinker that these cures are around the corner. But in reality science is moving to a place where embryonic stem cells are not going to be used. 
   And the other thing is they have been studied for 25 years. There were many people who came to the floor and  said this research is just beginning. The Journal of Science had a cover story about 6 months ago on embryonic stem cells. ``Twenty-Five Years of Study'' was the cover. It was not 8 years. It is not a new field of study. It is actually an old field of study, and it is a field of study that, in my opinion, may yield knowledge and you may be able to write a Ph.D. thesis based on the material that you discover or learn from embryonic stem cells. 
   And, of course, we are funding it. We are funding it through the NIH right now. We are increasing funding each year, embryonic stem cell research, on the cell lines that exist at the NIH. And really all this study did was just to prove the destruction of more embryos, and that is really what the bill is all about. And this is a critical line in the sand, you might say, that our Nation's research establishment is moving across. We are now going to say that it is okay to take these forms of human life and exploit them in the lab, destroy them for therapeutic purposes, and we have never gone down that path before. 
   And that is not where it will end. They are saying now it is the ``excess embryos'' from the fertility clinics. They will come back next and say, well, there really wasn't that many available in those clinics and we really need to create human embryos for research purposes and we need to specifically create them through a process called cloning. They want to do human cloning. That is creating human life through the process of cloning for their ``research,'' and this is what they always do in all the arguments, saying what it will cure. 
   So before I yield back, I just want to say they were deceptive not just in their stem cell arguments. You were talking about taxes when I came to the floor. To me it was so ironic, or deceptive, almost like a culture of deception, in my opinion. They passed PAYGO and said no more are we going to pay for things if we don't have the funds to do it, and then the next day they waived PAYGO on their homeland security bill. I mean they get up and they say they are going to do all these things, and the very next day they waived that rule requirement in their homeland security bill. Furthermore, they had absolutely no explanation of how we were going to fund the provisions in their bill. 
   The Washington Post, a liberal Democrat newspaper, speculated that the cargo-screening requirements that they put in that bill, which the industry says is unnecessary, could end up costing our economy hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the Washington Post. An anti-Republican newspaper said that. They put that in there, and they have no explanation of how they are going to pay for it. 
   And, of course, I guess the ultimate irony was all the talk about doing away with earmarks and then they pass a minimum wage bill through the House that has a special earmark that was placed in there by somebody that benefited a company in Speaker Pelosi's congressional district, which, to me, is absolutely unbelievable. 
   But, anyway, I have covered a lot of territory. I really came to talk about stem cells, and I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Well, you are absolutely right. Adult stem cell research in humans has been funded for about 25, maybe even 30 years. Embryonic stem cell research in the mouse began about 25 years ago.     
   In the mid-1990s, the House and Senate passed and President Clinton signed into law a provision that said no Federal funds would go to any research that involved the destruction of a human embryo. 
   Shortly after that a doctor by the name of Jamie Thompson, I think it is, at the University of Wisconsin was successful in extracting embryonic stem cells from a human embryo. People had been doing that in the mouse, but I guess nobody had either the technique or the hutzpah, as my Jewish friends like to say, to actually destroy a human embryo in his lab. But he did that. He successfully isolated the human embryonic stem cell. And then researchers wanted to get Federal funding. This has always been about Federal funding. 
   We don't have a law restricting embryo research. People can do it. I think a lot of it is unethical, but there is no law barring it. This is all about getting the government to fund it. 
   Under the Clinton policy, because we had a law in place saying you can't get funding if you are destroying an embryo, what the Clinton people did is they destroyed the embryos in an outside lab, and then sent the embryonic stem cells over to the NIH and they funded the research. I and several other Members wrote the Clinton administration a letter saying you may not be violating the letter of the law, but you are certainly violating the spirit of the law. That is what President Bush inherited in 2000 when he became President of the United States. 
   What President Bush said, which I think is a reasonable thing, all of these embryos have been destroyed and all of these cell lines are being studied at the NIH. We don't want to throw them away. The embryos have been destroyed, but we don't want to keep destroying embryos, so we will continue to fund research on these embryos, we just won't destroy any more embryos. That is really what this debate has been about. The people on the other side of the debate have been saying this has so much incredible promise so we have to fund it. Even though, by the way, the biotech industry won't fund it; venture capitalists won't fund it. We want Uncle Sam and taxpayers to fund it, 50 percent of whom are pro-life and are opposed to this kind of research, because it ``has so much promise,'' quote/unquote, is what they have been arguing. 
   When you actually look at the data, it really doesn't bear up to scrutiny. That is the fundamental point of my argument. If you look at the science, the science shows a lot of potential with adult stem cells, cord blood stem cells, and now these new amniotic fluid derived stem cells. The embryonic stem cells form tumors. Their potential application to therapeutics, I think, is very small, remote, unlikely. You have to turn off their ability to form tumors before they can be used.

<DOCNO>Mr. WELDON of Florida. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1, IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 27, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my view of H.R. 1, The 9/11 Conference Report. I commend the bipartisan group that worked together on this bill, which on balance is a good bill, although I do have reservations about some provisions of the bill. 
   There are some very good provisions in this bill, which were not part of the House-passed bill. I am pleased that many of the significant problems in the version of this bill that passed the House in January have been removed from the final conference report that we are voting on today. 
   This bill no longer contains the provisions that place the collective bargaining policies of Transportation Security Administration, TSA, employees above the homeland security needs of the American people. This was a troubling provision that was included in the original House-passed version of this bill. It was troubling because collective bargaining rights would have interfered with the ability of the Department of Homeland Security and the TSA to impose the best work policies and procedures possible in order to make our Nation safer. It would have interfered with the ability to fully and quickly implement security-based policies. 
   I am pleased that the Conference Report contains a provision that grants immunity from civil lawsuits to those who report transportation-related suspicious activities. This is a crucial provision that will free American citizens from the fear of reporting activity that they think is suspicious. No one should be subject to a lawsuit because they report suspicious activity. 
   We cannot allow an atmosphere of fear of litigation to further hamper our ability to thwart acts of terror. If people feel some activity is suspicious, they should feel free to report it to the proper authorities. It is then up to the authorities to determine if it is suspicious enough to investigate. In weighing the rights of Americans, I believe the right to be free from injury or death from terrorists trumps the right of threatening people to conduct their threatening activity with impunity. This provision directly addresses the case of the six Imams who have brought suit against the passengers on their flight who reported their suspicious activity. It is clear to most observers that these individuals were likely fomenting fear in order to create the lawsuit that has resulted. I, and my fellow Americans, will not stand for the patent abuse of our own legal system used against us. 
   Provisions in the bill enhancing the screening of air cargo carried on passenger airlines is an important provision and one of which I am very supportive. The bill will also implement a program to collect biometric data on those entering the U.S. from visa waiver countries. This will enhance security as will the provision enabling us to take into account visa overstay violations when considering visa waiver country policies. 
   I agree with these and other provisions in the bill and believe they will enhance national security. However, there are some provisions that have little to do with homeland security and should never have been in this bill. In fact, none of these provisions were included in the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and in fact, do just the opposite of enhancing security. 
   I am greatly disappointed that the Democrat majority chose to include a provision that will disclose to the public, including terrorists, how much money our Nation spends on intelligence gathering. This should never have been included in a bill aimed at securing our Nation. How does disclosing to those who seek to harm the American people make our Nation safer? I will be supporting efforts to ensure that this budget is not revealed and that this is not disclosed. 
   Additionally, I am concerned that the bill included a provision that allows the administration to increase the scope of the Visa Waiver Program. Currently, individuals from 27 nations are permitted entry into the U.S. without having to go through the security processes related to obtaining a visa. I oppose this provision and will support legislative provisions to limit the administration's ability to expand the program. 
   Finally, I share some of the concerns raised by my colleagues relating to the provision requiring 100-percent screening of container cargo. I am concerned that there are loopholes and weaknesses in such a system and that simply requiring 100-percent screening may give the American people a false sense of security. There are deficiencies in the screening technologies and, once screened, the cargo can still be tampered with. I believe we need to weigh the implementation of this program and adjust it along the way to ensure that we are using our homeland security dollars as wisely as possible. Even the 9/11 Commission recommended that we base cargo inspections on a security risk assessment rather than a 100-percent screening program. I think they recognized the value of a focused program. 
   I look forward to continuing to work to address these issues.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Madam Speaker, it is my honor to rise in celebration of the coming 60th anniversary of the creation of the Nation of Israel next month. I have long been a supporter of Israel, and I am proud of the strong bonds that unite Israel with our own Nation. 
   Not only is Israel one of our foremost allies in the current fight against terrorism, but they have been a long partner in peace, in commerce and in the values of liberty. Israel, like America, rose to prominence through the hard work of immigrants, and Israel remains the best model of democracy, religious freedom and peaceful coexistence in a very hostile location in the world. The contributions of Israeli ingenuity and Israeli technology are making an impact in the Middle East and throughout the world. 
   And today, with Iran threatening to destroy Israel and developing nuclear technologies and ballistic missile technologies, it's more important than ever that people of good will, Jews, Christians and of all faiths rise up in support of Israel and acknowledge Israel's coming 60 birthday. 
   Mazel Tov, Israel.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about a provision in this bill waiving the Iran Nonproliferation Act to allow NASA to purchase launch services from Russia. 
   NASA is the greatest proliferator to Iran. Indeed, just this week, Russia announced its intent to provide Iran a missile defense system, not to protect its people, but to protect its nuclear weapons production facility. 
   Now NASA has been asking for this provision because of their concern that without it, they will not be able to get our astronauts to the space station after 2010, when the space shuttle is retired. 
   Now we are told we have to do this because we can't afford to fly the shuttle anymore. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is pathetic. In the same week we are debating a $700 billion bailout of Wall Street, we are told we can't afford to fly the shuttle and we have to rely on Russia. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is bad foreign policy. It sends a bad signal to Russia and a very bad signal to Iran.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Pitts amendment. I am concerned with the change in the abstinence policy in the PEPFAR budget to permissive authority for the administration to give grants to abstinence-based programs. I fear that this is a setback to the work we are doing overseas with AIDS relief. 
   The best way to stop AIDS is to encour age people to abstain from sexual behavior outside of marriage. Last July, southern African AIDS experts and officials listed, and I'm quoting here, reducing multiple concurrent partnerships as their number one priority for preventing the spread of HIV. 
   I used to treat AIDS patients. I used to practice infectious disease. The reason AIDS exploded through the gay community in this country in the late seventies and the early eighties was because of this phenomenon, having multiple concurrent sexual partne rs. And the reason Uganda, and you're going to hear Uganda quoted over and over again, was successful in lowering their AIDS incidence from 18 percent to 6 percent, and there was very little foreign aid going in the country at the time they did this, is because they established an education program. 
   People are rising on the floor today acting like there is no money for anything other than abstinence education. This is a very modest component of the bill. We have a lot of money for prevention. We have mo ney for mother-to-child prevention. We are simply requiring that a third of the money go to what I think is the most cost-effective venue that we could be using. 
   I would highly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. I believe right now under the current  law, the President has the authority to waive this requirement if the country team asks for it and as I understand some countries have and they have waived the authority. I believe that this language that they changed in PEPFAR is auth orizing and this should have been left to the authorizing debate. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Pitts amendment.

   Mr. WELDON of Florida. I just want to clarify a point just made by the gentleman from Rhode Island. Under the Smith language, contraceptive devices will be distributed. This whole debate is about whether we're going to give contraceptives to Planned Parenthood, Parenthood International, aggressively trying to overturn the pro-life laws in countries all over the world. 
   We have dramatically increased distribution under Mexico City of contraceptive devices. Ethiopia, from 4.9 million to 19.5 million. A big, long list here. This is about Planned Parenthood and their effort to overturn pro-life laws all over the world and we don't want to give money to them. That's what this debate is about.
