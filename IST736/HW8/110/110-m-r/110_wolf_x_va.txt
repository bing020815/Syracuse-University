<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE UNITED NATIONS AFRICAN UNION MISSION IN DARFUR (UNAMID) -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor of this measure, I rise in support of H. Res. 1351. In 2004, I led the first congressional delegation to Darfur with Senator Sam Brownback, and witnessed the nightmare there first hand. 
   In July 2007 the United Nations' Security Council passed resolution 1769 which authorized a joint African Union/United Nations Hybrid operation in Darfur to take necessary actions to support the Darfur Peace Agreement and to protect its personnel and civilians. However, to date, only 10,000 of the 26,000 peacekeeping troops authorized by resolution 1769 have been deployed. They are in desperate need of proper equipment and air transportation and have increasingly become subject to attack by various rebel groups. 
   It has been widely acknowledged in the international community that these troops do not have the necessary resources to effectively carry out their mandate. On July 8, seven UNAMID peacekeepers were killed and 22 were wounded in a rebel ambush in the northern region of Darfur. The peacekeepers on the ground in Darfur have become demoralized by the impossible conditions on the ground. 
   I am pleased to support H. Res. 1351 and reaffirm the commitment of the United States of America to the people of Darfur and the peacekeepers who are putting their lives on the line to protect them.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CALLING ON CHINA TO END HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES PRIOR TO THE OLYMPICS -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentleman. I thank him for yielding. 
   I want to thank Mr. Berman and Congresswoman ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN and Mr. Chabot for bringing the bill up. 
   I also want to thank President Bush for meeting yesterday with the dissidents, and I know they were probably passionate with him to explain how important it is to speak out. 
   I also want to second what Mr. Chabot said about the Speaker. I appreciate Speaker Pelosi raising this issue on human rights and religious freedom in China. There is tremendous persecution. Catholic bishops are in  jail. A large number of house church leaders are still in jail. As Mr. Smith said, there is a list of 730 dissidents that we should advocate publicly for. 
   In the days during the Reagan administration, President Reagan would advocate publicly for names. That is very important. We know what they've done in Tibet in the Drapchi prison in the persecution of Tibetan monks and nuns. We know the Uighurs, Rebiya Kadeer, whose children have been arrested and are in jail as we now speak. They're plundering, beating the Falun Gong. And even in Flushing, New York, we believe--and the FBI is investigating--that the Chinese embassy was involved in a counter-demonstration beating of the Falun Gong in Flushing, New York. Not in Flushing, China, but in Flushing, New York. 
   We know of the labor camps, the laogais. We know what Harry Wu has told us of the labor camps that are still operating, and there are more labor camps in China today than there were gulags in the Soviet Union. 
   We know when the Speaker said, very accurately, the genocide in Darfur, the Chinese government is the number one supporter of the genocidal government in Khartoum. And as Mr. Smith and Mr. Pence said on the one-child policy on forced abortion, we know what they're doing. 
   What I would urge the administration to do and the President to do--I want to make sure we don't violate the rules and I speak to the Speaker--is to give a speech the way that President Reagan gave a speech at the Danilov Monastery. It was a very powerful speech. As Natan Sharansky said, when Ronald Reagan gave the speech in Orlando, Florida, where he called the Soviet Union the Evil Empire, it sent a message through the Perm. The prisoners in the Perm knew of what President Reagan was publicly speaking out and advocating for, and the people in the Perm and the people in jail knew when President Reagan gave the Danilov Monastery speech that he was speaking out. 
   So I would urge the President to give a Danilov Monastery/Evil Empire speech in China. Select a Catholic church or a house church or a university and boldly speak out. Keep in mind Reagan boldly spoke out and called the Soviet Union the Evil Empire, boldly spoke out in the Danilov Monastery.

   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentleman. 
   Ronald Reagan spoke out both times very boldly. If you recall, at President Reagan's funeral, Gorbachev came and attended the funeral. You can do it in that way. So I urge the President. 
   I would also urge the committee to bring up Congressman Smith's Global Online Freedom bill so we can send a message, because when we were there, we saw that sometimes some American companies are cooperating with the Chinese government using American technology to cooperate. 
   My closing comment, Madam Speaker, is that we urge the President to give a Ronald Reagan Danilov Monastery-type speech so that when he leaves China, it is clear to the dissidents who are in prison--because they will hear him--it is clear to the family members of those dissidents--because they will hear him--and it will be doubly clear, triply clear to the Chinese government that America and the President of the United States stands for freedom, and that must be done publicly.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CONDEMNING THE PERSECUTION OF BAHA'IS IN IRAN -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res, 1008, condemning the persecution of the Baha'is in Iran. The Baha'is are Iran's largest non-Muslim minority and have faced severe and often brutal persecution since the Iranian government banned all formal Baha'i activity in 1983. Incidents of violence and persecution targeting members of the Baha'i community have increased under the current regime of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. 
   On July 18, the house of the Shaaker family in Kerman was torched only weeks after their car went up in flames. Officials investigating the scene attributed the incidents to electrical problems despite a series of threatening phone calls received by the family in the days leading up to the incident. This is one of over a dozen cases in a string of arson targeting Baha'is over the past 15 months. 
   These attacks follow the arrest and detention of the seven members of Iran's national Baha'i coordinating group in May. All of these individuals remain isolated in the notorious Evin Prison in Tehran without access to legal representation and are prohibited from contacting their families. At this time, no formal charges have been brought against these seven individuals. 
   I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues as a cosponsor of this important resolution, and I hope its passage will send a strong message to the Iranian government that the United States Congress will always stand in solidarity with the persecuted people of the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (LET'S GET SERIOUS ABOUT OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, last Tuesday Congressman JIM COOPER and I reintroduced the SAFE Commission Act, and I'm hopeful that by joining efforts our colleagues in the House and the Senate will embrace this bipartisan commission that could put our country on sound financial footing. 
   U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, the Heritage Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Concord Coalition and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget all support the Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission Act. 
   These groups also have joined on what they call ``The Fiscal Wake-Up Tour,'' which has been traveling across  America from San Francisco to Cincinnati laying out the facts about the future financial condition of our country, discussing possible options and preparing the way for tough choices that those of us in Congress are going to have to make. 
   When you look at this tour, you see groups who usually disagree more than they agree on policy issues. That makes it even more extraordinary that they all agree that we need to sit down and work together to make sure our country doesn't fall into a financial canyon that we can never climb out of. 
   That's the message that is resonating with folks who hear them: the need to come together and work to find bipartisan answers to ensure a secure financial future for America. 
   What the tour has told us, too, is that we shouldn't underestimate the willingness and ability of the American people to hear the truth and support the decisions necessary to change our financial course, and that's encouraging. 
   Many of you may recall the Simon and Garfunkel song, ``The Boxer,'' with the refrain, ``Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.'' The Fiscal Wake-Up Tour offers hope that with education Americans may be more ready than we think to accept the fact that Federal spending cannot continue to balloon without consequences. It is time that we tell the American people what they need to hear and not just what they want to hear. ``The Boxer'' song, ``Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.'' 
   Thirty years from now we won't be arguing in Congress over discretionary spending anymore because there will be no funding left in that category. 
   I'm not an expert in economics, but simple math tells us that little money will be left to ensure that our highways and bridges are safe, that there will be no money for cancer research and to solve the riddles of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, that there won't be money to care for veterans. 
   Resources will be scarce to ensure our schools are the best in the world so that our children and grandchildren can get the necessary tools, particularly in math and science, to compete in the world marketplace. 
   We owe it to our young people to start the process today. Reining in spending is both an economic and it is a moral issue. 
   We cannot continue to avoid our responsibility to future generations of Americans by passing on a broken system in the form of unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations and unsustainable spending. 
   We cannot continue to borrow and mortgage our future to countries like China, which has a terrible human rights record and has plundered Tibet, and has Catholic bishops in jail and Protestant pastors in jail and others in jail, or the Saudi Arabia that is funding Wahabism around the world, that they carry obscene amounts of our debt. 
   But I'm going to be candid. Congress, on its own, unfortunately can't get it done in this politically charged atmosphere of Washington today. The Congress today is dysfunctional. The latest public opinion polls perhaps validate my assessment. 
   The American people expect us to put our partisan differences aside and to work together to get things done. We must move beyond the politics and come to grips with the fact that the financial future of our country is an American issue. It's not a red issue or blue issue. It's a red, white and blue issue. It's an issue that, as Americans, we should be working together to deal with. 
   Under the SAFE Commission process, Congress is the ultimate decisionmaker obviously, but it will be the SAFE Commission, after holding hearings across the country, listening to the American people and putting everything on the table for discussion, entitlements and tax policies, which will send its recommendations to Congress for a mandatory up-or-down vote, similar to what we do on the base closing commission. 
   Congress will be the major part in the SAFE process. It will be at the table. We even hold out hope that Congress could find its way and act on its own. 
   First, at least four of the 14 congressionally appointed commission members must be sitting Members of Congress. 
   Second, if Congress enacts significant legislation aimed at addressing this looming crisis, the SAFE commission would terminate and cease to exist. 
   We hope this happens, but, quite frankly, I don't think it will. Abraham Lincoln once said: ``You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.'' 
   I believe there is a moral component to this issue that goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. By that I mean have we lost a national will to make the tough decisions. 
   The SAFE Commission offers us the opportunity to find a way forward to protect our future. Is it right for one generation to live very well knowing that its debts will be left to be paid for by their children and their grandchildren? No, it is not right, but it is immoral.  
   I'm challenging our colleagues today to come together--to know that while you served in Congress you did everything in your power to provide the kind of security and way of life for your children and grandchildren that your parents and grandparents worked so hard to provide for you. 
   The challenge, too, goes out to the leadership in Congress and the Administration to make this a truly bipartisan effort and put the SAFE Commission on the fast track to enactment. 
   How can we lack leadership on such a fundamental issue? 
   Leadership by definition requires taking initiative--to act before others, to develop fresh approaches. 
   This issue is timely and critical. 
   I urge you to review the bipartisan Cooper-Wolf legislation.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my frustration and disappointment with the leadership's decision to bypass the Appropriations Committee and to bring up the 2008 supplemental without giving Members an opportunity either on the floor or in the committee to offer an amendment. 
   I wanted to offer an amendment to prohibit U.S. Government employees from attending the Beijing Olympics on the taxpayers' dime because of China's violent repression of religious minorities and human rights activists. 
   Catholics, Protestants, Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, Falun Gong practitioners and other religious minorities in China face harassment, imprisonment, even torture and death. China is actively engaging in espionage against our country and now participating in a genocide in Sudan.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, America must develop a 21st century energy security policy that will reduce energy costs, increase energy independence, encourage energy conservation, strengthen the economy and protect the environment, including steps to cut carbon emissions and address the impacts of climate change. I believe that policy must also include a commitment to invest in clean, renewable energy technology, the responsible exploration of domestic energy sources, an increase in fuel efficiency standards, and the research necessary to develop the fuels of the future. 
   Today the House considers a bill that is over 1,000 pages, with only 12 hours of notice and only 1 hour of debate. I found it interesting that while the bill was not introduced and made available to members until 8:30 last night, K Street lobbyists provided copies to congressional staff 3 hours earlier. 
   In the limited time we have had to read the bill, I have found some provisions that I could support. The bill has provisions to invest in research and development of a whole host of renewable resources, promote energy efficiency by the Federal Government, promote energy conservation programs and investment by the private sector in renewable energy generation. If we are ever to become energy independent, those are the kinds of investment we must make. 
   The bill also has provisions to establish grants to promote public transportation and expand use of alternative fuels, and extend tax credits for energy efficient projects in commercial buildings, production of renewable electricity and investments in solar energy and fuel cells. Earlier this year I voted for the Udall/Platts amendment to require electricity companies to ensure that 15 percent of their electricity is generated by renewable and alternative sources by the year 2020. Renewable energy development is vital to our national security, our economic prosperity and the health of our environment.  
   Another provision I support and have cosponsored separate legislation will increase automobile fuel economy standards, also called CAFE, Corporate Average Fuel Economy. 
   But with all these positive steps promoting energy investment, why add provisions that will penalize domestic oil and gas production? America is at the mercy of countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and even China whose governments control oil resources around the world. If we are ever to wean our Nation from foreign sources of energy, we must tap our own energy sources. Congress had an opportunity through this bill to find ways to partner with America's oil and gas producers to provide incentives to encourage alternative energy use and development and to stop the rising costs of gas and oil. Instead, the legislation adds billions in increased taxes which will hurt energy consumers and threaten U.S. jobs. I don't believe any fair-minded person would say that the way to lower prices at the pump is by raising taxes on the companies that find, refine and transport gasoline. 
   That is no way to promote energy independence. The tax provisions not only increase taxes for domestic drilling, but also include a massive tax increase on U.S. companies producing energy abroad. This will have the effect of placing U.S.-based companies at a disadvantage by reducing their ability to compete for investments in foreign energy projects. This is unacceptable when China, India and Russia are working night and day to corner the market on many of the world's energy resources. In fact, Cuba has sold leases for offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico to China, India, Canada and Spain. 
   Additionally, I was shocked to see that provisions to promote telework in the Federal Government were removed from the final bill. According to Environmental Defense, 6 billion gallons of oil can be saved if commuters telework just 1 day each week. Most importantly, these telework provisions did not cost a penny. 
   Just a few weeks ago the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A&M University released its annual traffic congestion study which found that congestion creates a $78 billion annual drain on the U.S. economy due to 4.2 million lost hours of productivity and 2.9 billion gallons of wasted gas. That's not even considering the air pollutants caused by idling vehicles around the nation. Why did we not consider savings from the telecommuting provisions included in the energy bill passed earlier this year as an offset instead of new taxes on the backs of the American people? 
   I also have learned that this massive bill includes a $2 billion earmark for the City of New York. I am sure there are other special interest projects that have been creatively air dropped into the 1,061 pages of this bill. With so little time to cull through those pages, though, no one but the sponsors will know before we vote. No wonder the American people have such low regard for Congress. 
   To truly create an effective energy policy, we must have an open and transparent process for all members and in fact all Americans working together. We cannot achieve energy security by increasing taxes on oil and gas producers, which will cripple our economy and impact the pocketbook of every single American. We cannot create energy policy through wheeling and dealing or thousand page bills released just hours before a vote. 
   Finding bipartisan consensus in developing energy policy is critical for our Nation's future economy, prosperity and security. Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate must work together so that America can truly start on the path to energy independence that delivers energy security and lower costs for American consumers in a way that also promotes environmental stewardship. 
   We can do better. We must do better.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE REGIONAL STRATEGY IN CHAD AND DARFUR -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 1011, a resolution I sponsored expressing the concern of the House regarding the crisis in Chad. 
   I want to acknowledge the support of my colleague and Africa subcommittee Chairman Donald Payne in working together to introduce this resolution, and also thank Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman and ranking member Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen as well as Africa subcommittee ranking member Congressman Chris Smith for their support in this effort. 
   Since its independence in 1960, Chad has struggled through civil war and political unrest. Recent fighting in Chad has demonstrated beyond doubt the fragile conditions in the region and the continuing destructive behavior of the Government of Sudan in Chad and Darfur. While Chadian rebel groups and their Sudanese allies who laid siege to the capital in early February have since fled toward the east and Darfur, the fighting claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians and forced tens of thousands more out of the capital city and into neighboring Cameroon. 
   This resolution calls on the United States government and the international community to promptly develop, fund, and implement a comprehensive regional strategy to protect civilians, facilitate humanitarian operations, contain and reduce violence, and contribute to conditions for sustainable peace and good governance in Chad. 
   It also calls for a strategy for the wider region that includes northern Central African Republic and the Darfur region of Sudan, as recent developments in Chad illustrate the terrible threat facing civilians and the risk of another major humanitarian disaster in that region. 
   The resolution acknowledges the concern about the safety and well being of innocent civilians in Chad, Chadian refugees and internally displaced persons, and refugees from Darfur and the Central African Republic that have taken refuge in Chad and strongly condemns Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and the National Congress Party for their support of the armed rebellion and aggressive behavior in Chad and throughout the region. 
   It also urges the Government of Chad to engage in an inclusive national dialogue with all stakeholders of the current conflict to reach a comprehensive agreement that would address the root causes of the Chadian crisis and strengthen democratic institutions. The resolution also urges the government to work to protect its civilians from violence and to honor its May 9, 2007, agreement with the United Nations Children's Fund, ensuring its commitment to end all recruitment of persons under the age of 18 and demobilize all children under the age of 18 from its security forces. 
   The resolution further urges the Government of the Central African Republic to fulfill its obligation under international law to protect civilians and engage in constructive and inclusive dialogue with opposition and armed groups. 
   The resolution also calls on armed opposition groups to renounce violence and respect the rule of law, engage in political dialogue to resolve the current crisis in their respective countries, and immediately end cooperation with the Government of Sudan and others that encourage and support armed rebellion. 
   Recognizing the importance of the United Nations Security Council in ending this crisis, the resolution urges the Security Council to remain focused on the crises in Chad and the  Central African Republic, and to ensure the effective and impartial protection of civilians, including internally displaced persons and refugees, particularly local populations, by preempting, preventing, and deterring attacks on civilians. 
   The United States also has an important role to play in resolving the situation in Chad, and the resolution calls on the president to continue United States humanitarian assistance to the refugees and internally displaced persons in Chad and the Central African Republic, provide support to strengthen democratic institutions and respect for human rights and rule of law, and seek punitive measures against the Government of Sudan by the United Nations Security Council for its aggression and destructive activities in Chad and the region. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is important for this House to express its concern about the crisis in Chad and how the political instability and humanitarian crisis there is impacting the entire region. I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

   The corridor goes over and includes Gettysburg, where Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address. Antietam, 20,000 people died. No environmental impact statement. No consideration of energy efficiency technology. No consideration for historic lands. It is an assault on property rights. 
   In the last Congress, we all got worked up on the Kelo decision. This is, in essence, whereby they can do this. And someone said, well, you go through the State. The power companies won't really try to go through the States. They will pro forma it, knowing that they can go to FERC and FERC will do it. 
   Here's what the FERC administrator said: ``The authority to lawfully deny a permit is critically important to the States for ensuring that the interests of the local communities and the citizens are protected.'' 
   What the Commission does today, it's a significant inroad in traditional State transmission citing authority. It gives States two options: Either issue a permit, or we will do it for them. Obviously, there is no choice.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Let me start by commending the chairwoman on putting together a thoughtful bill, her first as the chairwoman of this new and important subcommittee. I must also recognize the chairwoman's continuation of this subcommittee's bipartisan tradition, as well as stating how much I appreciate the chairwoman's willingness to listen to our concerns and accommodate them as much as possible. 
   Overall, I think it is a very good bill, but I do have some concerns. 
   First and foremost, I believe this bill sends a terrible message to the State Department's officers and foreign service nationals and our military fighting in Iraq. The report accompanying the bill clearly states that there is no funding provided for Iraq. I intend to offer an amendment to restore $158 million of the $391 million that the President requested. I believe that not providing the requested funding for counterterrorism and de-mining activities is shortsighted and potentially dangerous. This program has trained more than 1,000 Iraqis in explosive detection and removal, therefore helping to protect the lives of our military and also improving public safety to reduce insurgent access to deadly munitions. 
   No funds are provided to develop effective civilian law enforcement and anti-terrorism programs in Iraq, specifically to focus on strengthening terrorist financing and money laundering. 
   No funds are provided to continue English language training and professional training for military officers in the United States. This training focuses on international human rights, fostering respect for civilian control of the military and the rule of law. Such funding is crucial if public statements by Members about wanting Iraqis to be able to defend themselves are, in fact, accurate and not purely rhetorical. 
   Also, this fits into the recommendations made by the Iraq Study Group, and when the resolution came up a while back that the other side had, I think 220-some Members said they supported the Iraq Study Group. 
   Well, no funding is provided to help Iraq manage their national budget, a crucial step towards Iraq self-reliance. No funding is included to enable Iraq to stimulate local economies to counter the impact of the insurgents. Assistance was requested and denied that would help Iraq create jobs in the agriculture sector and create food production, thereby stimulating Iraq's second largest economic sector after the oil area. These funds would directly weaken the insurgent base in rural areas, which we all on both sides want to do. 
   Finally, no funding is included to help national reconciliation, political reform, and fair provincial elections in 2008 and fair national elections in 2009. Additional funding was requested to develop the Iraqi criminal justice system. These necessary funds would allow the Iraqi government to identify, bring to justice, and incarcerate insurgents and terrorists who are trying to destabilize the country. So, hopefully, we can adopt that amendment. 
   The second issue of concern for me is there are new provisions regarding funding for family planning programs overseas. The President clearly stated in a May 3, 2007, letter to the Speaker of the House that he would veto any legislation that weakens current Federal policies and laws on abortion. As a result of these language changes alone, I believe the bill will now be vetoed, which is unfortunate because there are so many good things in the bill. 
   Thirdly, the bill does not include any funding to support the recommendations by Commission for Assistance to a Free Cuba. The Castro regime is the only nondemocratically elected government in the Western Hemisphere. So now is the time to demonstrate a commitment to the future of freedom for Cuba and to fund the programs that will facilitate peaceful democratic transition. And, again, this has nothing to do with the whole trade issue that this place talks about or the whole travel issue. This is to help the democratic movement in Cuba. 
   In conclusion, I believe this bill has the potential to do a lot of good, and I want to say that this bill will help save a lot of lives not only here but around the world. This is the work of the Lord. And I know Members are going to come down and are going to be against the bill. And I hope that we can change some of these things to prevent a veto, but this bill, eventually when it passes, assuming it will be vetoed, is really to feed the poor, the hungry, the naked, the sick. Almost a better title would be a Matthew 25 bill. So it has the potential to do a lot of good, and I hope to work with Chairwoman Lowey to ensure the State Department has what it needs to do these things, the war on terror, to provide humanitarian assistance to the most needy, and to improve human rights around the world. 
   And Members on our side are offering amendments with regard to cutting. This is actually under the allocation with regard to the administration. 
   I look forward to working with the chairwoman to resolve the differences. 
   I also want to thank Nisha Desai, Craig Higgins, Steve Markes, Michel Sumilas, Celia, Rob, and also Christine, who were too embarrassed to put their names down. I wanted to put them down too. And I also want to thank the full committee staff on both sides, who have been very helpful. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I would shudder to think how the Nation's Capital would function without Metro. Visitors from all over the country, as the other Members have said, and all over the world use this system when visiting the Nation's Capital.

During the terrorist attacks of 9/11, when the Pentagon was hit, this city was immobilized and you could not get in and you could not get out. Metro was the reliable source, the reliable way to ensure that thousands were able to safely and quickly evacuate the city. This is, as the majority leader said, America's system. 
   I thank Mr. Davis again, and God bless him on his service.  
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my Virginia colleague  and long-time advocate for the transportation needs of the Washington metropolitan area. 
   This House and this region are going to miss TOM DAVIS. He has worked tirelessly to provide the needed support and oversight of the Washington Metro system to ensure that it serves not only the residents and commuters of Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, but the millions of visitors to the Capital City. 
   I have been pleased to work with Congressman DAVIS as well as Congressman HOYER and others in the Washington metropolitan area congressional delegation to spur Congress as Metro's partner, providing the Federal investment to operate the system. 
   Every Congress and every administration since 1960 when President Eisenhower signed the National Capital Transportation Act creating the agency to develop a rapid rail system in the Nation's capital has recognized the Washington Metro system as America's subway. 
   I shudder to think how the Nation's capital would function without Metro. Visitors from all over the country and indeed the world use the system daily when visiting our nation's capital. Metro's highest ridership days have come when national events were taking place here, attended by thousands of citizens from across the country--presidential inaugurations, holiday celebrations, and events such as the Pope's recent visit. 
   The Metro system also supports the Federal workforce. Federal employees rely on Metro to commute back and forth to work and home every day, and also between Federal offices during the day. During peak times, over half of Metro's riders are Federal employees and contractors. 
   Finally, this system is vital to the emergency needs of the region. During the terrorist attacks of 9/11, Metro was the reliable way to ensure that thousands of people were able to safely and quickly evacuate the city. 
   Now today, with gas prices soaring, Metro serves as the mass transit option for growing numbers of commuters. 
   It was a 16-year effort after President Eisenhower signed the planning legislation which culminated in Metrorail's opening day in 1976 with five stations operating 4.2 miles on the Red Line. Some 12 years later in 1988, Metrorail carried its one-billionth rider. In 2001, Metro opened the five-station, 6.5-mile segment to Branch Ave, completing the 103-mile, 83 station Metrorail system. 
   With Metro's growing use and importance in providing mobility for thousands of riders every day, it is critical that this Congress makes sure that capital improvements and preventive maintenance are provided to ensure the system's continued operation. 
   With the federal investment, however, comes the expectation that Metro be accountable for the taxpayer funds which it uses. This amendment is important to that effort and I urge adoption of Congressman DAVIS's amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, in August 2006, four of the computers in my personal office were compromised by an outside source. This source first hacked into the computer of my Foreign Policy and Human Rights staff person, then the computers of my Chief of Staff, my Legislative Director and my Judiciary Committee staff. On these computers was information about all the case work I've done on behalf of political dissidents and human rights activists around the world. That kind of information, as well, everything else on my computer, e-mails, memos, correspondence and district case work, was open for outside eyes to see. 
   I'm aware that the computers in the offices of several other Members of the Congress were similarly compromised, as well as a major committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee. That means the computers in the House Foreign Affairs Committee have been compromised. It is logical to assume that critical and sensitive information about U.S. foreign policy and the work of Congress to help people who are suffering around the world, was also open to view from those official computers. 
   In subsequent meetings with the House Information Resources and the FBI, it was revealed that the outside sources responsible for this attack came from within the People's Republic of China. Just so it's understood, they acknowledged that this attack came from within the People's Republic of China. 
   The cyber attacks permitted the source to probe our computers to evaluate our systems defenses and to view and copy information. My suspicion is some say that I perhaps was targeted by the Chinese sources because of the history of speaking out about China's abysmal, very abysmal human rights record. 
   My offices' computers were cleaned and returned to me by House Information Resources, but ever since this happened, I've been deeply concerned that this institution, the institution of the United States Congress, is definitely not adequately aware of or protected from these types of threats. 
   I've also learned that this threat exists not only here in the Capitol complex, but also when Members travel overseas. I've been told that, particularly in countries in which access to information is tightly controlled by the government, Members are at risk of having their conversations and information recorded or stolen from their cell phones and Blackberry devices. That means, when a Member of the House, the Senate or the administration goes abroad, goes to China, everything, and if they use their cell phone or they use their Blackberry, it's being recorded by the Chinese government. And I don't believe any Member of the Congress has been told of that. 
   As I've shared my office experience with other Members, it has become clear to me that many Members and committees of other offices in the House do not fully understand the extent of the threat against the security of their offices and how to protect themselves. 
   I have no information to confirm this, but it would be realistic that the Senate may also be at risk. 
   The committees in both Chambers on Government Reform, Intelligence, the Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services and the Homeland Security should have hearings on this issue. This is an issue that must have public hearings, as well as closed door and private hearings. 
   That is why, Madam Speaker, I'm here today on the House floor. I'm speaking out about the threat of cyber attacks from China and other countries on the entire U.S. government, including our military, because of my deep concern about maintaining the security and the integrity of our government. 
   According to a report from the Congressional Service, and I quote, ``U.S. counterintelligence officials reportedly have stated that about 140 different foreign intelligence organizations regularly attempt to hack into the computer systems of U.S. government agencies and U.S. companies.''     
   This happens with alarming frequency, according to a recent Business Week article entitled ``The New E-spionage Threat.'' This article states that U.S. Government agencies reported almost 13,000 cyber security incidents in fiscal year 2007, triple the number from just 2 years earlier. 
   The May 31 cover story of the National Journal, the respected National Journal, says, ``The Chinese Cyber-Invasion,'' and every Member should read it, titled the ``Chinese Cyber-Invasion'' reported, ``Electronic devices by the U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez and his party during a December 2007 visit to China were invaded using spyware that could steal information.'' Gutierrez was in China with a high-level delegation to discuss trade-related issues. 
   Now, this Congress said it's concerned about trade-related issues with China, and that's why he was there, such as intellectual property rights, consumer product safety, and market access. The Associated Press also reported on the breach. Why did we learn about this in the press instead of from our own government officials? Did our government do anything about this attack? Did they get information from Secretary Gutierrez that could be used against American business in negotiation of trade agreements? 
   China, in particular, is actively engaged in espionage against the United States. I recently had the opportunity to read, and I hope every Member of the Congress has read, the U.S.-China Economic Security Review Commission's classified report--it is in the House Intel Committee--to the Congress and found the report's conclusions to be very alarming. The report addresses China's activities in the areas of espionage, cyber warfare, and arms proliferation. I strongly urge all Members of the House to read this report as it gives a clear picture of the threat that China poses, the threat, and in their words, that China poses to our national security. 
   In fact, the Pentagon's 2008 annual report to Congress stated that ``in the past year, numerous computer networks around the world, including those owned by the U.S. Government, were subject to intrusions that appear to have originated within the People's Republic of China.'' 
   According to the Business Week article in 2007, the U.S. Government launched a classified operation called Byzantine Foothold to combat sophisticated new attacks that were compromising sensitive information at the State Department and a defense contractor, such as Boeing, the source of which U.S. officials allege is China. 
   The Business Week article states that computer attacks have targeted sensitive information on the Internet works of at least several Federal agencies: the Defense Department, the State Department, the Energy Department, the Commerce Department, the Health and Human Services Department, and the Agriculture Department, and the Treasury Department. Defense contractors Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Electric, Raytheon, and General Dynamics have also been targeted. 
   Despite everything we read in the press, our intelligence and law enforcement, national security, and diplomatic corps remain hesitant to speak out on the problem. Perhaps they are afraid that talking about the problem will reveal our vulnerability. In fact, I have been urged not to speak out about this threat. But our adversaries already know we are vulnerable. Pretending that we are not vulnerable is a mistake. 
   As a Nation, we must decide when we are going to start considering this type of activity a threat to our national security and the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces, a threat that we must confront and which we must protect ourselves. 
   Madam Speaker, the apparent lack of national urgency to address this problem only gives those who wish us harm an extra advantage. 
   The Government Accounting Office reported in 2007 that no comprehensive strategy exists yet to coordinate improvements of computer security across the Federal Government in the private sector.  
   I strongly believe that the appropriate officials, including those of the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, should brief all Members of Congress in a closed session regarding threats from China and other countries against security of House technology including our computers, BlackBerry devices, and phones. There must be a session where any Member who is interested has the opportunity to get briefed by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security and others. 
   The potential for massive and coordinated cyber attacks against the United States is no longer a futuristic problem. We must prepare ourselves now and develop procedures for responding to this threat. Members need to know how best to protect themselves, their staff, and their official business from these threats. I have experienced this threat firsthand, as have others in the Congress, and are deeply worried that this institution, the United States Congress, is not adequately protected. 
   Congress should take the lead in protecting our government and indeed our country from the threat posed by cyber espionage activities. 
   James Lewis, the director of the Technology and Public Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies remarked last year in testimony before the House committee on Homeland Security that ``If gangs of foreigners broke into the State or Commerce Department and carried off dozens of file cabinets, there would be a crisis. When the same thing happens in cyberspace, we shrug it off as another of those annoying computer glitches we must live with.'' 
   The apparent complacency in both the private and public sectors toward this threat is astonishing. We must know about the threat. We must speak out about how to protect ourselves and form a comprehensive strategy with which to respond. 
   Stephen Spoonamore, a CEO of a cyber security firm called Cybrinth, put the matter succinctly in the National Journal article. He said, ``By not talking openly about this, they are making truly a dangerous national security problem worse ..... Secrecy in this matter benefits no one. Our Nation's intellectual capital, industrial secrets, economic security are under daily and withering attack. The oceans that surround us are no protection from sophisticated hackers, working at the speed of light on behalf of nation-states and mafias.'' 
   We must cease, Madam Speaker, this Congress must cease, the administration must cease denying the scope and scale and risk of the issue. And he goes on to say a growing number of his peers ``believe that our Nation is in grave and growing danger.'' 
   Mr. Spoonamore is right. We are making this dangerous national security problem worse by not discussing it openly. I believe this institution, as my resolution states, should get the facts, and armed with these facts, should take the necessary action to protect the safety and integrity of the House. 
   In 1789, Madam Speaker, British Parliament member William Wilberforce, speaking to his colleagues about the slave trade, said, ``having heard all of this, you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say you do not know.'' 
   This Congress on both sides of the aisle and people in the administration can never again, can never again say you do not know; and the American people should ask their Members of Congress, Do you know and what are you going to do about it. 
   We cannot afford to look the other way when foreign sources are threatening to compromise our government institutions, our economy, our very way of life through cyber espionage. We cannot sit by and watch. I urge the adoption of the resolution. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. WOLF. Before I yield the gentleman 5 minutes, I would say this is bigger than just the House, though. The computers of the House have been violated and when Members go abroad, but also, it deals with people in the administration. 
   And so I think there need to be public hearings by the Armed Services Committee and by the Judiciary Committee. This Congress is never reluctant to hold a hearing on different things. This is a major issue so it must be broader than just the House Administration Committee.

   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentlelady for her agreement. I think we have to, one, read the National Journal. This is a very respected magazine. And this is a serious problem. Up until now, it has been neglected by many in the administration and many in Congress. 
   Secondly, I think the American people are ahead of this Congress. And quite frankly on this issue with China, I think they are ahead of the administration. They are ahead of the administration on human rights, religious freedom, persecution and bad goods coming in from China. This Congress and this administration ought to wake up. 
   Thirdly, people are not anxious to talk about this in the Congress, nor are they anxious to talk about it in the administration. They are not anxious to talk about it. There was an effort to have me not go ahead with this using different techniques and different ideas. And we complied. We worked with the majority every way we can. 
   I want to say this. I will not let this issue rest. I may not be the fastest person in this institution. But I am as dogged as anyone. And I expect the leadership, I expect the leadership to deal with this not just by the House Administration Committee, I expect the leadership to deal with this on the Armed Services Committee. I expect the leadership to deal with this with regard to the House Intelligence Committee. I expect the Government Operations, has the Government Operations Committee ever been reluctant to hold a hearing on anything? And the answer is ``no.'' They must deal with this issue. And I tell the gentlelady, who has been very good, and I thank her for that, that if this is not resolved, I will be down here on the floor. I will rework this resolution. It will be a privileged resolution. And the next time there will be a vote on this. And then the American people, the American people can see how aggressive this administration and this Congress will be on a major national security issue and the issues of religious freedom and persecution. Keep in mind that 35 Catholic  bishops are in jail in China. Two hundred Protestant pastors are in jail in China. They have plundered the Tibetans, and they're persecuting the Uighurs. This is not a government that is very friendly. And also they are the leading supporter of genocide in Darfur. 
   With that, knowing this will be dealt with, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I had wanted to offer two amendments, one that would have prohibited government officials from attending the genocide Olympics on taxpayer money, and also Members of Congress. And no Member of Congress who speaks out on human rights should go to that Olympics. 
   Secondly, I wanted to offer an amendment that would create a bipartisan commission, much like the Iraq Study Group, to look at everything, to put everything on the table, all of the spending and tax policies, to get control of our spending and where we are. 
   We have $54 trillion of unfunded liabilities in this Nation. We have $9 trillion of debt, $1 trillion that the Chinese hold, and the Saudis also hold a large portion, the Saudis who had 15 Wahabbies on those airplanes that went into our buildings. 
   Standard & Poor's says we will lose our AAA bond rating in 2012, and Moody's says we will lose it in 2018. The value of the dollar is falling like a rock. Gasoline is increasing. Mr. Speaker, what kind of country are we leaving to our children? Are we leaving a country whereby China and Saudi Arabia will be their bankers? 
   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran pastor who stood up to the Nazis, said, ``The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children.'' 
   This Congress, on both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democratic side, is not leaving a very good situation to their children and their grandchildren. I would ask you as Members of this Congress, as parents and grandparents, what kind of country do you want to  leave? What are you going to tell your kids and your grandkids later on when you say, When I was there, there was $54 trillion of debt, and I did nothing. There was $1 trillion held by the Chinese, who are spying against us, and Mr. Murtha knows how they are spying against us, we did nothing. 
   We lost our AAA bond rating, Mom or Dad or Grandma or Grandpa while you were there, did you do anything? And the answer will be: We did nothing.  
   I rise in opposition to this legislation. 
   I have been a member of the Appropriations Committee since 1995, yet I cannot recall a time that the House has avoided the Appropriations Committee process with such a critical nationally and internationally important piece of legislation. 
   Members of the Committee--including the minority--are being shut out of the process. 
   I wanted to offer an amendment that would prohibit U.S. government employees from attending the Olympics on the taxpayer's dime. 
   When awarded the honor of hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics, China had the opportunity to show the world that it has changed. But the China of today is worse than the China of yesterday, or of last year, or of the last decade. China is not progressing. It is regressing. It is more violent, more repressive, and more resistant to democratic values than ever before. 
   China, which jails Catholic bishops, Protestant house church leaders, Tibetan Buddhists, Muslim Uyghurs and Falun Gong practitioners; which is spying against us and supplying weapons to regimes like Khartoum; which has an extensive system of slave labor camps, was awarded the honor of hosting the 2008 summer Olympic games. 
   We should not reward the Beijing regime with our taxpayer dollars. U.S. officials should not be permitted to use Federal funds to attend the 2008 Olympics. But I am being prevented from offering this amendment because the Democrat leadership has gone around the Appropriations Committee and brought this bill to the floor under a closed rule. 
   I also wanted to offer an amendment that would create a bipartisan commission--much like the Iraq Study Group--to look at everything--tax policy and entitlement spending--and recommend legislative action to rein in our Federal debt. 
   We have $53 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over $9 trillion dollars in debt. Standard and Poor's Investment Service has indicated that we could lose our triple-A bonding rating as early as 2012. The value of the dollar is falling through the floor. China holds our debt. OPEC countries like Saudi Arabia hold our debt. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said, ``The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children.'' 
   Our grandchildren will bear the burden of out-of-control entitlement spending if we do not act. It's on our watch to fix, and the process being used today shuts out critical issues that we must face. 
   This House needs to come together and work in a bipartisan manner to address the critical issues facing our country. This legislation today is the product of the heavy hand of the Democrat leadership in foreclosing an open and fair process and I cannot support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (IRAQ STUDY GROUP -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, before I begin, I would also like to second what the Speaker said with regard to Leo McCarthy. He was also a member of the National Commission on Gambling, which I was the author of. And he came by my office a number times. And I was actually going to put his bio in the Congressional Record. So I thank the Speaker for that comment, and second it. 
   Madam Speaker, I was the author of the amendment to set up the Iraq Study Group. I felt that more should be done to look at what we were doing in Iraq, and so we put together a group and picked 10 people. It was chaired by former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton, head of the 9/11 Commission. Also  serving on it was former Secretary of State Larry Eagleberger; former prominent lawyer, Vernon Jordan; former Justice of the Supreme Court Sandra Day O'Connor; former Member of the House and Chief of Staff, in the Clinton administration, Leon Panetta; former Secretary of Defense, in the Clinton administration, Bill Perry; former Senator, and Governor from my State, Chuck Robb; and at one time, up until the end, a month before, current Secretary of Defense Gates, former head of the CIA. 
   This group was provided the opportunity to, in depth, to take a look at what was going on in Iraq and to develop some recommendations. The resolution that I have introduced as House Con. Res., that puts the Congress on record in support of the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. 
   Now, here's a group that has taken 9 months to analyze extensive hearings. Also there were 45 military and diplomatic experts, retired and active duty, of all political persuasions, along with key congressional leaders that came up with these recommendations. So I am asking Members to support my resolution when it comes up next week in support of this. 
   Secondly, it makes a major effort and encourages the administration to adopt also a diplomatic effort in addition to what it is doing. We urge the administration to engage Syria the same way that President Reagan during the 1980s, when we were defeating communism, President Reagan, God bless him, one of the greatest presidents we have ever had, gave the famous speech in Orlando about the evil empires. But he was also having his administration engage with the Soviet Union. And when Ronald Reagan then gave his speech, saying, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall,'' Reagan also had emissaries going to Moscow to engage. 
   Those of us in the Congress, when we used to go behind the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall in the Soviet Union, during the 1980s would always meet with the dissidents, would always attempt to meet with the leadership of the government on behalf of freedom, on behalf of liberty. 
   President Reagan was self-confident in what he believed. He believed that to engage the Soviets was not a sign of weakness. It was a sign of strength. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to put in the Record an article from the Wall Street Journal by Abraham D. Sofaer, who was counselor to Secretary of State Schultz, who also explains how Reagan engaged with the Soviets and how it is appropriate now how he would engage with Syria. 
   I am hopeful and I ask all Members to support the resolution when it comes up.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Smith, and for Mr. Smith's faithfulness to be over here. 
   This institution is frankly changing. It is changing before our eyes. This institution, on both sides of the aisle, almost doesn't seem to care anymore on these issues of fundamental human rights. This institution needs a little bit of Ronald Reagan. 
   Many of you voted to give this government PNTR. Read the letter. The conditions have changed dramatically. They're worse today than when you gave them PNTR. And yet this place is almost empty. Nobody seems to care anymore. 
   Father Ly is in jail. The American Ambassador ought to be fired. This administration has done a horrible job. 
   Let me just read some of the things that have gone on since we gave them PNTR and the President went over there. February 18, 2007, the second day of Lunar, Father Ly was banished to a remote secluded area. Does the Congress care? Does the administration care? 
   March 5, 2007, security forces in Saigon told Mrs. Bui Ngoc Yen that they had an order to arrest her husband. 
   March 8, 2007, Reverend Nguyen Cong Chinch were brutally assaulted by the security forces. 
   March 8, 2007, two prominent human rights activists and lawyers, Mr. Nguyen Van Dai and Ms. Le Thi Cong Nhan were arrested in Hanoi, told they would be detained for 4 months. 
   March 9, 2007 Mr. Tran Van Hoa, a member of the People's Democracy Committee, summoned by the security forces and threatened with ``immeasurable consequences,'' that's in quotes. 
   March 10, 2007, Do Nam Hai, an engineer writing under the pen name Phuong Nam, one of the leading members of the Alliance for Democracy told by security forces he could be indicted any time. 
   March 10, the same day, state security forces raided the home of Ms. Tran Khai Thanh, a writer. 
   March 12, 2007, do you get a pattern here? Can anyone see a pattern sort of developing here? 
   The Congress gave them MFN. Probably a majority on both sides gave them MFN. But do you see a pattern here? 
   March 10, state security forces. 
   March 12, lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a consultant on local government for the World Bank was arrested in his hometown. 
   April 5, 2007 the Vietnamese authorities in Hanoi rudely prevented Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, from your side of the aisle, from meeting with several dissidents' wives at a gathering organized at the Ambassador's house. 
   Now this Ambassador, frankly, and Mr. Lantos, and we have a bill that's coming up, this Ambassador has failed to turn the American Embassy into an island of freedom. During the days of Ronald Reagan, one of the greatest presidents we have ever had, not only in modern times, but in all times, turned the American Embassy in Moscow into an island of freedom that dissidents felt comfortable coming, and they were invited. 
   This Ambassador is just the opposite. He's silent. Dr. Martin Luther King said silence is the real danger. You expect the silence of your enemies, but you don't expect the silence of our friends. 
   Furthermore, the Hanoi government still has a large number of dissidents that are in jail. 
   Lastly, and I'm going to read a letter that I'm going to put in the Record that we sent to Secretary Rice the other day. The Vietnamese American community, a young but energetic group comprised of more than 1 million citizens, should be included in future dialogues with U.S. government officials. They know the history, the culture and the values of Vietnam. They also scrutinize the history and the tactics of communism and the Communist government's habits at the negotiating table. 
   I sincerely believe that the history of Vietnam must inform our approach to this and all other aspects of foreign policy. And the Vietnamese American community is a tremendous asset in this regard. Quite frankly, this administration, when Ambassador Marine leaves, ought to put a Vietnamese American in who understands these issues. So I'm going to submit this in the Record. 
   But these are important issues. This Congress just can't give these people human rights. And frankly, there is a whole shift taking place. I saw the other day, and if I'm wrong, I'll correct it for the record, that Steven Spielberg is now representing the Chinese government for the Olympics. One of Spielberg's greatest movies was the movie that he did with regard to what took place by Nazi Germany, Schindler's List. 
   Well, now there's a Schindler's list operation going on in China. There are 42 Catholic bishops that are in jail with China, with priests. And for those who might think it might be amusing, China is the one that's trying to do nothing with regard to the genocide in Darfur. 400,000 people have died. The head of China goes to Khartoum 2 months ago with a bold announcement. The announcement is they are going to build a new palace for the Sudanese that are bringing about genocide. Genocide in Darfur. 
   There are 46,000 house church leaders, leaders, committed leaders, house church leaders that are in jail in China today. In Tibet, it's against the law to have a picture of the Dalai Lama, and the Chinese public security police sent three public security police to my district spying on Rebiya Kadeer. If you read the Washington Post editorial last week, spying on Rebiya Kadeer in Fairfax County. Her three kids have been arrested. She's a Muslim. Her three kids have been arrested. So I just see, and I want to thank Mr. Smith for doing this, but frankly, for the Congress just to grant MFN to this fundamentally evil government, and for us to just sort of move on and just kind of not care anymore, it just is really troubling. When we fail to speak out for the least, we fundamentally fail to speak out for everyone. And so let me just say, I didn't know this was coming up, and I just caught it and came over here. I want to thank Mr. Smith for his faithfulness in being involved. And frankly, any Member that voted to give these guys PNTR, on both sides of the aisle, man, you've got a great responsibility now to really do something on these people. These are dissidents that are in jail. They are being suffered. 
   And frankly, I end by saying we ought to do more the way that Ronald Reagan did in the 1980s. Speak out on human rights, religious freedom and those values. And with that, you ought to call a role call vote on this because, frankly, this government is so dense that if they see a voice vote they won't even think it it's important. There ought to be a roll call vote so we can send a message on behalf of Father Ly, a Catholic bishop, a Catholic priest who's done nothing, and all these other people. And frankly, this ambassador ought to be shown the door. And we ought to put somebody in who represents the values of this country. Quite frankly, it ought to be a Vietnamese American who can go over there and advocate on behalf of those who are being persecuted.

   None of us can say that we do not know about the Nation's long-term financial outlook, which former Comptroller General David Walker said will result in a tsunami of spending debt level that will swamp our ship of state. It is time that this Congress and this administration and Secretary Paulson wake up to the massive debt that we are amassing. 
   Congressman Jim Cooper and I are working together on a bipartisan plan called the SAFE Commission, where 78 colleagues are with us. If there are other bipartisan solutions that you all have, put them on the table and let's get them discussed. It will take the leadership on a Wilberforce level from both sides of the aisle. 
   We know what is happening, and for the sake of our children and our grandchildren, we must not look the other way. Wilberforce said, and I close, having heard all of this, you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say you did not know.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CONGRESSWOMAN JO ANN S. DAVIS POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - April 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5489, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6892 Main Street in Gloucester, Virginia, as the ``Congresswoman Jo Ann S. Davis Post Office.'' 
   I would like to thank Congressman Rob Wittman for introducing this legislation to honor the memory of our colleague and friend. 
   Congresswoman Davis was not only my House colleague, she was my Virginia colleague who represented the First District of Virginia--a district, which she proudly called ``America's 1st District'' because of our country's roots at Jamestown and the many significant events in history, which occurred there. 
   Her career in elected office spanned 10 short years--from her first election in 1997 to the Virginia House of Delegates to her four elected terms in the House beginning in 2000. But over that decade, she made her mark as a deeply caring and hard-working public servant who believed in commonsense, conservative ideals. 
   She was a person of honesty, integrity, and strong moral conviction in representing her district and living her life. She was a dedicated and tenacious fighter for her beliefs, and the importance of her faith was obvious in the way she cared for and treated others. And, above all else, she worked tirelessly to protect the interests of the men and women in uniform, their families, and veterans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe that this designation will serve as a constant reminder to the constituents of the First District of Jo Ann's service and leadership. I wholeheartedly urge my colleagues to join us in recognizing Jo Ann's memory by supporting this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H. CON. RES. 63, IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, last night I testified before the Rules Committee asking that the Iraq Study Group report be made in order for debate today. The Iraq Study Group offers the way forward, a new approach, and is authored by former Secretary of State Baker and former chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton. Yet there has been no vote allowed. The American people have been shut out with regard to having a vote on the Iraq Study Group report. You cannot pick and choose with regard to the Iraq Study Group. 
   Let me read you some of the comments that have been made by the members who served on the Iraq Study Group. Lee Hamilton, Jim Baker: ``There is no magic formula to solve the problems of Iraq. However, there are actions that can be taken to improve the situation. 
   ``Our political leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and sustainable.'' 
   That is the Iraq Study Group. Members on both sides have said they support the Iraq Study Group, and yet there is no vote allowed on the Iraq Study Group. 
   ``In this consensus report,'' Hamilton and Baker go on to say, ``the 10 members of the Iraq Study Group,'' bipartisan, five and five, ``present a new approach because we believe there is a better way forward.'' 
   The better way forward, and the gentleman who just spoke mentioned the Iraq Study Group, is the Iraq Study Group, and yet the Rules Committee last night foreclosed a vote on the Iraq Study Group which is bipartisan. 
   Lee Hamilton, Jim Baker, Leon Panetta, Bill Perry, Ed Meese. Ed Meese's son is one of the colonels with General Petraeus. Leon Panetta, who served here in the Congress, but yet for some reason the American people are not to be given an opportunity whereby their Congress can vote on the Iraq Study Group. 
   There are good people on both sides. Every resolution should be in order. God bless you, what you are offering is fine, but give the country, give the American people, give us an opportunity to vote on the Iraq Study Group. You cannot pick and choose. 
   I urge a defeat of the resolution and urge that we allow this to be voted on whereby we can have a successful policy to bring this country together.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise against this rule and against the underlying resolution.  
   I've been to Iraq three times since the United States sent Armed Forces there. I continue to be deeply concerned about the violence that continues to take the lives of U.S. personnel as well as innocent Iraqi citizens. 
   That's why, upon my return from my third trip in 2005, I worked to promote an independent, bipartisan review of ongoing operations in Iraq--what I called ``fresh eyes on the target. `` 
   I initiated the legislation authorizing and funding the Iraq Study Group, which was set up through the U.S. Institute of Peace. The 10-member group--5 Republicans and 5 Democrats--was led by cochairs James A. Baker III, the Nation's 61st Secretary of State and honorary chairman of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, and Lee H. Hamilton, our former colleague in this House and director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, who also cochaired the 9/11 Commission. 
   The other members of the study group included: Lawrence S. Eagleburger, former Secretary of State; Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., former advisor to President Clinton; Edwin Meese III, former Attorney General; Sandra Day O'Connor, retired Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; Leon E. Panetta, former White House chief of staff for President Clinton; William J. Perry, former secretary of Defense; Charles S. Robb, former Governor and Senator of Virginia, and Alan K. Simpson, former Senator from Wyoming. 
   After more than 8 months of work, the panel presented its report last December 6. The Iraq Study Group was a truly bipartisan group who came together--like this body should be coming together--and offered the way forward in Iraq. 
   I believe the group's work provides an important framework to move forward in Iraq and on January 24 I introduced H. Con. Res. 45, expressing the sense of Congress that all the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group become the new baseline strategy for dealing with Iraq. That's the resolution we should be advancing today. 
   In my car coming to the Capitol this morning I heard a member of this body on a radio interview say he's voting for H. Con. Res. 63 because what we're looking for is a new solution for Iraq. We have that. It's the Iraq Study Group report. Look at the cover of the report--``The way forward--A new approach.'' 
   The Iraq situation has created a bitter divide in our country. We all want to see an end to the fighting in Iraq and stability there, as well as an end to violence perpetrated by terrorists around the world. I continue to pray for the protection of the American service men and women and civilians who are putting their lives on the line every day and also for their families here at home who continue to make tremendous sacrifices. 
   The Iraq Study Group met the test of developing a bipartisan consensus on how to succeed in Iraq. When our country is divided we are weak. When we are together we are strong. 
   I want to read from the letter penned by Secretary Baker and Congressman Hamilton as the prelude to the Iraq Study Group's recommendations:  
   There is no magic formula to solve the problems of Iraq. However, there are actions that can be taken to improve the situation and protect American interests. 
   Many Americans are dissatisfied, not just with the situation in Iraq but with the state of our political debate regarding Iraq. Our political leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and sustainable. The President and Congress must work together. Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the American people in order to win their support. 
   No one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare, growing violence, or a slide toward chaos. If current trends continue, the potential consequences are severe. Because of the role and responsibility of the United States in Iraq, and the commitments our government has made, the United States has special obligations. Our country must address as best it can Iraq's many problems. The United States has long-term relationships and interests at stake in the Middle East, and needs to stay engaged. 
   In this consensus report, the ten members of the Iraq Study Group present a new approach because we believe there is a better way forward. All options have not been exhausted. We believe it is still possible to pursue different policies that can give Iraq an opportunity for a better future, combat terrorism, stabilize a critical region of the world, and protect America's credibility, interests, and values. Our report makes it clear that the Iraqi government and the Iraqi people also must act to achieve a stable and hopeful future. 
   What we recommend in this report demands a tremendous amount of political will and cooperation by the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government. It demands skillful implementation. It demands unity of effort by government agencies. And its success depends on the unity of the American people in a time of political polarization. Americans can and must enjoy the right of robust debate within a democracy. Yet U.S. foreign policy is doomed to failure--as is any course of action in Iraq--if it is not supported by a broad, sustained consensus. The aim of our report is to move our country toward such a consensus.  
   This last sentence is the essence of what we should be addressing this week. The recommendations of the Iraq Study Group provide the blueprint for a consensus. The work has been done. The recommendations have been made. Now is the time for implementation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, we are a coequal branch of government. We do not work for the President or the administration; our job is to thoughtfully consider the issues before us, and to work with the President and with the administration. When we agree, it is our responsibility to work together for the best interests of our country; and where we cannot agree, however, we have an equal responsibility to make the case of why we disagree, and offer responsible and thoughtful alternatives. This resolution does not meet that test. 
   Some may say that is what we are doing in the House this week, disagreeing with the President and offering alternatives to the plan. This resolution fails. There is no plan offered. 
   Certainly the resolution before us includes a statement on which we all unequivocally agree: support for our brave men and women in the Armed Forces who are serving or who have served in Iraq.     
   Yet it also includes a statement of disapproval on the plan for Iraq offered by the President, a statement of disagreement to which, again, no alternative is offered. If we disagree with the President's plan, we should be offered reasoned, responsible alternatives. Instead of speaking today as Democrats or Republicans, we should come together, speaking as Americans who are seeking to answer the questions of how to move forward with success in Iraq. 
   Under the process today, we have only one option from the other side of the aisle. Is that what the American people expect from this House? No. The American people expect more. What is so amazing to me and in this Congress, you voted, this Congress voted and passed legislation last year that set our country on a course to find our way forward in Iraq. We have to look no farther than the report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to find a way forward, a new approach for Iraq, an approach that can bring us victory. 
   That is what we should be considering today. The recommendations of this distinguished group can bring us to a consensus and unite the Congress and the Nation on Iraq. I have been to Iraq three times, and since there, I continue to be deeply concerned. 
   So when I came back from my third trip, I offered this idea of an independent bipartisan commission we called fresh eyes on the target, and many Members on your side have been hailing it, yet you would not permit this to come up for a vote. Why would the Rules Committee shut down something that many of you ask for over and over? And there are Members on my side who don't like it, but it is the only balanced plan. 
   This legislation was set up, the 10 Members, bipartisan, five Republicans, five Democrats, Jim Baker, former Secretary of State; Lee Hamilton, who served here and has probably, quite frankly, forgotten more about this issue than any Members on your side or any Members on my side. A 10-0 decision, Leon Panetta, Ed Meese, whose son will serve with General Petraeus, they came up with this idea. 
   Yet the Rules Committee has shut this down not to permit a vote. They worked for more than 8 months supported by expert working groups, and senior military advisors in the areas of the economy, reconstruction, military, security and political development. The study's report was issued on December 6 and was hailed, but yet it is not permitted to come up for a vote. 
   Because of the importance of this group, I introduced a sense of Congress resolution in support of the recommendations. I asked the Rules Committee late last night to make my resolution in order to be considered during the debate. By doing so, I believe the House will be working to meet our responsibility as political leaders to seek a bipartisan consensus on the issue of war and peace. 
   But the request, not on my behalf, but on behalf of the American people, was turned down by the Rules Committee. Believe me, just for a second, maybe our side at times treated you wrong; but, believe me, you are getting to be a fast learner, because every time you seem to speak over here, the Republican side of the aisle is shut down from offering anything. This is the major issue of war and peace. Can you imagine if this were 1937 or 1938 or 1939 in the House of Parliament, and it was a resolution like this with Nazi Germany pouring over Europe, there would be some resolution, and everyone else, Churchill would have been shut out because he wanted to offer something constructive to make a difference. 
   Let me read from a letter penned by Jim Baker and Congressman Hamilton. There is no magic formula, they said, to solve the problem of Iraq. They basically say there are actions to take. The political leaders need to establish a bipartisan approach. They go on to make the report, the consensus report as to work that they have done. We recommend their report, and then they end by saying, ``Yet, U.S. foreign policy is doomed to failure--as is any course of action in Iraq--if not supported by a broad, sustained consensus.'' Then they go on to say how dangerous this is. 
   I ask you, why? Why couldn't we get a vote? Why couldn't the American people get a vote on something that many on your side may not like, but most do, and some on my side may not like, but most do, and I ask, this body ought to be voting on the Iraq Study Group to show the American people that we can be successful

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (NATION'S LOOMING FINANCIAL CRISIS NEEDS A BIPARTISAN SOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - March 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, as a nation, we are moving closer and closer to the edge of the financial cliff. A few steps forward and we will start the free fall into a canyon of debt which is bad for our country. 
   The baby boomers start retiring at the end of this year, and that will bring unprecedented levels of entitlement and other program spending. If left unchanged, in just a few decades there will be little money left for transportation, education, health care, medical research, cancer research, veterans, the environment, and all the other important programs. We cannot continue to keep borrowing and mortgaging our future to countries like China that carry our debt. 
   Young people should be clamoring for Congress to act; they have the most to lose from our inaction. It is their future that is being mortgaged, and every day we don't act we increase the debt burden they must repay in the future. 
   I have a bill which offers an opportunity to change the current course. Senator Voinovich and I first introduced the SAFE Commission last summer, and we reintroduced it in January. 
   Our country is in trouble, and we cannot afford to wait much longer. The bipartisan SAFE Commission will put everything on the table, entitlements and other Federal spending and tax policies, as it comes up with recommendations. It will hold town hall meetings across the country to explain the financial crisis we face and discuss the issue with the American people. I believe the American people, given the hard facts from a bipartisan panel, will understand that solving this problem will take some sacrifice from everyone. 
   The commission's recommendations would then come to Congress and we would take an up or down vote on the proposals in their entirety, similar to the BRAC process. Mandating congressional action on the panel's recommendations is what makes this unique. 
   There is also an opportunity for Congress to put forward an alternative proposal to reach the same goals at the same time the SAFE Commission recommendations are voted on. Holding out some hope that Congress would act on its own, the legislation also has a provision that if Congress were to pass a measure making substantive changes in entitlement spending and taking other action to get our financial house in order, the commission would cease to exist. But if Congress doesn't act no later than 17 months from the organization of the commission, it would be required to vote up or down on the SAFE Commission. 
   I have written a number of Dear Colleagues and personally talked with a number of my House colleagues about joining this effort. While 20 Republicans have signed on, including minority leader John Boehner, this effort has fallen on deaf ears on the other side of the aisle. I have personally sent a letter to each Blue Dog Coalition member appealing to them to step forward and join me in focusing national attention on this critical crisis. I have a history of working in a bipartisan way in this panel, and yet I hear absolutely no support or interest from the other side of the aisle. 
   I have also written to media and public opinions and leaders about this issue over the year. I certainly understand how the issue is competing with other national priorities, including the war in Iraq, but I fear that if we can't get Congress to move this year, there will not be another opportunity for a couple of years, with the 2008 presidential campaign heating up. This is a moral issue that this Congress is not addressing. 
   As a father of five children and a grandfather of 12, the fiscal challenges facing the Nation with the baby boomers retiring strike me as much more than a routine policy discussion. Without action, what kind of future are we leaving to our children and our grandchildren? In a word, ``bleak.'' We owe a debt to previous generations, to our parents and our grandparents for the sacrifices that they made for our country to make our country so great. Likewise, our generation, those who serve in this Congress and serve in the administration, must find the resolve so that generations to come will have the same type of financial future that our parents and grandparents gave to us. 
   I ask Members of Congress to look at this and join in a bipartisan way to deal with this issue in this Congress. And I also urge the administration, which has been silent on this issue, to stop, to break the silence. And for Rob Portman and the Secretary of Treasury and others to come up here and support this so we can make sure that we give our children and our grandchildren the same opportunities that our mothers and fathers gave to us.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CHINA AND THE 2008 OLYMPICS -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentlelady. 
   I want Members to see an editorial that was in the Wall Street Journal by Ronan Farrow and Mia Farrow entitled ``The Genocide Olympics.'' 
   It deals with the issue that there was a full page ad today in The Washington Post with regard to the genocide that is taking place in Sudan, and the one country that has the opportunity to really make a difference to stop the genocide in Sudan is the country of China. 
   Mia Farrow says in this editorial, ``One World, One Dream is China's slogan for the 2008 Olympics. But there is one nightmare that China shouldn't be allowed to sweep under the rug. That nightmare is Darfur, where more than 400,000 people have been killed and more than 2 1/2 million driven from flaming villages by the Chinese-backed government of Sudan.'' 
   I have seen those villages and the burning of the villages and we know that the genocide could be stopped by China. 
   Mia Farrow goes on to say, ``That so many corporate sponsors want the world to look away from that atrocity during the games is bad enough. But equally disappointing is the decision of artists like director Steven Spielberg, who quietly visited China this month as he prepares to help stage the Olympic ceremonies, to sanitize Beijing's image.'' Steven Spielberg, who produced Schindler's List, is now going to try to turn the 2008 Olympics in China to look like a wonderful, wonderful thing. 
   China is involved in Sudan where they have Antonov bombers bombing the people, helicopters coming in and killing the people, and the Janjaweed who come in and do all sorts of bad things--kill, rape and maim. And China has used its veto power, Mia Farrow says, on the U.N. Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the U.S. and the U.K. to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the slaughter. Beijing, she says, is uniquely positioned to put a stop to the slaughter, yet they have so far been unabashed in their refusal to do so. 
   Now, there are some people saying that maybe--maybe--the 2008 Olympics ought to be boycotted. Now, how will you feel, watching or going to the 2008 Olympics and knowing that the country that is doing that could stop the genocide in Darfur? 
   And so I would urge that if China does not deal with the issue, then the sponsors, but also the people from the West, certainly ought not encourage China to say that we don't care, therefore, we're going to go to your Olympics when Mia Farrow calls it ``the Genocide Olympics.'' 
   And then she says some other very tough things about Spielberg. Does he really want to be this? I mean, the Chinese are in essence doing what the Nazis did in the Olympics in the thirties, cleaning the streets and changing things. 
   China has the ability to stop the genocide that is taking place in Sudan, and I think everyone should do everything they can. This administration should do more and everyone in the Congress should do more, that if China doesn't use its leverage in the U.N. and allow the Security Council to pass a resolution allowing the end to come out with regard to U.N. peacekeepers in Darfur, then I believe that Mia Farrow and those who are concerned and are considering boycotting the Olympics will be right. This is a test for China. 
   Now, the Chinese Embassy is working this Hill aggressively. The Chinese Embassy will be working the administration. The Chinese Embassy will be working powerful governments around the world. But as long as the genocide continues in Darfur where 400,000 people have died, 2.1 million are living in refugee camps, knowing that China has the ability to stop what it mentions on  page A-18 in the Washington Post today in this editorial to stop this, then if China is not prepared to use their leverage to stop the genocide, then quite frankly I think Mia Farrow's title of calling this ``the Genocide Olympics'' will be true and no one should attend those Olympics. 
   The ``Genocide Olympics''  
   ``One World, One Dream'' is China's slogan for its 2008 Olympics. But there is one nightmare that China shouldn't be allowed to sweep under the rug. That nightmare is Darfur, where more than 400,000 people have been killed and more than two-and-a-half million driven from flaming villages by the Chinese-backed government of Sudan. 
   That so many corporate sponsors want the world to look away from that atrocity during the games is bad enough. But equally disappointing is the decision of artists like director Steven Spielberg--who quietly visited China this month as he prepares to help stage the Olympic ceremonies--to sanitize Beijing's image. Is Mr. Spielberg, who in 1994 founded the Shoah Foundation to record the testimony of survivors of the holocaust, aware that China is bankrolling Darfur's genocide? 
   China is pouring billions of dollars into Sudan. Beijing purchases an overwhelming majority of Sudan's annual oil exports and state-owned China National Petroleum Corp.--an official partner of the upcoming Olympic Games--owns the largest shares in each of Sudan's two major oil consortia. The Sudanese government uses as much as 80% of proceeds from those sales to fund its brutal Janjaweed proxy militia and purchase their instruments of destruction: bombers, assault helicopters, armored vehicles and small arms, most of them of Chinese manufacture. Airstrips constructed and operated by the Chinese have been used to launch bombing campaigns on villages. And China has used its veto power on the U.N. Security Council to repeatedly obstruct efforts by the U.S. and the U.K. to introduce peacekeepers to curtail the slaughter. 
   As one of the few players whose support is indispensable to Sudan, China has the power to, at the very least, insist that Khartoum accept a robust international peacekeeping force to protect defenseless civilians in Darfur. Beijing is uniquely positioned to put a stop to the slaughter, yet they have so far been unabashed in their refusal to do so. 
   But there is now one thing that China may hold more dear than their unfettered access to Sudanese oil: their successful staging of the 2008 Summer Olympics. that desire may provide a lone point of leverage with a country that has otherwise been impervious to all criticism. 
   Whether that opportunity goes unexploited lies in the hands of the high-profile supporters of these Olympic Games. Corporate sponsors like Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, General Electric and McDonalds, and key collaborators like Mr. Spielberg, should be put on notice. For there is another slogan afoot, one that is fast becoming viral amongst advocacy groups; rather than ``One World, One Dream,'' people are beginning to speak of the coming ``Genocide Olympics.'' 
   Does Mr. Spielberg really want to go down in history as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Beijing Games? Do the various television sponsors around the world want to share in that shame? Because they will. Unless, of course, all of them add their singularly well-positioned voices to the growing calls for Chinese action to end the slaughter in Darfur. 
   Imagine if such calls were to succeed in pushing the Chinese government to use its leverage over Sudan to protect civilians in Darfur. The 2008 Beijing Olympics really could become an occasion for pride and celebration, a truly international honoring of the authentic spirit of ``one world'' and ``one dream.''

I am proud to be a co-chair of the Congressional Public Service Caucus, proud to have been a federal employee, and proud to represent in Congress a large number of my constituents who are federal employees. These employees are a national asset who work hard day after day with professionalism and dedication. 
   Federal employees are the backbone of our government. They can be found working to find cures for diseases at the National Institutes of Health, helping seniors with their Social Security benefits, representing our interests overseas in the State Department, serving as stewards of America's natural resources in the National Park Service, helping our country defend the homeland at the Department of Defense and at the Department of Homeland Security. These are but a few examples of the many areas in which federal employees are serving our country. 
   We must not forget those federal employees who are risking their lives in the war against  terrorism. The first combat death in Afghanistan in the wake of September 11 was CIA officer Johnny Micheal Spann, one of my constituents. And today, Federal employees can be found throughout the globe fighting the war against terrorism in many different ways. 
   The sacrifice and hard work of our federal employees, whether abroad or at home, should never be forgotten. Federal employees deserve fair pay--which is why I have been pleased to support pay parity for federal employees since I have been in Congress. 
   They deserve adequate health care--which is why I have supported legislation to make sure federal employees get quality health benefits. 
   And retired Federal employees must not be forgotten--which is why I have supported legislation to aid Federal employees who have retired from active service. Federal employees deserve to be honored during Public Service Recognition Week. But we must always remember the they are serving our country every day of the year.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (THOMASINA E. JORDAN INDIAN TRIBES OF VIRGINIA FEDERAL RECOGNITION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I'm going to vote for this bill because I believe it represents a significant step forward in ensuring that the Commonwealth's interests are safeguarded when it comes to preventing casino-style gambling from coming to the state while providing full Federal recognition to these six Virginia Tribes. 
   However, I hope the Senate will take a very careful look at it before proceeding because I have already begun hearing rumors that attorneys are being consulted about ways to overturn the limitation on tribal gambling included in the legislation. 
   I believe the tribes when they say they aren't interested in pursuing gambling. Nevertheless, I would be extremely disappointed if there is any merit to the chatter I am hearing already--even before the bill gets out of the House--about their interest in a court challenge of the bill's gambling limitation. I certainly hope that's not true, and that what I am hearing is simply rumor. 
   I also must admit that I am troubled by the fact the tribes have been paying a lobbyist at least $80,000 for the past several years to advance this legislation. I certainly hope that this bill isn't the first step down the slippery slope we've been down before relating to lobbying and tribal gambling. 
   In moving forward with approval of this legislation, I believe it is important to underscore Congress' basis for this gambling limitation. Under the bill, no Virginia Indian tribe or tribal member, if granted Federal recognition by H.R. 1294, would have any greater rights to gamble or conduct gambling operations under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia than any other citizen of Virginia. Further, it is the expectation of Congress that the language restricting gambling operations by Indian tribes will be upheld if it is ever challenged in court, just as similar language was upheld in Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo v. the State of Texas, 69 Fed. App. 659. The Natural Resources Committee testimony demonstrates Congress' basis for including this limitation in the tribes' ability to engage in gambling. 
   In Narragansett Indian Tribe v. National Indian Gaming Commission, 332 U.S. App. D.C. 429, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit applied the Supreme Court's rational basis test from Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535 (1947), to determine that the denial of gambling opportunities under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to the Narragansett Tribe under the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act did not violate the equal protection standards of the Fifth Amendment. If the legislation before us today, H.R. 1294, is ever challenged in court, a court should similarly find a rational basis for this limitation. 
   Again, my concern is not with the Federal recognition of Virginia's Indian tribes. It has always been with the explosive spread of gambling and the potential for casino gambling to come to Virginia. No bill should become law unless it protects the interests of the Commonwealth. 
   If casino gambling were to come to Virginia, it would open the door to the myriad of financial and socials ills associated with gambling. Virginia's tourism sector, its economy and its communities are some of the strongest in the country. Places such as the Shenandoah Valley, Williamsburg and Jamestown are national treasures which draw visitors from all over the world. Small businesses thrive in Virginia. The Commonwealth's reputation would be tarnished if it allowed casino-style gambling within its borders. 
   As the author of legislation which created the National Gambling Impact Study Commission that released its 2-year study in 1999, I know firsthand about the devastating social and financial costs of gambling. Crime. Prostitution. Corruption. Suicide. Destroyed families. Child and spouse abuse. Bankruptcy. 
   This legislation, I believe, does shut the door on the opportunity for these tribes to acquire land and eventually establish tribal casinos. As I said, I know that the current tribal leadership has indicated that they do not want to pursue gambling--and I believe they are sincere. But what the leaders today say doesn't lock in the leaders of tomorrow. I have already started to worry that future leadership of the tribes will pursue establishing tribal casinos. I hope I am wrong.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (SUDAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND DIVESTMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I want to begin by thanking the chairman and the ranking member for bringing the bill up, and also to Congresswoman BARBARA LEE for the effort here. And hopefully this bill will be signed certainly before Christmas. 
   I think as we talk about the bill today, we should remember that genocide did take place, and in a certain respect continues to take place as we now stand here at this time. 
   Also, keep in mind, when talking about the Sudan Government, Osama bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996. And the same government that is there now invited Osama bin Laden to live there. And Carlos DeJackal and many other evil people have been in that country for a long period of time. 
   This bill, the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act, takes a very important step to pressure the Sudanese Government to halt the violent genocide, which continues in many respects. It authorizes State and local  governments to divest assets in companies that conduct business in Sudan. It also prohibits the U.S. Government from contracting with companies which conduct business in Sudan. And there are many companies that are doing business. There are many foreign companies, some American companies, a lot of Chinese companies. So this is not set up to do something for something that may happen. There are companies today that are doing business and prospering there. 
   Many have asked how to be involved in stopping the genocide. One answer is to pass this bill. Targeted disinvestment is a powerful tool. It is important to understand that targeted disinvestment is the removal of investment money from companies that are directly or indirectly helping the Sudanese Government perpetuate genocide. There are Chinese companies that are actually helping; some have sold weapons, some have sold Hind helicopters, some have sold other equipment that is helping with regard to this. 
   Since the ultimate intent of Sudan disinvestment is to protect the victims of genocide, it is important to tailor the disinvestment to have the maximum impact on the Government of Sudan's behavior and minimal harm to innocent Sudanese. Such targeted disinvestment excludes companies involved in agriculture, production and distribution of consumer goods or activities intended to relieve human suffering. 
   Many States, and they should be applauded, including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, New Jersey, and Oregon, have already moved to divest from companies doing business in Sudan. More States should act. 
   In closing, I want to again thank the Disinvestment Task Force. I would hope there would be a rollcall on this as a message so everyone knows. And again, I want to thank Congresswoman BARBARA LEE for her persistence and effort to bring this up and pass this. 
   Keep in mind, as you're voting today, and hopefully there will be, with the chairman, look up there. This will really send a message to the Sudan Government. And there is genocide taking place today as we now vote.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor who stood up to the Nazis, said, ``The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world that it leaves to its children.'' And this Congress is failing to serve the American people and failing to serve our children. 
   We have more than $53 trillion in unfunded liabilities and $9 trillion of debt. China, who violates human rights and religious freedom, holds our debt. The Saudis, who fund radical Wahhabism all over the world, hold our debt. 
   Standard and Poor's Investment Service predicts loss of AAA bond rating as early as the year 2012. 
   Is this bleak scenario what the 110th Congress wants to leave our children and grandchildren? If the ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children and grandchildren, this Congress is failing miserably. 
   Congressman Cooper and I have a bill, the SAFE Commission Act that has 105 cosponsors, that would put everything on the table, entitlements and tax policies, in order to rein in Federal spending. If we could come together, both sides of the aisle, we can ensure that our children and our grandchildren don't have to worry about the day when China and Saudi Arabia decide to call in our debt.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (VIRGINIA GRAEME BAKER POOL AND SPA SAFETY ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 1721, the Pool and Spa Safety Act. It has been my pleasure to work with Congresswoman WASSERMAN SCHULTZ during the last two sessions of Congress to bring this legislation to the floor. I applaud Representative WASSERMAN SCHULTZ for her dedication and fully support the congressional efforts to protect our children from swimming pool accidents. 
   Every summer we hear the tragic stories of young children involved in harrowing pool accidents. Though pool season is winding down for the year we must push forward and enact legislation to protect our children in the summers to come. 
   It's tragic that over the last 20 years, we have lost at least 33 children under the age of 14 as a result of pool and spa entrapment. Entrapment occurs when part of a child's body becomes attached to a drain as a result of the powerful suction of a pool or spa's water circulation system. Death or serious injury can occur when the force of the suction overpowers the child's ability to disengage from the drain. 
   According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, drowning is the leading cause of accidental injury-related death for children under 4 and the second leading cause of accidental injury-related death of children under 14. However, these figures are very likely understated because law enforcement do not always note ``entrapment'' when reporting a drowning. 
   In the hundreds of tragic drowning cases across the country each year, simple pool safety precautions could help save these precious lives. But it's important to remember that this legislation is not a federal mandate. Instead, it will encourage states to adopt comprehensive pool safety precautions that will substantially reduce the dangers of accidental drowning, body part entrapment, and hair entanglement. It will also promote swimming pool and spa safety. 
   We can prevent these tragedies and save our children. I urge the support for the Pool and Spa Safety Act, H.R. 1721.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE JO ANN DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with profound sadness that we come to the floor tonight to honor the memory of our colleague and friend, the Honorable Jo Ann Davis, who lost her 2-year battle with breast cancer this past Saturday. She was not only our House colleague; she was our Virginia colleague who represented the First District of Virginia, a district which she proudly called ``America's First District'' because of our country's roots at Jamestown and the many significant events in history which occurred there. 
   Jo Ann Davis also could have had a first next to her name because she was the first Republican woman elected to Congress from Virginia in 2000 to succeed our late colleague Herb Bateman. But that historic aspect of her career in Congress was not important to her. Representing her constituents and being the best Member of Congress she could be for the people of her district, that was what was most important to her. 
   Her career in elected office spanned 10 short years, from her first election in 1997 to the Virginia House of Delegates to her four elected terms in the House beginning in the year 2000. 
   But over that decade she made her mark as a deeply caring and very hardworking public servant who believed in common sense and conservative ideals. In remembering Jo Ann's work in Congress, there are several thoughts I would like to share. 
   She battled to the end with courage and grace in her fight against breast cancer. When she was first diagnosed in 2005 with the insidious disease, she announced it publicly to encourage other women to beware of the disease. Her bravery and personal strength were a source of inspiration to many. She was a person of honesty, integrity, and very strong moral conviction in representing her district and living her life. And she had a very strong commitment to the Lord. She was a dedicated and tenacious fighter for her beliefs, and the importance of her faith was obvious in the way she cared for and treated others and in the way she did her job. 
   She was a tireless and passionate advocate for the First District in Virginia, working to protect the military interests in her district and Navy shipbuilding in Newport News. She cofounded the Congressional Shipbuilding Caucus as she worked to provide for the defense of our Nation. 
   But as important as that work was for Jo Ann, protecting the interests of men and women in uniform, their families, and veterans was priority number one. 
   She also worked hard for other local interests, such as the removal of the ``ghost fleet'' of obsolete, environmentally hazardous ships from the James River; better regulation of the amount of trash coming into Virginia; and protecting the resources of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   This House and this Nation will miss Jo Ann Davis and her dedication to public service. I want to express my sincere condolences to her staff, both in Washington and in her district, who can be proud of their work by her side for the people of America's First District. Jo Ann Davis had an outstanding staff, and I want to thank the staff. 
   I also want to join with my colleagues in expressing profound sympathy to Jo Ann's husband, Chuck; and their two sons, Christopher and Charles; and a granddaughter. 
   In remembering Jo Ann Davis and her life of service to others, I am reminded of the words of Scripture where it says: ``Well done, good and faithful servant.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, when the House responded to the economic crisis facing our country and considered a financial rescue plan this past Monday, September 29, the vote failed 205-228. Because of my deep belief that Congress must take action to restore the confidence and stability in the Nation's financial system and keep credit flowing to the people of Virginia and to households across the country, I voted for that legislative package and enclose for the RECORD my statement that day explaining my vote. 
   I have never been more concerned about the financial future of our country. Following the results of the House vote, there was a record 1-day point drop in the stock market that wiped out $1.2 trillion in wealth that average folks have tied up in retirement accounts, pension funds, and college savings. While there was a short-lived rebound on Tuesday, the market has continued on a downward spiral. 
   The latest unemployment figures announced today showed that the economy shed 159,000 jobs in September, the steepest drop in 5 years and the ninth straight monthly decline. Also that day, world stocks fell to a new 3-year low. This news, combined with reports this week that U.S. auto sales fell in September by 27 percent from a year ago, points to a worrisome sign that credit is tightening and the economy is hurtling toward a deep recession. 
   If we don't deal with this financial crisis now, foreign governments like China and Saudi Arabia, who already hold a significant portion of our debt, are waiting in the wings to buy up even more of America. We cannot allow China--a country that persecutes its own people because of their faith--or Saudi Arabia--which breeds the kind of radical ideology that led to the terrorist attacks on our country--to own what generations of Americans have worked so hard to build for their children and grandchildren. 
   After the House's failed vote, the Senate worked to revise the bipartisan package. The new bill includes the base of the economic rescue plan voted on in the House plus additional taxpayer protection and tax relief provisions and was passed by the Senate 74-25 on Wednesday. Because I continue to believe that this Congress must act to restore confidence in our economy, I will vote today for this amended measure. 
   The revised bill has significant new safeguards for taxpayers and important tax relief provisions that will increase the amount of bank deposits insured by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 through 2009, to help stop a run on banks; protect 21 million working, middle-class families from getting hit with an average tax hike of $2,500 from the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT, for tax year 2008; extend critical energy tax credits and incentives to encourage conservation and the development of renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar power; extend tax deductions on State and local sales taxes and out-of-pocket expenses for teachers; expand the income threshold used to calculate the refundable portion of the child tax credit; extend a property tax deduction to homeowners who don't itemize, and provide tax relief for those in areas hit by recent natural disasters including hurricanes and floods.  
   As in the original legislation, the revised measure authorizes up to $700 billion for a troubled assets relief program for the Treasury secretary to buy mortgages and other assets that are clogging the balance sheets of financial institutions and making it difficult for working families, small businesses, and other companies to access credit. While the legislation gives the Treasury secretary an immediate $250 billion for the program, it requires the president to certify that additional funds are needed, $100 billion, then $350 billion subject to congressional disapproval. The assets acquired by the Treasury will eventually be sold. Many economists believe that if they are purchased at appropriate discounts, it is fair to say that the Treasury will recoup the taxpayers' investment or could even turn a profit over the long-run. 
   The measure also provides strong watchdog authority over the Treasury through an oversight board and a special inspector general to protect against waste, fraud and abuse. The bill also ensures that irresponsible corporate executives at institutions participating in the Treasury program will not be rewarded with multi-million dollar ``golden parachutes'' or severance pay. The FBI continues to pursue corporate fraud investigations related to lenders, brokers, and appraisers involved in the mortgage and sub-prime loan crisis. 
   I understand the concerns raised about the response to the financial crisis our country is facing. This package, including some provisions added by the Senate, is certainly not perfect. But I can't pick and choose from the parts. As I said in my statement after the House's initial vote, credit is the lifeline of our economy. Overall I believe this plan is vital to protect the long-term economic future of our country and to ensure that people in my congressional district as well as folks across America are able to keep their jobs, get a home loan or car loan or a student loan to send their kids to college, and protect their savings and the value in their retirement accounts. 
   I have always worked for the best interest of the taxpayers and residents of the 10th District which I represent. I am voting for this package because in good conscience I cannot stand by and watch the financial futures of the people across America tumble toward ruin not seen since the Great Depression. I believe this vote is the right thing to do at this time for our country. 
   The American people are understandably angry that our Nation's financial condition has reached this point and I understand the worry that has brought. I'm angry and worried, too, and share the concerns of the scores of people from the 10th District who contacted me in recent days. I understand when folks say they don't want to ``bail out'' Wall Street when they see the greed and irresponsibility we've witnessed from some in the financial system gambling with other people's money and losing. Experts say that the root of the current financial crisis can be traced to the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage industry and the impact of high-risk loans on the Nation's housing industry. 
   I agree and also share the concern about reports that some CEOs on Wall Street and top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--which are now in Federal conservatorship--have gotten sweetheart deals and bonuses in the millions of dollars. That kind of action must not be rewarded and that's why I applauded the news that the FBI as well as the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched investigations into potential criminal cases against firms accused of contributing to the market collapse. 
   But I'm more worried about the people of Virginia and across America if we don't respond to the collapse in the credit markets in our country. We face a financial crisis and threat to the U.S. economy the proportions of which many say we haven't seen since the economic collapse of the Great Depression. For the past few weeks, the news has been filled with reports of some of the most prominent financial institutions in our country in free fall. Just this Monday, Wachovia, one of the largest banks in Virginia and perhaps a bank you or your family or neighbors use, was sold, and more banks are expected to fail. 
   Access to credit is the lifeline of our economy. I'm worried that if we don't take the necessary action to shore up the Nation's credit system it will be the mom and dad in Herndon who won't be able to get a student loan to send their kids to college or buy a new house, or the young college graduate in Leesburg who won't be able to get a loan to buy a first car, or the older couple in Winchester nearing retirement whose nest egg in a 401(k) account is losing value, or the mom and pop store around the corner in Front Royal that can't get the loan to make payroll, or the family in Manassas who need to sell their house but watch as home values drop and the prospective buyer can't get a home loan. 
   I believe this crisis calls for extraordinary action. Some say without action millions of jobs could be lost. I believe the legislative package before Congress was mis-named as a ``bailout.'' It is important to understand that it was a depression prevention plan to help restore confidence in and stabilize our country's credit system and ultimately the American economy. No legislation is ever perfect and there will be people of good will who disagree. But in tough times, it is the responsibility of lawmakers to act and make tough choices. 
   I voted for this legislation today because I believe it was the right thing to do to begin the process of resolving this crisis and setting the country's financial institutions on sound footing. This legislation was a bipartisan compromise dramatically changed and improved from the original proposal and forged after tough negotiations between both political parties and the call that the measure must first and foremost protect taxpayers' investment and have transparency, accountability and oversight. 
   The package fulfilled those goals by: 
   Providing the Treasury secretary with authority to buy troubled assets currently held by financial institutions, but cut in half Secretary Paulson's original proposal of $700 billion in up-front, immediate authority. The plan would allow $250 billion in immediate authority, with another $100 billion available after the Secretary reports to Congress, and providing Congress with the authority to withhold the remaining $350 billion, assuring that economic assistance will be financed by Wall Street, not Main Street. Many economists predict that ultimately taxpayers will see all their investment fully recouped. 
   Providing transparency and oversight through establishment of a bipartisan oversight commission, split evenly between minority and majority; reporting requirements to ensure proper reports to Congress and the public; a special inspector general; a financial stability oversight board; strict conflict of interest and unjust enrichment rules, providing that if after 5 years the Government has a net loss of taxpayer funds as a consequence of the purchase program, the president will be required to submit a legislative proposal to recoup such funds from program beneficiaries. 
   Protecting taxpayers--not shareholders and not corporate executives--against loss by placing taxpayers first in line to recoup losses from participating financial institutions in the event they fail or lose money. 
   Prohibiting executive compensation or golden parachutes to ensure bad actors on Wall Street are not rewarded. 
   Requiring the establishment of an insurance guarantee program that in lieu of purchasing assets with taxpayer funds is available to insure assets at no cost to the taxpayer. Costs would be fully paid for by participating companies, i.e., those receiving the assistance. Assets insured by the program would count against the total funds the Treasury secretary would otherwise have available to make purchases. 
   In considering this package I had to answer this question: What is the consequence of doing nothing to help stop the hemorrhaging of the Nation's credit system, and even the broader consequence of a potential worldwide depression? I had to decide what is in the best interest of our country and the taxpayers and residents of this congressional district. 
   When faced with that decision, I cast my vote for the legislative package. I was disappointed that the bill failed passage by a vote of 205-228 and that a majority of my House colleagues both Democrat and Republican did not recognize the need to shore up our financial system and restore the flow of credit to help protect Main Street America. 
   Just minutes after the final vote, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped over 700 points and closed for the day down 778 points, the largest one-day point drop in history. The broadest measure of the American stock market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell 8.77 percent, its biggest drop since October 1987. The failure to approve the legislation resulted in uncertainty and turmoil in the markets, eroding billions of dollars in individual savings and household wealth. In a few hours, an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets lost their value--that is people's retirement accounts, pension funds, and college savings. 
   With the failure of the legislation, it is uncertain what the next step will be, but the crisis in the financial markets continues, and congressional leaders have pledged to go back to work and negotiate a bipartisan solution to restore confidence in the markets and come back to the House for another vote. No matter what final legislation is enacted to help stem the current crisis, I believe Congress has lots of work to do in the future to reform financial market regulation so that our country is not faced with this kind of crisis in the future. 
   The crisis in the credit markets, however, may be a symptom of a greater financial crisis on the horizon. We must come to grips with the national debt which is approaching $11 trillion. Then we must focus on the over $53 trillion in unfunded and unsustainable entitlement obligations we face as well as uncontrolled  Federal spending. The statistics are staggering and real. Standard and Poor's Investment Service has indicated that the United States could lose its triple-A bond rating as early as 2012 if we do not take action to reverse course. By not dealing with this issue we are enabling foreign governments like China and Saudi Arabia to buy America. That is bad for our country. 
   That's why I introduced the SAFE Commission Act, H.R. 3654, with Democrat Rep. JIM COOPER of Tennessee to set up a national bipartisan commission to put everything on the table and recommend to Congress a way to put our country on sound financial footing. The legislation requires an up-or-down vote by Congress. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call said in an editorial that the SAFE Commission should be part of the discussion of any response to the financial markets crisis. Other newspapers and organizations across the political spectrum have agreed that the SAFE plan can be the way forward. 
   P.S. I have based my service in Congress on the principles of honesty and integrity and doing what I believe is best for the people of this congressional district and the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I rise today to join my House colleagues in support of this resolution recognizing September 11 as a day of remembrance; extending sympathies to those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001, and their families; honoring the heroic actions of our Nation's first responders and armed forces, and reaffirming the commitment to defending the people of the United States against any and all future challenges. 
   We all will always remember where we were on that fateful morning of September 11, 2001, a beautiful, sunny and clear early autumn day in the Nation's capital when terrorists launched their attacks on America. It is etched forever in our memories. 
   We will never forget--those who died; those who survived and live with the scars; the firemen who ran up the stairs of the World Trade Center to save lives and gave theirs; the heroes on the plane in Pennsylvania; the families left behind whose lives will always have a void; the neighbors, the friends, the countless strangers who performed selfless acts of kindness we will never even know about. 
   On this solemn anniversary I always think back to the sermon the pastor of my church gave the Sunday after September 11 when he said: ``Life is fragile. Evil is real. God is sure.'' 
   Life is fragile. It can end in an instant. The families of those who died in the attacks on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and in a field in Pennsylvania never thought that would be their last day to see their loved ones. 
   A woman in New York said, ``We parted with a kiss on the Union Square Subway platform at around half past eight that morning. Jason was heading to his new job at Cantor Fitzgerald in the World Trade Center; I was heading to my office in SoHo. He must have made it to his desk moments before the plane struck the building.'' 
   Evil is real. We saw on September 11 that evil men did evil deeds to innocent people. Thirty people from Virginia's 10th congressional district died on 9/11. I went to the Pentagon that day and saw with my own eyes the destruction. I returned to the Pentagon this morning to join the dedication of the beautiful and moving memorial to hose who died there seven years ago. 
   I went to Ground Zero in New York City two months after 9/11 and saw the devastation. I saw the notes written on the wooden railing of the viewing platform from family members. One said, ``I love you Daddy'' in a childish scrawl. Another said, ``We miss you Dad. When you look down we hope we will always make you proud.'' 
   Evil is real, but God is sure. Psalm 46 says: 
   ``God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way, and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging. Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall; he lifts his voice, the earth melts. The Lord Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.'' 
   Our lives changed on September 11, and in many ways are still changing and will continue to change. Clearly, we are much more aware of the threat we now face. 
   We had heroes on 9/11--those who lost their lives and those who tried to save them--and we continue to have heroes today. They are the brave men and women who are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq showing the terrorists that we will take the fight to them. They are the thousands of civilian employees at numerous Federal agencies supporting those efforts. 
   Some of those heroes, like those on 9/11, have given their lives to protect our way of life. To them and to their families, we will be forever grateful. 
   I am reminded of a quote from President Ronald Reagan, who was such an optimist. He believed in America and for what she stands. He once said in describing America, ``We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we can always be free.'' 
   Indeed, we will always remember. And we will always be grateful that we live in the United States of America where, it has been said, unlike almost any other nation on earth, our identity is rooted not in blood, religion or birthplace, but in the idea of freedom. 
   Freedom has never been with a price. We owe our lives to each and everyone who has paid that ultimate price so that we can continue to live in freedom. And so today, we remember 9/11 and those souls who perished, and we also honor those who responded to the horrific events of that day, and resolve to continue the fight against terrorism and those who would seek to destroy freedom.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (FEDERAL FOOD DONATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2420, the Federal Food Donation Act of 2008. This bill would require a clause in federal food services contracts greater than $25,000 to encouraging donations to nonprofit organizations, such as food banks and food pantries. 
   I have been active in the fight against hunger for over two decades. Following my first visit to Ethiopia during its famine in 1984, I worked across the aisle to fight hunger both at home and abroad. I was pleased to work for the passage of the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act of 1996 that protected organizations donating food to charitable organizations from liability in order to spur greater donations. 
   However, I am concerned that rising food commodity prices and gasoline prices could hamper efforts by food banks and food pantries to meet the needs of the hungry. In meeting with charitable organizations in my congressional district, it is clear that the business  community and government agencies could be doing much more to support efforts to a growing number of families relying on food assistance from charitable organizations. 
   Anyone who has visited a grocery store in the last year understands the challenge our food banks are facing. U.S. grocery prices increased 5.1 percent overall during the last year, with a 17-percent increase in cost for dairy products, a 13-percent increase for rice and pasta, and a 12-percent increase in the cost of breads. This has a tremendous impact on the bottom line for American families. For example, if a family earns $45,000 a year, it now costs them an extra $1,000 to maintain the same food, gas, and basic goods purchases compared to 2006--a 9.6-percent increase. This makes more families dependent on food assistance, and even more affluent families less likely to donate to food banks and food pantries. 
   I am proud that the food banks and food pantries, grocery stores, and chambers of commerce in my district are coming together to raise awareness of this challenge and develop community-based solutions. Given the large federal agency presence in my district, I believe that this bill will help supplement their efforts. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this pragmatic and necessary legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (TELEWORK IMPROVEMENTS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4106, the Telework Improvements Act of 2008. 
   I would like to thank Congressman Danny Davis for introducing this important and necessary legislation. I also want to recognize Chairman Henry Waxman and Ranking Member Tom Davis on the Oversight and movement Reform Committee for reporting out a good bill for our consideration today. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been a long-time and staunch supporter of telework or telecommuting. Telework offers a 21st century workplace option that can reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, as well as cut gasoline consumption and dependency on foreign oil. Study after study has shown that telework benefits employees and employers. It gives employees the flexibility they need to meet daily demands. 
   Employers--both government and private businesses--get the benefit of increased productivity, improved morale, fewer sick leave days used, better worker retention, and reduced costs for office space. 
   My legislation enacted in 2001 mandated a phased-in program to expand the number of federal employees who telework with the goal of giving every eligible federal worker this workplace option by the end of 2005. While annual surveys by the Office of Personnel Management on telework by federal employees have shown some progress in meeting the law's mandate, there is much more that agencies can do to expand the number of federal telecommuters and this legislation is an important next step in making the Federal Government a model telework employer. 
   To emphasize the importance of telework in the federal workplace, when I chaired the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations subcommittee, I included provisions in the FY 2005, FY 2006 and FY 2007 spending bills for the departments of Commerce, Justice, and State and related agencies to withhold $5 million from the agencies which fail to meet the 2001 law. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor and strong proponent of the Telework Improvements Act that we are considering today. It will require the head of each executive agency to establish a policy under which employees may be authorized to telework and allow authorized employees to be allowed to telework at least 20 percent of the hours worked in every two administrative workweeks. 
   Given the soaring cost of gas, I can think of no better time for us to be passing this bill and encouraging further adoption of telework. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, including my district in northern Virginia, telework has the added benefit of taking cars off the road and reducing congestion and air pollution. It is also a good policy to have in place for continuity of operations in the event of an emergency. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation so that we can ensure that the federal workforce is making full use of teleworking.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (THE COOPER-WOLF SAFE COMMISSION ACT: BIPARTISANSHIP REQUIRED -- (House of Representatives - April 03, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, last week the annual Medicare trustees report concluded that consideration of reforms to ensure the financial security of Medicare must occur in the near future. The report states, ``The sooner the solutions are enacted, the more flexible and gradual they can be.'' As lawmakers, we are obligated, on economic and moral grounds, to tackle this enormous issue. 
   Newspaper headlines in the days following the release of the report say as follows, ``Should political stalemate end, entitlement solution possible''; ``Entitlement reform cannot wait on politics''; ``Budget experts left and right urge action on entitlements.'' 
   Every day that the Congress doesn't act, nor the administration, we miss an opportunity for our children and our grandchildren to get this country moving. Congressman Cooper and I have a bill called the SAFE Commission. It's a bipartisan bill. 
   I am also, Mr. Speaker, disappointed that Secretary Paulson has failed to address this issue. He said he feels like he is playing solitaire. Secretary Paulson, there are 74 cosponsors in the House, 40 Republicans, 34 Democrats that are waiting for you to do something. Secretary Paulson, if you leave this administration with failing to do that, you will regret it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CELEBRATING AMERICA'S HERITAGE ACT -- (House of Representatives - October 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen. I want to thank the chairman very much for his help and his support and your staff. I also want to honor Mr. Regula, who has probably made such an impact on these issues over the many, many, many years. 
   I rise in strong support of this. The journey through hallowed grounds is hallowed growth. It begins with Monticello where Jefferson came out and wrote those words ``that all men are created equal, endowed by their Creator.'' Ronald Reagan said those words were a covenant, a covenant with not only Americans but with the entire world. 
   Then we move up to Antietam, Antietam where President Lincoln took that win, that battle, that victory there of 20,000 deaths and then had the Emancipation Proclamation. That is hallowed ground because when you walk in 1 day, 20,000 people died. 
   And then we move up to Gettysburg, Gettysburg where President Lincoln, probably the greatest or second greatest President after President Washington, gave that famous speech that made sure the Union came together. 
   This is hallowed ground. It is areas that we have helped define ourselves and who we are and why we are who we are. 
   Also in this area is Monroe's house, Oak Hill; Montpelier, President Madison; also Zachary Taylor's home; Eisenhower's farm; Teddy Roosevelt's cabin; Kennedy's house; Marshall's house, who helped devise the Marshall Plan. This will help commemorate, preserve and promote. 
   Let me read you what David McCullough said. He said, ``This is the ground of our Founding Fathers. These are the landscapes that speak volumes, small towns, churches, fields, mountains, creeks and rivers with names such as Bull Run and Rappahannock. They are the real thing, and what shame we will bring upon ourselves if we destroy them.'' 
   For those who have objected, this is what the bill says: nothing in the subtitle alters any duly adopted land use regulation, approved land use plan or other regulatory authority of any Federal, State, tribal or local agency. 
   It goes on to say: nothing in this subtitle conveys any land use or other regulatory authority to any local or coordinating entity. 
   And the bottom line is, this bill cannot and does not affect the rights of any property owner. 
   In closing, let me say here's what Lincoln said. When Lincoln was in this area he said, ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it far above our poor power to add or detract.'' 
   This region, this area is sacred. It is hallow. I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, please pass this bill so we can preserve and protect and promote together, to educate our young people so when they hear the word ``Antietam'' they understood what took place; when they hear about ``Gettysburg'' they understood what took place; when they read the Declaration of Independence, they honor the men who said we give our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. 
   I urge an ``aye'' vote for this and again want to thank Mr. Rahall very, very much and his staff and Mr. Regula for his leadership, not only on this but on all of these park issues and all of these important preservation issues over the many, many years.

   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, last Tuesday the annual Social Security Medicare Trustees Report was issued, and not surprisingly, drawing the same dismal conclusions it did last year. We have all heard the statistics about the demographic challenge retirement of the Baby Boomers generation presents. But what are we doing about it? 
   I am disappointed that this Congress and this administration continue to turn a blind eye toward the country's unsustainable financial path. The American people cannot afford to have this issue languish in partisan gridlock. Americans should know the longer we wait to get our fiscal house in order, the harder and more abrupt the changes will be for America's younger generation. 
   I am challenging all of us to be part of the solution so we can tell our children and our grandchildren that while serving in Congress, we did everything in our power to protect their futures. Please cosponsor the Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission Act, which will put everything, entitlement spending, tax policy, and all other Federal programs on the table, and require action on controlling the long-term spending.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (TOM LANTOS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - September 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentlelady. 
   First off, I would like to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their support on the resolution, and also the staff. At the end I will include all of the staff members who have worked on this issue from my side from the very beginning. 
   I also want to thank my colleague, Jim McGovern, who has taken on the role of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus succeeding our good friend and colleague, the late Tom Lantos, for whom this resolution is named. 
   Mr. McGovern has hit the ground running, and I believe that Mr. Lantos would be very proud of the job he is doing. 
   I first became interested in human rights when in 1984 my good friend, former Congressman Tony Hall, asked me to go to Romania with him. It was a life-changing trip. I would urge all Members to sort of try to find these different events and places around the world where people are being oppressed and suffering. It is an eye opener for us.  
   Ronald Reagan once said that the Constitution is kind of a covenant. It is a covenant that we have made not only with ourselves, but with all of mankind. 
   By making the Congressional Human Rights Caucus into a commission, which will serve as an arm of the House of Representatives, I believe we are helping to take a step to fulfill that covenant. The creation of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will tell the world that the United States is still the shining city upon a hill, a beacon of hope in a world of turmoil and vision. 
   It was the vision that led Congressman Lantos and former Congressman John Porter, with the help of their wives, Annette Lantos and Kathryn Porter, to really establish the Human Rights Caucus in 1983. 
   There is much else that I can say. One, I am looking forward to working with Jim. This is to honor Mr. Lantos. It has seemed in the past that when major issues came up, the giants were Mr. Lantos and Mr. Hyde. And I may say, my colleague to the right, Mr. Smith and the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), and Mr. Berman and some others, but really not a lot of others. This is an opportunity for us to come together to really care about this issue and hopefully we can get some of the new Members who don't know they are going to be Members who are campaigning around the country somewhere who will come here in January next year so the baton is passed to new Members so there will be other people like Mr. Lantos and Mr. Hyde who will carry it well into the future. 
   I thank the leadership on that side for this. And I want to thank Jim and I thank Mr. Berman and Ms. Ros-Lehtinen.  
   Madam Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank Chairman Berman and Ranking Member Ros-Lehtinen for their support of this resolution and the staff on both sides. 
   I would also like to thank my colleague, Representative Jim McGovern, who has taken on the role of co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, succeeding our good friend and colleague the late Congressman Tom Lantos, for whom this resolution is named. 
   Representative McGovern has hit the ground running, and I believe that Mr. Lantos would be very proud of the job he is doing. 
   I first became interested in human rights when in 1984, Congressman Tony Hall, a Democrat and my best friend in Congress invited me to go on a trip with him to Romania. 
   At that time Romania was a very dark place. Under Nicolae Ceausescu, the securitate engaged in severe violations of human rights and religious freedom. 
   Many people I met slipped notes in my hand telling me that their family members had been taken away or killed by the government. 
   The trip to Romania, combined with a trip I took later that year to Ethiopia, which was in the midst of a famine, sparked my passion for human rights. 
   In Ethiopia, I held malnourished babies in my arms. It is a profound and humbling experience to see this kind of suffering first hand. 
   Ronald Reagan once said that the Constitution is ``a kind of covenant. It is a covenant that we've made not only with ourselves, but with all of mankind.'' 
   By making the Congressional Human Rights Caucus into a Commission which will serve as an arm of the House of Representatives, we are fulfilling this covenant. 
   This creation of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will tell the world that the United States is still the ``shining city upon the hill,'' a beacon of hope in a world of turmoil and tragedy. 
   No other Member of Congress can claim to have known turmoil and tragedy like our late colleague. 
   In the ashes of despair, Tom saw hope and opportunity. It was this vision that led Congressman Lantos and former Congressman John Porter with the support of their wives, Annette Lantos and Kathryn Porter, to form the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in 1983. 
   Since then, it has grown into one of the largest, most active, bipartisan caucuses in the Congress. 
   I was deeply honored to succeed Congressman Porter as the Republican co-chair of the caucus when he retired in 2001. 
   After the retirement of John Porter and then with the losses of Representative Tom Lantos and Representative Henry Hyde, we are without some of the greatest champions of international human rights and religious freedom 
   It is fitting that we ensure that their legacy is preserved and honored through the creation of this commission. 
   It is our duty as Representatives of the people of the United States of America, to speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves. 
   Our world will be a better and safer place for our children and grandchildren, when all people can live together and respect the most basic dignities and freedoms of all human beings. 
   Madam Speaker, over the years I have been supported in my work on human rights by a dedicated staff who has shared my passion for advocating on behalf of the oppressed and persecuted people in this world and worked to promote the mission of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus. I want to thank those staff members and recognize them today: 
   Molly Miller, Elizabeth Hoffman, Elyse Anderson, Samantha Stockman, Anne Huiskes, David Dettoni, Karen Feaver, Scott Flipse, Stuart Mallory, Brett Dody, Karin Finkler, Aldo de Pape, Fay Johnson, Hillary Hosford, Evan Baehr.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, there are legitimate and important emergency funding needs for the troops and our Federal civilian corps on the ground in Iraq and elsewhere. The President requested $93.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to continue the fight against terrorism, and that is what we should be doing. 
   Unfortunately, this bill offers, I think, a way of not doing that in an appropriate way. It is bloated with $124.3 billion in spending, $21 billion over what was requested. It is true we have provided funding for emergency supplementals before, but it would be hard pressed to convince the American people that $25 million for spinach producers, which may be important to do, but in the regular order; $74 million for peanut storage may be appropriate, but in regular order. It should not be done here. At the same time it does that, it restricts the civilian spending for the provincial reconstruction teams, which helps us do some of the civilian things that we should be doing in Iraq. 
   The larger issue, however, is this legislation before us has become a vehicle, unfortunately, for polarization on the fight to stabilize Iraq. I have been there three times. I believe tying the hands of our military commanders to adapt to the changing circumstances can only hurt our mission and our troops. 
   I don't believe it is a good policy to criticize the administration's strategy as failing, while at the same time cutting the very funding necessary for the administration and the troops to succeed, and then putting conditions on releasing the funding provided. They just don't all fit together. 
   We have to look no further than the report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to find ``the way forward, a new approach for Iraq.'' Just last months when we debated the Iraq war resolution, 106 Members from both sides of the aisle mentioned the importance of the Iraq Study Group and how they supported it. 
   Last night Mr. SHAYS asked the Rules Committee to make in order an amendment that I was cosponsoring to do exactly that, and it was turned down, and just at the very time the diplomatic engagement that most of us wanted to see take place begins to take place. The meeting 2 weeks ago had us engaging with the Syrians and the Iranians. We accepted Mr. Moran's amendment in the full committee, which was good, to really put the Congress on record in support of that diplomatic effort. But Mr. Shays was turned down again, as I was turned down several weeks ago. 
   The Iraq Study Group's Cochairmen Baker and Hamilton said in the group report, ``The U.S. foreign policy is doomed to failure, as is any course in action in Iraq, if not supported by a broad, sustained consensus.'' 
   This bill is not a broad, sustained consensus. The recommendation of the Iraq Study Group could have brought us, and still may very well bring us, to a consensus that unites the Congress and the nation on Iraq. That is the policy both the Congress and the administration should embrace. This bill does not do it, and I urge a ``no'' vote on it.  
   There are some legitimate and important emergency funding needs for our troops and our Federal civilian corps on the ground in Iraq and elsewhere. The President requested some $93.4 billion in emergency supplemental appropriations to continue the fight against terrorism. That's what this bill should be addressing. 
   Unfortunately, this bill fails to offer a reasonable way forward in supporting our troops, and I cannot vote for it. 
   This is a bloated $124.3 billion spending bill--over $21 billion than what was requested.  
   It's true we've provided funding for emergencies in other supplementals, for example hurricane relief and planning for a flu pandemic. But I think we would be hard pressed to convince the people we represent that $25 million for spinach producers or $74 million for peanut storage costs qualify as emergency spending needed today. The debate on that kind of spending should be part of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process where it belongs. 
   The larger issue, however, is that this legislation before us has become the vehicle for polarization on the fight to stabilize Iraq. It does not offer an alternative. Instead, it would ultimately mandate a retreat. 
   I have been to Iraq three times, and my concern for our troops has never been stronger. If I thought that this bill was in their best interests, I would support it. 
   Tying the hands of our military commanders to adapt to changing circumstances can only hurt our mission and our troops. 
   Within the State-Foreign Operations portion, it cuts funding necessary to support projects such as the Provincial Reconstruction Teams. PRTs are joint civilian-military teams living in the provinces among the Iraqi people. They work side-by-side with the Iraqis to identify development and governance programs and offer our best bet for improving stability and governance. 
   Cutting funding for these teams is cutting them off at their knees before they get a chance to stand up. These funds are essential for improving safety and stability--the very safety and stability which will enable our troops to withdraw more quickly. 
   I just don't believe it is good policy to criticize the administration's strategy as failing while at the same time cutting the very funding necessary for it to succeed and then putting conditions on releasing funds provided. 
   We have to look no further than the report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group to find ``the way forward--a new approach'' for Iraq. They worked for more than 8 months, supported by expert working groups and senior military advisers in the areas of economy and reconstruction, military and security, political development, and strategic environment. 
   The study group's report released last December 6 was hailed as an important opportunity to chart a new course for Iraq. That is what we should be considering today. 
   Just last month when we debated the Iraq war resolution, 106 Members from both sides of the aisle mentioned the importance of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations as the way forward in Iraq. 
   Last night, Mr. SHAYS asked the Rules Committee to make in order an amendment, offered in partnership with me, to support the findings of the Iraq Study Group. By doing so, we believed the House would be working to meet our responsibility as political leaders to build bipartisan consensus on the issues of war and peace. 
   But his request was turned down. That was the second time in a month that the Rules Committee has not allowed an amendment on the Iraq Study Group's report. Instead, we have before us a political statement that pulls us farther apart. 
   The ramifications of this polarization reach far beyond Washington; all the way to Baghdad and the Iraqi provinces. I want to read from the letter Secretary Baker and Congressman Hamilton wrote as the prelude to the Iraq Study Group's recommendations:   
   Many Americans are dissatisfied, not just with the situation in Iraq but with the state of our political debate regarding Iraq. Our political leaders must build a bipartisan approach to bring a responsible conclusion to what is now a lengthy and costly war. Our country deserves a debate that prizes substance over rhetoric, and a policy that is adequately funded and sustainable. The President and Congress must work together. Our leaders must be candid and forthright with the American people in order to win their support.   
   And it goes on to say:   
   ..... U.S. foreign policy is doomed to failure--as is any course of action in Iraq--if it is not supported by a broad, sustained consensus. The aim of our report is to move our country toward such a consensus.   
   The bill before us does not move the country toward a consensus. The country must come back together. We must be united. That is the only way we will be successful. 
   The recommendations of this distinguished group could have brought us to consensus and united the Congress and the Nation on Iraq. That is the policy both the Congress and the President should embrace. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I am deeply disappointed that the FY 2009 budget resolution we are considering today continues business as usual in the House. This resolution is another missed opportunity to come to grips with the financial crisis looming on the horizon for our Nation. We face enormous fiscal challenges and addressing them will take bipartisan commitment. The budget resolution--and all of the substitutes--fail to address the long-term spending crisis staring us right in the face. 
   Jim Cooper and I have been working together with almost 70 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle ii offering a solution--the Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission Act--to respond to what outgoing U.S. Comptroller David Walker characterizes as a ``tsunami of spending and debt levels that could swamp our ship of state.'' 
   At the Government Accountability Office, Mr. Walker has coordinated the country-wide ``Fiscal Wake Up Tour'' and has done a tremendous job of working to educate the American people on the grave condition of our country's fiscal health. I salute David Walker for the yeoman work he has done in bringing this issue to the front burner. He is leaving GAO this week, but he is not abandoning the cause in which he believes and into which he has poured his heart and soul over the past few years. He was quoted as saying, ``I love my job. I love GAO. But I love my country more.'' 
   Republicans and Democrats must take to heart David Walker's words--for the love of country--and come together to avert the financial tsunami coming closer and closer to our Nation's shores. It doesn't take an expert to understand that this nation is teetering on the edge of a financial crisis like no other time in our history. 
   We had the opportunity in this year's budget process to take the initial steps to get our financial house in order. But again this budget cycle, the House is choosing to look the other way and continue business as usual. 
   If we don't get our country's financial house in order and make the sacrifices necessary today, the future for our children and grandchildren will be bleak. Our economic growth will come to a grinding halt, our standard of living and even our national security will be at risk if we don't start actively working to change our current course. We cannot continue to keep borrowing and mortgaging our future to countries like China and Saudi Arabia that carry obscene amounts of our debt. 
   This issue is an economic and moral issue that hangs like an ominous cloud over everything we do as public servants, yet many ignore it. I understand we won't be able to fix our financial woes overnight, but we must come together across the aisle if there is ever to be any hope of ensuring that our Nation's future is strong. 
   That's why Representative Jim Cooper and I joined efforts and have been calling for a national bipartisan commission that will put everything--entitlement spending, other Federal program spending and tax policy--on the table and come up with recommendations to halt the mounting debt. 
   Nothing would be off limits for discussion by the commission members. 
   A critical component of the commission's work will be to engage the American people in a national dialogue about the scope of the country's financial conditions and solutions to the problem. After spending 6 months conducting townhall-style meetings around the country, the commission will present a report to Congress describing the long-term fiscal problems, public suggestions and views, and policy options available to get us back on the right track. 
   Modeled after the Federal base-closing process, Congress would be required to vote up or down on the plan in its entirety. Mandating congressional action is what makes the SAFE Commission unique. If other viable bipartisan solutions are presented, I think we should look at those, too. 
   The Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission legislation has been endorsed by groups across a wide political spectrum--groups who usually disagree more than they agree on policy issues--the Brookings Institution, the Heritage Foundation, the Concord Coalition, and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Business Roundtable and National Federation of Independent Business are also on board. National columnists David Brooks, David Broder, and Robert Samuelson all have written about the entitlement crisis facing our country and the SAFE Commission as a potential way forward. Senators Conrad and Gregg have introduced similar legislation in the Senate. 
   The financial tsunami is moving closer to our shores and the longer we wait to act, the harder it will be to stop the tidal wave of red ink. If our children and grandchildren were on the beach with an actual tsunami off the coast, we would do everything we could to help them. We must move beyond politics and come to grips with the fact that the financial future of our country is an American issue and it's on our watch to fix. 
   How can this Congress sit by knowing full well that our financial woes will haunt generations to come? 
   I could easily use all the time for general debate today providing the evidence to support the critical need to address the nation's financial future. This should be the number one budget priority for this Congress. Let me give an example. In January, Moody's Investors Service released its annual report which concluded that the United States triple-A bond rating is at risk. The United States could lose its triple-A bond rating as early as 2012. What does that mean? 
   That means that respected credit-rating agencies are projecting that the United States will be on par with Greece and Estonia by 2015, Poland and Mexico by 2020, and below investment grade--junk debt--by 2025. 
   Here's more evidence: the retirement of the baby boomers started this year and presents a demographic challenge that is unprecedented. In 2006, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security consumed 40 percent of the budget. That percentage is expected to jump to 51 percent in less than 10 years. It may be out of sight, out of mind for now, but it's simple math. As the number of Americans aged 65 and up rises, and the working population shrinks, more Americans will draw on promised benefits. The rubber will meet the road, and we will have done nothing to cushion the blow. 
   We cannot continue to avoid our responsibility to future generations of Americans by passing on a broken system in the form of unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations and unsustainable spending. 
   Simply put, the budget resolution set forth this year represents a missed opportunity. We need to follow the example of David Walker and for the love of our country, and for our children and grandchildren, do what it will take to protect our Nation's future. The SAFE Commission is the bipartisan way forward. Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert for the RECORD a letter I received from U.S. Comptroller General David Walker, a recent Financial Times article about our Nation's triple-A bond rating, and a Robert Samuelson op-ed from The Washington Post.   
   Escaping the Budget Impasse  
   Almost everyone knows that the next president will have to wrestle with the immense costs of retiring baby boomers. Comes now a small band of Democrats and Republicans who want to do the new president a giant favor. They want to force the new administration to face the problem in early 2009. Why is this a favor? Because dealing with this issue is so politically unsavory that resolving it quickly would be a godsend. Otherwise, it could haunt the White House for four years. 
   Let's review the problem (again). From 2000 to 2030, the 65-and-over population will roughly double, from 35 million to 72 million, or from about 12 percent of the population to nearly 20 percent. Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid--three big programs that serve the elderly--already represents more than 40 percent of the federal budget. In 2006, these three programs cost $1.1 trillion, more than twice defense spending. Left on automatic pilot, these programs are plausibly projected to grow to about 75 percent of the present budget by 2030. 
   Stalemate results because all the ways of dealing with these pressures are controversial. There are only four: (a) massive tax increases--on the order of 30 to 50 percent by 2030; (b) draconian cuts in other government programs (note that the projected increases in Social Security and Medicare, as a share of national income, are more than all of today's domestic discretionary programs); (c) cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--higher eligibility ages or lower benefits for wealthier retirees; or (d) undesirably large budget deficits. 
   The proposed escape seems at first so drearily familiar and demonstrably ineffective that it's hardly worth discussing: a bipartisan commission. But what would distinguish this commission from its many predecessors is that Congress would have to vote on its recommendations. The political theory is that, presented with a bipartisan package that cannot be amended, most politicians would do what they believe (privately) ought to be done rather than allow pressure groups, including retirees, to paralyze the process.  
   There is precedent for this approach. Since 1988, Congress has allowed more than 600 military bases and facilities to be closed or streamlined using a similar arrangement. An independent Base Realignment and Closure Commission evaluates the Pentagon's proposed closings and listens to objections. With the president's approval, it then submits its own list, which goes into effect unless vetoed by both houses of Congress. This process provides members of Congress bipartisan ``cover'' and prevents amendments from weakening the package. 
   Two prominent proposals would adapt this approach to the budget. The first, offered by Sens. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), the chairman and ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, would create a 16-member commission, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. All eight Democrats would be from Congress, as would six Republicans. The administration would have two members, including the secretary of the Treasury. 
   Conrad's notion is that the impasse is political and that only practicing politicians--people with ``skin in the game''--can craft a compromise that can be sold to their peers. The commission would report in December 2008. Twelve of its 16 members would have to support the plan, with congressional passage needing 60 percent approval (60 senators, 261 representatives). These requirements, Conrad and Gregg argue, would ensure bipartisan support. 
   The other proposal comes from Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Frank Wolf (R-VA.) It would also create a 16-member commission, with two major differences. First, only four of its members would be from Congress. Second, though Congress would have to vote on the commission's proposal, there would be some leeway for others--including the president--to present alternatives as long as they had the same long-term budget impact. Any proposal, however, would have to be voted on as a package without amendments. 
   A combination of these plans might work best. A 20-member group would be manageable and should include four outsiders to provide different perspectives and, possibly, to build public support. Perhaps the head of AARP should be included. And it would be a mistake to present the next president with a take-it-or-leave-it package. The Cooper-Wolf plan would allow a new administration to make changes--and get credit--without being able to start from scratch. 
   This commission approach has potential pitfalls: It might create a face-saving package that does little. But everything else has failed. The main political beneficiary would be the next president. It would be revealing if some of the hopefuls--Democrats and Republicans--would show that they grasp this by providing their endorsements. Otherwise, the odds that Congress will even create the commission are slim.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (BIPARTISAN EARMARK REFORM -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, the need for earmark reform should be an issue that we can all agree upon, a bipartisan agreement. As reported last week, Congress' approval rating fell to just 22 percent. Will the House sit idly by patting each other on the back as this issue continues to grow and be one that the American people care deeply about? 
   Quite frankly, the effort in the House to bring a level of transparency in the earmark process, as good as it may appear, has yet to satisfy the American  people. As a first step to restoring confidence in the earmark system, Congressman Jack Kingston, a member of the Appropriations Committee, Zack Wamp, a member of the committee, and myself have introduced H. Con. Res. 263, which calls for a joint select committee to review the earmark process, and it places a moratorium on all earmarks while the panel undertakes its work. 
   Congress holds the power of the purse, and, quite frankly, I don't believe the American people really want us to cede that authority to the executive branch. Under the Constitution, that is the job of the congressional branch. And while I believe that the majority of earmarks are for purposes which help people, those Members who oppose earmarks have made some legitimate claims, and they have to be addressed. 
   There have been positive earmarks to fight gangs, to fight the violent MS 13 gangs. We created an office of gang intelligence in the FBI to track the gang movement across the country, and there is a growing problem with regard to gangs. 
   The Iraq Study Group was an earmark, and that helped bring about fresh eyes on the target, if you will, bringing former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former cochairman of the 9/11 Commission, Lee Hamilton, along with Ed Meese, former Attorney General of the Reagan administration whose son is on the staff with General Petraeus over in Iraq, and people like Chuck Robb who is a former marine and Governor and Senator who fought in Vietnam. So it brought together a group of people to take a look at that, and 61 of the 70-some recommendations of the Iraq Study Group have been adopted now, and that basically was an earmark. 
   I also was told that the work that Dr. Francis Collins has done, and I may be wrong on this, but Dr. Collins has received the gold medal. He is the one who has mapped the human genome system. And there are people alive today because of the work that Dr. Collins has done. Dr. Collins will map those genes whereby we know that some individual with a certain gene may get a certain condition and now they can deal with that to save their life. So there have been some very positive ones. 
   But I think it is important to acknowledge that the Members who have opposed earmarks have made some legitimate claims, and they deserve that we look at those claims and address those claims. 
   The joint select committee on earmark reform, which is called for in the bill, would be comprised of 16 members, Mr. Speaker, evenly split between the House and the Senate, because whatever we do, the House and the Senate have to be together, also, between Republicans and Democrats. And I think the American people are thirsty. They are thirsty for some bipartisan activity out of this Congress. So we will come together, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, to form this committee. 
   The panel would examine the way the earmarks are included in authorizing bills, which has not been done, appropriation bills. And to the credit of the committee, there has been some work done on the appropriations. Also, tax and tariff measures. Also, what has not been done very well, executive branch earmarks would also be studied. I want to stress that again, because I think the Congress has ignored some of this and I think the general public doesn't understand, but this panel would also, Mr. Speaker, look at executive branch earmarks, reviewing earmarks in all bills considered by Congress. All bills is really the key. 
   The House, during this period of time, should place a moratorium on all earmarks until the joint select committee has finished its work and we are able to put into place a rule system that restores the confidence of Americans that legislation is not loaded up with hidden special interests or wasteful spending. It would restore honesty, integrity, and openness to the process that everyone would feel very confident because the ground rules would have been agreed to by everyone. The American public would see how this was done. 
   I strongly support the earmark reform, including listing names of sponsors on earmarks or specific line item spending. But the rules, Mr. Speaker, must apply an equal standard to all legislation, appropriations, as well as authorizing and tax bills and disclosing earmark sponsors. It must be across the board in every bill, but it also must be a process of indisputable integrity and probity that is honest and authentic, and one in which the American people have absolute trust. That is the key. It has to be a process, Mr. Speaker, in which the American people have absolute trust. 
   Earmark reform must be bipartisan. It must be an issue on which both political parties can come together so that every Member of Congress can know what is in there, the American people can know it. And I am hopeful that Members on both sides of the aisle will join this effort and support the Kingston-Wamp-Wolf earmark reform bill. 
   Then, Mr. Speaker, we have the opportunity after we do that, because I know most Americans are concerned about the spending with regard to the Federal debt and the deficit. I have a bill with Congressman Cooper, again, a bipartisan bill, and again, it is good to see, we have to work across the aisle. It is called the Cooper-Wolf bill, Mr. Speaker, and what it does, it sets up a national commission of eight Republicans and eight Democrats, and I would tell Members that there are 70 Members plus on the bill, roughly 30 Democratic Members and 40 Republican Members. I must say, Congressman Hoyer gave a very powerful speech at the Press Club several months ago endorsing this concept. On the bill, we have Congressman Boehner, the minority leader. We have Congressman Blunt, the minority whip. We have people on both sides of the aisle of all political viewpoints from every part of the country. And what it does, Mr. Speaker, it puts everything on the table.     
   It puts Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and tax policy on the table. It has the support of the Heritage Foundation and Brookings. Alice Rivlin, head of the Office of Management and Budget in the Clinton administration, supports it. We have the support of some of the more thoughtful think-tanks, such as Brookings. A lot of different groups. We have had favorable editorials and comments from David Broder from The Washington Post, David Brooks from The New York Times, and Robert Samuelson, who writes a column for The Washington Post. Also we have had editorials in papers like the Tennesseean and the Richmond Times Dispatch and papers like that. 
   What it would basically do, it would have this national commission of eight Republicans and eight Democrats to go around the country having a conversation with the American people. They would listen to the American people. Then they would hold public hearings in every Federal Reserve district in the Nation. So they are required to go everywhere. 
   Interestingly enough, the Brookings Foundation and Heritage, along with David Walker of the Government Accountability Office, are now doing this in what they call ``wake-up tours,'' where they are going out around the Nation to tell the American people of the danger, the fiscal danger, the financial danger, that awaits this Nation if we do nothing about this spending and the debt and the deficit. 
   Congressman Cooper knows so much about this. I wish he was with me here today. But I respect his knowledge and understanding and his work on the Budget Committee. 
   But, Mr. Speaker, David Walker said, and I will insert it in the Congressional Record, I have sent it out to some Members of the House, David Walker said there was a tsunami, a financial tsunami off the coast waiting to come in and overcome and overtake this country. 
   As the father of five children, if our children were on the beach and someone said there was a tsunami off the coast of New Jersey or the North Carolina coast or the Maryland coast, we would as parents want to do everything we can to help our kids. So for our children and for our grandchildren, we have an obligation to deal with this problem. 
   Also, Mr. Speaker, I think it is also a moral issue. In the Ten Commandments it says: ``Thou shall not steal,''  and for one generation to be living off the next generation is in essence stealing. 
   With all the support that we have, the bipartisan support, again, a lot of good Members on both sides of the aisle, I am hopeful that there can be a way that we can bring this bill up and vote on it in this session. 
   So with the earmark bill that I spoke about earlier which deals with a fundamental problem that the Congress has to deal with, and with this bill, we can have a renaissance in this Nation, create jobs and make a tremendous difference. So I just hope that we can pass both of these bills in this Congress. 
   I see my friend from Tennessee, and I will yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Wamp).

In the 10th District of Virginia, which I represent, these designations protect the lands that George Washington surveyed, that inspired Thomas Jefferson, and that Chief Justice John Marshall farmed. 
   Millions of Federal, State, local and private funds have been used to preserve and protect the lands now threatened by the designation of a National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor which authorized the Federal Government to override state transmission siting authority. 
   We must give these lands this limited protection. I urge you to support this commonsense amendment to protect our private citizens and our national treasures.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I went to the Rules Committee yesterday for the fourth time since January asking that my amendment be made in order to allow the House to discuss and vote on the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group as the way forward in Iraq. 
   For the fourth time this year, the Rules Committee said no. I can only assume from that action that the Democrat leadership instead prefers to continue to lock down the House and deny the opportunity to take the bipartisan road on Iraq policy. 
   On the question of finding solutions in Iraq, this House cannot continue to just blindly follow the White House or the leadership of the Congress. 
   The Washington Post has editorialized that the debate on Iraq in recent weeks is all about political gamesmanship. Every member in this House knows that's true and that is what's been going on here. More importantly, I believe that the American people know what's going on. Just look at the polls on where Congress stands. 
   We owe it to the men and women in our armed forces who are putting their lives on the line every day in Iraq to at least take the time to discuss the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group.  
   We also owe it to their families. 
   We need to have a honest, true debate on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. 
   To not vote on the recommendations of such a distinguished group that took over eight months looking at this issue and talking to dozens of military officers, regional experts, academics, journalists and high-level government officials from America and abroad just doesn't make sense. Take a look at the Iraq Study Group report for the extensive lists of those who advised the ISG, including the military senior advisor panel--retired Navy Admiral James O. Ellis, Jr., retired Army General John M. Keane, retired Army General Edward C. Meyer, retired Air Force General Joseph W. Ralston, and retired Army Lt. General Roger C. Schultz, Sr. 
   As I have said time and time again, the Iraq Study Group is the way forward and what I believe is the best and most appropriate way to be successful in Iraq. 
   It was bipartisan and all of its 79 recommendations were unanimous. 
   Two of its members--Lee Hamilton, the co-chair, and Leon Panetta--served in this body. Two others--Alan Simpson and Chuck Robb--served in the Senate. 
   Co-chair Jim Baker and Lawrence Eagleburger served as secretary of State. 
   Bill Perry was President Clinton's secretary of Defense. 
   Bob Gates served on the panel for seven months--stepping down to become the current secretary of Defense. 
   H.R. 2574, the Iraq Study Group Recommendation Implementation Act of 2007, which was the basis of the amendment I asked to be made in order under the bill we are debating today, has 59 cosponsors--34 Republicans and 25 Democrats. 
   We all know the war has created a bitter divide in our country. The ISG allows us to come together. 
   I will say it again: the best way forward is for both the Congress and the president to embrace the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. 
    Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, it comes down to doing the right thing. The question is, when will the leadership in Congress show the courage that the American people expect and do the right thing--not for me or for the members of this House, but for the thousands of brave men and women serving in uniform, their families and the good of our country?

   Mr. WOLF. I want to thank Mr. Scott and Mr. Boucher for bringing this resolution up. 
   Words are inadequate at this time. And our community and our State and the Nation have been devastated by what has taken place. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today in support of this resolution offering the condolences of the House to the victims and their families of the horrific violence at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, on Monday morning, and to the students, the faculty, administration, staff and their families who have forever been changed by this tragedy. 
   My heart is heavy for the entire grieving Virginia Tech community and the families in the 10th District of Virginia who are mourning today because the young, promising lives of their children have ended. According to the morning news we have received, there are going to be at least five victims who call the 10th Congressional District, my district, home. 
   There really are no words that can adequately express, and as a father of 5 children and a grandfather of 12, words you can say, that can express the sorrow we are feeling for the families today. But with this resolution, it is my hope that the families in my district and the families and loved ones of all the victims will know that this district, this Commonwealth of Virginia and indeed the entire Nation are with them in spirit, offering them our heartfelt sympathy and prayers. 
   With my colleagues in the Virginia delegation, I attended the very moving and emotional convocation yesterday in Blacksburg. I was impressed with the Tech community, the students and staff, administration. President Bush did an outstanding job, as did Governor Kaine, in addressing the students and the administration. It was truly a feeling of family coming together to offer love and support to each other in their time of grief and loss. 
   There is still a numbness and incredulity about what happened on the Virginia Tech campus just 2 days ago. The wounds in Blacksburg are deep, but with the unity of spirit and the deep faith I felt yesterday on the Tech campus, it is my hope that as the tomorrows come, this outstanding institution and all those who are associated with it will find hope and peace. 
   May God bless all of us at this very, very difficult time.

   The Journey Through Hallowed Ground winds its way along U.S. Route 15 from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to Jefferson's home of Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia. Starting as a trail used by the Susquehannock and Iroquois, America's early history can literally be traced along this corridor. Jefferson's Monticello, Madison's Montpellier, Monroe's Oak Hill and Ashlawn Highland, Zachary Taylor's homes, Eisenhower's cottage, Teddy Roosevelt's cabin, John Marshall's home, General George Marshall's home, and Camp David are situated along this route, which is also dotted with numerous Civil War battlefields. 
   I close with Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, spoken at the northern terminus of the Journey Through Hallowed Ground corridor and signifies the history, and he said: 
   ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men and women, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it far above our poor power to add or detract.''

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I am going to withdraw the amendment, but I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to call to the attention the financial storm and the tsunami that is off the coast ready to hit our Nation. 
   Our Nation's Federal fiscal policy remains unsustainable, and in last Thursday's Washington Post, Comptroller General David Walker referred to what called to a ``tsunami of spending'' that will result in ``very rough seas, like we've never seen before in this country.'' 
   If Congress is not proactive in addressing the mounting entitlement costs and fiscal outlook 30 years from now, we won't be here deciding how to spend discretionary funds in an appropriations bill, there won't be any money left for anything. In 2006, Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, consumed 40 percent of the budget. That percentage will jump to 51 percent in 10 years, and there will be a devastating impact on the country. 
   In less than 20 years, there will be no money for student loans, transportation funding, national parks or cancer research or autism research, just to name a few. 
   More than $2.6 billion a day is needed to fund the savings shortfall, which has left us with nearly 40 percent of our GDP in foreign hands. The Saudis hold  a lot of our debt, the Saudis hold a lot of our debt. The Chinese hold a lot of our debt. 
   On Tuesday, the Budget Committee held a hearing on foreign holdings of U.S. debt, and the vulnerability of our economy. The CBO director testified that increases in foreign holdings accounted for about 86 percent of total Federal borrowing last year. 
   We should care about that. We should care that the Saudis hold this debt, the Chinese that hold this debt. China is the largest single source of financing for the current U.S. account deficit. While the U.S. falls deeper and deeper into debt, other countries are saving. Although China usually gets most of the attention, it's also Saudi Arabia. Fifteen of the hijackers for 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia, Iran and Kuwait. 
   This amendment incorporate to expedite a national commission, eight members from each side to come together. This place is a partisan, political pit. There is no opportunity in this Congress to resolve these issues. 
   We can't even decide when we are going to adjourn around here sometimes. So what we take is eight Republicans, eight Democrats come together, put everything on the table. Everything has to be on the table, including tax policy. 
   This Commission would make recommendations and would hold public hearings around the country where the American people could have input. They will come back. 
   What makes this different than most others is that this would be like the base closing commission. It would require a vote to be taken by the Congress. 
   But 10 years from now, 20 years from now, when many of our people are going to be sitting on the rocking chair, having served in this Congress, and editorials and the newspaper headlines say ``Nation in crisis,'' we are going to ask, what did we do? 
   I have written a number of Dear Colleague letters. We are up to 31 cosponsors, Members cosponsored this. We need eight Members from each side, everything on the table, recommendations would come back, require the Congress to vote. But for our children and for our grandchildren, I would ask that we do this. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would ask to include a Washington Post article by David Broder and also some other material in support of the idea.  
   Deficit Day of Reckoning  
   Next Monday is the real day of reckoning for President Bush and this new Democratic Congress. That is the day the president sends his budget for next year up to Capitol Hill, and you really will be able to judge by the reaction what will happen in Washington in the next 9 months. 
   Last year, when the budget came out, Democrats hooted in skepticism and many conservative Republicans expressed dismay at the size of the projected deficits. In the end, the House and Senate could not agree on a budget resolution, and the government went on autopilot in terms of domestic spending, continuing at the same level as the year before. 
   This year, as I learned from conversations with two senior White House officials last week, the president hopes his budget will become a starting point for serious negotiation--not a partisan football or simple laughingstock. 
   That hope was encouraged by a letter to the president last week from the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Harry M. Reid, and the chairmen of the two budget committees, Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. and Sen. Kent Conrad. 
   The first sentence said, ``We are writing to express our strong interest in working cooperatively with you to address our Nation's fiscal challenges.'' It acknowledged that as the process unfolds, ``Democrats and Republicans will disagree about particular priorities, and we will need to negotiate our differences in deciding how to allocate scarce resources.'' 
   But it put forward four principles that could lead to a successful budget outcome this year. 
   ``The budget should account realistically for projected federal costs,'' including the billions needed for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the adjustments needed in the alternative minimum tax, which otherwise would punish millions of middle-class families. 
   ``The budget should realistically project short- and long-term deficits,'' as objectively as the calculations of the Congressional Budget Office, which show the prospect of very large deficits if current tax and spending policies are unchanged. 
   ``The budget should provide detail throughout the entire budget period,'' making clear the hard choices that lie ahead. 
   ``The budget should be based on fiscal discipline that is sustained over the long term,'' underlining the fact that it will take years of effort to repair the damage done to our fiscal condition in the past 6 years. 
   The House took an important first step in repairing our fiscal health last month by reimposing the ``pay-go'' rule, requiring any increase in entitlements or tax relief to be balanced with tax increases or spending cuts. 
   While not endorsing these specific principles, the White House officials with whom I met certainly pledged to make visible the costs of the war and to be specific about the trade-offs needed to maintain budget discipline, both in the short term and the long term. 
   They said that the economic assumptions underlying the president's budget are modest--if anything, an underestimate of the revenue likely to be produced by a growing economy. And the officials indicated that the president will recommend that, for a second year in a row, overall growth in discretionary domestic spending--the part separate from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security--be held close to zero. 
   If Monday's budget fulfills those promises, the stage could be set for a serious effort to put the federal fiscal house in order. 
   But the warning voiced in an interview by Rep. David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, must be borne in mind. Obey recalled that when the late Rep. Richard Bolling of Missouri invented the congressional budget process, he said, ``It will work only if all the key players--in Congress and the administration--use honest figures and make a genuine effort to live within its discipline. Otherwise, the budget process will become a barrier to action.'' 
   If the congressional budget process breaks down, two Republicans, Rep. Frank R. Wolf of Virginia and Sen. George V. Voinovich of Ohio, have proposed a commission of legislators and experts to tackle the long-term budget challenges and bring back a plan that Congress would have to vote up or down, or substitute an equally effective blueprint 
   One way or the other, this problem must be faced. Monday's budget message could be the first step.   
   National Debt 
   ISSUE: Comptroller warns of fiscal disaster. 
   The alarm clock is ringing. Time to wake up! 
   The ``alarm clock'' is David Walker, comptroller general of the United States and head of the Government Accountability Office. He's on a nationwide ``Fiscal Wake-Up Tour,'' which he plans to continue through the 2008 elections. 
   His purpose is to warn Americans of the fiscal train wreck the Nation faces if it doesn't get its fiscal house in order. He's urging people to let the Federal government know they want something done about the problem. 
   That's crucial, because elected officials like to buy voter support with low taxes and big spending programs. That will never change unless the public lets its leaders know they can raise taxes and cut spending without being punished at the polls. 
   There's little choice. Things will grow exponentially worse as the Baby Boom generation begins collecting on entitlement programs. In the next few decades, the national debt, now at a record $8.8 trillion, could rise to more than $46 trillion. 
   Interest payments on a debt of that size would consume every cent the Federal government currently collects in taxes. It's conceivable that little or nothing would be left for national defense, roads and other infrastructure, entitlement programs, environmental initiatives, etc. The Nation can't operate that way. 
   Fortunately, Walker has help. He's accompanied on his tour by bipartisan representatives of leading think tanks, and recently U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., filed legislation to create a bipartisan commission to tackle the problem. Everything would be on the table, from taxes to entitlement spending. The bill would require Congress to vote on the commission's recommendations in their entirety. 
   If you want your country to remain strong and prosperous, let your members of Congress know you support this legislation. Self-indulgence got us into this mess. Only self-discipline can get us out.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (FINANCIAL CRISIS FACING OUR NATION WILL REQUIRE BIPARTISAN EFFORT -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in the administration and especially Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson for not embracing solutions to the economic tsunami that is off our coast. Congressman Cooper and I have proposed the SAFE Commission to respond to what the outgoing U.S. Comptroller, David Walker, characterizes as a ``tsunami of spending and debt levels that could swamp our ship of state.'' 
   We have $53 trillion in unfunded liabilities and are over $9 trillion in debt. What more does Secretary Paulson need? 
   The SAFE Commission Act has 74 bipartisan cosponsors. It has been endorsed by the Business Roundtable, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and think tanks across the political spectrum. If we don't get our financial house in order and begin controlling entitlement spending, it will be our children and grandchildren who pay the price. 
   How will Secretary Paulson feel if he leaves at the end of this term and has done nothing, has done nothing to deal with the entitlement issue? 
   Secretary Paulson, we ask you to support the Cooper-Wolf bipartisan commission.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Lewis for yielding. 
   I rise in opposition to the resolution. And let me just stipulate it probably has a lot of very good things in it. But when I was chairman of two different subcommittees, we always had complete consultation, and if what I am saying is not accurate, those Members should come down here and attack me for it, complete consultation before we sent the bills out. And what I am concerned about is the precedent that we are establishing. 
   I have a resolution to put the Congress on record in support of the Iraq Study Group. Now, am I going to be foreclosed from offering that resolution? Here is a group of men and women, Baker and Hamilton, who spent 8 months. It was one of these evil earmarks that you hear all about it. Am I going to be foreclosed from offering the Baker-Hamilton solution to the  problem? The administration doesn't like it. Probably Members on both sides of the aisle don't like it. But am I going to be foreclosed? Here is a group that spent 8 months looking at this. And Jim Baker is a good man and Lee Hamilton is a good man. They were bipartisan. Chuck Robb; Bill Perry; Leon Panetta, who served over here; and Ed Meese. Based on what we are seeing here now, I will be foreclosed. Any resolution that comes from this side of the aisle is automatically foreclosed. We have watched it for the whole month of January. 
   So let me just say I am sure, Mr. Obey, this is probably a lot of good stuff. But we on the minority side have to be treated the way we should be. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. 
   Now, the test will be with my resolution, and there are only two of us on it, GILCHREST and myself. Will I be foreclosed by the Rules Committee in 2 weeks from my resolution that puts the Congress on record in support of the Baker-Hamilton Commission? Ten people, five Republicans, five Democrats, spent more time looking at this issue of Iraq than this Congress has, than the Republican Party has and the Democratic Party has. And based on what is taking place so far today, I will be foreclosed. 
   And I hope I am not foreclosed because when you are in the minority and you don't have that opportunity to offer amendments, then, frankly, you are being cut out of the process.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. 
   This is a continuing resolution like no other that I have seen before. It is an omnibus appropriations bill that will fund nearly one-half of the federal government for fiscal year 2007. 
   When I was Chairman of the Science, State, Justice Subcommittee, we had in-depth discussions and consultations with our Ranking and minority members. On our committee we worked in a bi-partisan manner. The precedent that this CR is setting troubles me. 
   I have a resolution supporting the recommendations of the recently released Iraq Study Group, also known as the Baker-Hamilton report. 
   Based on this CR process with its closed rule and no committee debate, does this mean that I am going to be foreclosed from offering the resolution? 
   The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has been quoted saying that most of the negotiations on the CR were conducted by staff. While we have terrific staff on both sides of the aisle, this is not the way this institution is supposed to operate. 
   The resolution before the House includes $31.2 billion for the State, Foreign Operations accounts. 
   This is an increase of $1 billion dollars over the Fiscal Year 2006 level. 
   I am in no way criticizing the Gentlelady from New York, but I did not meet with the chairwoman of the subcommittee to discuss the CR. I know she is fair and reaches out across the aisle, and perhaps her hands were tied in this unfair process. 
   To be candid, there are some positive aspects of the State, Foreign Operations chapter. One is the full funding of the president's request for Global HIV/AIDS. This funding will provide life saving drugs to thousands of people infected with HIV/AIDS and will meet President Bush's goal of treating 2 million people, preventing 7 million new infections, and caring for 10 million people by 2009. 
   In addition, another $50 million is provided for the African Union's Mission in Sudan, and another $113 million for United Nations' international peacekeeping. 
   But, these funding increases had to result in decreases elsewhere. The president's 2007 Budget request included $3.2 billion for the Economic Support Fund, the continuing resolution cuts $746 million from the request, and is $148 million below the 2006 enacted level. A reduction of this magnitude will affect the Administration's ability to carry out critical foreign policy priorities, including democracy, infrastructure, and economic development programs in Iraq. 
   The president's 2007 Request included an increase of $709 million for stability and reconstruction programs in Iraq, these programs are essential to improving the safety of our troops in the country. Yet, the majority directed that there be no mention of funding for anything related to Iraq in the resolution. 
   This process is not the way the House's business should be conducted. I urge members to vote against this measure to make a statement about the way this entire process has been handled.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (ON OUR WATCH -- (House of Representatives - October 03, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, last evening I came to the House floor to talk about one of the most critical issues facing our Nation today. 
   Our country's financial outlook is desperate. How do we stop the red ink and the bleeding? How do we come together as Republicans and Democrats and make certain that the American people don't suffer for our out-of-control spending? 
   I'm talking about entitlements and other mandatory spending. How do we change course? Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security combined with interest on the national debt will consume all of the government's revenue by the year 2026. 
   According to the GAO, balancing the budget in 2040 would require cutting total Federal spending by 60 percent or raising taxes by 2 1/2 times today's level. Both would devastate the economy. 
   The longer we wait to get serious about this reality, the harder and more abrupt the adjustments will be for the American people. 
   I ask every colleague in the House, how will you feel when there isn't enough money for medical research, for cancer research, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, or for autism? How will you feel when you know it was today's Congress, this Congress that we all have the honor to serve in, that passed the buck to the next generation, that avoided the issue, and said it was just too hard? 
   I'm challenging every Member of this House to come together, to know that while we served in Congress, we did everything in our power to provide the kind of security and way of life for our children and our grandchildren that our parents and our grandparents worked so hard to provide us. 
   Congressman Jim Cooper, a Democrat from Tennessee, and I have come together because we know what is at stake. We have a bill that we believe is the way forward to help stop the bleeding. And, quite frankly, I would say to my friends on both sides of the aisle the American people desperately want to see us working together, Republicans and Democrats, to deal with these important issues. 
   The bipartisan SAFE Commission will send its recommendations to Congress. We will have an up-or-down vote  similar to the base closing process, which we now have in effect in the Congress, on getting our financial house in order. 
   There are other ideas, too. I am inserting Robert Samuelson's op-ed in today's Washington Post. He hits the nail on the head when he talks about the need for bipartisan work, a bipartisan panel, to help us do our job. ``Everything else has failed,'' he says. 
   I urge you to think about this issue and the real problem we face now. Not an issue for next week or next month or the next Congress but an issue for this Congress. An issue for now. 
   In the song by Simon and Garfunkel, ``The Boxer,'' it says, ``Man hears what he wants to hear and disregards the rest.'' I urge us to tell the American people not what they want to hear but what they need to hear. And I urge us to come together and work in a bipartisan way for our young people, for our children, for our grandchildren, and for all Americans.  
   Escaping the Budget Impasse  
   Almost everyone knows that the next president will have to wrestle with the immense costs of retiring baby boomers. Comes now a small band of Democrats and Republicans who want to do the new president a giant favor. They want to force the new administration to face the problem in early 2009. Why is this a favor? Because dealing with this issue is so politically unsavory that resolving it quickly would be a godsend. Otherwise, it could haunt the White House for four years. 
   Let's review the problem (again). From 2000 to 2030, the 65-and-over population will roughly double, from 35 million to 72 million, or from about 12 percent of the population to nearly 20 percent. Spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--three big programs that serve the elderly--already represents more than 40 percent of the federal budget. In 2006, these three programs cost $1.1 trillion, more than twice defense spending. Left on automatic pilot, these programs are plausibly projected to grow to about 75 percent of the present budget by 2030. 
   Stalemate results because all the ways of dealing with these pressures are controversial. There are only four: (a) massive tax increases--on the order of 30 to 50 percent by 2030; (b) draconian cuts in other government programs (note that the projected increases in Social Security and Medicare, as a share of national income, are more than all of today's domestic discretionary programs); (c) cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--higher eligibility ages or lower benefits for wealthier retirees; or (d) undesirably large budget deficits. 
   The proposed escape seems at first so drearily familiar and demonstrably ineffective that it's hardly worth discussing: a bipartisan commission. But what would distinguish this commission from its many predecessors is that Congress would have to vote on its recommendations. The political theory is that, presented with a bipartisan package that cannot be amended, most politicians would do what they believe (privately) ought to be done rather than allow pressure groups, including retirees, to paralyze the process. 
   There is precedent for this approach. Since 1988, Congress has allowed more than 600 military bases and facilities to be closed or streamlined using a similar arrangement. An independent Base Realignment and Closure Commission evaluates the Pentagon's proposed closings and listens to objections. With the president's approval, it then submits its own list, which goes into effect unless vetoed by both houses of Congress. This process provides members of Congress bipartisan ``cover'' and prevents amendments from weakening the package. 
   Two prominent proposals would adapt this approach to the budget. The first, offered by Sens. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), the chairman and ranking minority member of the Budget Committee, would create a 16-member commission, evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. All eight Democrats would be from Congress, as would six Republicans. The administration would have two members, including the secretary of the Treasury. 
   Conrad's notion is that the impasse is political and that only practicing politicians--people with ``skin in the game''--can craft a compromise that can be sold to their peers. The commission would report in December 2008. Twelve of its 16 members would have to support the plan, with congressional passage needing 60 percent approval (60 senators, 261 representatives). These requirements, Conrad and Gregg argue, would ensure bipartisan support. 
   The other proposal comes from Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Frank Wolf (R-Va.). It would also create a 16-member commission, with two major differences. First, only four of its members would be from Congress. Second, though Congress would have to vote on the commission's proposal, there would be some leeway for others--including the president--to present alternatives as long as they had the same long-term budget impact Any proposal, however, would have to be voted on as a package without amendments. 
   A combination of these plans might work best. A 20-member group would be manageable and should include four outsiders to provide different perspectives and, possibly, to build public support. Perhaps the head of AARP should be included. And it would be a mistake to present the next president with a take-it-or-leave-it package. The Cooper-Wolf plan would allow a new administration to make changes--and get credit--without being able to start from scratch. 
   This commission approach has potential pitfalls: It might create a face-saving package that does little. But everything else has failed. The main political beneficiary would be the next president. It would be revealing if some of the hopefuls--Democrats and Republicans--would show that they grasp this by providing their endorsements. Otherwise, the odds that Congress will even create the commission are slim.

   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I rise today to extend a warm welcome to our guest chaplain, the Reverend Elton Van Welton of Leesburg, Virginia. 
   Reverend Van Welton is the senior pastor of Crossroads Baptist Church. In the two short years he has been at Crossroads, the church membership has grown dramatically, and its rate of financial giving to world missions to the poor and to the hungry has increased by over 500 percent. He has also worked to establish many local ministries, such as Saving Addicts for Eternity, which partners with local Narcotics Anonymous groups to provide spiritual guidance to those struggling with addiction. 
   Pastor Van Welton first joined the ministry in 1999 after receiving a master's in divinity from Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Before his career as a pastor, Reverend Van Welton received his juris doctorate from Regent University and was a practicing attorney in the Commonwealth of Virginia before he received his call to the ministry. 
   I commend Rev. Van Welton for his dedication to spreading the word of the gospel and for his faithful service to our community in northern Virginia. It is a blessing to have him here today to serve as our guest chaplain.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Darfur Accountability and Divestment Act. I want to thank Congressman Lee for her leadership in this effort; also Chairman Frank for his effort to move this thing and not just talk about it, but actually get it out; also Congressman Bachus and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen for their effort.     
   I also want to thank all of the young students around the country who have participated in this whole disinvestment thing. When the whole tide was running against them, they went against the tide, and this language, this legislation, will enable them now to move. 
   Genocide continues. 400,000 to 450,000 have died. There are 2.5 million in camps, many in Chad. Now, the Sudanese government, I heard on Friday, are giving the right for people in Chad to come back, not Sudanese but people from Chad, to come in and take over much of the land, some of the land, up to 90,000 that belongs to the people of Darfur. 
   The previous speaker just said the U.N. failed. Wow, the U.N. failed so much. The U.N. failed in Srebeniza. They stood by and allowed the Serbs to come in and commit genocide in Srebeniza. The U.N. failed. And Kofi Annan, who was really head of U.N. peacekeeping, and he failed while he just stood by and allowed the genocide to take place in Rwanda. Kofi Annan and the U.N. failed and history has to show it. It has to show that the people at the U.N. failed to deal with this issue of genocide. 
   When Senator Brownback and I were there with the first group, we came back and asked Kofi Annan to go. He had not actually been there before. This has been a failure. And because of Congresswoman Lee and Chairman Frank and others coming to demonstrate the United States is committed to doing something that can really make a difference and not just a resolution that calls something something and nothing ever happens. 
   The Chinese have failed. We cannot hide the fact. Every time you purchase a piece of furniture or food or whatever and it says ``Made in China,'' this is the government that has helped bring you the genocide in Darfur. Their Olympics in 2008 will be a monument to their genocidal activity and effort. Period. Period. They've even hired people to put on a good show similar to what Nazi Germany did, Hitler did, in the Olympics in the thirties. They could have singlehandedly stopped the genocide. The President of China went to Sudan and we all thought that he was going to announce that he had put pressure on the Sudanese government. He announced that he was building them a new palace. China, after the Government of Sudan, is the number two country responsible, history will show, responsible. 
   Lastly, because of the efforts of Congresswoman Lee, hopefully now all of the Governors and the State legislatures, including my own, which did it in the Senate but not in the House, will now feel released and there will be no excuse to pass these, the same way that the State of New Jersey did under the leadership of Don Payne and the people there. The same way that California did. The same way that Illinois did. Many States have been reluctant. They have looked for excuses to find out. This legislation takes away all the excuses and hopefully this time next year after all the legislatures have had an opportunity to act, there will be a rollcall and all 50 legislatures will have participated and made this State law whereby the disinvestment takes place around the world. 
   Again, I thank Congresswoman Lee. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey. There ought to be a rollcall vote on this. I don't know what the intentions are, I'm not involved in it, but there ought to be a rollcall vote because they will look to see. One, it will be interesting to see if anyone votes ``no'' on it, but secondly I think the Chinese will look, the Bashir will look, the Khartoum government will look, and lastly the people in the camps will find out that the United States Congress has done something to really make a difference.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON S. CON. RES. 70, CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - June 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I am deeply disappointed that the FY 2009 budget resolution conference report represents another missed opportunity to address the financial crisis facing our nation. Focusing on these economic challenges, reining in entitlement spending, and curbing Congress's appetite for autopilot spending will take strong bipartisan commitment from both sides of the aisle. Our ``long-term'' spending crisis has arrived, and our children and grandchildren will bear the burden if Congress does not act. 
   Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German theologian who was at the heart of the German resistance against Nazism, said, ``The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children.'' 
   This Congress is leaving the next generation saddled with $54 trillion in unfunded liabilities and $9 trillion in debt, $1 trillion of which is held by the Chinese. They also face potential loss of our country's triple-A bond rating--as early as 2012, according to Standard & Poor's, or by 2018, according to Moody's Investors Service. This is an economic issue, but also a moral and generational issue. 
   Representative JIM COOPER and I have been working together with over 100 cosponsors on a solution that would put everything--entitlements and tax policy--on the table in order to turn things around. The Cooper-Wolf SAFE Act would create a bipartisan entitlement review commission, culminating in a required up or down vote by Congress on a legislative proposal born from the commission's work. Mandating action is what makes the SAFE Commission unique. 
   We had the opportunity in this year's budget process to take the initial steps to get our financial house in order. But again this budget cycle, Congress is choosing to look the other way. I am hopeful that my colleagues will recognize that the budget resolution makes little progress on this pressing issue and join our efforts with the SAFE Commission. 
   When educating his colleagues in the British Parliament about the horrors of the slave trade in 1789, William Wilberforce said, ``Having heard all this you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say that you did not know.'' 
   Not one member of the 110th Congress can say they don't know about the category 5 storm off our shores, which former Comptroller General David Walker says could result in a ``tsunami of spending and debt that could swamp our ship of state.''

   In 1993, when this issue first came up, I voted the other way. I was on the wrong side of the issue. I would remind Members of the Congress that two of the best Members of Congress that I have ever served with were for this bill. Congressman HENRY HYDE, who was a giant, and I would say one of the more pro-family people here in this Congress, and also former Senator Dan Coats, who was ranking Republican on the Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families, both voted for the Family Leave Act at that time. 
   I would urge Members to support this, because the bonding process and the immediacy and opportunity for mom to spend time with that child at the very, very beginning is very, very important.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (MADE IN CHINA -- (House of Representatives - July 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Madam Speaker, I have a longer speech today which I will insert for the record, but I want to highlight some of the key points. 
   During the debate over granting China permanent normal trade relations status, proponents argued that economic liberalization would lead to political liberalization in China, that exposing China to the West's ideas and values would lead them to play a more constructive role in the international community, and that the U.S. and other industrialized nations could influence China through economic activity to better respect the rights of its citizens to fundamental human rights. 
   Instead, we have seen why the protection of basic liberties should not come second to economic growth. The China today is worse than the China of yesterday, or of last year, or of the last decade. 
   And now, in addition to all of the horrible things the Chinese government does to its own citizens, it is doing to other countries' citizens as well. 
   Just read the headlines: 
   Toothpaste from China containing an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some antifreeze. 
   Chinese-made Thomas the Tank children's trains slathered in lead-based paint, a substance that is toxic if swallowed. 
   Unsafe food products from China including prunes tinted with chemical dyes, dried apples preserved with a cancer-causing chemical, scallops and sardines coated with putrefying bacteria, and mushrooms laced with illegal pesticides. 
   Five types of farm-raised shrimp and fish from China banned by the FDA because they are so contaminated from unsafe drugs in China's polluted waterways. 
   Malfunctioning fireworks from China responsible for critical injuries, including in my hometown of Vienna, Virginia on July the 4th. 
   Chinese-made tires sold without a critical safety feature that prevents the tread from separating from the tire. 
   Within a year, China will also be the biggest source in the world of greenhouse gases from all the new coal-fired power plants being built. 
   I could take several 1-hour special order speeches to detail China's egregious human rights record: 
   Slave labor camps; 
   Religious persecution, including torture and imprisonment of Catholic bishops, Protestant church leaders, Muslim worshipers, Falun Gong followers, and Buddhist monks and nuns; 
   Human organ harvesting and selling; 
   Sophisticated system of espionage against the U.S. government and American businesses; 
   World's leading producer of pirated products. 
   Then there's China's foray into Sudan, selling weapons to the very government orchestrating the genocide in Darfur. 
   And despite all of these abhorrent acts, China was still awarded the honor of hosting the 2008 Olympics. 
   Where is the outrage over China's unacceptable behavior in the Congress and in the administration? The facts are before us. The United States can no longer say that things are improving in China. 
   Next time you make a purchase and you see the words ``Made in China,'' think of the poisoned toothpaste, the contaminated food, the polluted waterways and airspace, the exploding tires, malfunctioning fireworks, the human rights abuses, and the intimidation of religious leaders.  
   Madam Speaker, imagine a country where factory workers have no workplace safety, labor or environmental protections and are required to work 80-hour weeks for no more than $110 per month to produce goods for export. 
   Imagine a country which boldly supplies missiles and chemical weapons technology to countries that support or harbor terrorists. 
   Imagine a country that oversees a network of espionage operations against American companies and the U.S. government. 
   Imagine a country which tortures and imprisons Catholic bishops, Protestant church leaders, Muslim worshipers, Falun Gong followers, and Buddhist monks and nuns just because of their faith and systematically destroys churches and confiscates Bibles. 
   Imagine a country which has a thriving business of harvesting and selling for transplant kidneys, corneas and other human organs  from executed prisoners who are thrown in prison with no trial or sentencing procedures. 
   Imagine a country which maintains an extensive system of gulags--slave labor camps, also known as the ``laogai''--as large as existed in the former Soviet Union that are used for brainwashing and ``reeducation through labor.'' 
   Sadly, none of this is imaginary. Such a nation exists. It is the People's Republic of China. 
   Sadly, too, that's just part of the list of egregious actions. 
   In 2006, the Chinese government arrested 651 Christians that we know of. Currently, China has 6 Catholic bishops in jail and another 9 under house arrest. Renowned human rights advocate Rebiya Kadeer has watched from exile as the Chinese government arrests and beats her family members in her homeland. 
   Late last year, western mountain climbers captured on videotape a horrifying scene: Chinese police shooting from their North Face tents at a group of Tibetan refugees crossing Nangpa Pass. A 17-year-old Buddhist nun was killed and several others were wounded. 
   There are some who assert that human rights are something that should come once stability has been attained. They say that protection of human rights comes second to attaining economic power and wealth. We must reject that notion. 
   During the debate over granting China permanent normal trade relations status, proponents argued that economic liberalization would lead to political liberalization in China, that exposing China to the West's ideas and values would lead them to play a more constructive role in the international community, and that the U.S. and other industrialized nations could influence China through economic activity to better respect the rights of its citizens to fundamental human rights and the unfettered practice of their faith. 
   Instead, we have seen why the protection of basic liberties should not come second to economic growth. The China of today is worse than the China of yesterday, or of last year, or of the last decade. China is not progressing. It is regressing. It is more violent, more repressive, and more resistant to democratic values than it was before we opened our ports to freely accept Chinese products. 
   And now, in addition to all of the horrible things the Chinese government does to its own citizens, it does to other countries' citizens as well. It poisons children in Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Australia, with toothpaste containing an industrial solvent and prime ingredient in some antifreeze. This toothpaste was marketed under the brand name ``Mr. Cool.'' 
   Some 1.5 million wooden toys in the Thomas the Tank Engine line of children's trains were recalled after manufacturers discovered that the Chinese-made toys were slathered in lead-based paint, a substance that is toxic if swallowed. 
   China continues to send American consumers adulterated and mislabeled food products, including prunes tinted with chemical dyes, dried apples preserved with a cancer-causing chemical, scallops and sardines coated with putrefying bacteria, and mushrooms laced with illegal pesticides. 
   Food and Drug Administration inspectors who traveled across the world to investigate the recent mass poisoning of U.S. pets stemming from tainted pet food from China arrived at two suspected Chinese factories, only to find the factories had been cleaned out and all equipment dismantled. 
   On June 28, the FDA banned the import of five types of farm-raised shrimp and fish from China because they are so contaminated from unsafe drugs in China's polluted waterways. 
   A recent NPR story described how garlic from China outsold garlic grown in California for the first time last year. China began dumping garlic at U.S. ports below cost in the 1990s. Hefty tariffs kept the garlic imports at bay for a few years, but since 2001, imports of Chinese garlic have increased fifteen-fold. 
   Several Fourth of July celebrations in my district, including in my hometown of Vienna, VA, included malfunctioning fireworks that injured 11 people, including children and an infant. These fireworks came from China. 
   Some 450,000 imported tires were recalled from Foreign Tire Sales after it was discovered that the Chinese-made tires were sold without a critical safety feature that prevents 
   the tread from separating from the tire. A blown tire can cause the driver of the vehicle to lose control of his or her car and crash. 
   China is one of the world's leading producers of unlicensed copies of goods ranging from movies and designer clothes to sporting goods and medications. According to the Motion Picture Association of America, 93 percent of DVDs sold in China are unlicensed copies. The MPAA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other industry groups say that despite stricter Chinese enforcement, product piracy is growing amid China's booming economic expansion. 
   China is building a new coal-fired power plant every week and within a year will be the biggest source in the world of greenhouse gases. It is building factories and infrastructure all over the developing world, but we have no solid data on China's plans or programs. A recent editorial in The Washington Post reported that World Bank experts estimate that toxic air and water in China kill some 710,000 to 760,000 Chinese each year. 
   During a recent visit to Sudan, Chinese President Hu Jintao promised to build a new palace for the Sudanese president, Omar al-Bashir, despite Bashir's role in orchestrating the ongoing genocide in Sudan's Darfur region. This is in addition to the recent Amnesty International report that China is selling weapons to the Sudanese government, which are then being used to kill and maim innocent civilians in Darfur. 
   China bullies neighboring Taiwan, repeatedly threatening to launch missiles from the mainland for Taiwan's refusal to accept China's claims of sovereignty over the democratically governed territory. 
   And despite all of these abhorrent acts, China was still awarded the honor of hosting the 2008 Olympics. The Olympic Games: an event designed to lift up ``the educational value of good example and respect for universal fundamental ethical principles,'' according to its own charter. Does China's behavior sound like a ``good example'' to the rest of the world? Or that it is reflecting ``fundamental ethical principles'' that all nations should aspire to? 
   Amnesty International reports that the Chinese government is rounding up people in the streets of Beijing that might ``threaten stability'' during the Olympic Games, and is detaining them without trial. Human Rights Watch reports that the Chinese government is tightening restrictions on domestic and foreign media, in an effort to control what information leaks out about China's repressive and violent nature during coverage of the Olympics. 
   China has even gone so far as to claim it will ``force rain'' in the days leading up to the Olympics, in order to have clear skies for the Games. They intend to fire rocket shells containing sticks of silver iodide into Beijing's skies, provoking a chemical reaction that will force rain--despite mixed reviews on the soundness of this science. 
   China's desperation to conceal its true character leading up to the Games smacks of the Nazi bid for the Olympic Games. Analysts are likening the 2008 Beijing Olympics to the 1936 Olympics, in which Nazi Germany soft-pedaled its anti-Semitic agenda and plans for territorial expansion, fooling the international community with an image of a peaceful, tolerant Germany under the guise of the Olympic Games. 
   Like the Nazi regime in 1936 Berlin, the Chinese government is preparing for the Olympics by hiring U.S. firms to handle public relations and marketing for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 
   Where is the outrage over China's unacceptable behavior? The facts are before us. The United States can no longer say that things are improving in China. 
   But China would have America and the world believe that is the case. China has hired a number of large lobbying firms in Washington, DC to push China's agenda with the U.S. government. Documents from the Department of Justice show these lobbyists as having a significant presence on Capitol Hill, including almost 200 meetings with Member offices between July 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. 
   America must be a country that stands up for basic decency and human rights. America must speak out on behalf of those who cannot speak for themselves--men and women who are being persecuted for their religious or political beliefs. Our foreign policy must be a policy that helps promote human rights and freedom. Not a policy that sides with dictators who oppress their own citizens. 
   Next time you make a purchase, and you see the words ``Made in China,'' think of the poisoned toothpaste, the contaminated food, the polluted waterways and airspace, the exploding tires, malfunctioning fireworks, the human rights abuses, and the intimidation of religious leaders. Remember that China poses a threat not only to its own citizens, but to the entire world. 
   American businesses have an opportunity to capitalize on China's failure to protect the safety of its food exports. American businesses should seize this opportunity by reclaiming their place in the global market. The United States government and American consumers must be vigilant about protecting the values that we hold dear.

In Srebrenica, the U.N. stood by as 700 Muslims were led to their death by the Serbs. In Darfur, where I have been, I led the first delegation, 450,000 people have died, and this House has called it genocide, and genocide continues today.

   Mr. WOLF. I was watching this meeting and resolution in my office today, and I support it. I think it's a good issue, but I want to say to the gentleman from New Jersey, I don't understand why you've boxed up for months and years the bill that Congressman CHRIS SMITH has that deals with Lyme disease. 
   I was at a national Lyme disease conference this week. Lyme disease is spreading through our Nation. Lyme disease is spreading through my congressional district. Lyme disease is spreading through New Jersey, spreading through the gentleman's district, spreading through Mr. Smith's district, and if I could get the gentleman's attention, rather than whispering back and forth, I would like to know, if we are going to do resolutions like this and take them out of the committee, why Mr. Smith's bill, which has been pending in your committee for a long time, cannot be considered? 
   If you watched the movie the other day, the number of people that have been impacted by Lyme disease is very serious. This is spreading. It's in Pennsylvania, I would tell the person who's chairing the House. It is spreading throughout the United States, and yet the bill is boxed up, locked up in your committee, and I want to know, because I've had enough of seeing this thing and seeing it go time after time after time, and you're keeping the bill from coming out. 
   So if I could yield to the gentleman to tell me, what do you plan on doing about Lyme disease? Why won't you get that bill out? What is the status of it? And what would we tell somebody who happens to have Lyme disease today to know that the bill is pending in the committee? 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. WOLF. Reclaiming my time, we're not going to let this issue go away, I want to tell the gentleman from New Jersey, even if I have to come up into New Jersey and go throughout to say that this bill is being boxed up. 
   Just so Members know, instances of Lyme disease are rapidly rising in Virginia, not only in my congressional district but across the country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1993 to 2007, reported cases of Lyme in Virginia have risen 990 percent, and this committee has done nothing. In the same time frame, reported cases are up 235 percent nationwide. 
   Lyme disease is frightening, keeps the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts from camping during summer months or children playing in the backyard or joggers on bike paths through tree-lined neighborhoods, sharing the outdoors with a minute insect that can bring monumental health problems. 
   Congress needs to get serious. I was watching this and I think you have boxed it up. You know, when the gentleman was speaking--if you could look at me, I would just appreciate it. I want to tell the gentleman that we're going to hold you to this with regard to hearings. I will come and testify, but if this issue is boxed up next year, we're going to deal with it in many ways.

   Mr. WOLF. Reclaiming my time, I was going to offer the Chris Smith amendment to the appropriations bill.  The Appropriations Committee hasn't met and had any hearings for months. Your side has prohibited any amendments from being offered. But I will tell the gentleman, next year, if you don't move this bill, I am going to offer it to the Labor-H bill next year and we will have to deal with it on the floor. 
   I believe we have a responsibility to address an issue that is wreaking havoc in my district and across the country. That's the rapid rise in Lyme disease and there is a bill pending in the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee that could go a long way towards helping raise awareness about the threat of Lyme. 
   Just this week I went to a briefing sponsored by the National Capital Lyme and Tick-Borne Disease Association. People are suffering from Bell's palsy, meningitis and other manifestations from Lyme disease. 
   There are people in my district whose entire nuclear family suffers from chronic Lyme: Young men and women who have had to take medical leave from their college studies to battle severe joint pain and bleeding ulcers, once healthy people unable to dress themselves or tie their shoes; and folks hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt just trying to get some quality of life back for their loved ones. 
   Americans need to learn about Lyme and press their Federal legislator to act. It is unacceptable--an outrage--for Congress to ignore this issue. 
   This past August I held a Lyme disease awareness forum in my district in Loudoun County, Virginia, to help my constituents learn how to prevent Lyme disease from touching their families. Three medical doctors, including two county health departments, volunteered their time to share their expertise in Lyme-related issues. 
   Lyme disease is an illness caused by bacteria that are transmitted to people by the bite of an infected black-legged tick, also known as the deer tick, which is comparable in size to the tip of a ball point pen. With all of the natural beauty and outdoor activities in many of the congressional districts we represent, it's important we work to educate our constituents about this debilitating disease. 
   Speaking as a father of five and grandfather of 13, I worry about deer, mice, and even family pets transporting ticks and transmitting Lyme. 
   Incidents of Lyme disease are rising rapidly in Virginia and across the country. According to the Centers for disease Control and Prevention, from 1993 to 2007 reported cases of Lyme in Virginia have risen 909 percent. In that same time frame, reported cases are up 235 percent nationwide. 
   Lyme disease is frightening. Picture Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts camping during the summer months or children playing in the backyard, or joggers on bike paths through tree-lined neighborhoods--sharing the outdoors with a minute insect that can bring monumental health problems. 
   This Congress needs to get serious about stepping up to the plate, and making sure people in high risk areas are aware of this threat. H.R. 741--The Lyme and Tick-Borne disease Prevention, Education, and Research Act--legislation introduced by CHRIS SMITH with a host of original cosponsors from New York, Connecticut, Arizona, Illinois, Rhode Island, Washington, among others, now has collected well over 100 bipartisan cosponsors. 
   The bill, which would expand Federal efforts with respect to prevention, education, and research activities, will go a long way toward getting the word out about Lyme disease and the precautions people can take to ensure that they never have to suffer the consequences of chronic Lyme. 
   ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'' could not be a more appropriate adage for Lyme disease. Failure to recognize Lyme disease early in its course can result in the development of difficult to treat infections in the brain, eyes, joints, heart, and elsewhere in the body. 
   As public servants, we have given our word to do everything we can to protect the public interest. We are sorely lacking in Federal efforts to increase awareness and education about Lyme disease. Every year since 1998, legislation similar to H.R. 741 has been introduced in the House, and we have failed to act. 
   I urge every member to educate themselves on the Lyme statistics in their home state and take a close look at H.R. 741. 
   For those Members who sit on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, I urge you to step forward and act to see that this bill is reported out of committee before the House completes its legislative business for the 110th Congress. 
   For the House leadership, I urge that this bill be placed on the calendar now for action. If we can spend time loading up the suspension calendar and voting on commemorative anniversaries and naming post offices, we surely can find time to address legislation that can make a difference in the lives of Americans.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. Res. 332, which recognizes the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. On December 10, 1948, the United Nations General Assembly came together to pass the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which serves as a set of standards for all people and all nations of the world to strive toward. 
   Drawing upon principles from both the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the fundamental human rights bestowed to each person on this Earth regardless of race, religion, or ethnicity. Ronald Reagan once described the U.S. Constitution as ``a kind of covenant. It is a covenant we've made not only with ourselves but with all of mankind.'' The Universal Declaration of Human Rights shines light in the darkest corners of the world and reminds those in the most desperate of situations that every person is entitled to respect and dignity. 
   It has been my distinct privilege to serve as co-chair of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus for the past 7 years. The Caucus was founded in 1983 by the late Congressman Tom Lantos and former Congressman John Porter for Members of Congress to work to defend the rights of individuals worldwide as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 
   With the passage of this important resolution, I reaffirm my commitment to serve as a voice for the voiceless and continue to ensure that human rights remains a priority in the U.S. Congress.

Now you give him an amendment, which may be a good amendment or maybe not, but I don't get any opportunity to offer my amendment. 
   Many on your side say, we are concerned about Darfur. This would have done more. There was a CIA station chief who left the CIA, working for the Khartoum government, and you would not even allow us to offer an amendment. Yet you go to the rallies and you speak out against Darfur.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. I am pointing at the Rules Committee. I am pointing at everybody on this side who would not give me an amendment to stop the genocide in Darfur.  
   Madam Chairman, I continue to grow more and more frustrated that my side of the aisle is not being heard. 
   I have been to the Rules Committee no less than three times this year--most recently last night--seeking amendments to bills coming before the House. Each time I have offered substantive changes, aimed at improving legislation. I have not been offering partisan amendments that would gut bills. 
   The amendment I sought to have debated as part of this bill would have closed the revolving door on former ambassadors and CIA station chiefs from representing countries in which they served for five years. Currently, an ambassador can leave the service of the United States one day and be hired the very next as an agent of foreign nation where they had served. These officials see every decision the United States makes in relation to that country. They have access to intelligence, policy documents and other confidential information. But under today's rules, the day they leave they have every legal right to use that same information on behalf of a foreign nation. These are people who have been entrusted with great responsibility. And they don't always work in the most friendliest of countries, or countries who have the United States best interests at heart. 
   My amendment would have ended this practice. Regrettably, it wasn't ruled in order, yet Mr. Abercrombie's amendment, which aimed at closing the revolving door for flag and general officers from going to work for huge defense companies, was. I don't understand. Your side talks about wanting to work in a bipartisan fashion. I don't see it. My amendment drives at the same thing as Mr. Abercrombie's, yet was roundly dismissed. This issue has nothing to do with Republican or Democrat. It has to do with what is right. 
   Last year I learned that a former State Department official and former CIA station chief, trained at the expense of the American taxpayer, were lobbying on behalf of Sudan, the same government that is playing a role in the genocide in Darfur. 
   No other government is a more established enemy of human dignity. Not only is the government widely linked to organizing and arming militias who have raped and killed innocent women, men and children, pillaged villages and displaced millions in Darfur, the Khartoum government gave safe haven to Osama bin Laden from 1991 to 1996 and allows the terrorist group Hamas to operate within its borders. 
   We all say we want to end the genocide yet we have no problem with rogue govermnents hiring Washington-based lobbyists. Yet the Rules Committee won't allow an amendment barring former high ranking diplomats and CIA station chiefs from representing country's like Sudan. 
   Don't even get me started on Saudi Arabia, where not just one, but several former ambassadors to Saudi Arabia have been on the Kingdom's payroll. 
   Severe human rights abuses and religious persecution are status quo in Saudi Arabia. Our own State Department has flatly said religious freedom does not exist in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Wahhabi doctrine, which is at the root of our global war on terror, is taught and encouraged by Saudi Arabia. 
   Read the attached piece from CQ that ran in February of 2006 about former U.S. Ambassadors to Saudi Arabia--the home to 15 of the 19 al Qaeda hijackers--who have or are presently on retainer by the Saudi government. It is extremely troubling. 
   During the Reagan Administration no lobbyist would have dared to even suggest representing a country like the Soviet Union. The clients signed up by some in the lobbying business today are among the world's most unsavory governments, including major human rights abusers and direct threats like China. 
   It saddens me to learn that reputable Washington lobbying firms take up the mantle of a Chinese state-run entity in their efforts to ``merge'' with a private American company. Is there no consideration given to the fact that the Chinese government poses a national security threat to the United States, including an organized spy network, which I have heard described in great detail in FBI briefings? 
   China blatantly disrespects free trade norms and intellectual property law. It persistently violates human rights, imprisoning and torturing Catholic priests, Protestant house church leaders, Tibetan Buddhists, Uyghur Muslims, and Falun Gong practitioners. China consistently stifles political dissent and free expression. Yet, big K Street firms don't think twice about representing them. 
   Nor do they think twice about the fact that China is providing guns and ammunition to the government of Sudan, which is complicit in the genocide that is taking place in Dafur. More than 450,000 people have died and China has done nothing to stop the violence. The PRC, in fact, is helping fuel the violence. 
   Sadly, we didn't get to debate this today. I hope in the future that the Rules Committee, and your side, will look at the aim of the amendment before just dismissing them out of hand.  
   American Diplomats Tend To Become Saudi Lobbyists--But Maybe Not for Much Longer  
   Back in August 2002, a congressional delegation was traveling around Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of the 19 al Qaeda hijackers who less than a year earlier had launched the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. 
   On one leg of the trip, in a big, white embassy van, Republican Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, a former FBI agent, turned to the U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Robert Jordan. He asked Jordan, in light of how the Sept. 11 attacks had revealed the Saudis' role in nurturing al Qaeda-connected charities and religious schools, whether Jordan, a big-time Houston oil and gas lawyer, would be the first U.S. ambassador to not go to work for the Saudis after leaving his post. 
   Jordan, who had George W. Bush as a client before he went to the White House, considered Rogers' question for a moment, and then politely declined to ``take the pledge,'' according to a witness who recalled the episode. 
   Not that it mattered: Jordan's firm, Baker Botts LLP--that would be James A. Baker  III, secretary of State in the first Bush administration and lawyer for the second Bush in the 2000 Florida election deadlock--already had a host of business clients in the royal kingdom, with offices in Riyadh and Dubai. 
   In any event, Jordan in 2003 joined the long list of U.S. ambassadors and other former American officials working directly or indirectly for the Saudi royal family. 
   Rogers last week introduced a bill that would bar federal employees from representing foreign governments for four years after they leave public service. Also last week, the House overwhelmingly approved a resolution (H. Res. 648) that sharply curtails lobbyists by foreign agents on the House floor. 
   Representative Frank R. Wolf, R-Va., plans similar legislation, but more narrowly targeted diplomatic and intelligence officials. He called the practice of ambassadors--and former CIA officials--representing the Saudis, or other governments where they had worked, ``scandalous.'' 
   ``It's a great honor to be an American ambassador, to represent the United States,'' Wolf said by telephone. ``And we have some great ambassadors. But with that, to whom much is given, much is required.'' 
   Reached in Houston, Jordan said he doesn't remember ``all the details of that conversation,'' but added: ``At that time I certainly didn't have any intention of representing Saudi interests. It was premature in any event, because I was still pretty much in office.'' 
   Pressed further, he said, ``I remember someone bringing it up, and it may well have been Congressman Rogers.'' 
   Rogers declined to comment on the matter. 
   Actually, it would be big news if a senior U.S. diplomat in the Middle East did not accept the warm embrace of the Saudis or other despots upon leaving the region. 
   They are sprinkled all over Washington, particularly in such well-known Saudi-supported think tanks as the Middle East Institute (MEI). 
   Two former American ambassadors to Saudi Arabia lead the MEI--Wyche Fowler Jr. (chairman) and Edward Walker (president). Former ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and deputy assistant secretary for the Near East David Mack is MEI's vice president. Also at MEI is Richard Parker, former ambassador to Algeria, Lebanon, and Morocco, and Michael Sterner, former ambassador to UAE and deputy assistant secretary of Near Eastern Affairs. 
   Chas. W. Freeman Jr., another former U.S. ambassador to the kingdom, is president of the Saudi-backed Middle East Policy Council. Another ambassador, Walter Cutler, leads the Saudi-backed Meridian International Center. 
   From the Saudi point of view, all this is a good thing. 
   The legendary former Saudi ambassador to Washington Prince Bandar bin Sultan was quoted in The Washington Post a few years back as saying, ``If the reputation then builds that the Saudis take care of friends when they leave office, you'd be surprised how much better friends you have who are just coming into office.'' 
   Rogers' bill would prohibit U.S. officials from leaving office and lobbying ``on behalf of any foreign entity.'' 
   Wolf's bill ``will be much more narrow, focused primarily on ambassadors and [CIA] station chiefs,'' said an aide. 
   Wolf is concerned about Saudi Arabia's influence. But he's also watching China. 
   Last July he sent a blistering letter to the Washington powerhouse firm of Akin Gump, which represented the China National Offshore Oil Corp. during some of its aggressive takeover bids here last year. One of its partners was a member of the president's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. 
   ``That's just not appropriate,'' Wolf said.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I would like to express my support for H.R. 3887, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2007. I have long worked to support action on what may be considered the most egregious human rights violation occurring in the world today. I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, TVPA, which created an office at the U.S. State Department to monitor trafficking in persons around the world. 
   The trafficking of people and the effects on victims--mostly women and children--can only be described as evil. In many cases, women and children are misled and forced to move across borders, to live in a foreign country, alone, away from family, friends and any kind of support network. They are then bought, sold, and forced into the sex trade. Billions of dollars are generated each year through trafficking. 
   Unfortunately, the United States is also a destination for some of these victims. It is shocking to learn about women being held as sex slaves literally in houses and basements that I drive by every day on my way to the Nation's capital. This reauthorization addresses this aspect of international trafficking by protecting victims in the United States from retaliation by those who trafficked them; expanding and revising U.S. criminal violations to allow offenses against international trafficking criminals and sex tour operators; ensuring assistance to U.S. victims of trafficking, and preventing the trafficking of foreign children found in the United States by ensuring that they are not repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusive families and are well cared for. 
   The focus and commitment of the administration on this issue is making a difference in Countries around the globe. We still have a long way to go, but this reauthorization bill is a significant step in giving the State Department the necessary tools to combat this appalling practice. It is a privilege for me to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, last spring I took a trip to Antietam National Battlefield. As I walked along Bloody Lane, the site of one of the most vicious battles of the Civil War, I was struck by how many individuals made the ultimate sacrifice. 
   September 18, 1862, was the bloodiest day in American history. There were more than 23,000 casualties, nine times as many Americans killed or wounded in World War II's D-day on June 6, 1944. More soldiers were killed and wounded at the Battle of Antietam than the deaths of all Americans in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican War and the Spanish-American war combined. 
   I also visited the site of the George Washington's crossing of the Delaware in anticipation of the Battle of Trenton. Washington was down to only 3,000 soldiers and the war was almost lost. Yet with great courage and sacrifice, Washington and his forces were successful in changing the direction of the American Revolution. 
   I also think of the tremendous sacrifice being made by thousands of men and women serving today not only in Iraq and Afghanistan but around the globe. Their families at home are also making great sacrifices. 
   After those visits and the lessons in history they brought, I began reading about the looming financial crisis on the Nation's horizon with the impending retirement of the baby boom generation. That information was chilling. 
   In less than a year, the baby boom generation will begin trickling into retirement. A few years later, that trickle will become a flood. And within 5 more years, it will become a tsunami that will begin to wreak havoc on the Social Security and Medicare systems. 
   Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security consume 40 percent of the budget in 2006, but will consume 51 percent in 2016, which is just the tip of the Democratic iceberg. 
   There is near unanimous consent by all who have looked at this issue. Social Security and Medicare are amassing huge deficits, and we are ill prepared for the coming flood of new baby boom retirees. When our retirement security programs like Social Security and Medicare were established, the ratio of workers supporting each retiree was more than 10 times the number supporting retirees today. In 1945, there were 42 workers for each retiree. Last year, the ratio dropped to three workers for each retiree and is expected to drop to just two workers for each retiree in 2030. 
   In reading about the coming financial emergency, my mind kept going back to Antietam and Washington's crossing and all the substantive examples of sacrifice for country by Americans. I asked myself, what kind of financial security as a Nation are we passing on to those who are coming after us? 
   While there never is a convenient time to make hard decisions, the longer we wait, the more dramatic the remedy will be that is required. 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, balancing the budget in 2040 necessitates one of two alternatives: Cutting total Federal spending by 60 percent, and this place will never do that; or raising Federal taxes by two-and-a-half times today's level. Either of these options would devastate our economy. 
   But if we can summon the resolve to begin these difficult conversations now, and make hard choices on the front end, we can change the current course. Abraham Lincoln, one of our greatest Presidents, said ``you cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today,'' yet that is precisely what we are doing in avoiding our responsibility to future generations by passing on a broken system in the form of unfunded Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
   That is why next week Senator GEORGE VOINOVICH in the Senate and I in the House will join to introduce identical legislation to establish a national commission that will put everything, everything, entitlement benefits and all other Federal programs, as well as our tax policies, on the table and to require, require Congress to vote up or down on its recommendations in their entirety, similar to the base realignment and base closure commission, BRAC. 
   This commission would be called the SAFE Commission, to secure America's future economy. We first introduced the SAFE Commission last summer. Since that time, the proposal has received strong support from across the political spectrum, including the Heritage Foundation, the Concord Coalition, former Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, and former Congressional Budget Office directors. It is being endorsed by major newspapers across the country, including the Dallas Morning News, the Orlando Sentinel and syndicated columnist David Broder. 
   It is in the hope of building a consensus on this very difficult issue that we will again offer this legislation. One of the most critical responsibilities of the Commission will be explaining the crisis we face and listening to the American people about how to get the country back on sound financial footing. 
   It will also develop a strategic plan for the future. It will look beyond the beltway for solutions, holding at least 12 hearings, one in each Federal Reserve district, over the span of 12 months in order to hear directly from the American people.  
   After its 12-month listening tour, the commission will present to Congress a report describing the long-term fiscal problems, public  suggestions and views expressed during the town meetings and policy options available to ensure Federal programs and entitlements are available for future generations. 
   With a bipartisan three-fourths majority vote, the commission will send to Congress a legislative package to implement the commission recommendations no later than 60 days after the interim report. The administration and Congress will have 90 additional days to develop actuarially equivalent proposals to achieve the same cost savings. 
   Essentially, no later than 16 months from the organization of the commission, Congress would be required to vote--up or down--on each proposal. 
   We have put in the legislation procedures for expedited consideration of the commission's legislation to ensure that the Congress acts. I do not want this to simply be another blue-ribbon commission whose findings end up on a bookshelf somewhere only to collect dust and never be acted upon. 
   The SAFE Commission will be comprised of 16 voting members, four appointed by the Senate Majority Leader, three by the Senate Minority Leader, four by the Speaker of the House, and three by the House Minority Leader. 
   Four of the 14 Congressional appointments must be sitting Members of Congress. Additionally, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as well as the Secretary of the Treasury will serve as voting ex-officio members. 
   The Congressional Budget Office and the Comptroller General of the United States will be appointed as non-voting ex-officio members of the commission to lend their expertise. The President will have the ability to appoint bipartisan co-chairs from among the 10 voting members appointed by Congress. 
   As a father of five and grandfather of 12, the challenge posed by the pending retirement of baby boomers strikes me as much more than a routine policy discussion. Without action, just what kind of future are we leaving to our children and grandchildren? 
   I also deeply believe there is a moral component to this issue that goes to the heart of who we are as Americans. By that I mean, I wonder if we have lost the national will to make tough decisions that may require sacrifice? 
   Moreover, have we lost the political courage to reject the partisan and special interest demands and do what is best for our country? 
   If we remember the legacy we have inherited--the sacrifices of Washington's crossing and Antietam and so many other examples from the over two centuries of our Nation's history--and the debt we owe to previous generations--our grandparents and our parents and the sacrifices they made to make our country what it is today--I believe we all will be moved to do our duty. 
   I have heard criticism that such weighty decisions on the Nation's financial future are the responsibility of Congress. I couldn't agree more. The SAFE Commission has two provisions to protect congressional prerogatives. First, of the 14 members appointed to the commission, four must be sitting Members of Congress. Second, if Congress enacts significant legislation aimed at addressing this looming crisis, the SAFE Commission would terminate and cease to exist. 
   The SAFE Commission should be embraced by both sides of the aisle. This is a national issue; not a Republican issue or a Democrat issue. I am open to suggestions about the legislation from members of both parties. We also welcome a forthright national dialogue. 
   Only by working together in a truly bipartisan manner will we be able to secure America's future economy. I believe most Americans will welcome it as well, especially considering we all want what is best for our children and grandchildren. 
   We must heed the cautionary words of George Washington's 1796 farewell address: ``We should avoid ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden of which we ourselves ought to bear.'' 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, by defeating the previous question on the rule, Members will allow consideration of H. Con. Res. 263, earmark reform legislation introduced by Jack Kingston, Zach Wamp, and myself. 
   Quite frankly, our effort in the House to bring a level of transparency in the earmark process has yet to satisfy the American public. Congress holds the power of the purse and I don't believe the American public really wants us to cede that authority to the executive branch. And while I believe that the majority of earmarks are for purposes which help people, those Members who oppose earmarks have made some legitimate claims. 
   H. Con. Res. 263 would help restore confidence in Congress by creating a Joint Select Committee on earmarks and place a moratorium on all earmarks while the panel undertakes its work. The Joint Select Committee  (JSC) on Earmark Reform would be comprised of 16 members, evenly split between the House and Senate and Republicans and Democrats. The panel would examine the way earmarks are included in authorizing, appropriations and tax and tariff measures. Executive branch earmarks would also be studied. Reviewing earmarks in all bills considered by Congress is key. 
   The House should place a moratorium on all earmarks until the Joint Select Committee has finished its work and we are able to put into place a rules system that restores the confidence of Americans that legislation is not loaded up with hidden special interest, wasteful spending. I strongly support earmark reform including listing names of sponsors of earmarks or specific line-item spending. But the rules must apply an equal standard in all legislation, appropriations as well as authorizing and tax bills, in disclosing earmark sponsors. It must be across-the-board in every bill, but it also must be a process of indisputable integrity and probity that is honest and authentic and in which the American people have absolute trust. 
   Earmark reform should be a bipartisan issue that every member of Congress is concerned about.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise against the resolution, and I rise in support of the Iraq Study Group. 
   Most Americans favor the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. In fact, most Members of this body also favor the Iraq Study Group, but all would favor its consideration. I have asked the Rules Committee on three different occasions to make the Iraq Study Group recommendations in order, and I have been denied. 
   Let me say that we ought not blindly follow the White House, nor we ought not blindly follow the Democratic leadership in Congress. The American people have a very low opinion of this institution, as Mr. Thornberry just said, because all they see us doing is attacking, dividing, and using political rhetoric. 
   The American people want us to come together. A majority of your side have said they support the Iraq Study Group. A majority of my side have said they support the Iraq Study Group. Lee Hamilton, Jim Baker, Leon Panetta, and Ed Meese have done an outstanding job. They have 41 experts of all political views that have come together. 
   This body ought to be voting and debating the Iraq Study Group and not a resolution that is preordained that it will be vetoed. 
   Let's come together. Let's bring it up for a vote, but to blindly follow the White House or to blindly follow the Democratic leadership that will not give this up, we will continue to have the lowest opinion poll this Congress has ever had. The American people deserve better. The men and women who are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve better, and their families deserve better.   
   The 79 recommendations of the Iraq Study Group provide a comprehensive blueprint for dealing with the war in Iraq. Its conclusions were the result of consensus, and most people favor implementing the bipartisan panel's recommendations. 
   Members of the administration, albeit anonymously, have been quoted as saying the ISG is the way to go. Members of the military have looked favorably on the report. And so have both sides of the aisle here in Congress. 
   H.R. 2574, which would codify the recommendations of the report, and whose lead sponsor is a Democrat, has 58 cosponsors. 34 Republicans are on the bill; and there are 24 Democrats. 
   Look who served on the panel: Jim Baker, Lee Hamilton, Lawrence Eagleburger, Vernon Jordan, Ed Meese, Leon Panetta, Sandra Day O'Connor, Chuck Robb, Alan Simpson and Bill Perry. Secretary Gates served until being appointed Secretary of Defense. 
   The panel took nearly 9 months to come up with its 79 recommendations--which were all agreed to unanimously. 
   The ISG met with military officers, regional experts, academics, journalists and high-level government officials from America and abroad. 
   Congress should have opportunity to debate--and discuss--the merits of the Iraq Study group's recommendations. 
   It is not adequate to just blindly follow the whims of the White House or the Democrat Leadership in Congres. We need to be working together toward building a consensus on this issue rather trying to score political points. 
   The American people expect more. The men and women serving in uniform deserve more. So do their families. 
   They want to see us the Congress, the administration and the nation working together; not fighting each other. 
   Implementing the 79 recommendations of the Iraq Study Group is the one thing we can do that could have an impact. 
   I have tried three times now to get this Congress to adopt the recommendations of the ISG. Each time my efforts have been rebuffed by the Rules Committee. If we had acted back in January, we wouldn't be here today. I realize the war has created a bitter divide in our country. The ISG allows us to come together.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, in January, Moody's Investors Service released its annual report which concluded that the United States triple-A bond rating is at risk. 
   We should care that respectable credit rating agencies are projecting that the United States will be on par with Estonia by the year 2015, Poland and Mexico by 2020, and below investment grade, junk debt, by 2025. 
   Our Nation cannot continue on its current financial path. The Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission Act would put everything on the table, tax policy, entitlements, and other Federal programs, to provide a bipartisan way forward on this issue. Over 70 Members from both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat, are already cosponsoring the bill. 
   We must work together to rein in spending. We cannot continue to avoid a responsibility to future generations, to our children and our grandchildren, by passing on a broken system in the form of unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations and unsustainable spending.

   Mr. WOLF. In his first speech in the British Parliament in 1789 describing the slave trade, William Wilberforce concluded telling his colleagues this, he said, ``Having heard all of this, you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say you did not know.'' 
   Not one Member of the 110th Congress can say they do not know about the Nation's long-term financial outlook which former Comptroller General David Walker said will ``result in a tsunami of spending and debt that could swamp our ship of state.'' 
   According to the Government Accountability Office, America is $5.3 trillion deep in publicly held debt and has estimated $54.3 trillion in unfunded promised benefits if we don't change our current course. And that is trillions with a ``T.''  
   The Social Security Medicare Trustees Report recently issued only reinforces the dire condition of our fiscal health. The Medicare Trustees Report concluded that consideration of reforms to ensure the financial security of Medicare must occur, stating, ``the sooner the solutions are enacted, the more flexible and gradual they can be.'' The Social Security report echoes this sense of urgency, saying, ``The projected trust fund deficits should be addressed in a timely manner. Making adjustments sooner will allow them to be spread over more generations.'' 
   And if those dire projections are not enough to raise the warning flags, couple those with the fact that the value of the dollar is falling through the floor. What more evidence do we need to realize that our children and grandchildren cannot afford to have their leaders choose to look the other way? 
   I was so disappointed that Treasury Secretary Paulson's focus is not on this issue. I told him today when he testified before the State and Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee that I believe he is one of the most qualified Treasury Secretaries our Nation has had. He has a brilliant mind, but his attention isn't on the most fundamental of all issues, the economic future of America. 
   I was also disappointed that he didn't answer my question about the projections credible rating agencies, such as Moody's Investment Service, are making about the U.S. triple-A bond rating being at risk as early as year 2012. I also asked Secretary Paulson what the ramifications of this loss would be. He didn't answer that question either. 
   Just last week, Congressman Jim Cooper and I sat in on a roundtable discussion held by Maya MacGuineas and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and they have done a great job. It was just such a diverse group from the business, finance and policy communities, former CBO directors, former OMB directors, think tanks, political views across the spectrum, the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution included. Almost everyone expressed concern about the entitlement crisis we are facing. This is not only an economic issue, it is also generational and a moral issue. 
   You may have read Pete Peterson's editorial in Newsweek this week. He ended by quoting Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German pastor who was instrumental in the resistance movement against fascist Germany. He said, ``The ultimate test of a moral society is the kind of world it leaves to its children.'' 
   I cannot help but wonder what sort of future today's partisan Washington is leaving to generations to come. If we can come together, both sides of the aisle, we can ensure that our children and our grandchildren have all the opportunity that you and I have had. Jim Cooper and I are working together on the Cooper-Wolf SAFE Commission, with over 80 bipartisan cosponsors. 
   If anyone has another viable plan to address our entitlement tsunami, we're anxious to hear it. But we cannot continue the status quo. Doing nothing is not acceptable. 
   Wilberforce's admonition rings as true today as it did in 1789. ``Having heard all this, you may choose to look the other way, but you can never again say that you do not know.'' 
   We know, and it's on our watch. Let's fix it.

<DOCNO>Mr. WOLF. (VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3096, the Vietnam Human Rights Act of 2007, a bill which I am pleased to cosponsor. Introduced by my good friend and colleague, Representative CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey, a champion of human rights in this House, this is an important measue which speaks to the deteriorating state of human rights in Vietnam. 
   After joining the World Trade Organization in January 2007, the politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) has carried out a large-scale brutal campaign of arrest against the nascent movement for democracy in Vietnam. Ignoring all international criticism and strenuous protests of the Vietnamese people, inside Vietnam and abroad, the communist regime in Hanoi has shamefully pushed ahead with its crackdown. Among others, the following events were particularly disconcerting to me: 
   On February 18, 2007, the second day of the Lunar New Year, which is the most sacred time in Vietnamese culture, the communist security forces raided Father Nguyen Van Ly's office within the Communal Residence of the Hue Archdiocese. Father Ly was later banished to a remote, secluded area in Hue. 
   On March 8, 2007, Reverend Nguyen Cong Chinch and his wife were brutally assaulted by security forces of Gia Lai Province in the Central Highlands, who then arrested Reverend Chinch on undisclosed charges. 
   Also on March 8, 2007, two prominent human rights activists and lawyers, Mr. Nguyen Van Dai and Ms. Le Thi Cong Nhan, were arrested in Hanoi and were told that they would be detained for four months as part of an undisclosed investigation. 
   On March 9, 2007, Mr. Tran Van Hoa, a member of the People's Democracy Party in Quang Ninh Province, and Mr. Pham Van Troi, a member of the Committee for Human Rights in Ha Tay, were summoned by security forces and threatened with ``immeasurable consequences'' if they do not stop their advocacy for human rights in Vietnam. 
   Also on March 10, 2007, state security forces also raided the home of Ms. Tran Khai Thanh Thuy, a writer, on the grounds that she advocated for ``people with grievances'' against the government. They took away two computers, two cell phones, and hundreds of appeals that she had prepared for victims of the government's abuses. 
   On March 12, 2007, lawyer Le Quoc Quan, a consultant on local governance for the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, UNDP, and Swedish International Development Agency, was arrested in his hometown, Nghe An, less than a week after he returned from a fellowship at the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington, D.C. His whereabouts are unknown at this time. 
   On April 5, 2007, the Vietnamese authorities in Hanoi rudely prevented Congresswoman LORETTA SANCHEZ (D-CA) from meeting with several dissidents' wives at a gathering organized at the U.S. Ambassador's home. The police reportedly used very hostile and undignified manners to intervene in the meeting. 
   Furthermore, the Hanoi communist regime is still imprisoning many political dissidents and labor advocates such as Huynh Nguyen Dao, Truong Quoc Huy, Nguyen Tan Hoanh, Doan Huu Chuong, and more than 350 lay people of the Protestant churches in the Central Highland. 
   I share the concerns of the Vietnamese-Americans in my district, as well as all across the country, who are very angered and distressed by what they perceive as a new and aggressive plan of the Hanoi government to reverse the progress of human rights in Vietnam. It seems to me that the Vietnamese government is conducting this crackdown on advocates of human rights and religious freedom because it believes that the U.S. has no further leverage in the region. Now that Vietnam has been admitted to the WTO, and met with the Holy See, they believe they can respond in this brutal fashion to supporters of democracy and freedom and we will not respond. 
   Throughout my years in Congress, I have worked to foster human rights and religious freedom throughout the world. I have raised this issue with U.S. government officials often, especially since this recent crackdown, in an effort to pressure the Vietnamese government to stop persecuting its citizens. I believe the State Department should consider putting Vietnam back on the list of Countries of Particular Concern if the human rights situation in Vietnam does not improve. I believe that the State Department is failing the Vietnamese people struggling for human rights, and is not doing all that it can do to advocate on behalf of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people should be able to choose their own leaders through free and fair elections and to use the Internet freely without censure or restrictions. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge a unanimous vote for passage of this legislation so that the Vietnamese people will know that the U.S. House of Representatives stands in support of their freedom.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment. 
   Just to bring it back, one, this has nothing to do with trade. So the trade issue is not even out here. It also has nothing to do with the issue of travel, and I have asked for a visa to Cuba, and they denied me when I tried to go. 
   This amendment should be called not the Diaz-Balart amendment. Thi s should be the Sharansky amendment. This should be called the Yelena Bonner amendment. This should be the Havel amendment. I just read the interview with Havel the other day. 
   What we want to do with this money is the same thing that was done in Eastern Europe during the days of Ronald Reagan when we brought down communism. This is what we did in Romania to bring down the Ceausescu government. So this is a major cut. The Bush administration funds this to the pro-democracy groups in Cuba. They need this for training. They need this for their journalists. They need this for technical assistance.     
   They need this for so many other reasons. USAID reported U.S. assistance supported journalism correspondence courses for 200 Cubans; publication of 23,000 reports by independent Cuban journalists, on and on. Dissidents are ro utinely rounded up. 
   If this amendment passes, imagine how they will feel in Cuba today to know that the United States Congress stood with them. If it fails, they will be demoralized. 
   This is really the Sharansky amendment of 2007. This is the Havel amendment of 2007. This is the Yelena Bonner amendment of 2007. This is the amendment that we used to do in the 1980s to bring down communism, to help the civilian side, the dissidents. 
   This has nothing to do with travel; it shouldn't even be mixed wi th that. That's a mixed issue; it has nothing to do with trade. It is what do we do to help the dissidents; Armando Valadez has been in jail for almost 19 years. 
   And so, I would hope that we can come together and send a message that when this amendment is passed, the word goes forth as they listen to their Radio Free Cuba tomorrow to know that the United States Congress stood with them the way that they stood with Havel. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Florida for the balance of the time .

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, this restores $156 million of the $458 million that was cut. The amendment that we're going to offer today is in complia nce with the Iraq Study Group. 
   Now, about 226 Members of this body said they favor the Iraq Study Group. What this does is this puts money back in for demining. If you listen to the news today, there were 13 killed with regard to IEDs in the effort for demining. This also puts money in for training for human rights. 
   Now, whether you want to go out today or whether you want to do whatever you want to do, we still need training for human rights, we still need training for capacity for democracy and go vernance, we still need ways for reconciliation to bring the parties together. We are always hearing about the differences between the different factions. That's what this money is for. 
   The administration originally asked for $458 million. We knocked it down. We brought them in and said, what do you really need? They said, this is what we really need. 
   This amendment is what the Iraq Study Group recommended. The Iraq Study Group recommendation number 6 says, ``Building the capacity of the  Iraq i Government should be at the heart of U.S. reconstruction efforts, and capacity building demands additional U.S. resources.'' That's what this is on. 
   I urge Members on both sides, this ought not be a political issue or partisan issue, to support this amendment.

   This, in closing, deals with the whole issue of demining, human rights training, criminal justice, rule of law and human rights. None of these things really ought to be controversial for anybody, what ever their position. Also they fit into the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. 
   I think to offer an opportunity to heal and to build the private sector, the civilian sector in Iraq on these issues of human rights training is important, so when the United States is out, there will be respect for human rights, there will be criminal justice, there will be rule of law.

The gentlewoman put a lot of programs with good money in. What do you honestly need? So everything would be in compliance with the benchmarks. But it would also give them the initial funding. They said, we actually need this $158 million.

   Mr. WOLF. I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   Everyone has frustrations. I think the U.N. could do certainly a lot more on Darfur and many of the other things. T hey stood by and frankly didn't do very much in Rwanda, either. But what this amendment would do, I think, is people have to look at it. This would actually cut NATO fees, and NATO is sort of the backbone of what we're doing in Afghanistan and many other places, but particularly $41 million out of this fund goes to NATO. 
   Also, on the World Health Organization with regard to avian flu and things like that, this is not the time to do that. Also, there is another issue that I have personally made a cause, of funding the war crime tribunals to bring people to justice. This would cut the war crimes tribunal in Rwanda where over 800,000 people have died between the Hutus and the Tutsis and that whole issue. Also the former Yugoslavia where after the genocide that took place, Milosevic was brought to the court. 
   So for those reasons, I understand what the gentlelady is trying to do. But I think this would be the wrong place to kind of do it, from NATO and IAEA and the World Health Organization and the war cri mes tribunal. 
   Lastly, this is at the request of President Bush, of the Bush administration. This is what the Bush administration, President Bush, has requested. 
   For those reasons, I urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from North Caro lina (Ms. Foxx). 
   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Chairman, Mr. Shays has made a good case, and the Chair has made a good case for this. Without mentioning the groups, so we don't call any attention to them, we know the good work that they are doing. Mr. Shays lived with one of t he groups for a period of time. You saw the schools they were building. So I am just concerned we are getting wrapped up into process that since nothing is in, we are not going to put things in. 
   This is something that would actually work and have success in Iraq from the civilian side. It would be a  great boost to have this in. So I strongly support the amendment.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman. Congresswoman ANNA ESHOO is interested in this and a lot of others, and I thank the Chair for accepting the Kirk amendment in the full committee. 
   I looked for you yesterday. What I wanted to ask you to do was to offer an amendment on the floor, and I know the gentlewoman would have accepted it, of another $100,000, or $1 million, for the Chaldean Christians, and get a roll call vote on it; because colloquies are colloquies, but a roll call vote is a roll call vote. 
   AID has failed to address this issue. We have asked them a number of times. They tell us that we can't be targeting with regard to certain ethnic groups, and it has never been a satisfactory answer. So it is too late now, but it would have been a good thing to do. In fact, this Congress a nd this government, we have abandoned the Christians in the Middle East. We have pretty much walked away and the Christian community in the Middle East is declining. 
   So you are on to something, and hopefully you can find a way in another bill or in the supplemental perhaps to offer to work with the gentlewoman to have an amendment, and then you offer an added $100,000 or $1 million or whatever you think is appropriate, and then ask for a roll call vote so the entire Congress is on record, because you ar e right on target.  
   I want to thank you, and we will work with you and help you in any way possible. But a roll call vote of 435-0 would send a message to the AID people that they would have to face and focus on.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Pitts amendment. 
   First of all there is the flexibility; there is ability to waive. I hope Mr. Pitts will cover that. 
   Let me read you what Ambassador Mark Dybul said. He said recent data from Kenya, Zimbabwe and urban Haiti show decline in HIV prevalence. A new study has concluded that these reductions and prevalence do not simply represent the natural course of these nations' epidemics, but can only be explained by chang es in sexual behavior. This demonstrates the power of behavior changes to save lives and the importance of support for effective behavior change intervention. 
   If people from my old neighborhood back in southwest Philadelphia heard this debate that the Congress was debating ``faithful'' in this, is it a good idea or a bad idea, they would say, what is going on? 
   As Mr. Pitts said, I would argue too that he is right. I think Biblical faithfulness is a Biblical principle. Faithfulness is a very goo d principle. Does anyone disagree? Now we are debating abstinence? We are saving lives. 
   So there is flexibility. So there is a fake argument here. There is the ability to waive; and what we are doing here, we could talk about different things, they are underlying agendas. We are talking about basically are we going to save lives. Are we going to save lives. 
   I will stipulate that Mark Dybul has forgotten more about this than this Congress knows. Because of that, I will urge an ``aye'' vote for the Pi tts amendment to save lives. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to my friend from Pennsylvania.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, before I recognize the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin), I would say to my friend, my very good friend, I would increase the funding for family planning. I would gladly increase it. So I think the question is how much money would be good if we could actually increase it with that. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Ms. Fallin).

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, this is the article that I referred to, Public Radio, I'll put it in the Record. It says, Morning Edition, April 23. ``During the past week, dozens of women in southwest China have been forced to have abortions even as late as 9 months into the pregnancy, according to evidence uncovered by NPR.'' It goes on, mentions a family which Liang describes how they told her that she would have to have an abortion. ``You don't have any more room for maneuver,'' he says they told her. ``If you don't go to the hospital, we'll carry you.'' The couple was then driven to Youjiang district maternity ward in Baise City. ``I was scared,'' Wei told NPR. ``The hospital was full of women who had been brought in forcibly. There wasn't a single spare bed. The family planning people said forced abortions or forced sterilization were both being carried out. We saw women being pulled in one by one.'' 
   Now, in answer to Mr. Ryan's comment, Mr. Ryan, I led the opposition over here in opposition to PNTR. President Clinton was one of the biggest supporters. He accused President Bush, criticized him, and then switched and strongly supported it. 
   I have sent your office, with due respect, probably 25 letters asking you as a Blue Dog member to cosponsor a bill that I have, and I'll do it again, on the SAFE Commission. On my SAFE Commission I have eight Members from the Democratic Party, eight Members from the Republican Party, and I put everything on the table, tax policy. Someone on your side said there is no Republican over there that would do it. I put tax policy on it. Some of my people don't like it, but we do. We also put all the entitlements to save the country. 
   I agree with you. God bless you. I agree that the debt that the Saudis hold is terrible. The debt that the Chinese hold. And I would beg you, because I know you're a good person, I watch you in committee, I followed your campaigns, join me in the SAFE Commission. We can get a handle on this deficit that we have in the country. This places a partisan political pit, and both sides are at each other. 
   So what I want to do is what we did on the Iraq Study Group, get eight Republicans and eight Democrats, give 1 year, this is modeled after David Walker, the GAO, to go around the country and educate and talk to the American people and listen. And then we use the Base Closing Commission concept whereby this Congress has to vote. 
   You're right. The amount of debt that the Chinese hold is horrible and that the Saudis hold. And I have written you over and over. The fact is, I will say it right now, I've been surprised that I haven't had anybody from your side cosponsor, because I will stipulate you care about the deficit as much as I do, maybe as a newer Member you may actually care about it more. But I agree with you, and the SAFE Commission is the opportunity to deal with this. 
   If you look at the language in the package I'll send to your office, I put every single thing on the table. And if you would join me, I don't know if we could pass it in this Congress or not, but I think you're exactly right, we could help save this country because we are living off of Chinese money and Saudi money. And keep in mind, the Saudis funded all the madrasses up at the border. There were 15 Saudis funding the Wahhabis. The Saudis are funding radical, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic. So if we could come together and do that.

   Mr. WOLF. The gentleman's concern, and the gentleman is a very good Member, and I appreciate when he speaks a lot of times in committee. I agree with him, and not only do I agree in my conscience, I vote with him, and sometimes I even speak for him. But it is an issue here of going to the groups that are involved, and I will put a copy of the article in the Record, but the two that I mention, and to give them the support whereby they would do these things. I can't speak for other people, but I think it would be wrong.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and in support of the committee's language. In fact, I think the language is very moderate, perhaps even, from my own perspective, a little bit too moderate because I think we could have put some other conditions on it. 
   Ayman Nour is still in prison. I visited Ayman Nour's wife. He is still in prison. He is not very, very well. We have interceded on his behalf, the Congress and everyone else. But Ayman Nour is still in prison. 
   The Coptic Christians. The life of the Coptic Christians is worse today than it has been for a long while. So if you're a Coptic Christian in Egypt, you're in trouble. 
   For the Baha'is, the Baha'is in Egypt just live the most miserable life that you can possibly live. They are not even recognized. They cannot even get a card for a driver's license. They are a nonentity. They are not even there. They are not. So they can't move. They can't do anything. 
   There is anti-Semitic and anti-Christian editorials and cartoons in their newspapers. Just look at what they say. The government controls those newspapers. So if a government controls a newspaper and anti-Semitism and anti-Christian language is in there, does that not mean that someone in the government is saying that? 
   Also, the language is moderate. They gunned down the Sudanese. I was there shortly after they gunned down the Sudanese. There are many Sudanese that live there, and they gunned them down. There is police brutality. 
   The Gaza. The gentleman, Mr. Lantos, was right with regard to the Gaza. They have a powerful military. They could be doing much, much more. 
   Egypt is a great nation. It is a great nation. They are great people. They are our friends. But friends have to be honest with friends. 
   Mr. Obey was exactly right. We have given them, Mr. Obey would have this figure better than I would, over $15 billion. Martin Luther King said, in the end, we will remember not the words that were of our enemies but the silence of our friend. As a friend, for us not to speak out on this issue, we would be derelict in our duty. We would be derelict in our duty. 
   So, Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment, and in support of it, and would say to the gentlewoman, the Chairwoman, it would have sent a very refreshing message if one of the other conditionalities had been with regard to the Coptic Christians, who are very patriotic people in Egypt and who love their country and who always speak proudly of their country and who always honor their country; and also if we had conditionality language with regard to the Baha'is. But I think Mr. Obey is right. I agree with the Chairwoman. I would hope that we would defeat the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I know it has been accepted, but this is an important amendment. My father was a policeman for 20 years in the city of Philadelphia. 
   If a country isn't prepared to send somebody back, then we ought to do what the gentleman from Texas said. We ought to deny them the visa. And I will push for this when we get to conference. I think this is a good amendment. 
   We just can't go to all these meetings and say we love our police officers and we honor them and then all of a sudden we walk away from them. The gentleman is exactly right. Let's pass this. I appreciate its being accepted. But I think we ought to pass it because they think we are a patsy. 
   We also had a young man in my district who was run over and killed around Christmastime. And the guy left and went back to El Salvador, and that family hurts, are in pain every day, and they can't get this guy back. So I think if there is any deficiency in it, it probably ought to cover every felon but at least peace officers. 
   So it is a good amendment, and it has been accepted. But, frankly, I think we should have asked for a roll call vote to get every Member on record for it. But since it has been accepted, let's keep it in the bill. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe). 
   The amendment was agreed to.

   Mr. WOLF. Reclaiming my time, perhaps the amendment really doesn't go far enough in the sense that to do something that really matters, there is a real concern that many American Ambassadors to Saudi Arabia are now out working for the Saudi Government. And I have an amendment that we're trying to get through the Rules Committee. Mr. Lantos and I are working on asking various groups to look into this. There are actually, I understand, CIA station chiefs, American CIA station chiefs who were station chiefs in Saudi Arabia that may be now working for the Saudis. 
   The Saudis funded the madrassas up along the Pakistan-Afghan border. There were 15 Saudis on the aircraft, one of them went into the Pentagon and killed 30 people from my congressional district. The first person killed in Afghanistan was Michael Spann, a CIA agent from my district, because of the activities of the Saudis. 
   The Saudis are funding anti-Semitic, anti-Christian activities in some of the schools. This is Wahhabism. I've been kind of shocked. This is a milquetoast amendment. This is a weak amendment. There should be something really strong to get control of this Wahhabism that is spreading. 
   So, yes, let's pass it. But I would hope the next time we really do something that really can make a difference because this is dangerous. Had they not funded those madrassas, frankly maybe what took place on 9/11 may have never taken place. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. WOLF. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment for three reasons. One, I would hope in the next Congress we have a Republican Speaker, and so I wouldn't want to see that side limit our Speaker. That is number one. 
   Number two, Senator Sam Brownback and I were one of the first ones to go to Darfur. I wish more Members would go to Darfur. I think it is genocide. I think one of the problems is that this place hasn't moved fast enough because people haven't seen it.  They couldn't smell it. They just couldn't feel it. And so to say you couldn't go to Darfur where there is a genocide taking place now is just not a good idea. I have been to Sudan five times. Certainly you couldn't limit the Speaker to go some place that I, as a lowly Member, could go to. 
   The third reason is that I was one of the Members who went to Syria. Now, I am not a weak person. I used to go to the Soviet Union during the days of Communism and speak out for the dissidents. Chris Smith and I went into Perm Camp 35 and interviewed Sharansky's cellmate and did a lot of things that really made a difference. 
   When I went to Syria, here is what I said to Assad. With me was Robert Aderholt, not exactly a liberal Member of the House; Joe Pitts, again, God bless him, a very conservative Member of the House, a good person. Here is what we said to Assad four times, and it was good that he heard it. I said it twice, and Mr. Pitts said it once, and Mr. Aderholt said it once. We said, one, stop allowing foreign fighters to come and transit your border. I am not saying it is because of our effort, but 2 weeks after that, the Commanding General in Afghanistan said that the foreign fighters had slowed down. They actually saw the results. 
   Secondly, Israel's right to exist. Assad should have heard Members. More Members should go tell Assad, Israel has the right to exist. 
   Thirdly, I said stop supporting Hezbollah and Hamas. We were 4 feet from him. We looked at him directly in the eye and said no more support. We know and they know where Hamas and Hezbollah have their offices. They're in Damascus. 
   Lastly, we said to them with regard to this, stop interfering in Lebanon's right to exist. 
   So, I am of the mind, and I may be in the minority of my party, I take the Ronald Reagan approach. Ronald Reagan, when he called the Soviet Union the evil empire, his greatest speech was to the National Association of Evangelicals, Orlando, Florida, 1983. He called them the evil empire. But as he called them the evil empire, he sent people out to talk. 
   If you recall his speech he gave at Danilov Monastery, where he talked about freedom, Gorbachev was there. Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviets because he went and engaged, not in weakness. He put the Cruise Missiles in in Europe in 1983 when people complained. But he was able to do it. 
   So, one, I hope we have a Republican Speaker, and I would hope everyone on our side agrees when we have a Republican Speaker in the next Congress. 
   Two, I went to Sudan. I think everybody in this body ought to go to Sudan. They ought to go to Darfur. Maybe it was because of the failure of people to go to Rwanda. Maybe that wouldn't have taken place. 
   Lastly, intellectually it would be impossible to say this was a good idea if I was one of the ones that went. I think by going I served the interests of our Government. I was criticized. I had people criticize me.     
   But I thought it was good that Assad heard that. 
   Lastly, I met with the leading dissident in Syria, and I said, ``Should we put your name in our release?'' And he said, ``Please, put my name in.'' Sharansky used to tell us, ``When you spoke out for me, when you said things for me, my life got better.'' 
   This dissident said, ``Mention my name. Mention my name. I will stand with you,'' because, he said, ``nobody else is coming to meet with me and stand with me.'' We stood with him, and when we left Syria, after we left, the Syrian Government criticized us for the tone of what they thought we said. 
   But, God bless, I would hope that every Member of this body would go to Syria and sit down with Assad and say, stop the foreign fighters; Israel's right to exist; stop the support for Hezbollah and Hamas; and stop messing around in Lebanon and let these people who want freedom to have freedom. 
   For that reason, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.
