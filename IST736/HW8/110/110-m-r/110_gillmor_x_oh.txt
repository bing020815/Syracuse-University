<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Chairman, I will enter my statement in the Record, and I am going to be very brief. 
   I rise in support of the amendment. I want to commend the gentleman, Mr. Turner, for taking leadership on this amendment. He has a record of being very active, when he was mayor of Dayton, trying to deal with the problems of predatory lending. And I want to commend Mrs. Biggert for her work on this, as well as her work on financial literacy. 
   Ohio, unfortunately, has been one of the leaders in foreclosures. And I want to point out one of the things that we found about foreclosures nationally and also in the Midwest, most of those foreclosures have not come as a result of loans by federally regulated banks and savings and loans. They have come from those lenders and mortgage brokers who are not regulated by the Federal Government but by the States, who have not done their job. 
   I called together a conference, I guess about six weeks ago, of Ohio financial institutions, of regulators, of community groups, to talk about the foreclosure crisis and what effectively could be done. And I was surprised that the consensus that came out of that meeting of all those groups was that the single most important thing you could do would be to provide for housing counseling. And the people who did have counseling had a very low foreclosure rate. And all this bill would do would be to provide a modest increase in counseling. We will get a tremendous benefit and a decrease in foreclosures as a result of it. 
   I think this amendment presents a choice. You have two agencies, and you have a choice between them. You've got the Inspector General and the Housing Counseling Program. Which one are you going to fund level to last year and which one are you going to increase? And I would say to you, if you look at what's going on in the housing market, it is pretty clear that if there is to be a priority between those two, it ought to be to put more money into counseling so that you can save people and their homes. 
   I also point out that the Senate has already passed language that goes much further than ours. So I would ask for support of the Turner-Biggert-Gillmor amendment.  
   Today I rise in strong support of the Turner-Biggert-Gillmor amendment. Not a day goes by that we do not see reports of another facet of the growing turmoil in our housing markets. For far too long, Ohioans and others have been subject to predatory lenders, loose underwriting standards and too few housing counseling opportunities. My colleagues Mr. Turner, Ms. Biggert and many others have explored these issues for years and have worked tirelessly to find solutions to the problem of foreclosure. Mr. Turner was active in efforts to prevent predatory lending as the mayor of Dayton. My colleague Ranking Member Biggert has been a leader in efforts to promote financial literacy. Housing counseling is a critical element to helping Americans stay in their home. During a recent summit I put together on Ohio's foreclosure crisis, regulators, lenders and housing advocates from Ohio alike presented an opinion that a significant number of homeowners were not able to tell you whether they had a fixed-rate or an adjustable-rate mortgage. Today, too many find out the hard way when their loan resets. It is expected that some $600 billion in subprime loans will reset in the next 18 months and the fallout could be devastating to many of our constituents. 
   The consensus of all those attending was that the most important single thing we could do to prevent foreclosure was to provide counseling before people actually entered into a mortgage. Housing counseling will not be a silver bullet, nor will it prevent someone currently in the foreclosure process from losing their home. That being said, there is a clear need for additional federal resources in this area and would hope my colleagues will support this small increase. 
   Legislation I recently introduced with Representatives Bachus, Pryce and others would authorize some $100 million per year in housing counseling, a more than doubling of FY2007 enacted levels. The Senator has proposed a comparable increase. While I hope this stand-alone legislation is quickly adopted by the House, this amendment assures that moving forward, Congress is in favor of additional resources for housing counseling. 
   I urge my colleagues to accept this modest increase in funding so that our constituents can keep their homes once they realize the American dream of homeownership.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (NATO FREEDOM CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and also for her support of this resolution. I am very pleased to join with my colleague, JOHN TANNER, in supporting this resolution. 
   NATO is our most successful military alliance, maybe the most successful military alliance in history. It won the Cold War, and it is also providing security now in many other areas of the world that are outside the exact geographical footprint of the NATO countries. For example, as Mr. Tanner pointed out, there are troops in the Balkans. There are NATO troops in Afghanistan where they are carrying the fight. Many of those NATO allies have had troops also in Iraq. 
   Very shortly after NATO was created in 1949, there was another group called the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to keep a close liaison between the North Atlantic Council, which is NATO, and the parliaments of those countries. Mr. Tanner and I have had the opportunity to represent the United States on that organization for I think a little over 10 years, and it has been a very valuable organization from the point of view of the United States. We have both had the opportunity at different times to serve as vice president of it and as chairman of the Economic and Security Committee, and Mr. Tanner now leads our delegation to that group. 
   One of the things that I think is important about that when we go, as Republicans and Democrats, we seem to quit being Republicans and Democrats when we get outside of the United States. I would say when we meet with our European allies, the only way they know which party we belong to is when they ask us, because we speak with one voice. 
   But many of the nations on the other side of the Cold War east of the Iron Curtain are now members of NATO, and they are some of the strongest and most enthusiastic members. As recently as 2004, seven new countries were added, all of them Warsaw countries, bringing the NATO membership to 26: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. 
   I want to point out that NATO is not a club you just join. You have to earn membership in NATO. It is a military alliance. You have to meet the criteria, and you have to contribute your part to that military strength in order to be a member. As long as the new members meet those commitments, NATO will continue to be a strong alliance and one of the strongest forces for peace, stability, and democracy in the world.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (INTERNATIONAL SOLID WASTE IMPORTATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I am pleased to rise in support of this bill. 
   I introduced a similar bill in the last Congress with the cosponsorship of my friends Mr. Dingell and Mr. Rogers and much of the rest of the Michigan delegation. We were successful in getting it passed last year, but the Senate did not act. I am proud to join as a cosponsor with those gentlemen in this effort this year, and I hope we get better luck in the Senate in this session. 
   This is a commonsense bill. It gives authority to the States to regulate foreign waste which is being dumped in our landfills. The process of planning, developing and maintaining landfills is often contentious and often very expensive. Our communities should not be forced to sit back and watch as their resources are overwhelmed with trash from outside the United States. 
   International waste, as has been mentioned, has become a tremendous burden for my neighbors to the north in the State of Michigan. And while much of the foreign waste coming into the United States ultimately ends up in Michigan, this is an issue for all Americans. Our landfills are an important resource, and I believe there will come a day when Michigan's landfills have a sign outside that reads ``Landfill full. Continue to Ohio.'' It is that domino effect that makes international waste a national problem. 
   The current law rewards the environmentally irresponsible, those who won't make the investment and face the issue of creating landfill space. It punishes the environmentally responsible, like Michigan, who have gone to the effort to make landfill space available. That situation has to change. This legislation will do it, and I am pleased to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JULY 26, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. Madam Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Frank-Bachus amendment to H.R. 2419. This vast expansion of the Farm Credit System is unnecessary and unwise. American businesses today enjoy the best financial services marketplace in the world. There are opportunities for credit at every turn. The current Farm Credit System was set up in a different era to offer all the products and services of a financial institution to farmers and farm-related small businesses. 
   A government sponsored enterprise for over 90 years, the Farm Credit System remains the only GSE with direct lending authority. In towns of 2,500 people or less, this system is able to compete directly with other lenders, but with major advantages given to them by their government-sponsored status. The historical justification for this special GSE status has been to focus the system on farmers and companies that provide farm related services. The expansion which the Farm Bill currently seeks would dramatically alter the mission of the Farm Credit System and detract from its mission of helping farmers. There is no need for the expansion of this government entity and there is no vacuum to be filled. 
   Regardless of whether or not you disagree with the policy of the expansion of the Farm Credit System, you can disagree with the process used here to legislate. In a July letter to the Speaker, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Financial Services Committee asked for a sequential referral, yet were denied. While the Committee on Agriculture clearly has jurisdiction over the Farm Credit System, the Committee on Financial Services has jurisdiction over all extensions of credit and a referral was justified. 
   In a recent letter written by the former regulator of the Farm Credit System, Michael Reyna, we see an objective analysis of this expansion. As Mr. Reyna mentions, the Farm  Credit System is seeking an expansion of their powers to move beyond their historical focus. ``Therein lies its primary flaw--the System's efforts are more about the System's growth and profitability rather than the credit needs of agriculture and rural America. When it comes to commercial agriculture, competition among lenders is healthy and credit is available and affordable.'' 
   Let's not fix what isn't broken. Let's keep our government-sponsored lending operations tied to their original purpose and let's support the Frank-Bachus amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (SEASONED CUSTOMER CTR EXEMPTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee for their diligence on this legislation. 
   This much-needed regulatory relief provision will help reduce unnecessary paperwork for both banks and for their regulators. And by granting an exemption from currency transaction report requirements for seasoned customers, this legislation seeks to streamline the filing of CTRs, which is a critical tool for our law enforcement officials.  
   There is little doubt that our regulatory structure has contributed to the United States being the model for the world when it comes to financial services; but without constant attention to the burdens of outdated rules and regulations, our markets can be weighted down by unnecessary costs. 
   I am pleased to see that Congress is tackling the issues of the regulatory burden early in this session, and I look forward to working with Chairman Frank, Chairman MALONEY, and Ranking Member Bachus and the other members to look for ways to find sensible regulatory relief for our banks, our thrifts, and our credit unions.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (INDUSTRIAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. I want to thank Chairman Frank for all his leadership on this issue, not just in this session, but in previous sessions, and also thank Ranking Member Spencer Bachus for his consistent support of the principles embodied in this legislation. 
   Chairman Frank and I have cosponsored meaningful reform of the ILC charter option for a number of years now. We have gotten a bill, passed the House twice, it died in the Senate. I think this year, though, the third time may be the charm. I think we have substantially more support for this legislation in the Senate than in the past. 
   While it's available in only a handful of States, the ILC charter is the last loophole remaining for commercial firms wishing to engage in full-service banking. 
   While a majority of current commercial owners of industrial banks refrain from using all the banking powers available to them, the broad ILC charter does allow for a complete mixing of banking and commerce, which I and other objective observers, such as Alan Greenspan, Chairman Ben Bernanke and others, consider to be financially unwise. 
   The trend in Congress over the past several decades has been one of removing loopholes and exceptions in the bank law. We did it most recently in 1987 and in 1999, and the trend is clear: If you want to engage in full-service banking, you must become a bank or a thrift holding company. 
   Chartering an ILC in Utah is really your only option to make an end run around our bank laws, and the secret is out. ILC assets have grown more than 3,500 percent over the past decade. Applications for new ILCs look nothing like they did 80 years ago when this charter was created. States such as California, Maryland and others have taken notice of this alarming trend in ILC applications and have installed roadblocks to an extension of the charter. 
   State action alone is insufficient, however. It's time that Congress address this policy concern, using the time which was wisely given to us by the FDIC-imposed moratorium. I also want to commend Chairman Bair and the FDIC for listening to the concerns of Congress and imposing that moratorium. 
   Should Congress fail to send H.R. 698 to the President, we will be increasingly in danger of creating a parallel banking system to that which we have now and which has served the country very well. Both financial and commercial firms will look to this industrial bank option as a way to escape the rules that apply to everybody else. The banking system is well served by the different charter options available to them, but the universe in which an industrial bank can operate is more expansive than any other. 
   This is poor public policy. Simply saying that since no ILC has yet taken full advantage, that Congress shouldn't act, is wrong. 
   We are currently in a time of banking stability. Up until recently the FDIC had gone a record 952 days without a bank failure. But I don't like to think about the type of hit that the deposit insurance fund would have taken,  and the hit that taxpayers would have taken, if Enron had had an industrial bank prior to their collapse.     
   This bill is a combination of significant bipartisan effort undertaken by myself and Chairman Frank to strike a balance between protecting those ILCs already in existence and preventing any further widening of this loophole by commercial firms. 
   The list of supporters for this reform measure is long and growing. We have 145 cosponsors of this measure to date, and the other body has already begun its deliberations of an identical bill. 
   So I want to sincerely thank Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and their staff for the hard work on this bill, and urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (INDUSTRIAL BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, let me commend the gentleman from Utah for an articulate presentation. He is protecting the hometown industry, and there is nothing wrong with that. 
   I think this bill, though, involves something much broader than that; and it involves a very important financial principle that has been recognized for decades, which is a separation of banking and commerce. 
   Really, the fact that some of these ILCs have not utilized all the powers they could have isn't really an argument against this bill. Because the business plan of some of the new industrial companies trying to take over ILCs, Home Depot is a great example, is totally different than what the history in the past has been. So that history I don't think is really relevant to what this bill is aimed at. 
   But that having been said, I am very pleased to yield as much time as he may consume to the ranking member, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).

<DOCNO>Mr. GILLMOR. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GILLMOR. I thank the gentleman from Texas, who is a real American hero, for yielding me the time.     
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution we are considering does not do a single thing to help our troops or to achieve the goals of America, our allies or the Iraqi people. 
   Congress is spending an entire week on a nonbinding resolution that, even if it passes, will not change the course of action in Iraq. Our time could have been spent much better debating real issues, such as how to most effectively win the war that terrorists are waging on us. 
   Now, personally, I am skeptical that an increase of 20,000 troops will make the difference and that it will stabilize Baghdad and Iraq. But, for me, the question is, to whom should we listen regarding operational decisions in Iraq? Should we listen to the recommendations of the U.S. military or to the politicians in Washington? 
   And as an Air Force veteran, I think we should accept the recommendations of our military. And in that respect, 2 weeks ago the General in command of ground forces in Baghdad said, and I quote, ``By bringing more troops in, it provides us the opportunity to work with them, to provide more time to defeat this threat, which is both an al Qaeda threat as well as sectarian violence.'' 
   I have visited in Germany in the medical facilities with our wounded troops from Iraq. A member of my family served a year in a combat zone in Baghdad, and I am incredibly proud of our men and women in the military. They are talented. They are dedicated. They are professional and they are the best in the world. And we owe them a tremendous debt of gratitude. 
   Now, even though it is nonbinding, there is, I think, a large omission in this resolution. While it does compliment the actions of our military men and women, nowhere does it commit to continue providing funding for troops in the field. And at a time when some in this town are talking about cutting off funding for our troops, I think we should commit to providing full funding for our Armed Forces as long as they are in the field. 
   Now, there is no guarantee that this troop buildup will be successful, or that the Iraqis will succeed in finally taking over the security situation in a responsible way. But what we do know is, at this point there is not a better plan proposed which has a chance of victory. And we also know that failure in Iraq threatens the security of the United States, the security of the Middle East, and, in fact, the whole world. 
   Early last year I had the privilege of leading a delegation to Asia, where we met with the Prime Ministers of India, of Thailand and Singapore. And those are all countries that are now and have been under terrorist attack. All of them agreed with the need to cooperate for security purposes, and with the importance of winning the war against terrorism in Iraq because of the consequences of not winning would have on the rest of the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, this resolution has two purposes. First, it rejects the only plan which has been suggested by military leaders with a chance of success in Iraq. Second, it begins this Congress down a path which ends with cutting off funding for our troops and abandoning our foreign policy because of failed congressional fortitude. I am opposed to the resolution and opposed to our micromanaging of the war on terror.
