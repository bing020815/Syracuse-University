   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I met a young lady the other day who made the determination that she could no longer afford to commute to work. The costs of her commuting outweighed any benefit from the long-term employment at that particular place. And it happens again and again. We have volunteer firefighters who can't volunteer to fight fires because they can't afford the fuels to get there. It is making a tremendous impact on our local economy. 
   And what offer do we hear today, we are going to sell some oil so we can buy some other oil and that is really going to put us in a better place. That is an absolute shell game. In order to do this, according to the Department of Energy, if you want to buy that heavy crude, you have to go to Venezuela to get it. We send right now $150 million a day every day to Hugo Chavez, the same guy that is buying attack submarines, about nine of them according to local press reports, to interfere with United States shipping, according to his rhetoric. He buys guns for the FARC in Colombia. 
   So you--what you are saying is that we are going to spend more money in Saudi Arabia and we are going to spend more money in Venezuela and we are going to spend more money in Russia, all of those places who do harm in one way or another to the United States of America. So your answer here isn't going to help America but maybe for a few days at the very expense of our national security. 
   We beg you for the people who are dying at the pump right now, who are mortgaging their homes to fill up their tanks and trying to make it work, come up with a real energy policy, conservation, alternative fuels and American-made energy that lowers prices, brings jobs back, and it protects and keeps a billion dollars a day here in the United States. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a shell game that is dangerous and it is reckless, and I would certainly encourage this body's strong rejection of sending more money to Hugo Chavez to do more bad things to freedom, democracy and to threatening the security of the United States.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise to voice my support for H.R. 5749, the Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008. I am not able to cast my vote today. However, as a co-sponsor of this bill if I had been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on final passage of H.R. 5749.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I appreciate the renewed enthusiasm for this issue, and I can't tell you how important I think it is. Energy today is a national security issue, and it is incredibly important that we have a full understanding of what the money that we send every single day overseas is doing to our enemies, how it is fueling their ability to do things like buy weapons, improve weapon systems and do other things. 
   I was struck by one portion of the bill and would make an inquiry to the bill's sponsor, that you made a difference between the National Intelligence Estimate and the National Intelligence Assessment. I am curious why you chose National Intelligence Assessment versus the National Intelligence Estimate on this particular issue. 
   I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana to respond.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. And I understand that. And I think the gentleman from Louisiana misstated, it is not because it is the most accurate report, it is because it is based on open-source information and something that we could use to project versus the actual intelligence estimate which is more narrow in scope and used confidential, and as you know, classified sources of information. 
   And I ask the question because I have to be honest, I am very disappointed with my friends this evening on an issue that I think is so important. You know, there is a reason, I think, that we have a 9 percent approval, the lowest this Congress has ever registered. And it is for issues exactly like this. 
   We stood up in good faith last week. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hoekstra introduced this very bill word for word, and then we offered it, the same bill, in a motion to recommit. And this is policy, and we won't spend much time on it, but I have to note that I just think this is an awful way to do business here, and I think the 110th Congress has really sunk to new lows. 
   There was no reason that you couldn't have picked up the phone and talked with Mr. Hoekstra about a bill that he introduced and pioneered to deal with a most serious issue. As a matter of fact, one of the speakers today actually voted against the bill in its form, but today there is a renewed enthusiasm that we are going to pass this bill.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. You are very welcome, sir. To the distinguished Member, I am reclaiming my time. 
   The only real problem with the bill last week was that there was a Republican and not a Democrat. You know what, I say okay. If that's the way this is going to be, I say okay. 
   Ronald Reagan had a very interesting plaque on his desk, and it said, ``It's amazing what you can get done if you don't care who gets the credit.'' So I am going to offer this tonight, Mr. Distinguished Majority Leader, and then I will let you respond. 
   We hope that because of this new spirit of great ideas, but it has to be a Democrat idea, I am for that too, because I am more concerned about $4 a gallon gasoline and people not being able to make it. 
   So I offer this suggestion, and I will offer this deal tonight, H.R. 3089, please take it. It opens up ANWR and OCS and builds more refineries here in the United States. It's yours. We'll bring it over word for word and let you put a Democrat on it. Let's get it done. 
   H.R. 2279, which builds new refineries on military bases. Please, take this bill, help those people who are suffering under $4 a gallon gasoline. I'll bring it over, word for word. Put your name on it. We'll get it done. 
   H.R. 5656, which repeals the ban on coal-to-liquids as an aviation fuel. Please, for the people who are stopping to go to their children's away games because they can't afford over $4 a gallon gasoline, take this bill, please. I will bring it over, word for word, it's yours. 
   H.R. 2208, which provides incentives for the development of coal-to-liquids, please, take the bill. Put your name on it. We'll vote for it. Put it on suspension. We're in. 
   H.R. 2493, which eliminates expensive and wasteful boutique fuel blends, which is costing Americans real money out of their paychecks. Their food prices are going up. We have volunteer firefighters who no longer can afford to respond to fires in very remote areas of places like Michigan and Texas and, yes, even Louisiana. Please, take the bill. Put a Democrat on it. Call a sponsor, we'll give it to you word for word. 
   H.R. 6107, it opens up the coastal plains of Alaska, which we know will directly have an impact on the cost of fuel and bring down those prices of people who can't afford over $4 gasoline today. 
   H.R. 6108, which opens up our deep oceans as an energy resource. My legislation, H.R. 6161, which will spur the development of clean cars and invest in nuclear power. I give you the bill today, it's mine, it's yours. I'll give it to you. Take it. Put it on suspension. 
   My complaint here is this. There has been a lot of nothing happening on it. If you are trying to tell the American people you are for lessening their burden at the pump, which is literally killing small towns all across America, then let's do something about it. If it's just the fact that Republicans are on these bills, we give you all of them, every single one of them. Let's do this together, so the people who are paying the pain at the pump get some relief. 
   Now, this bill is pretty serious, I think, and I believe the reason we need this American-made energy plan, and that this helps us understand what the impact of those oil dollars flowing overseas every single day, and every day that we don't do something, means that we are a little bit in danger, is serious. That's why we are going to support this bill. We don't care if your name is on it. We really don't. 
   We just want to point out we don't care if your name is on all the bills that do the right thing. Every day, think of this, every single day, we send $840 million to OPEC. We send $191 million to Saudi Arabia. This is as of April. We send $155 million to Venezuela, $52 million to Russia. 
   Energy is a critical issue, and it's one that we should focus the intelligence community's efforts on. We shouldn't divert our intelligence resources to global climate change, as my colleagues have suggested. It doesn't have a real impact for what we know is fueling our very enemies' ability to buy missile systems, to upgrade their nuclear arsenals, to invest in their conventional forces, and people like Hugo Chavez, spending money, as has been reported in public newspapers, on submarines. We all certainly know what his intentions are with that, with American shipping so close to the coast. 
   Focusing our intelligence resources on energy security would make clear to the American people that our priorities are focused in the right place again. The press has also reported that Hugo  Chavez has supported the FARC, a terrorist organization that operates in Colombia. Wouldn't it make sense to track the rising oil prices, which results in greater income to Chavez's now nationalized oil companies, and to assess whether these funds are being used to collude with terrorist organizations? Is it merely coincidence that Chavez has reportedly traveled to Russia today to buy arms in the wake of rapidly rising oil prices? I think we all know the answer to that. It's helpful to have the intelligence resources focused on that very serious problem. 
   We need to have a better idea of how rapidly escalating energy costs are directly or indirectly increasing funds available to terrorist organizations so that this Congress can make informed decisions about the policy going forward. If there is a direct or even an indirect correlation between rising energy prices and increased financial support to terrorist organizations, we need to know, and we need to take action. 
   What are the security implications of Iran leveraging energy resources against the United States? Iran is the world's fourth largest producer of crude oil and as oil prices continue to rise, we must consider the potential for Iran to leverage energy resources and the potential effects of such actions. 
   These are questions our intelligence professionals should be analyzing and answering. We have done a lot of things here. We have played a lot of games. I think there was even a bill last week they called the DRILL Act. It stuns me a little bit. There was actually no drilling in the bill. 
   We need to have an honest discussion, not only with ourselves, but with the American people. We haven't really done that. Every day, it presents a national security issue that we spend about $1 billion a day overseas to people who want to do us harm, every single day. 
   Every day that we don't open up our own American-made energy resources, shame on us. We are just only adding fuel to what we will have to deal with in one way or another. 
   In addition to the economic aspects of having increased domestic energy supply here in America that frees us up, provides jobs here at home, and provides energy security and reduced prices and makes us competitive in a worldwide market when we are talking about the competitiveness of energy prices, and the manufacturing of goods here in the United States. The greatest thing of all, if you do a comprehensive package that includes conservation and alternative energy, and American-made and American-drilled oil, it means that we walk away from the ability to have to send $1 overseas. The sad part is, it's doable. It's absolutely doable. 
   We really don't need the intelligence community to come back and tell us this. We know it, but I am strongly encouraging us to support this bill, because maybe if it's coming from the intelligence community and says, hey, folks in Congress, you have a problem, you better do something about it, I am going to be for it. I don't care if it has a Republican name on it or a Democrat name on it. As I have said before, we have got a whole list of great bills we are willing to walk over and have you sponsor as soon as we can possibly get the ink to dry. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have the greatest respect for my friend from Maryland. I enjoy his service on the Intelligence Committee, but I think we have had this debate before. I can't tell you, you are a great guy but how wrong you are on this one. 
   You know, you talked about Big Oil. Let's all be mad at Big Oil. I am mad at Big Oil. I have friends who run small stores who literally have had tears in their eyes because the fuel costs don't allow them to do deliveries of food, deliveries of flour for what they used to do. 
   I know mid- and small trucking firms who have had to actually park their trucks, because anything over $4 takes away all their margin. This is hurting the poorest Americans first, the middle class second, and, beyond that, people are adapting. But the folks who have played by the rules are getting killed with these oil prices, these gasoline prices.     
   So what you are telling me is you are mad at them. You say they are not drilling on any of the leases. Not true, they have got 4,700 onland leases. But they are telling us, this is where we know the oil is. Please let us get it. 
   And we said, no, we are mad at you because you are making money because oil is $145 a barrel. 
   Okay. I am mad at them too. But every day that you stay mad and you don't take action means that we send $840 million to OPEC every day. That really makes me mad. 
   How about $191 million to Saudi Arabia? What should that be doing to you? 
   How about $155 million to Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who we know is in collusion with the Iranians, who we know is investing in munition plants, who we know, by press reports, is buying submarines to intimidate U.S. shipping, who we know is buying munitions for the FARC in Colombia. We finally have them at rope's end, and we don't care that we are going to fund them through this sham of a government in Venezuela? 
   Or the $52 million we sent to Russia. And by the way, they are retrofitting their nuclear missile systems that are targeted at the United States. And they couldn't do it before. Just a few years ago they couldn't afford to do it, we had to give them money to dismantle their nuclear program. And because oil is at $145 a barrel because we refuse to increase the supply in the world, they are going to go out and buy missile systems targeting us. 
   It is crazy, it is madness, and we can do something about it. If you are mad at oil companies, increase the supply of oil and watch the prices fall. That is the best way to get them. And guess who benefits? The single mom who is right now trying to debate if she can keep that job because it is a little bit too far at $4.19 a gallon in my hometown. I have talked to those people and they are at wits' end. 
   We have to stop this. I said, we don't care if it is Republican or Democrat. And if that has been the concern, quite obviously tonight maybe that was the big issue. We again, I will offer again, you can have every bill that we have; I will bring it over, to stop sending money to foreign oil overseas at the expense of our people at the pump. 
   You can bring up Big Oil all night long. You can be mad at them, you can tax them, you can try to regulate them, but you and I both know that prices aren't going to go down at the pump for any of those causes. They will if we have an American-made domestic supply that actually impacts the world market and starts bringing prices down. 
   I'm going to plead with all of you for those people who don't have a voice and they don't have fancy lobbyists and they can't afford to fly to Washington, DC because they are barely making it right now, please, let's have an American-made energy supply that keeps Americans alive, keeps them employed, has an impact on our national security, has an impact on our economic security, and the best benefit of all, it takes care of our environment in the process, because what we are proposing is conservation, alternative energy and American-made sources of energy, including oil. And there is more conservation in our bills than there is production. Who isn't for that? 
   I haven't heard any discussion of nuclear with zero emissions. You talk about sun, solar and wind. That is great. But that, in and of itself, won't do it. 
   Take our comprehensive bills, the all-of-the-above energy plan. Take it all. Get it done. Make a difference for the future generations of America. We will all stand up together and celebrate. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   What we are talking about is conserving energy to get ourselves off foreign oil that actually has an economic impact, a positive economic impact. 
   The statistics you made up from the oil companies I have never heard them before. They are absolutely outrageous. And who cares? I am mad at them, so let's do something about it. Let's do a conservation, alternative energy and American-made oil so that we can stop punishing the very people who are struggling to make it every day. 
   You can be disappointed and mad and kick the chair and say we hate them, and that is great. It doesn't do anything for somebody who is paying more for milk or bread or gasoline.

   I would hope and urge, for the very pressure that is being put on those families, we would stand united, with your name on the bills, and take care of those people, because right now they are at the back end of the heel, and all they hear is their disappointment in a very, very, very inactive Congress on the issues that matter to them the most.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hobson) for yielding me this time. 
   Mr. Chairman, in the report accompanying H.R. 2641, the subcommittee commends the nuclear physics research community for its efforts to rescope the next generation rare isotope research facility in light of the current fiscal constraints. However, the report contends that ``the rare isotope beams will involve modifications to existing accelerators rather than the construction of a new rare isotope accelerator, RIA.'' 
   As you know, National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, located at Michigan State University, is the leading rare isotope facility in the United States and needs an upgrade to stay on the leading edge of rare isotope science. Michigan State's upgrade proposal includes the reuse of several major components of the existing NSCL. However, it does not intent to use its existing cyclotron accelerators, as they would not be suitable for the beam strengths contemplated by the new facility. As a result, if one were to interpret this language literally, Michigan State would not be eligible for any potential DOE funded facility since it is not proposing ``modifications to existing accelerators.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, I am assuming this is a problem created by ambiguous wording and does not represent a substantive shift in the position of the subcommittee. Would you concur with my assumption, sir?

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise for a point of order against consideration of the resolution because it violates clause 9(b) of House rule XXI for failure to disclose a taxpayer-funded earmark contained in the bill. 
   Section 618 of the Democrats' SCHIP bill contains an undisclosed earmark directing taxpayer funding to a facility located in Memphis, Tennessee, specifically in the district of the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   Under House rules, all earmarks are supposed to be disclosed, and the Member requesting the earmark is required to certify that he has no financial interest in this earmark. 
   The earmark contained in this bill has not been disclosed anywhere. In fact, at the Rules Committee last night, my friends in the Democratic leadership certified this bill as ``earmark-free,'' despite the fact that this bill includes an earmark for the gentleman from Tennessee. 
   The requirements of full disclosure and certification that there is no financial interest have not been met here. 
   This earmark was not in the House-passed bill, H.R. 976. It was not in the Senate amendment to H.R. 976. I would point out it was in the House-passed H.R. 3192, but it was never disclosed there either. 
   This bill threatens the important programs that protect the health of seniors and children, and that debate should happen. 
   This bill spends billions in taxpayer dollars on health insurance for families who make $83,000 a year and on illegal immigrants. This bill ignores House earmark rules to buy votes for its passage. 
   Mr. Speaker, the American people are entitled to know how their tax dollars are being used. This is why the Republican leadership for months has been requesting a vote on House Resolution 479, legislation that would clarify the rules of our Chamber to ensure all earmarks are publicly disclosed and subject to challenge and debate here on the floor. The majority leadership has unfortunately refused to allow H. Res. 479 to come to the floor for vote. And this is why Republicans had no choice but to file a discharge petition last week that will force H. Res. 479 to the floor. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is a reason that the American people hold us in lower regard than a twice-convicted used car salesmen. It is because we continue to, in a slap of the face of every American taxpayer who gets up in the morning and plays by the rules, to play politics and slip things into bills that are not only against the rules, but against the integrity and well-standing of this House.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, to my distinguished colleagues, I certainly understand the efforts to fence off issues when it comes to the census, and I think there are some issues of which we can find a level of importance to take a very small amount of money, make that census more efficient, and do some great good for the United States of America. 
   Think about some of the goods that we have had coming to the United States of America from China that have been counterfeited, adulterated, contaminated just recently: pet food, toothpaste, bottled water, auto parts. There is an assessment that just counterfeit auto parts coming out of China alone cost American jobs to the tune of $750,000. 
   A couple of years ago, in 2004, the Department of Commerce's Trade Agreement Compliance Center was created, and it was designed to specifically and solely go after Chinese unfair trading practices. And if we are going to have free trade, it must be fair trade. The deficit with China in 2006 was $230 billion, and it is getting bigger. But think of the products that they are selling. Think of the products that they are working into the system. Think of the unfairness to American workers who are playing by the rules, producing products that are safe and legal and in compliance with intellectual property. 
   So you think about what they are doing: currency manipulation to unjustly compete against American jobs that robs us of jobs unfairly in the trade world, certainly not appropriate. Counterfeiting not only of auto parts that we have just seen, but the things they have done with pet food and toothpaste and bottled water. The chemicals used on some food products that they brought in a few years ago. Michigan apples is an example where they used a pesticide that we don't allow in the United States because it is dangerous to public health. All of those things have happened and will continue to happen if we don't step up and make a serious statement about our commitment to stop unfair trade practices by China and stop counterfeit parts that are robbing jobs and products that may, in fact, take the lives of Americans. This is serious business. 
   We ask for just $6 million. It will double the Office of Compliance where these trade cops will look specifically at Chinese trade violations. I can't think of anything more important for us to do given the recent cases that are coming out of China. And only with vigorous and well-funded trade monitoring and enforcement can we provide a level playing field and allow U.S. manufacturers to compete around the world. 
   In order to deliver the promises of free trade, we need to guarantee fair trade. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. I understand. I think a little under a 3 percent cut for counting versus our ability to go after what we know we have found. Contaminated pet food; contaminated toothpaste, which people consume, which is certainly a public health hazard; and auto parts that rob our manufacturers of important jobs must take priority. It obviously hasn't worked the way we want it. We should step up in a big way. A $230 billion trade deficit. This is the right investment.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have a series of three amendments, and what we are trying to do here today is solve a couple of very real problems for average FBI agents who, in my day, were called brick agents. These are the folks who are doing the real work, working organized crime or collecting intelligence on foreign spies or doing counterterrorism work here in the United States, trying to save and prevent any hazards from happening in our homeland, doing violent crime or chasing gangsters or involved in the public corruption that is pervasive in so many of our cities around the United States. 
   They're doing great work, and these are very talented people, and we don't really pay them a lot of money. We ask a lot of them. We tell them to move around a lot. We send them to very high-cost cities, New York City, and think what about we do. 
   We have an agent who's been in, say, 7, 8, 9, 10 years, he makes about $89,000 as a supervisor of other FBI agents, and he's in Alabama. You can do pretty well at that standard. And then we tell him or her, because his or her talents are needed in New York City, You're going to go. So you pack up your family and you show up in one of the world's most expensive cities, and for that, we give you $3,000. 
   So he or she goes from living pretty decently in a place like Alabama on $89,000 to a high-cost city making $92,000, and the hardship begins. It's wrong that we treat some of our frontline defenders in homeland defense in this way. 
   So, last summer, we sat down and tried to work with the FBI director to get a couple of things accomplished. One was a housing allowance. Other agencies in the city of New York have housing allowances for their agents and their officers who serve there because they recognize the need for, A, constant moving; and B, in high-cost areas, you need a little extra help just to get by. Some of these agents have 3-hour commutes to go into work, 3-hour commutes, work a very long day, longer than most Americans; then they have a 3-hour commute to go home. It's pretty tough on their family life. It's tough on their finances, and it's wrong that we ask these agents to suffer under that kind of financial difficulty. We should and could do better. 
   So, last summer, we agreed with the FBI director, of which we have public statements to the effect, that we would try a pilot housing project here in Washington, D.C., another high-cost area. It's hard to attract FBI agents to come back to Washington, D.C., because of the high cost that is uncompensated. So we agreed that we would try a pilot project here to see if we couldn't work out the kinks. Now, the FBI has agreed to this program. They said it's the right thing to do. They will try a pilot project. If it works here, we'll see where else it can go. 
   So we take a very small amount of money, about half of 1 percent from the $2 billion plus going to NOAA, and we say we're just going to redirect a little of this money into something that we know can make a difference for those who are defending the United States of America and doing some of the hardest work that is out there. 
   So, if we do this amendment, I won't have to do an amendment later on that specifically outlines how we would do a housing project for FBI agents across America. And think of those high-cost cities like Los Angeles or Miami or Chicago, New York City, places in New Jersey, Atlantic City, the cost of housing is ridiculous. And they're not well-compensated to begin with, and to ask that extra burden isn't right. 
   So we're going to do two things. We're going to do that. Hopefully, if we do this, I will be able to withdraw my second amendment on the FBI housing allowance. And secondly, they have something called an up-or-out policy of which, by the way, I oppose, but I worked with the director to protect the pensions of those FBI agents that have been impacted by this up-or-out policy. 
   And by the way, the FBI, after this agreement last summer, sent an internal communications and said basically, hey, we're going to do this for you. For those of you who are impacted, and these are supervisors who have served well for their country and their community and the Bureau who had to step down from being a supervisor because they didn't want to be forced to move to a high-cost city in Washington, D.C., to further their career. Maybe their kids were in school, maybe they had to make other considerations. So they were forced not because of their lack of good work but because they were just serving in that capacity for 5 years. And those who were close to retirement, it significantly impacted their retirement, their pensions, and it's wrong. 
   There's a small number of agents that we can fix with this proposal that takes care of those agents who have served us all well. While we were sleeping, they were working. While we were in the safety of our barbecues, they were in danger protecting this country. 
   We owe it to them to have these two fixed. It's agreed to by the FBI director. It's agreed to by the FBI. We just need to get some language in to accomplish that. I would urge support of this amendment.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, this certainly seems to me a change in policy. This is a straight transfer. Now, the other two amendments I understand we may have something to chat about, but this is a straight dollar transfer. We have reduced one account and increased another account. It is a straight transfer and should be considered made in order.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, distinguished Chair of the Appropriations Committee, I hope we can work this issue out. This is language that was agreed last year by both parties to take care of two, I think, very important fixes for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
   We have a segment of agents who are being punished, for lack of a better term, for not choosing to come back to Washington, DC. They have served their countries ably. They have served their tours as brick agents and worked the streets, and kicked in doors, and arrested drug dealers and mobsters, and gone after terrorists, and done all that hard work that we ask them to do every single day. Unselfishly, so, they have done it. 
   Through that course, they have decided to be supervisors and pick an area of expertise. In this particular case, they have picked a supervisory specialty that might be white collar crime, or it might be organized crime, or it might be counterterrorism or it might be foreign counterintelligence. That expertise allows them to lead these agents to better investigations. 
   In a new policy implemented by the FBI Director, these fairly senior agents, it asked them to step aside if they chose not to come back to Washington, D.C. Some of them had their kids in high school. 
   You can imagine being in Des Moines, Iowa, close to home, and you have got 18 or 19 years of Federal service, maybe they are former military before that. They have got lots of Federal service, looking to move on in a few years. That is a hard choice for them to make. In doing so, it cost them that added benefit to their pension for serving in a leadership capacity in the FBI. 
   So what we simply did is last summer worked out some language with the FBI Director that said we were not going to let these 200 or so agents be punished by this new policy. They deserved to have that pension at the rate of service which they have ably given their country. Again, this language was agreed to by both parties last year, but because this was a continuing resolution and it was dropped in conference, we did not have that opportunity to get this fixed. 
   The second part of that, which I can talk to in the second amendment, is also about a housing allowance that would allow agents, for the first time, like other Federal agencies working in major cities across the United States, to enjoy a housing allowance in these very high-cost areas, so that we can keep, retain and really say thank you to the hardest working FBI agents who are working to protect the homeland. 
   With that, I would hope that the chairman and I could work this through and try to find some conclusion to what we have already agreed to needs to get fixed for these people, who, by the way, have already been told their pensions will be fixed, and yet to this date have not. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, I thought this amendment was in order. But, in that vein, I thought I heard the chairman say that he would be willing to work with us maybe in conference and we could find some language that might be acceptable to the chairman where we could kind of conclude this deal that I think we all have agreed to in the past, that maybe we can work out that language in the conference.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member. 
   And the gentleman from Minnesota, I compliment you on your efforts here. It is important that we meet America's water needs all across the country. 
   I do have some reservations, however. My family owns a small construction company, and that is about the worst business you can be in in a State like Michigan where the economy is struggling. And they hire some union employees, not because the law tells them they have to do that but because they happen to find that their union subcontractors are the best ones to complete their job. 
   But what you have done in this bill is not for a prevailing wage and empowering people to make more money, you have stopped a whole segment of our society from even competing to get these jobs. There are hundreds and hundreds of regs and comments on how you compute Davis-Bacon. If you were going to go back and say, we will rework this thing so the average American understands what it is, we might be with you. 
   But the problem is, they can't afford consultants and lawyers. They can't hire people full time just to figure out the regulations so that they might be able to compete to fill out the application to compete for the bid. They are small, and there are a lot of small businesses. 
   What you are saying to the 80 percent of the entrepreneurs across America who are small business owners who are generating 80 percent of the growth in our economy, 80 percent: You don't qualify. We're sorry. Go get yourself a lawyer and a fancy accountant and spend a lot of money you don't have, and maybe you will have an opportunity to get a job if you can figure out the hundreds of pages of regulations and comments to comply with Davis-Bacon. 
   So it is not that you are going to get more on these projects, and I think your intentions are absolutely right, and I want to be with you because it is the right thing to do. But the problem is, it is not just going to cost more, you are going to get less. So the more money you put in means it is going to cost more, but we will get less pipe in the ground than if we had allowed a free market and the small entrepreneurs, who are creating jobs in America, to even have the chance to compete. Rules and regulations, taxation and litigation never met with prosperity. It has slowed us down, and it has slowed the small guy, the little guy, the people that you claim you want to support, from even competing. 
   I would hope that we could get over our differences on this particular issue and set it aside. We know that we want money to go to water infrastructure in rural America. Let's let them do that. Let's take this out. Let's let the little guy compete. Let's let that small entrepreneur who is working 7 days a week and doesn't know if they are  going to have enough money to pay the light bill, let alone take a salary this particular month in places like Michigan, let them compete. Let's take this divisive piece out of it. It won't change what you are wanting to do. That is the thing. 
   If you take this out, small America wins. Let's do that and stand together and be for water infrastructure around the United States.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, it is a three-legged stool if we are going to get to energy independence. It is alternatives fuels, which there is great promise. There is also the expansion of refineries. We knew that early, and if we were going to have a stable supply and cheaper prices, we needed more refining capability in America. And it was domestic production. You need all three so that we do not send more money to Ahmadinejad and Chavez. 
   Political theater is what we see here today. A bill that did not go through the committee process gives you this. 
   I agree, giving $400 million to a CEO of which they had no material stake in a company is wrong, but what is worse is giving more money to the very people who are targeting the United States and seek our destruction. 
   Do not fool yourself. This is where this money is going. You make it more expensive to refine gasoline in the United States, this bill does it, they will buy it offshore. You make it more expensive to produce energy in the United States, they will buy it offshore. 
   These will be the recipients of these dollars. Let us take this bill back and go do it the right way. We can come together on renewable energy. Michigan State University is doing great work on cellulosic research, so we can get to that next generation of ethanol that burns efficiently in American-made automobiles. But we cannot do it if we are sending money to the very people that seek our destruction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would strongly urge that we have a little common sense, we close the curtain to this political theater and we get back to the reality of what our policies will really mean for the future of this country. If you care about your children, stop sending the money to Ahmadinejad and Chavez.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise reluctantly today to point out something that I think is incredibly important. The ag work that you have all done is important, and agriculture is certainly an important part of our American economy. And our ability to feed ourselves is critical to our national security. 
   But we also have another national security issue of which we cannot get the attention that it so deserves. After 9/11, we put together these commissions, the 9/11 Commission, to say, Hey, what went wrong? 
   We decided we would merge a whole department together and call it the Department of Homeland Security to best meet the needs and safety and security of the homeland. We did all of these things in preparation for what we knew was likely to occur, and that is certainly another attempt by terrorists to attack the United States of America. 
   And one of the things that we did through all of that is said we have to give law enforcement, our intelligence services, every tool that we can find to make America safe, because we have asked a lot of them. 
   We have said we want you to go to the most dangerous places in the world and find bad guys and stop terrorist plots against the homeland. We told our FBI to work long hours and weekends, spending a lot of time away from their families, to make sure that no terrorist plot is successful in the United States of America. 
   But today, we allow more conversations between known terrorists overseas talking to known or unknown terrorists overseas to go unheard because of a quirk in the law. We have been asking day after day, week after week, month after month, please, for the safety and security of the United States of America, let's have the courage to fix this law so we can protect America. 
   Right now and today, there is a terrorist conversation happening overseas that we are not allowing our law enforcement, our intelligence services, to monitor. Overseas, with non-United States citizens. I was an FBI agent for about 6 years, and I understand and appreciate the probable cause standard of which we engage to American citizens, and it is right that we do that. It is right that it is difficult to get a warrant to intercept their conversations because that is who we are in America and we should cherish it for our citizens. 
   But to tell them that we expect them to stop terrorist attacks against America, and we allow all of these known conversations to go unlistened to at a time when we know that they are heightening up to do something is irresponsible, if not criminal. 
   This is important what you talk about. This is more important. We should not leave this Chamber today, tomorrow, or at the end of the week without fixing this critical national security problem to the United States of America. It is wrong. We have soldiers in harm's way. We have intelligence officials in harm's way. We have domestic law enforcement in harm's way. Let's stand with them today, defeat this rule, fix this problem, and move on to the other important issues of the day. It is that important. 
   And don't kid ourselves. We cannot kid ourselves, Madam Speaker. This is that serious. You know, when a very distinguished member of the Cabinet stands up and says ``I have a gut feeling,'' that is not a gut feeling. It is based on a whole series of pieces of information that doesn't say when or where or what, but it says something is happening. There is a ramp-up. There is lots of activity; there is lots of chatter. Something is going on, and yet we stand here blinded. We can't hear. We are not allowing them to see where the trouble is next brewing. It is wrong. We need to fix it. 
   We should stand in unanimity today and defeat the previous question so that we can fix this problem and move on and keep America safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this is really almost going beyond the pale of irresponsible and getting into dangerous. 
   I used to be an FBI agent, and every day in this country there is an FBI agent who goes up to somebody, an average citizen, it may be a coworker, it may be a neighbor, it may be somebody who owns a small business, it might be somebody who owns a big business, and says, We need your cooperation to catch child pornographers, and here is the evidence. Will you cooperate with your Nation? And we do it every single day, and great Americans stand up every single day and say, Yes, I will. I will go after child pornographers with you. I will go after crack dealers selling the drugs to our kids with you. I will go after murderers who murder our children in the streets of America, and I will stand with you and cooperate so we can eliminate the dangers from our communities. 
   And you know what the government did? It went and said, Hey, to whatever business it was, small, big, large, we had people kill 3,000 people, murdered, on one day. And you know what, they are coming back. Will you cooperate with your government to stop the next round of murders? 
   But we play a very dangerous game. It is about civil liberties. Then why did we pass the bill before, and before that? Because there is civil liberty protection in this bill. It is a farce. 
   What is at risk here is the future certainty by our intelligence agencies and every single American who wonders: If I cooperate against a criminal of any sort, a terrorist, are they coming to get me next? 
   We need to refocus on who the bad guys are. It is not the companies who cooperated with their government. If you are a small business selling insurance or you are washing windows, it is the terrorists who threaten the lives of Americans. 
   We ought to be proud of every American who has the courage in a dangerous world to stand up and say: I will stand with you, United States of America, to get the true enemy, the bad guys, al Qaeda, terrorists, crack dealers, child pornographers, and everybody in between. 
   I urge the strong rejection of this rule, and let's get back to business and give them the tools to keep us safe.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have such great respect for my fellow colleague and Michigander, Mr. Conyers, for his work and passionate belief and where he stands. 
   I do worry about where we're at. And I hear the gentleman talk about the fact that we just don't have time, and we need more time. You know, today we're going to spend hours and hours grilling a professional baseball player about he said/she said activities in professional baseball. We spent an entire day on this floor this year trying to figure out how we're going to designate scenic trails in New England; 162 bills commemorating someone or something, 162 on the floor this year; 62 bills naming post offices. 
   I think, if we put this in perspective, this isn't about needing more time. This isn't about that. We've obviously wasted a lot of time. 
   Our Constitution, as so many people point to, says some pretty clear things to me. It makes sure that you stand tall and you take an oath to defend against all enemies, foreign and domestic. It's one of the most important things that we do in this body. 
   If we can find time to put Roger Clemens in a chair and grill him for hours and make a media circus about professional baseball, you'd think we could spend a few minutes protecting the United States of America. Instead what we do is we kind of fool around and wring our hands and say, I'm for national security but kind of, not really. But, hey, did you see these jangly keys? Professional baseball could be in trouble. It maybe works for my kids when they were 3 and in trouble, but it doesn't work for the American people, and it certainly doesn't work to keep us safe. 
   This isn't about the Constitution. Many of your Members came down here and said, we think this is unconstitutional, but give us 3 more weeks of unconstitutionality in the United States. If I believed that, as a former FBI agent, I wouldn't vote for it. It's wrong. 
   This is about white hats and black hats. It's about good guys and bad guys. It's about Good Samaritans. You know, there are ads on TV today where they go into high crime neighborhoods and say, It's okay for you to tell on criminal behavior. Please call the police. Please call the FBI. Please make a difference in your community. 
   Think of the confusing message we are sending today because we're hooked up on the size of the company. So if I go in as an FBI agent to find the address that a pizza delivery company has for a fugitive, should we go after them, too? Should we go after that pizza delivery guy for, out of the goodness of his heart, telling us where there is a fugitive who may have committed murder or have committed child pornography or been selling drugs and is in violation of the safety and security of his neighborhood, his community? No, of course not. And we shouldn't punish people who say, listen, I want to help the United States catch terrorists and murderers, and if you ask me and I'm in lawful possession of it, I'll share it with you. We do it in banks. We do it in small businesses. We knock on neighbors' doors every day in this country and say, Help us help protect your neighborhood, your kids and your family. Will you tell us what you saw? Will you tell us what you know? Will you tell us where this information leads us to? It happens every day. 
   This is about black hats and white hats, good guys and bad guys. Let's make sure we stand up today for every courageous American who stands up for the safety of the community of this United States. I don't care how big or  how small they are, we ought to stand with them and not make them the enemy.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this is the trouble when you introduce bills to hurt somebody, to try to punish somebody. When the Democrats took over a couple of years ago, they said they had a secret plan they were going to lower gas prices. The problem was the plan was deeply rooted in punishing average Americans. 
   If you drive a minivan, you are bad, and you are wrong. If you use electricity at home, you are wrong. If you commute more than 40 miles to work, you are wrong. So you have developed a plan that punishes them, and we are seeing the impact of that in every community in this country. 
   Single moms are having a difficult time packing their kids up. They have got to be at three events, they have got to pay for child care. They have got to stop and get gas to get them there. What they said is, you are wrong. You are wrong for working that hard. 
   What this bill does is it says ``no'' to more than it says ``yes.'' You want to hurt somebody so bad, oil companies, Alaskans, middle-class families. You are in such a hurry to do that, you have created a bill that hurts them more. 
   If you go home and try to put your kids on the Internet to do their homework, it will raise their monthly bill. If you cook their food on the stove, it will raise their monthly bill. If you put food in the refrigerator, this bill will raise their monthly bill. 
   It does nothing to help middle-class families. This is a slap in their face. 
   You say no to biomass, no to coal, no to shale oil, no to nuclear because you don't like it. This bill makes it easier for China to drill off our coast than it does for American companies to produce American-made energy. 
   This is not an energy bill for average Americans. I am a small-town guy. I plead with you, come to small-town America, see what these provisions, these plans are doing to average Americans in the middle class. It's killing them. 
   Don't punish America. Unleash the resources that we have to help America.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, simply just to answer this distinguished chairman and friend and distinguished colleague from Michigan, reverse targeting is not in this bill. It is not in this bill. 
   When I was a young FBI agent, this whole thing started a lot differently. We had to target the phone. We didn't target the individual. We targeted the phone. So we had to develop a probable cause case on the phone that an individual was using, that phone, that bit of copper wire, to further a criminal enterprise and have criminal discussions. Think about how long ago that was and how the world has changed. And the big thing for us, by the way, was to get a pay phone, where they would change pay phones because they were trying to outsmart us. They'd go to one pay phone and go to the other one, and if we didn't have a warrant on that other pay phone, couldn't listen to them even though we knew what the heck they were doing on that phone. We had to go back to the court, develop probable cause on that particular phone. You can see how technology even then started to get ahead of us a little bit. 
   Then we realized in America we got really smart and we said, hey, wait a minute, it's not the phone that's the criminal. It's the bad guy. Let's target the bad guy. So, if he goes to phone A or phone B or phone C, it shouldn't matter. We know that he's the bad guy using those instruments to further their criminal enterprise. 
   That's what we did, and we all did, and you did that. When I was an agent, you passed those laws and they were good. They were good laws and they helped us keep abreast of technology and changes and changing in criminal activity. 
   Think about today, prepaid phones. If I'm a terrorist, I buy a thousand of them. I don't ever use the same phone again. It means we have to be that much better. 
   And what this bill does, what the bill yesterday did not do, is make it technology neutral. Everyone got up last night and said this is about foreign-to-foreign. We don't care about that, but the bill and the language as it was written did, and it put technology in there. So now you had some FBI agent trying to figure out how do I catch this guy, because not that I don't know he's a bad guy and I can prove it to the judge, but because of the kind of technology he's using. 
   It took us right back into the 1970s and 1980s when we had to scratch our head and we came to Congress and said don't do that to us. 
   Yesterday, you're saying we're going to do it to you again, and it's wrong. And I guess I'm so disappointed. I know you hate the Attorney General and I know you hate the President of the United States, but don't you love soldiers? Don't you love people who are risking their lives to catch terrorists? Of course you do, and I know you do.     
   This bill helps us protect them so they can protect us. Right now there are billions, and I mean billions of conversations and communications every single day, and I mean billions. There is nothing in this bill that circumvents a United States citizen's right to the fourth amendment protections, nothing, nothing. It protects them. 
   What we are trying to say is, let us, let the intelligence community go overseas. 
   May I have an additional 30 seconds? 
   This bill is an important step to protect us to bring technology to the point where we don't make agents and officers worry about foreign-to-foreign communications between terrorists we ought to be listening to. The court should not be involved. America believes it. I know my colleagues believe it too. 
   Pass this bill.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to cut right to the chase. We have so little time. 
   I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   You know, the New York Times highlighted in an investigation in May, the global and deadly epidemic of counterfeit drugs. Counterfeit product diethylene glycol, an industrial solvent ingredient in antifreeze, found its way into cough medicine on our shelves. It was traced from Panama, through Spain, from China, all countries that would be permitted under this bill. 
   We must remember how dangerous this is. And I understand everybody's intention to try to lower drug prices to our seniors. That's critically important. 
   But what we are doing is throwing open the gates to every counterfeiter in the world, and the top five countries, China, Russia, India, Colombia, the other countries who are trying purposely to adulterate our prescription drug safety in the United States of America. 
   Seventy years ago the same diethylene glycol killed more than 100 people in the United States. That's why we have the FDA today. And guess what? It just happened again in May. 
   This is the wrong time to throw away all of those institutional years that we've developed to protect our drug supply in America. And I want to quickly show, and I apologize for the speed here, Mr. Chairman, but we have so little time on such an issue that is so important to the United States of America. 
   This is one of the facilities that was making drugs in China. How many of you would ask your mother to take a drug coming out of this facility? None of you. None of you would do it. And it's wrong for us just to throw it open for a political gamesmanship to say we're going to try to lower drugs. It's dangerous. 
   Aricept, to treat Alzheimer's disease, was found to be counterfeit. And it looks unbelievably uncanny like the real thing. Let me show you real quickly. Look, you cannot tell the difference. Are you going to ask an Alzheimer's patient to tell the difference between the real and the counterfeit?  
   And guess what? This isn't 70 years ago. This is today. They're trying to do this today. I cannot tell you how dangerous this is. We should take the opportunity to undo this and go back and use common sense. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the gentleman from Arizona's amendment to cut funding for the USDA grant for Wood Utilization Research. 
   For the past 15 years, Michigan State University and other universities have used grants for Wood Utilization Research to strengthen and improve the United States wood product  industry. Jointly, these universities have addressed major problems in all of the forest regions of the United States. This collaboration has provided important advances that have helped to make our wood product industry more competitive around the globe, and our forests healthier here at home. Specifically, grant funding has been used to expand sustainable, environmentally sound forest practices and develop renewable wood-based materials. 
   The United States wood products industry is fragmented and composed of many small firms whose only access to advanced technology is through government or university laboratories. A major benefit of the USDA Wood Utilization grant has been the flexibility of universities to rapidly respond to critical regional or national research needs. In addition, the availability of grant funding has leveraged additional funds from state and private sources. 
   Michigan State University, located in Michigan's 8th District, continues to be a leader in this vital research. Today, they are performing research on wood materials that will shape the future of this industry for years to come. Projects include the conversion of wood residuals into biofuels, the development of environmentally safe preservative systems to lengthen the life of wood products (thus lessening the demand for harvest), the creation of wood materials that can substitute petroleum-based plastics, and the utilization of trees killed by emerald ash borer. Many of these projects will help reduce our nation's dependence on foreign sources of petroleum, create manufacturing and research jobs, and further strengthen our wood product industry. 
   Mr. Chairman, this research grant is critically important not only for Michigan State University and my district, but clearly for the United States wood product industry and our national energy needs. I thank the Committee for funding the grant, and I urge my colleagues to oppose this dangerous amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to be here, and I appreciate the bipartisan spirit in which this debate is conducted and why this is just a bad idea. 
   Many of us come to this microphone, to this well, through our conclusions from a whole variety of backgrounds and interests. I think back, not all that long ago, when I had a good friend in town, and we had a great philosophical debate about organized gambling coming to his town. And he was all for it. He had been, I think, the third generation of a great restaurant in that town. It was very well known, well known all over the State, and he said it would boost his business. Well, about 2 years after that casino landed in that town, he closed his doors. I think it was in his family for decades. It broke his heart. There was trembling in his voice when we had a conversation over the phone. Because, when organized gambling comes to your town, there are very few who will make a whole bunch, and there are a whole bunch who will lose a lot. 
   And it is not the economic tool that people profess. Study after study after study clearly shows there is more net loss, that there is more cannibalization of small businesses around these organized gambling casinos than there is success and benefit that happens inside. 
   Certainly, the local governments that house them love it; it means cash to them. That's great. But at what price? And we really need to stop ourselves and ask, at what price?     
   We already have more casinos in Michigan than we have public universities. And this isn't about fairness for this tribe. This tribe has seven casinos already, $400 million in revenue. And what they are asking to do is something unprecedented. The Federal court ruled against them. The State court ruled against them. But they said let's go around all of those things, including a 2004 referendum by the State of Michigan that said enough is enough, we're going to cap it right here at what we have. They went around all of those things, and it's like putting a casino from a tribe in Washington, DC in Cleveland and saying, ``This is part of our heritage, you need to help us.'' That's not what this is. This is about organized gambling and putting it in a place where they think they can make more than the $400 million in revenue they are already making. 
   I just plead with this House and this Congress don't set this precedent. And I don't care if they say it in the bill or not, it is a precedent. And every community in America will wake up one day and say we can do this too. We can come to Congress. We can show up and go around our States and our legislatures and our people and the courts, and we'll go to Congress too and get special treatment to have an organized gambling casino in a neighborhood near you. 
   A lot of people speak for both sides of this issue, but very few will speak for the folks who will lose everything when these casinos come to town. 
   I plead with this House not to do this. It's not the right thing to do. We know it's not the right thing to do. I encourage all of us to vote ``no'' on the rule and vote ``no'' on the subsequent legislation.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, two problems with where we're going: one is, this will, in effect, require intelligence officials to seek a Federal court warrant for foreign targets overseas. That is undeniable. Everybody in the intelligence community says it. The Senate even came across in a bipartisan bill, led by Democrats, who agree to the same principle and said that's the wrong direction to go to protect America. 
   The other serious problem: one of your great distinguished Members, ELIJAH CUMMINGS, took a courageous stand in a courageous moment when he had serious crime in his district in Baltimore. He went out, went on TV on a PSA and said, please cooperate with the local police to solve this crime. Please step up and cooperate so that we can solve these crimes together. 
   What we are effectively doing today, we're effectively telling businesses, large and small, and citizens from neighborhoods to corporate citizens to individual citizens, everybody who every day across America says, I will cooperate with law enforcement to solve crime because it's the right thing to do, you send an absolute chilling effect across. And I've heard this from businesses not related to this particular issue, telecom companies, companies who cooperate on kidnappings, companies that cooperate on trying to find people who are fugitives, who have raped children, people who cooperate on catching drug dealers. They've said, you know, if you show up and ask me that, I want to help. But what this body is telling them, you might not be protected. It might not be just enough. And if you have enough money, and we have enough trial lawyers, you're going to find yourself in court. 
   So what these people are saying is, maybe I can't cooperate with my government anymore. Maybe I can't, in good faith, like good Samaritans have done all 200-plus years of this great Nation, come forward and say we are in this together. We are united to stop crime, to keep our homes and neighborhoods safe and to protect our country from terrorism. 
   The CIA case also said it's not good. The military leader said it's dangerous,  the intelligence community said it's dangerous, and so did the Democrats in the Senate. Let's join them and do this right.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, a letter recently from the NAACP says: We strongly support maintaining adequate funding for the Medicare Advantage program that serves as a critical funding for accessing health care services, particularly for low-income and minority Medicare beneficiaries. 
   Talk about what's in the bill. Don't use children as your shield. This is the single largest cut to Medicare in the program's history. Absolutely, it is, and let me tell you what you are cutting. Read the bill. 
   You're cutting stroke victims from inpatient rehab. You're cutting doctors. You're cutting oxygen equipment and wheelchair services to seniors. You're cutting seniors' home health care, cutting hospital payments, cutting skilled nursing care for the sickest seniors in nursing homes. You're cutting dialysis services for kidney cancer patients. You're cutting imaging services for cancer and cardiac patients. 
   The list goes on. You're telling seniors once we slash the Medicare Advantage payments, we're going to push you on to part B, and guess what, your premiums are going up. We can work this out. 
   This was a Republican-generated idea when it started, SCHIP, to include those 200 percent or below of children in poverty, and I will tell you that there's not one thing that helps those kids under 200 percent of poverty, and you will get more of illegal immigrants at the expense of seniors. This is a bad bill.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I think the thing that surprises me the most on this is the lack of honesty on this bill, and I think to the credit of many of my friends on the other side of the aisle, I don't think you've been told what's in this bill. 
   This isn't about poor, uninsured children. My dad used to say, if a salesman comes to you and talks about the needs of his kids before he talks about the quality of his product, beware; you're getting sold a bill of goods. 
   That's exactly what has happened today and in the previous days and why they don't want to talk about the bill, why they don't want amendments. 
   Why? It's the single largest cut in Medicare's program history. You are cutting Medicare to millions of seniors. I wouldn't want to talk about it either. 
   And what else are you doing? You're cutting stroke victims when they're in in-patient rehab. Stroke victims, our seniors, are going to cut that. Doctors, you're cutting doctors. You're cutting oxygen equipment and wheelchair services to seniors. You're cutting seniors' home health care. You're cutting hospital payments. You're cutting skilled nursing care for the sickest seniors in nursing homes. You're cutting dialysis services for kidney cancer patients. You're cutting imaging services for cancer and cardiac patients. 
   You're telling businesses we're going to make it more expensive for you to give health care to the working poor.     
   You are doing that in this bill. I bet many of you don't even know that. You are also telling seniors, by the way, once we slash the largest in history amount of money out of Medicare, your part B premiums are going up. We're going to make it more expensive for you. Less doctors taking Medicare patients, higher small business costs, higher Medicare premiums, not one dollar for the 700,000 under 200 percent of poverty who need our help. 
   Shame on you.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I too want to congratulate Dr. Vern Ehlers of Michigan who has spent a great portion of his career in the United States Congress championing our Great Lakes. They are truly our Nation's jewel that we in the north don't think we get enough credit for helping protect. I know the Speaker understands exactly what I am talking about, being a part of that Great Lakes basin.     
   And now I think if you watch the speeches on the floor today, that the rest of America will see why we become so feisty about water diversion and invasive species and contaminants going into our Great Lakes, and why, in a bipartisan way, we stand on this floor today to celebrate what has been done, what this bill will do, and the future health of the Great Lakes for future Americans. 
   I too grew up in the Great Lakes region and remember the warnings of no fishing and no wall eye fishing in Lake St. Claire when I was growing up, and how devastated we were to think that you couldn't even go out and put your line in the water and take that fish home without some horrible thing happening to you. 
   Well, we've come a long way since then, and I think we've all gotten a lot smarter on how we protect these lakes. And it goes just beyond what is good for the Great Lakes Basin. Currently it provides water to 42 million people in America. Nearly 30 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product is produced in the Great Lakes region. 
   The Great Lakes States have 3.7 million registered recreational boats, a third of the Nation's total. The commercial sport and fishing industry is collectively valued at more than $4 billion annually. Unfortunately, years of  industrial pollution have spread toxic sediments throughout the Great Lakes, and this bill directly confronts and cleans up those polluted and degraded areas. 
   This act has had an enormous impact on the citizens of Michigan and their communities. In Michigan alone, hundreds of thousands of pounds of dangerous contaminants have already been removed and safely disposed of. Of the 31 areas of concern in U.S. waters, four projects have already been completed, one project is underway, and six are currently being monitored and evaluated. This program is extremely workable and has been named one of the most effective Federal clean-up programs we have. 
   Since 2004, the EPA estimates that almost 1 million cubic yards of contaminated sediments have been removed from our Great Lakes tributaries. These sediments are filled with toxic substances such as mercury, arsenic, chromium, cadmium, polychlorinates (PCBs), and lead. 
   This really stands as our legacy to the next generation of Americans who will enjoy the Great Lakes, and it is an investment in the health of those Great Lakes for a prosperous, clean future of the Great Lakes basin. We have to pass this Great Lakes Legacy Act and continue the investment in the Great Lakes so that future generations will experience the lakes as we know them today.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, this is a pretty important debate, and I have to tell you I am a little confused by my friends' resolution. It is a very complex problem. 
   When you look at the problem in Iraq today, you have really two distinct problems. One is the ethnosectarian violence that is self-sustaining now in Baghdad. It was a precursor to al Qaeda activity to actually create conflict between the Sunnis and the Shias, and unfortunately, it has raised to a level that it is self-sustaining. 
   And you have an al Qaeda-Sunni insurgency happening west of Baghdad that certainly warrants our attention, and the troops there have called for reinforcements. They said, give us reinforcements, we need them badly. Al Qaeda is settling in to make safe haven here. 
   And part of the plan or the surge in fact says that we are going to reinforce those soldiers who are fighting al Qaeda, and they have asked to be reinforced. 
   The simplicity of the resolution concerns me greatly. I am not in favor of sending American troops, the other 16,000, into the streets of Baghdad to intervene in the sectarian violence. I am not. 
   I am in favor of supporting the soldiers who have asked and should receive reinforcements fighting al Qaeda in the west. 
   This resolution really makes no difference in that fight. It makes no difference in the complexities and how we win and get our soldiers home. This resolution does not bring one soldier home. This resolution does not make one soldier safer. This resolution does not bring to justice one terrorist. This resolution offers not one alternative. 
   I think we made some devastating mistakes in Iraq: The extent of our de-Baathification, and what that has meant for us winning the peace, the dismissal wholesale of military units and what that has meant to our ability to sustain peace, the shuttering of nearly 300 state-owned enterprises and what that has done for unemployment and not allowing us to sustain the peace, our failure to focus our national power on solving some of these basic problems. 
   We, in fact, and this is up to us, have allowed politics to creep onto the field of battle, and that has created some very real problems for us and our soldiers. We have seen, because of that politics that has crept into the battlefield in Iraq and what that has meant, it has created some inefficiencies. I, the other day, have counted up 12 different groups or agencies or Departments that have some ability to provide reconstruction money in Iraq. Twelve. That is a problem. 
   Some conflicting policies. Our soldiers will tell you that they feel that they are handcuffed. They at least have one hand cuffed behind their back because of the politics that have crept in  that changed the way they are allowed to engage the enemy as they see him and protect themselves. Politics crept onto the battlefield. 
   The turf battles between the State Department and DOD, I wish they didn't exist. We all know they do. We took a very large, bureaucratic, civilian organization and set it down in the middle of Baghdad and wondered why it has some inefficiencies. But these are things that we can change. We can do that. 
   And my mother told me that if you are going to tell me what I am doing wrong, you better be prepared to tell me how to do it right. 
   The resolution before us today says nothing of an alternative. We have soldiers who are getting up every day engaging themselves in the fight for liberty and defense and going after al Qaeda targets in the west and trying to find al Qaeda elements locating and spurring on to self-sustaining ethno sectarian violence. It does nothing to tell them that we, A, support them and, B, will give them all the tools and make the changes that we know we can to make it possible for them to come home to their families soon. 
   This afternoon I am going to do that. I am introducing a resolution, it is fairly comprehensive, that will allow us to focus our national power without sending 20,000 troops to Iraq. It will help target the unemployment that we know is fueling terrorism in Iraq today. Clear rules of engagement for our troops, calling for the repatriation of the one to two million Iraqis who are middle class Iraqis, their doctors and lawyers and engineers and their teachers who fled Iraq in this turmoil to engage our allies to get them back and invest them in the future of Iraq. 
   What disturbs me most, Mr. Speaker, about this resolution, is its clear purpose is to divide those of us in this Chamber. 
   As I said earlier, I don't support the surge in Iraq that targets sectarian violence in Baghdad. I think that must have an Iraqi face for that to be successful, and I think we can provide logistics and command and control and we can provide combat air support and special operation support to make them successful as they move through Iraq. I think we can do that. 
   But this resolution does nothing to bring Members together to solve this problem. If you win this vote today, and this passes, we will have solved not one problem for one soldier who gets up this morning hoping and praying that he can accomplish his mission and come home to his family, not one. It truly seeks to find the differences of those of us in this Chamber on how we move forward in Iraq. There is nothing constructive in that, nothing constructive in that. 
   There is a young soldier that I met, I visited him down in Brooks Army Medical Center. He asked that his leg be amputated so that he could have full range of motion so he could pass the physical training test for the United States Army and go back to Iraq. And he was going through all that very painful process of getting it fitted and going through the physical training and trying to rehabilitate himself. 
   And as I got ready to leave, I said, is there anything that I can do for you as a Member of Congress? And he turned and said yes, sir, there is. Just don't give up on us. 
   Now, if this soldier can believe in this mission, and he can get up every day and fight through the sweat and the pain and the anguish of a lost limb so that he can get back in the business, if he can roll up his pant leg every day and fit that prosthesis, isn't there a way, and shouldn't we do better and roll up our sleeves to work together to find a solution? We got in this together, we must get out of it together. 
   We need to stop the division that this resolution brings to this House and start working together. Our soldiers deserve better. America deserves better. The future of this country and safety and security deserve better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in the majority today because in this bill you effectively kill our opportunity to talk about FISA and the renewal of our opportunity to listen to foreign terrorists talking to foreign terrorists overseas. And it's intellectually not honest with the American people if you don't tell them what you're doing, because it's dangerous. It's really dangerous. 
   This is day 11, day 11 that you're starting to slowly turn off our ability to listen to bad guys plotting to kill Americans and to kill our allies overseas, men, women, children, Christians, Jews and Muslims. The danger of this is very real and very palpable. 
   They passed a bipartisan bill in the Senate and said this is urgent; let's do it. Two weeks ago, the Director of the ODNI came out and said, this is important. 
   We've often said here we should listen to our commanders in the field. They are screaming at the top of their lungs, give us this authority so we can continue to keep America safe. 
   I heard some argument that, gee, we can just listen if we want and we can come to the FISA Court if we want. 
   I used to be an FBI agent. It took me 9 months to develop the probable cause on my first case to get a criminal title III, which is the same as a FISA, to listen to somebody's conversations. And it should be that hard. It should be that hard for United States citizens. They deserve that protection under our Constitution. 
   But what you're saying is you think that those overseas criminals, a criminal in Pakistan, a terrorist plotting to kill Americans, making a phone call from Pakistan that ends up in Saudi Arabia, we ought to say, well, wait a minute; we need to come all the way back to the court, we need to work up probable cause and try to figure out if we ought to be listening to that conversation. 
   No American out there, including the majority of the Senate and I think the majority in this Chamber, believes that's the right standard to keep America safe. This is dangerous. 
   Now I know you're down here with the jangly keys theory and thinking, if we just distract them long enough they'll think this is about big oil companies and all of that mess. This is about the majority killing our opportunity to give this tool, this authority which they have used responsibly to make sure that we don't have attacks against Americans here. 
   What does a majority of the Senate and a majority of this House see that the majority leadership does not? What won't they see, and why won't they tell the American people what they're doing? 
   It's day 11. Every day that goes by we are in jeopardy of attack. 
   I will guarantee you this today. There is somebody picking up some electronic instrument to communicate what plan they may have to kill Americans or, as I said before, our allies, or Christians or Jews or Muslims. 
   What will it take for the majority to stand up and stop politicking on the lives of Americans, our allies and every global person, to stand up and say we will stand for the defense of the United States and its allies and we will stop terrorists in their tracks? 
   I would urge the strong rejection of this rule.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I rise with a little bit of apprehension today, but this is really a horrible way to do what we're trying to do today, and we've known that every year certainly since I have been a Member of Congress. I think this is my eighth time trying to fix what is really a bad system of telling doctors every year you're going to be cut unless we do something. A horrible system. I think we all agree we have to do something. 
   But something really spectacular happened today and I don't think in a good way. For the first time since I've been in Congress, we've decided that we're going to fix it as we have every single year since I have been here except we are going to cut senior citizens off from their programs in Medicare, for the first time since I have been here, and that we're going to do that today. And I scratch my head a little bit. We have always been able to come together in a bipartisan way and say we can fix it for the doctors without taking it out of the seniors. We don't have to punish the patients to help the doctors. And I know they can get on planes and they are doing okay financially and they can fly here and lobby us and talk to us and get in our ears, and that's important. And you know what? They should. Because every single year we tell them don't invest in your company because we are not going to tell you their business, their business of providing medical services. Don't invest in that because we're not sure if we are going to cut you 10 percent or give you 2 percent. Pretty hard to make that investment decision to go to health information technology that we know will save lives or add a new staff member that they know they might be not able to pay for if we don't get our act together, which tells us why this system is so horrible. But because we failed to act, this Congress failed to act, I think the provision starts tomorrow with a 10 percent cut. We said 2 million poor seniors in this country, you're going to get a letter in the mail that says you no longer have service under Medicare Advantage. Think about the fear and the confusion. Do we have to do that? Is that the best that we can do here in this Chamber and call it a bipartisan effort? 
   Ten million seniors depend on Medicare Advantage. They voluntarily signed up. And after this bill, 200,000 of them that live in Michigan will have fewer choices, reduced benefits, higher out-of-pocket costs. 
   Half of the Medicare Advantage enrollees have incomes below $20,000 a year. Imagine the fear when your electric bills are going up because we haven't done anything here in this Congress, when your gasoline prices are over $4 and maybe your kids don't even come to see you anymore. But, oh, by the way, we are going to give you this letter and we are going to celebrate that in a bipartisan way we have stood up and said the heck with you, you're going to have to deal with it on your own, you 10 million seniors. Can't we do better? I think we can. 
   So when the President vetoed this, it wasn't about mean spiritedness and taking things away and we're not going to help those seniors. It was about please renegotiate. If for the last 7 years we could come together and say we can help you doctors without punishing you senior citizen patients, why can't we do that today? It's the first time that we have had to do that since I have been in Congress. I know we can do better. And when you're done, think of this: Fully 70 percent are minorities making under $20,000 on Medicare Advantage.

   Please, sustain the President's veto. It doesn't mean it's over. It means we get to negotiate a bill that protect doctors, as they should, allows them to make investments in the future of health information technology and other things without facing a 20 percent cut. By the way, if we did nothing, it would be a 15 percent cut by the end of next year. Because of this bill, it's a 20 percent cut. 
   We have to do better. I will vote to sustain. I would urge you to sustain the President's veto.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I first want to thank JOHN DINGELL, a friend and colleague and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, for working with us on putting together what I think is a great product, and really the first opportunity we are going to have in Michigan, I think the first really good opportunity to say ``no'' to Canadian trash. And for that, sir, I thank you. And Mr. Wynn, sir, thank you as well for working with us and standing tall, which is really an important issue. Michigan gets hit hardest, and your care and concern for those of us in the north is greatly appreciated. 
   Right now, the current law allows trash to move across international borders and States can do nothing to regulate this waste, as Congress has not given them the authority to do so. Canada has for years taken advantage of this situation by turning Michigan into the dumping ground for Ontario's trash. This bill, the fourth of its kind, really, since 2000, gives States the authority to regulate Canadian waste and directs the EPA to implement the existing U.S.-Canada Trans-Boundary Agreement. More importantly, it gives Michigan the authority to regulate trash coming from Ontario, no matter how the EPA chooses to implement that trans-boundary agreement. 
   In 2006 alone, over 3.6 million tons of Canadian trash was dumped in our great State of Michigan. As we lose landfill space, shipments of Canadian waste continue to increase every year, and this year was no exception, Madam Speaker. 
   While my colleagues and I have been trying to pass this law, the problem has only gotten worse. Since 2001, when I introduced the first bill to fight Canadian trash, over 17 million tons of garbage have been driven across the border and dumped into our back yards. 
   Since our first attempts to fix this problem, annual garbage loads from Canada have tripled. Of all the trash Canada sends to the United States, 90 percent of it ends up in Michigan. Six years ago, just 10 percent of the waste disposed in Michigan landfills came from Canada; today, that has doubled to 20 percent. Over 400 garbage trucks over a single day rumble through our neighborhoods and deposit and unload their waste in Michigan landfills. 
   Without the ability to regulate this out-of-control surge in Canadian waste, Michigan communities can only sit back and watch the trash pile up. And what have we been getting and why is this a concern? We have had human blood dripping from trash trucks; stopped the whole bridge crossing for almost 6 hours on one occasion as the local police tried to determine the cause of it. It turned out it was hazardous medical waste. Thank God it wasn't a body. But we didn't know, and there is no good way to search those trucks to find out. We had to find out because human blood was dripping from the back of a garbage truck. 
   We have found drugs in those garbage trucks. We have found, in the dumps that receive Canadian trash, that PCP levels have increased. It is a true and real environmental and security problem, not just for Michigan, but for the United States, that we don't get a handle and say to our good friends to the north, this is an unneighborly thing to do, let's work this out. 
   When we anticipated years ago in Michigan that we would cite landfills, which is a very difficult thing to do, we had 20 years' worth of capacity; pretty hard thing to do. You go in through neighborhoods, and we cited these landfills. And we did the right thing for the right environmental reasons. And because of Canada, we believe that our  landfill capacity, because we were diligent and were trying to protect our environment in the future, may have been cut in half because of Canada's inability to deal with their own household municipal garbage problem. 
   The best part of this is that in Canada they actually allow its provinces to restrict intraprovince waste. So if you think about this, Saskatchewan could say ``no'' to Ontario's trash, while Michigan is compelled by law to take it. That is a problem. And again, I argue, it is unneighborly, and we should be able to fix this problem. 
   It is important to note that this bill would not impact State shipments of trash, commercial waste streams; it is only that household municipal waste, that trash that is at the end of the revenue stream where you dig a big hole and you throw it in, that is the only trash that this bill narrowly focused on. 518 is a balanced, narrow NAFTA-compliant bill that gives Michigan and other States the authority they need to be good stewards of their land. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, and Madam Speaker, Michigan needs your help. My colleagues and I urge the support of this important bill. 
   I again want to thank Chairman Dingell and Chairman WYNN for their help and assistance in what really is not only an environmental issue, but a national security issue as well. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I was an FBI agent and I worked organized crime in Chicago, and I did criminal title III work, which is equivalent to FISA on the intelligence side. I developed the sources. I did the debriefings. I did the surveillances. I did the interviews. I talked to lawyers. I talked to more lawyers. It is a very high standard to gain probable cause to listen to United States citizens' conversations. And it should be, and we should protect it. It should be that hard. 
   But I am going to tell you what we are going to do with this bill today. We are going to make it harder for us to go after terrorists who are trying to kill Americans than it was for me to go after organized criminals in Chicago. That is wrong. 
   And I think the intentions are right, but we did take the time to read the bill that we got this afternoon. There are some real problems with the language in here. 
   Number one is this whole thing was established so that we could be technology neutral. And I am just going to address the first paragraph. I think others are going to talk about other things. Because often you are referring to section 105 where it says a court order is not required for those who are not located in the United States. But if you read that whole paragraph, it's not technology neutral. You have set the bar beyond what our technology will be allowed in order to comply with the law. 
   It shouldn't matter if a terrorist is calling a terrorist from Pakistan to Saudi Arabia. We shouldn't care how or what technology they use. It should not matter. If what you say that you don't care that foreign terrorists who are talking to foreign terrorists, that we should not have to have a warrant, this language is wrong. It's wrong. And the people who have to follow the law tell us it's wrong. 
   If you honestly believe this, then let's sit down. The gentleman from California was right. In about an hour we could have this worked out. Everybody would be happy, and we could protect the citizens of the United States, not only their civil liberties at home but from the terrorists who are today planning attacks against the United States. 
   And we all know in a classified way the fact that this is not fixed has cost American lives. 
   No more screwing around. Let's sit down. Let's work it out. Let's get this right.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in my friends. And I have the greatest respect for my good friend from Florida and the gentlewoman from California. We have worked so well together on so many issues that, I think, have made a difference in a positive way for national security for this country. I believe that with every fiber of my being. 
   I almost feel bad for you that you would be sent here on behalf of the Speaker to try to defend this today. I feel bad for you because I know you both. And I know that is not the direction you would have taken, had it been your decision. 
   Efforts to change this are not new. The level of concern by so many of us who sit in those classified hearings in our Intelligence Committee is not new. Last year, my colleague from New Mexico introduced a bill that would have fixed this problem last year, and it was stopped. Earlier this year, earlier this year, it was introduced again to fix this problem, and it was denied by the majority. 
   I have to tell you, when I was a young FBI agent, sometimes you would look up at the policies kind of flowing down at you. We were working awfully hard to develop probable cause to get wiretaps, which was the right thing to do. It was a difficult process with lots of vetting, lots of hours, lots of source development and source vetting, lots of surveillance, and putting it all together to make something like that work so that it could rise to the standard to go after a United States citizen and their communication. It is a pretty high standard. I argue, as somebody who did it for a living, it should be. 
   But what we have been arguing for for the last year is to say, listen, we should not give those rights to terrorists overseas who are conducting terrorist activities to target Americans or our allies, including the United States soldiers. They do not deserve the rights of a U.S. citizen. 
   This was an easy fix. It said, let's be technology neutral. Times have changed since the 1970s when FISA was written. Technology has changed. People communicate completely differently. 
   What we said last year is let us change to keep up, because today we have asked soldiers to stand in harm's way. And the thing that I know that my colleagues understand, both Democrats and Republicans, is because this House has failed to act, they have stood in harm's way without all the information that they need and deserve to be safe, successful, and come home to their families. 
   This gamesmanship is dangerous, and I mean dangerous. My colleagues understand those classified cases that we talk about, that we know because this has not been fixed. Lives may have been lost because of it. Lives may have been lost because of it. We can change that today. 
   I just got a copy of this. As I go through it, just in my brief cursory look at it, this is not what we have been negotiating. There have been no new demands. This is so easy. This is so simple. It can be about a 2-page bill, and we can begin to protect Americans in harm's way, including the homeland, but, most importantly, the soldiers who are overseas who deserve that protection. And just because we shout and we yell, no, no, no, we believe that terrorists should not have to have a warrant overseas as well doesn't make it so, and you know that. That has been the stumbling block. The Court has said it. The intelligence community has said it. The DNI has said it. We have said it. 
   I am going to beg all of you, please, for the lives of the soldiers who are at risk today, for the homeland, this is not the place for gamesmanship. This is not the place that we argue about a bill that we have not even seen. This is the time that we should come together. This is the time that this bill should be out and done, negotiated, and free from all of the gamesmanship we see today. 
   When I go home and look at those families of those folks who have loved ones overseas, I want to be able to tell them we have done everything that we can do to make them safe. When somebody kisses their young child and puts them on the bus, I want to be able to look that family in the eye and say we are doing everything to make sure we get all the information of what the terrorists are up to to protect the United States of America. 
   We all know in good conscience we can't say that today, and we have not been able to say that for months in good conscience. 
   This is our chance to come together as people I know and I respect, who know the dangers of the gamesmanship on an issue this important. Let's stop it. Let's go back. Go back and tell the Speaker, I am sorry, we are not playing this game. 
   People's lives are at stake. We can do this. We can do this together. I know that is why I was sent here. I know that is what you believe in your hearts. Let's do this together. Let's put this stuff aside and fix this problem so that we can begin to listen to the conversations of terrorists we know are planning attacks against our allies and the United States of America. 
   I strongly urge the reconsideration of this. Let's do this. We can do this. We should do this. We ought to do it. And shame on us if we can't do it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. I want to commend Mr. Hastings. We have worked on many issues of which we have agreed strongly in the betterment of national security. I couldn't more strongly disagree with this bill and where we are going today. 
   As one of the very few people on this floor that has actually gone out and developed sources and developed the leads that you possibly need to develop probable cause as a former FBI agent to either bug or intercept phones, offices, or other privileges communications between Americans, I can tell you the long and arduous process it takes to develop that, to go to the judge and say, Your Honor, I do believe that these people are engaged in criminal activities and here is why. And it takes months and months and months. So let me tell you what this bill does today that is so disturbing. 
   Non-United States citizens who are insurgents in Iraq building IEDs that our troops are trying to intercept electronically are now given more rights to privacy than we do for gamblers, degenerate gambling operations developed under the criminal code in the United States of America. That, my friends, is true. Incidental communications, you don't have to go back to the judge, you continue to listen. But what we have done is we have set a standard that every time they want to go overseas and intercept these folks, the standard of the bar is set so high they have to go get a court order. They have to get a warrant. And it takes months. 
   This isn't about Hollywood. This isn't about Jack Bauer. This is about  real people having to develop probable cause in accordance with the law of the United States. And what you said is that insurgent in Iraq has more privacy rights than any criminal, any United States citizen under the criminal code of the United States of America. That is what you have done with this bill. Oh, yes, sir, it is. Read the language and understand what it takes for them to go through the process to develop probable cause. 
   This is the confusion that led to the delay that may have cost the lives of United States soldiers. We all know the example of which we are talking about. 
   This bill encourages that confusion and that standard to give foreign terrorists in a foreign land more privacy rights than United States citizens under the criminal code here. It's wrong. 
   We often say, listen to the intelligence community, listen to our commanders on the ground. I implore you to do just that. They oppose this bill because it makes it harder for them to go after foreign terrorists in foreign lands plotting to kill either U.S. soldiers or even attacks against our homeland or our allies. This bill does all of those things. 
   I don't ever doubt the intention of my friends, but words matter in the legal code. And when you stand before that judge, believe me, there is no agent that believes they are Jack Bauer and are going to fudge a little bit on what the Constitution asks and tells them they must do. They are going to err on the side of the United States Constitution every time. And for those who don't, they deserve to go to jail, and we do prosecute those occasionally. But what you are saying is we are going to create this whole system for foreign terrorists to give them more rights than the privacy of United States citizens. I strongly urge the rejection of this bill. Let's go back to the table and protect our United States citizens.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I think this is going to be an improvement to the bill. 
   This is a good bill. And what this, my amendment, does is deal with the issue of infrastructure. This bill talks about infrastructure. And we have asked the EPA, in this particular bill, to study what additives we add to make the process better when we are talking about moving alternative fuels through the infrastructure. But that sometimes infers that you are either at the point of origin, the refinery, or the point of sale. 
   But there are lots of places that we may be able to apply additives in the process of making alternatives fuels viable, and what we are asking with this amendment is very simple and noncontroversial. We are saying, when you are studying what additives to put in, you should also include where is the best place to put those in in the long process. 
   Our fear here is that we get isolated to only looking at a very small section of where those additives ought to go in this system. And one thing that we know, and we have talked about it here, the gentleman and my friend from Massachusetts made a great argument about the retrofitting gas stations and how important the infrastructure is. 
   Well, if we don't know where these additives go in the system, we, in fact, may be shooting ourselves in the foot here. All it does is take what is existing in this bill and expand it by saying, don't only look at what, but where, those additives can go in the system to make an improvement in our alternative fuels as we march to the future. 
   Very simple. I would argue it is certainly germane to the bill.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I was hoping for an 11th hour reprieve on this issue. We had sent up the call and the white flag to try to get this worked out. Hopefully, maybe in the few minutes I will take to talk about this, you will be moved to tears and be ready to accept the amendment, my friend. 
   One of the things that we have talked about today, and this is an important issue, is how we move forward on alternative fuels. This bill is important. It outlines some pretty important steps for us to move forward. But this amendment gives us the opportunity to have a concrete action that we can take that will immediately allow us to impact. 
   You think about my generation: It was going to the moon. The generation after me was the E-economy. This generation is going to be alternative fuels and how they change the course of our consumption of fuel both in our homes and in our cars; how national security, by getting us away from foreign oil, is changed forever, and not soon enough; how it helps our economy, how it helps our environment. All of that is right now. It is not 10 years, it is not 15 years, it is right now. 
   We have set up a pretty good system for research and development. We now have great amounts of resources going to get us to alternative fuels. We also have a look at the production of it. How do we produce biomass? How do we produce ethanol? What is the next level of cellulosic ethanol? 
   Then the big problem is the distribution of it. That is the one thing that we are just having a difficult time getting over. It is the one hurdle for an exponential growth in our ability to move to alternative fuels. Be it hydrogen, be it ethanol, be it biomass, all of those things have infrastructure problems. 
   The one thing that we know we can do is expand the number of ethanol  pumps. We have to do it. It must happen. But there is a problem. If you are a small, independent gas station owner, you have to take a huge risk, $30,000 to $60,000 to put in an ethanol pump on an economy of scale that isn't there yet. So we have to kick-start it. This is our opportunity to double the number of ethanol pumps available across the country. 
   I know we are going to get into some wrangling about germaneness, and about this paragraph doesn't jive with that paragraph, and this committee hasn't had a chance to talk about it, but this committee has. This bill passed by voice vote last year. 
   Voice vote, we all agreed in a bipartisan way. It went through committee. It had its hearing and moved on to the Senate. Unfortunately, that is where we didn't move it forward. But this is our opportunity to get it done and get it done soon. 
   My friend from Massachusetts, Mr. Delahunt, talked about the urgency, about how fast we should go forward on this and how important it was that we get away from dependency on foreign oil; and what that means to our national security, our economic security, our environmental security. There are only 34 States where you can even get ethanol at a gas station. 
   Let us take this bold move now. If we are serious about moving forward, let's just swallow this one and say, this is the right thing to do. We have already had hearings. We have already voted on it in the House. Let's get this thing moving, so we can double the number of ethanol pumps and move forward for the safety and security of the next generation that will change the course of our economy here in the United States. 
   I ask my friends to reconsider their reservation, and I would urge the support of this amendment. I look forward to working with you on this and other issues in the future.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. I thank the gentleman from Michigan. 
   Mr. Chairman, thank you very, very much for working in such a bipartisan way. I often think after some of our most spirited meetings in the Intelligence Committee, where we have passionate, civil debates, how proud, really, America would be that all of us on both sides of the aisle give all of ourselves to the right outcome on these bills. I want to thank you for allowing that debate to happen in committee. 
   To Mr. Thompson, I have enjoyed working with you on the committee, and I think we have done some great things in a bipartisan way. 
   Mr. Chairman, this is one of those bills that while I think both sides probably would have had a few things different, but because we committed ourselves to put the country first and bipartisanship as our final goal and what works for America, you have a package here that I think sends a great message to the most important group that this bill will impact, and that's the men and women who risk their lives every single day trying to make sure we have the best intelligence to our war fighters, to our police officers, and to keep this country safe. For all of that, to the staffs on both sides, thank you very much. 
   I want to bring your attention to two particular issues. There are a lot of great things in here to think about. 
   One is the FBI policy. Thank you again for working with us on what I think is a growing problem with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and this, I think, was the first signal we need to get a handle on it. The FBI implemented an ``up or out'' policy for its supervisors that was supposed to allow new people in and promote the supervisory special agents, people who had over years developed a Rolodex where they could call the local police chiefs, work with the local community, get to know and understand and gain the trust of these local communities. 
   We have hustled them out after 5 years. They may be the best performing supervisory agents the Bureau has ever had, but when the clock runs out, you're done. 
   In that policy, we have lost half. Almost 290 supervisory special agents have left management in the FBI, retired, stepped down, quit, whatever they have decided to do that wasn't in their interest or their family's interest, because of this policy. 
   I can think of no policy that discriminates against half of your management that we would call successful at a time where we need experience to guide these new agents, which are about half of them, by the way, are fairly new, I think under 5 years or 7 years, something like that. We have tried to work with the Director and say this is the wrong approach, this is a punishment approach. You have great men and women committing themselves to these careers, dedicating themselves to these supervisory positions. We need to reward them, not punish them. 
   We have tried to set up a housing policy to entice them. Three years, longer than 3 years, even after the agreement from the Director, we have been working on this to no avail. It has gone nowhere. Instead, they continue to say this is a policy that works. 
   They are separating themselves from the field, and it's dangerous. Over the last 2 weeks I bet I have talked to a dozen agents, some in supervisory roles, others who are not, who are impacted by their supervisors either leaving or new ones being hired, 12 agents, 100 percent unanimity. This is a bad and dangerous plan for the future of the FBI.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. I think that this is an issue that we have to even pay more attention to. This is an important step to regain the confidence of the FBI and its leadership. It has to happen. Thanks for your leadership on it. 
   Lastly, I just want to talk about the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence. I have worked with Mr. Thompson on this. We have spent a lot of time understanding this. Our concerns are real, and the intelligence community concerns are real. 
   We created this new organization. Its job was to coordinate, not be operational. We have found that it goes well beyond mission creep, and it is in mission grasp. It is bloated, it's too big, and it became an agency not that supported the decision and calculations of the field, but became supported by the field. 
   It's a dangerous development in intelligence. I appreciate working with you. I know we have a lot more work to do. Congratulations to all on a bill that will, I think and believe, keep America safer.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. This is the one thing that just has me scratching my head. Every day, analysts in the IC community will hear those words, ``caliphate,'' ``jihadist,'' ``Muslim extremism,'' because those are the words of our enemy. And what we're telling this whole community, whose job it is to keep us informed and keep people who are going to do these intelligence investigations informed, is who they are, what they are, and how they use words, including coming up and briefing members of the State Department, ambassadors, and other things. 
   So what you're saying is no more free speech; we're going to hurt somebody's feelings. We don't want to say that terrorists are using words like ``caliphate,'' they're using words like ``jihad.'' 
   This is the craziest thing I have ever heard. It is political correctness that is dangerous. 
   If you ask the average American, should we shut down these people's use of the words in describing it to public officials, they will scratch their head and laugh. But that's exactly what you do when you create these artificial systems of the speech police. 
   Do you want them to walk around the halls and police those who may slip and use the word ``jihadist'' after quoting Osama bin Laden in trying to get somebody to understand the dangers that they pose to the United States of America? 
   I would just ask my colleagues, please, use a little common sense. This surpasses any, any commonsense test you can put together when it comes to free speech, number one, and accurately communicating between the powers that be, the intelligence community and policy-makers that need to have the same language that our enemy does to understand who they are and how dangerous they are.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I want to congratulate the chairman on mostly good work. And a big budget doesn't necessarily mean a good budget. We have had some great discussions. There are some really good things in this bill. But there are some serious departures on the direction in which we take intelligence that I think are so important that we need to stand up and oppose this bill. 
   This bill jeopardizes our ability to listen to terrorists. It puts it at risk. This bill cuts very specific human intelligence programs. They will get less money this year than they got last year. 
   I just want to talk for a minute about global climate change. As mentioned earlier, the President's budget proposes over $7 billion for climate change activities. This bill should be about securing America. Instead, it is being used to secure a political agenda on these items. 
   Climate change is an important issue, and it should be taken seriously. Thankfully it is. Fourteen Federal agencies already have active climate change programs. Let me go through them: Agriculture, Commerce, State, Health and Human Services, Interior, Transportation, EPA, NASA, NSF, Defense, Treasury, USAID, the Smithsonian, the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, DARPA and NASA all have active research, development, testing and evaluation programs. NASA's program already makes satellite images available to government researchers. 
   This legislation assigns intelligence agencies that have limited experience in this area the job of researching climate change. We are going to take analysts away from looking for Osama bin Laden and we are going to put them on the ``March of the Penguins.'' 
   This bill requires intelligence agencies to use intelligence satellites to monitor environmental issues. Many of my colleagues have been in the field. You know that imagery is so important and so high in demand. This is the wrong direction for their mission accomplishment. 
   If you want to break the spirits of our intelligence agencies, if you want to destroy their morale, go ahead and give them this assignment. Tell them they should spend their day watching the grass grow, and see how it works. George Tenet referred to these kinds of assignments as ``bugs and bunnies assignments.'' 
   We are making a mockery of the seriousness of climate change and a mockery of the important work our intelligence agencies do. If you liked building the rain forest in Iowa, you are going to love the Department of Environmental Espionage. 
   Vote against this legislation. The stakes are too high. The people in the field mean too much to us. Their mission is too crucial to have it diverted for a political agenda.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I just want to quickly respond to my colleague, who I have the greatest amount of respect for. Climate change is an important issue, and I think the point we are trying to make here is that there are 14 agencies, $7 billion already being spent on it. The time to train an analyst and a case officer to their optimum performance level is between 5 and 7 years. Five and 7 years. That is an incredible investment. And I want them looking for Osama bin Laden, for the next nuclear program that we don't know about around the world. It takes a tremendous amount of effort to get them where they need to be. This is the wrong direction for it. 
   We have, I am going to read them again, the Army, Navy, Air Force, DARPA, NASA, EPA, NSF, Defense, Treasury, USAID, the Smithsonian, Transportation, Interior, HHS, State, Energy, Commerce and Agriculture all looking at climate change. Don't waste these very precious resources.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I have the utmost respect for the gentleman. We have had long conversations or at least short interrupted conversations over the past several days and in committee. I thought we had a fairly spirited debate in the Intelligence Committee about this very issue. 
   The good thing is we agree this thing has exponentially grown, not the direction Congress intended. It was supposed to be a small, efficient organization that was coordinating and not inhibiting agencies from doing their work. 
   I reluctantly, as we talked earlier, oppose this amendment, because really all it does is say give me another report, and you can grow as much as you want in 2008. This is what the staggering number is here. The number itself is classified, but it is over 37 percent growth from where they are right now to 2008, in headquarters. 
   Now, they are not catching one spy. They are not recruiting one asset. They are not out analyzing any particular image from the sky. They are getting more in boxes. They are getting more in computers. They are getting more bureaucracies and personnel staff and all of the other things that go along with growing your headquarters. That is all happening. 
   When you travel around the world, the folks who are out there at the front end of this store, the analysts and the case officers, will tell you, please, enough already, because they took all of those analysts out of that community. 
   Remember, it takes 5 to 7 years to get somebody to where they are really effective in this community. It's very difficult work.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Reclaiming my time. I don't know if I can say it any better. I hope to work with the gentleman in committee. I wish you would consider this. 
   One point I think it is very important to make, this does not cut one analyst. They didn't even make all the hires they requested in 2007. Then they came back and asked for a significant increase in 2008, didn't even hire all the people from 2007. So the notion that they put forward that this somehow cuts the analyst doing counterterrorism work is wrong. 
   It scares me more that this bureaucracy is so hell bent on protecting itself that it would make that claim. That's why I think we need to send this message, work with them to make this right sized, so we provide value added to the people risking their lives around the world. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time I may consume. 
   I want to thank Mr. Hastings for working with me on this amendment. We have watched this thing for 3 years, and we have watched it pretty closely. We all want it to succeed. There are some really dedicated and committed people really trying to make this thing work. 
   But one thing I have learned here in watching it in Washington, D.C., and going out to the field, where these case officers, the young ones, the middle-ranged ones and the older ones in the field, you can get a lot of insight about what happens between the difference of between there and back here. 
   We have seen, I thought, a very poor performance. I have had this conversation with many of my colleagues here about their briefings, about this increase, and what they really performed, and what their mission set was. There are some things that they do and do well and are value-added. 
   But this exponential growth, at the expense of analysts and officers in the field, I think is the wrong direction. I think it's so important that we make this statement to them that enough is enough. 
   They brought in, remember, everyone of those analysts came from an agency that's doing targeted work, the counterterrorism center at the CIA. They were doing real work, targeting bad guys, identifying, putting them on lists, trying to get our guys to bring them to justice. 
   What happened then is they disrupted some of those operations, brought those people in, and started tasking back to the people in the field. That's not value-added; it's just not. 
   We can live with this if we can work out the kinks. As a matter of fact, Senator McConnell said, he thought the thing was getting a little bit too big. He didn't really influence this budget, 37 percent increase. We must do better  by the people in the field, 5 to 7 years to train a case analyst and an officer. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield to my good friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings).

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Reclaiming my time, I just thank the gentleman for his work and effort on this, and kind of us coming together on this conclusion over the past 3 years watching this process. Again, this is not anti-DNI. We think it serves a valuable purpose, but it is getting too big too fast. 
   Again, this does not cut one analyst from doing work in this country, not one. They couldn't even fill the slots we have for 2007 before they came back and said we have to get even bigger next year. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Chair, I just want to clarify again, there is no one to be cut, with all due respect to my chairman. What they are talking about is what they have future planned, which would be pulled from the community as it stands now. It would actually allow the DNI to reprioritize the folks that he has in that shop. And many of my colleagues will remember that the number that the DNI gave was lower than the number that is even in Mr. Hastings' and my amendment. He thinks it is too big. 
   So there won't be any cuts, there won't be any jeopardizing of security, there won't be any analysts that get home once they are employed and fully engaged. They may go back to doing counterterrorism work, but they will not be sent home.

   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I know the hour is late, but this is such an important issue. There are some good things in this bill, and my colleagues have rightly said this is the biggest expenditure we have ever seen in a very long time, as a matter of fact, ever, in our intelligence bill. But bigger isn't always better, because the priorities in the bill are what is important. 
   The folks who are on the front lines, our analysts, our case officers, our soldiers who are being protected by the feed of information that flows to them, are incredibly important. And make no doubt about it, my friends, this is a huge shift philosophically from where we have been in the past. 
   Nothing in here, nothing in here fixes the problem that we have today in not being able to listen to certain phone calls that might lead to an attack on the United States of America. Nothing. That lack of urgency should scare us all. 
   The fact that we cut human intelligence programs in this bill, they will get less money this year, some of them very sensitive, very classified, specifically cut out of this bill, jeopardizes soldiers in the field in not getting the proper assistance and information that they need. 
   We also take a political bent. There are also some disturbing things, things that we all sometimes don't like about the House that we serve in. Sometimes it was said because we did things that way for a long time, we should continue to do it. Those are the things that we can change tonight. Those are the things that we can at least tell the American people with this motion to recommit we believe in getting that information, we believe in human intelligence. Certainly the 9/11 Commission did. We believe in regular order and the rules, so that when earmarks go into very sensitive bills like this, and we have seen what happens when we don't follow the rules, it can cause trouble. 
   Think about what we are talking about. Right before Afghanistan, we dropped seven CIA officers in very remote places in a very difficult neighborhood, and on their own they committed to get around with this Northern Alliance that was together, but not really. They had tribal problems. They had cultural problems among themselves. And their duty, these seven CIA officers, was to pull things together. Human intelligence got us where we needed to be.     
   Many would say it saved thousands and thousands of lives of U.S. soldiers because of their brave actions in the mountains of Afghanistan in very difficult territory because we had human-on-human contact that gave us the information and the operations that we needed to be successful. 
   And in this bill, in this bill, they take away precious resources for those kind of human collection activities. When we have soldiers in the field, that is a philosophical departure from where we have been in the past. 
   We can't stand for that. We can't stand for the fact that we may lose our ears on terrorist activities being planned today. And we also can't take wasteful programming in something that is this important. 
   You know, for a time of war, the priorities of this bill are completely misplaced in critical areas. The motion to recommit would readjust those priorities by increasing human intelligence funding for the Central Intelligence Agency by $23 million. That money would come from an earmark funding for the National Drug Intelligence Center which a formal oversight report of the House Committee said: ``An expensive and duplicative use of scarce Federal drug enforcement resources.'' And the U.S. News & World Report called it a ``boondoggle.'' 
   The motion to recommit would also direct the Department of Justice Inspector General to conduct an audit of the National Drug Intelligence Center to determine if this center was wasteful and duplicative. 
   For all of the talk about reform, the majority has blocked an audit by a party-line vote in committee with no substantive explanation. My amendment requiring the audit also was blocked by the Rules Committee. It shouldn't be controversial that these funds could be put to far better use in human intelligence. In numerous important respects, this bill fails to provide adequate support to the Intelligence Community's activities on the forefront of its ability to protect our national security. 
   In a classified annex, the majority cuts human intelligence programs, counter to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission; and significantly cuts certain specific initiatives related to American efforts to counter radical jihadists and to support our Nation's objectives in Iraq. 
   A review of just this center, and why this $23 million is so important, it is going to human collection. A review of the NDIC, U.S. News & World Report in 2005 concluded: ``It is a boondoggle,'' and ``rocked by scandal and subject to persistent criticism that it should never have been created at all.'' 
   You know, sometimes, and God love us all, we get pretty myopic on our districts. This is the time that we need to look outward to the rest of the country. We are United States Members of Congress. What is good for our backyard may not be good for the rest of the country. 
   There is a Marine right now that is counting on human intelligence to tell us if there is an IED on the road, if al Qaeda is around the corner. If we don't want to stand up for this motion to recommit, we will endorse the boondoggles of the past at the expense of our soldiers in the field. I would urge support of the motion to recommit.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. (COMMENDING THE MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY SPARTANS FOR THEIR VICTORY IN THE 2007 NCAA HOCKEY CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - May 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume. 
   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I also want to thank Bart Stupak from Michigan for working with us on this resolution. 
   I am proud to represent Michigan State University in the great State of Michigan. It is truly an extraordinary school with a proud history of world-class academics and championship athletics. Known for its quality in faculty, its research, it is certainly one of the finer universities, a proud tradition in  land grant institutions in this great State who is now headed by President Lou Anna Simon, who has done a tremendous job at the university in so many areas. 
   But last month we got to witness Michigan State's winning tradition once again, this time on the biggest stage in college hockey. 
   On April 7, the MSU hockey team won the Division I NCAA National Championship. The Spartans defeated Boston College by a score of 3-1, as we all know, and the winning goal came with only 18.9 seconds left in the game. It's no fun unless you make it close. Well, our Spartans certainly got our heart rates up that particular day. 
   It was a hard-fought game against a top-ranked opponent, but as many of you know, the Spartans' specialty is winning. They came out on top. 
   The Spartans scored three goals in the third period to spur a dramatic, comeback-from-behind victory. Justin Abdelkader scored the game-winning goal and was named MVP of the NCAA Frozen Four tournament. Chris Mueller put the game out of reach with an empty-net goal with just 1.2 seconds left on the clock. Goalie Jeff Lerg made 29 saves, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania discussed earlier. 
   Upon their return to East Lansing, showing the school spirit, certainly the community's support, there were over 4,500 fans turned out for a parade and a rally at Munn Ice Arena on the campus of Michigan State University. 
   Prior to the championship game, the MSU hockey squad burned through the NCAA Frozen Four tournament. The Spartans defeated Boston University, Notre Dame, University of Maine to reach that championship game. 
   In the tournament, the Spartans played top-notch defense against the Nation's best teams. They were 17 for 18 on penalty kills. Jeff Lerg made 104 saves and allowed only five goals in the tournament. 
   Let me tell you a little bit more about this historic championship season. The Spartans won the national championship for the third time in school history, the first since 1986 when current Athletic Director Ron Mason coached the team. Michigan State's Rick Comley, in his fifth year as head coach, won his first national title with Michigan State and the second national title as head coach. The Spartans compiled a 23-13-3 record and won the national championship as a number three seed in a field of 16 tournament. 
   There are many reasons to be proud of this Spartan team, and there are many reasons Michigan State fans are so proud of their hockey team and their university. 
   Michigan State remains the all-time winningest program in the history of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Former Head Coach Ron Mason has 924 victories, making him the all-time winningest coach in NCAA history. Current Head Coach Rick Comley has 714 wins, ranking fifth of all time. 
   I am proud to be a Spartan and represent that fine Michigan State University, and on behalf of myself, the entire Michigan delegation, Bart Stupak for his special assistance, I would like to congratulate our head coach, Rick Comley; his hardworking staff and assistants; and the best hockey players on the ice, the Michigan State Spartans; and certainly their fans. 
   Go Green. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I want to compliment Mr. Reyes. When this happened 124 days ago when it expired, I realized what a challenge you had. They were asking you to win the Kentucky Derby by entering a donkey in the race. And trying to get all of the folks together to get us to the place where we are today was not short feat. 
   Mr. Hoekstra and Mr. Reyes, I want to thank you both because what this bill does today is reaffirm what we have been saying for the last several years, that the due process of the Constitution, the fourth amendment, is alive and well and protected in this bill. And any rhetoric to the contrary is simply not true. It is fear mongering. 
   For any U.S. citizen who believes that their phones are going to be unceremoniously and injudiciously tapped or listened to is simply wrong, and this bill reaffirms the importance of that fourth amendment and due process for every American citizen every day. 
   But it also says some very important things. We are going to protect the Good Samaritan law that we have known and developed over the last 200-plus years that if you in good faith help your neighbor or help your country, in good faith you will be protected from damages sought by anyone else. If you stand up and protect the liberties and justice of your country and the lives of your neighbors, you will be protected in this law. 
   And finally, our foreign intelligence service allies have been nervous for 124 days, begging, pleading, cajoling, asking please, step up to the plate and reengage in one of the most important intelligence elements that we have, that the United States shares with our foreign allies to stop suicide bombers, to stop terrorist elements from developing plans and plots to kill their citizens as well as our own. 
   This bill reaffirms all that we said last year and the year before. It reaffirms what we said in the Protect America Act in August of 2007 that it is absolutely important that we step up to the plate and listen to foreign terrorists in foreign lands plotting to kill citizens of our allies and here at home. 
   I want to congratulate all those who came together today, and urge those with the rhetoric to please stand for your country today, stand for the soldiers in the field who deserve our protection and the protection of the intelligence services, and for every mother and every father, every child in America who looks for a better day tomorrow knowing that we once again have both our eyes and our ears on the problem with terrorism and radical jihadists.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how disappointed I am in my colleagues across the aisle. Many of us reached out and said we'd like to help craft the language that solves the problems that we all agree are problems. 
   Even the Speaker of the House acknowledged that illegals in that other bill was a problem; that adults on the bill was a problem; that people collecting over 300 percent, in some cases $83,000 or up to $100,000, that was a problem. The fact that we're taking millions of children and forcing them off of their private insurance and onto a government program was a problem. 
   All was acknowledged. But not one constructive meeting happened where we actually sat down and said, we all agree that those are problems. You agree and we agree. Let's work out the language so that we can get a bill that takes care of poor children. That's what we believe. 
   But, Madam Speaker, I would encourage you to read the bill. As a matter of fact, she was proud to say that they capped it at 300 percent. We got the bill last night. We're still finding some real gems in here. 
   Denial of payments for expenditures for children health care assistance for children whose effective family income extends 300 percent of the poverty line. Basically, they said, we capped it, see? 
   And then you read down a little bit, under rule of construction: ``Nothing in these amendments made by this section shall be construed as changing any income eligibility level for children under this section.'' 
   You didn't change anything. As a matter of fact, you made it worse, actually made it worse. So you know that same $83,000 family that we all agreed and the Speaker stood right on this floor and said is a problem is still a problem in this bill. 
   I encourage all of you to read the bill. The rhetoric is great. Who's against poor kids? Nobody. But if you want to do something that has meaning, if you want to say that everybody's vote counts, that everybody should participate in this process, and you want to stand for kids and not behind them, then we need to reject this rule and come back and write a bill that doesn't allow illegals to have welfare benefits, that doesn't take these 2 million kids and throw them off their private health care, that doesn't have families making $83,000 subsidized by hardworking middle-class families. We can do it if you just try. You didn't even try. 
   The only people that are welcome now on that side of the aisle's leadership offices are pollsters, focus groups, people who are running TV ads. Last night we had Members getting calls on the bill that we didn't see, advocating for the bill. Oops. 
   To say that this has been honest and fair and open is a disgrace to this institution, and it is a great institution. 
   There's lot of people over there I have just so much respect for, and so many of them were trying to reach out and do this; but they were completely cut off from anything that resembled reasonableness. 
   I just want to cover quickly, Mr. Speaker, the things that the Speaker said again. No illegals. CBO says that, in fact, is not true, and you confirmed in a meeting earlier with your leadership that no proof of citizenship is needed in this bill. Reason enough. 
   Adults, you said we took care of the adults issue. CBO scores 10 percent of all the participants by 2012 will be adults. 
   Nothing over 300 percent. You heard the language in there that actually obliterates that. We don't take these working-class families off of their private health care insurance. CBO says 2 million will lose it. 
   If you honestly believe by your words in this well that these were problems before that you tried to fix, we need to reject this bill, start talking, cooperating and negotiating; and we're going to have a bill that truly helps poor children.

<DOCNO>Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. ROGERS of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. 
   CBO said this will not save money. 
   Something interesting happened. You had the chance, my friends on the other side of the aisle, in committee in the negotiation of this bill, had the chance to set prices, what this bill would do. And when you went out to set prices, you said we cannot do it. The private sector cannot do it for any cheaper than $35; so let's protect the American people, and we are going to put an amendment into this bill that sets those premiums at $35. 
   Let me read just from the amendment that was offered by my friends on the other side of the aisle and, thankfully, didn't pass. It is to set the premium at $35 including, as it says here, for months in the subsequent year, and some legal hyperbole here, and then in the previous year increase by the annual percentage. So every year you were going to increase the prices because the government set the price at $35. 
   If we had believed that price-setting was the answer in providing prescription drugs to families who needed it, who were making the decisions between food and prescription drugs, we would have increased their cost in my State by 100 percent. 
   It doesn't work. You are empowering the same bureaucrats who came up with the $500 hammer, and you are asking them to go out and get into America's medicine cabinet. As a matter of fact, the ones that do it now, they are  even telling you that you can't have certain drugs because it is too big for them. There are 4,300 different drugs, 55,000 different pharmacies; and when the Secretary right after 9/11 knew that they had to purchase Cipro, it took them over a month to negotiate the price because government isn't designed to be in the business of negotiating prices. They set prices, and it doesn't work very well. 
   Why would we take away all of the savings that all of these seniors are enjoying today? And that is what you will do, just by your example. 
   I would strongly encourage this body to reject price-setting and raising the cost of prescription drugs to our seniors around the country.
