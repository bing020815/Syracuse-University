   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment. And while they say miracles never cease, this is living proof. Despite my frustrations with the leadership of the Department of Energy, and they are great, I am rising to oppose the gentlewoman's motion to cut the DOE's Departmental Administration and make a case for why they need the level requested by the President. 
   For too long, DOE has been stuck in a quagmire of mismanagement, operating devoid of leadership and vision. But cutting funds that are critical to the successful management of our Nation's energy programs, especially at such a critical time in terms of our energy security, I think is a foolish time to do that. A cut of close to $30 million to this account will cost far more in terms of our Nation's energy needs than the good message it might send. 
   So don't be misled by the gentlewoman's argument that cutting $28 million in discretionary funds in this account will reduce the deficit. It might. But I think it will do the opposite. It will undermine DOE's efforts to oversee climate change research, improve the use of renewable energy, and provide national scientific leadership. 
   But DOE, I hope, is listening today and gets the message. They need to get their act together, and I agree with the fact that they don't have their act together. But I don't think this is the way to get their attention at this moment. But if I thought it was, I would agree with the gentlewoman, because I believe the intent here is more than just to cut the deficit. It is to wake them up to get some reasonable management in that quagmire that is over there and just answers to the other body's needs all the time for additional spending. So it is unfortunate, but I do oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition also to the gentleman's amendment. This is not personal between me and the gentleman, and I hope it wouldn't be when I get over too, because I am really opposed to this amendment, and I am really in support of the chairman on this, because this is something we have worked on for a long period of time. 
   I know the administration and some Members, those from New Mexico, are not pleased with the cuts to the weapons program. I have heard from the other body, and they may claim these funding reductions somehow threaten our national security. 
   I also recognize it is politically convenient to move money from a so-called bureaucracy in Washington to what is portrayed as a field-level purpose. Sorry, folks, but I don't buy either of these arguments, and I strongly believe this bill puts our nuclear weapons programs in the proper perspective. 
   I have been a member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for the past 5 years, and I have personally visited every single nuclear weapons lab, plant and site in DOE's complex, and I honestly can't tell you how much our national security is protected, whether we fund the nuclear weapons account at $6.5 billion, $6 billion, or even $5.5 billion. And I certainly can't tell you what benefit we will gain by adding $192 million back to the weapons program and devastating NSA's management office, as the gentleman proposes. 
   I also sit on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, as does my chairman, and we both are all too aware of the funding shortfalls in the conventional defense area to believe that nuclear weapons are somehow a higher security priority. 
   So after years of looking at this from virtually every angle, I can tell you definitively that what we need is a national strategy for nuclear weapons and a clearly defined set of military requirements that is derived from that strategy. Then, and only then, will NNSA be able to lay out what a modern weapons complex, capability of producing a specified number of reliable replacement warheads will look like. 
   In the meantime, we have many nuclear nonproliferation priorities that need to be addressed. This will have real security benefits today, not at some weapons design lab tomorrow. 
   This bill balances our national security needs by making the prudent recommendations on weapons we have discussed and by putting an additional $398 billion above the President's request towards defense nuclear nonproliferation activities. These funds will play down the risk of nuclear smuggling by improving programs such as the elimination of weapons-grade plutonium production; international nuclear materials production and cooperation; second line of defense and cooperation; MegaPorts; MegaAirports; and global coordination among domestic security agencies, such as DHS and foreign governments. 
   Furthermore, these additional funds will support the implementation of an International Nuclear Fuel Bank, a priority for security experts ranging from National Security Advisor Steve Hadley to former Senator Sam Nunn to the leadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
   Getting our national security priorities right is what this bill is about, and it is a rational approach I wholeheartedly support. But let's call it what it is. This amendment isn't really about national security. It is all about jobs at these DOE weapons facilities. 
   In particular, the Los Alamos National Laboratory is in the gentleman's State of New Mexico. This lab has held a preeminent place at the Federal trough for years, and now fears the loss of jobs because of this bill's recommended funding levels. Los Alamos has the largest number of employees of any DOE field site, with employees who receive the highest level of compensation, and a lab that has the highest overhead rate of any DOE operation. All told, Los Alamos receives close to $2 billion a year from our bill, plus additional reimbursement of work from other agencies. And I cannot tell you what we get in return for that investment. 
   I do know that Los Alamos has chronic management problems, and I can read a long litany of security failures, safety accidents and costs and schedule overruns brought to you by the 9,000 highly paid folks at Los Alamos. Don't let anyone tell you that these problems are a thing of the past. DOE just informed us this week of yet another security screwup at Los Alamos, and this is after a number of others. 
   Given this track record, do we really believe adding another $192 million will improve security? I would argue our national security might actually be improved by cutting 1,800 jobs from a facility that can't seem to manage sensitive information. We would have a lot less people to watch. 
   The bottom line is that gutting the office of the NNSA Administrator by reducing its funding by almost half will undermine any chance of the NNSA actually managing the weapons and nuclear nonproliferation programs. Does the gentleman expect us to believe that jobs in New Mexico are more important than the overall national management of these sensitive national security programs? 
   So I am, you can tell, opposed to the gentleman's amendment. I believe the priorities are misguided. The weapons program has no clear strategy of a way forward. And this bill report addresses the shortcomings with its prudent funding recommendations and bold direction. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this ill-conceived amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment to eliminate funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. I have been against the Appalachian Regional Commission since I was on the Budget Committee in 1995. But I do appreciate the chairman's cutting the funding back because we always have a problem dealing with the Senate on this issue. 
   But let me tell you, for all of the heartburn we have had over congressional earmarks and administration earmarks, I would point out that funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission basically provides earmarks designated by the Governors of 13 Appalachian States. If we are cutting our earmarks, then we should be reducing these as well. The one thing we should not do is delegate our decision-making to the authority of these Governors, no matter how well intended the purposes are. 
   And I have to tell you, we have been throwing this money into these counties for all these years, and they are still at these levels. It doesn't do any good. It just goes down the tube. We should do programs that really help the quality of life in these regions and help them move out, rather than doing these little projects that keep them in the poverty level. So I support the gentleman's amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlelady's withdrawing of the amendment. At the time this proposal came up, I was the chairman of the committee and we worked together on this with the current chairman. GNEP was a proposal that was put out for people to raise their hand if they were interested in the project. It was never intended that the project be a permanent disposition site. So I think your people should understand that it was only an interim site. I would recommend that the record show that it is  only an interim site that is intended if they are successful in receiving a GNEP award.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. But I want to tell you I am very sympathetic to the gentleman's concerns. We should preserve hydropower wherever we can. We should advance hydropower. He is correct in those statements. 
   However, I think the amendment is too broadly written and could lead to unintended negative consequences because there may be certain structures that because of environmental reasons or economic reasons we need to take some action on. 
   So what I would like to suggest to everyone is that we oppose the amendment, but we work together to see, because I think the chairman shares the concern for hydropower and that we would try to work to see how we can get some language at some point that might address the problem in a more appropriate way. So I do reluctantly oppose the amendment, but I am certainly within the spirit of the amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. I just wanted to take a moment to comment that I really appreciate the Chairman's very thoughtful comments, especially on all the issues that he talked about, but certainly, when it comes to NNSA and the lack of management of the weapons systems. 
   The gentleman remarked to me over here, do we have 9,000 weapons, or 10,000 weapons? Well, the number we've been trying to get out for a long time, cause it's a good news story. But we can't tell you here how good news the story is, because it's still secure. And we've tried for a number of years to get  out this issue of how many weapons we have and to get this complex sized appropriately. 
   But we're very disturbed, in a bipartisan way, about the management of the entire Department of Energy. And I want to associate myself with the gentleman's comments and his opposition to the amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (U.S. TROOP READINESS, VETERANS' HEALTH, AND IRAQ ACCOUNTABILITY ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1591, the Fiscal Year 2007 U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Health, and Iraq Accountability Supplemental Appropriations Act, because, in my opinion, it sends the wrong message to our troops, our allies and the Iraqi people, who really want to take care of and control of their own country. 
   In my opinion, this bill will tie the hands of the commanders in the field by micromanaging from Washington the military decisions that those commanders ought to be making on the ground. Further, by setting a date-certain timeline requirement for withdrawing our troops, in my opinion it will endanger U.S. personnel and give our enemies a date to wait us out. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill not only sends the wrong message to our troops about their efforts to bring stability to Iraq, it sends the wrong one to our allies throughout the world. In my opinion, it says that if you bloody us enough, we are going to walk away. 
   If we walk away, our credibility is gone in the world. We will be abandoning the thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives and voted for freedom, and risk bringing dishonor to the men and women who have fought and died in this war. 
   One thing that strikes me about the debate of this bill and the recent one on H. Res. 63, the Iraqi war resolution, is that there is little or no discussion on what the Iraqis are willing to do to bring themselves closer to taking control of their own country.  
   Earlier this year I went on a bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. While we met with U.S. troops and commanders, we also had a chance to meet with the leaders of those countries, including Iraqi Prime Minister al-Maliki. He told us if his country had the command and control, equipment and our backing, the Iraqis could begin to take over their own security in 3 to 6 months and that we could be able to redeploy 50,000 U.S. troops at that time. 
   Mr. Speaker, we need to make sure that President Maliki has the tools and resources to be successful. For those who are looking for a timely withdrawal of troops, why shouldn't we be focusing on giving him and his plan a chance, rather than setting arbitrary withdrawal deadlines? The quicker that the Iraqi people take control of their country, the quicker U.S. troops can begin to withdraw with dignity. This bill, I don't believe, moves us further in that direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to send our own message to the leadership of this body that our troops and commanders in the field deserve a bill that will support them in their efforts to bring stability to Iraq. 
   Finally, I am troubled by the way the new majority has restricted the debate, for even while we are encouraging the Iraqi people and their leaders to become more democratic, the House of Representatives, in my opinion, is moving in the opposite direction. 
   During the last elections, much was made about maintaining a fair and open process in the people's House, and I shared that. Frankly, I don't think we did when we were in the majority enough on that. This bill, however, is back to even worse than that because it is being considered under conditions that are neither fair nor open. Specifically, no amendments are allowed, and no alternatives can be considered on this most important bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, a bill with such historical importance needs to have open and fair debate. That is the way this type of bill has always been considered, I thought, before. That is what the American people were promised last fall. I, frankly, deeply regret that this is not now occurring today.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   First of all, let me thank Mr. Obey, the chairman of the committee, for his good work with us on this bill. And I want to add my support to Chairman Visclosky on doing a good job on his first bill, and I will talk about that a little bit further. 
   This is the first Energy and Water appropriation bill that my colleague from Indiana has developed and brought to the floor. The first one, I found out, is always the hardest one, but he has done a great job and it is a good bill; and I have certainly enjoyed working with him this year in a new position for me also as the ranking member on this bill. 
   It certainly helps to have an allocation that is $1.1 billion over the administration's request. However, I do not disagree with the major funding decision that the chairman has made in this bill. 
   This bill is a very thoughtful approach to some very difficult issues, including investing in our Nation's water infrastructure, developing domestic energy sources with less impact on global climate, and fostering our national security through rational efforts on nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear weapons. 
   I want to comment briefly on a couple of specific programs and projects, including several that Chairman Visclosky has just recently discussed. I fully support the increased spending for water resources infrastructure. We have chronically underinvested in this infrastructure in recent years both in this administration and, frankly, in the previous administration.     
   And the hurricanes of 2005 taught us some very hard lessons about the consequences of such underinvestment.  
   The Corps already has a significant backlog of construction projects, a backlog that, frankly, is only going to get larger with the next Water Resources Development Act, which we don't have the money to fund that. 
   I'm very pleased that the chairman maintains the continuing contracts and financial management reforms for the Army Civil Works program. These reforms are critical if the Corps is to get its house in order, and if it is to make responsible use of the $5.5 billion we provide in this bill. And let me say that not fixing the Corps' problems has cost us a lot of money, because when we don't complete projects on time or don't complete parts of projects, those projects grow in cost and it makes the problem even worse. And therefore, the underfunding of this by the administration, and not just this administration, but previous administrations, has not been helpful. 
   I generally agree with the majority's priorities for the Department of Energy. It is essential that we develop advanced energy technologies that increase our energy security by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lessening our dependence on foreign oil. However, I will caution that increased spending on these technologies is no guarantee of increased results, especially at the Department of Energy. 
   I want to briefly talk on this subject of loan guarantees. I will state up front that I have no confidence whatsoever that the Department of Energy is capable of managing this program in a responsible manner. That said, I recognize the congressional and industry pressure in favor of loan guarantees. 
   You may hear two complaints about our bill, that we do not provide the full administration request of $9 billion for loan guarantees, and that we did not include nuclear power plants in the $7 billion. Those criticisms miss one essential fact: that Congress already provided DOE with $4 billion for loan guarantees in the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution that was not restricted to any particular energy technologies. The Department could apply all $4 billion to nuclear power plants if they so choose. But let me tell you, they don't have any expertise over there on this, and it's going to be a mess because they don't know how to handle it and they don't know how to underwrite these loans. But they're going ahead with the program because Congress is pushing them into it. 
   Now I want to talk about nuclear weapons. 
   I share the majority's concerns on the reliable replacement warhead. The concept of RRW has merit if it allows us to have a smaller stockpile of more reliable weapons that will not require nuclear testing. But all we have right now is a vague promise. What we need to see is a significant stockpile plan from the administration that shows how developing the RRW will actually get us to a much smaller future stockpile. Such a stockpile plan is also essential before we invest significant resources in modernizing the DOE's nuclear weapons complex. For that reason our bill does not fund RRW, and makes roughly a 10 percent reduction in the weapons account activities. 
   We should not be spending billions to modernize a Cold War footprint of the weapons complex until the Department of Defense defines what kind of future stockpile DOE will have to support. I don't think most people are really aware of how this all works, but the Defense Department is the customer, DOE is the provider. 
   I am aware that there are Members' and administration concerns about the effect these cuts may have on weapons facilities. I will address these concerns later in my discussions. 
   Now let me talk about one that really gets me going. 
   There is really only one place in this bill, and I see the chairman smiling, where I have a really significant difference of opinion with the majority, and that is funding for the MOX plant. For those Members who are not familiar with this project, let me do a little quick review. 
   In early 2000, the United States and Russia agreed for each country to dispose of 34 metric tons of excess weapons-usable plutonium. Each country had a preferred technology for plutonium disposition. The U.S. wanted immobilization, and Russia wanted fast reactors. So, they reached a compromise to convert the plutonium into mixed oxide fuel to be burned in existing commercial lightwater reactors. The U.S. and Russia were supposed to proceed in parallel with their respective MOX projects. Well, guess what? The Russians are coming. Last year, Sergey Kiriyenko, the head of ROSATOM in Russia, told the chairman and myself that MOX is an obsolete and expensive technology, and Russia has no intention of building a MOX plant unless the international community pays 100 percent of the cost. If Russia has to spend any of its own money for plutonium disposition, then it will use fast reactors. He couldn't believe that we were dumb enough to still want to build a MOX plant in the United States. Well, guess what? We are going to build one because we are that dumb, I guess, because DOE and some in Congress still think we should proceed with construction of this plant. 
   The project was sold to Congress as costing only $1 billion. That's where it started out. The latest estimate, and they haven't broken ground yet, is $4.7 billion. And that's before construction actually starts. Given DOE's dismal track record of controlling costs, the final price tag will certainly be much higher. The total set of facilities and operations that must be completed to dispose of the 34 metric tons of U.S. plutonium has an estimated life-cycle cost of $11 billion. And the project is now a mere 11 years behind schedule. 
   So, what has been the response of this cost growth and schedule slipping and the Russian abandonment of the MOX approach? The authorizers delinked the U.S. and Russia project, meaning they want the U.S. MOX project to go forward with or without any Russian progress. The U.S. material, frankly, is not at risk. What we really wanted to do was to eliminate the 34 metric tons of the Russians. So now, what is the incentive for the Russians to go forward and eliminate theirs? So, we lost all our leverage. 
   This is not about nonprolifieration, it's all about jobs and economic development in South Carolina. Without any competition, DOE picked the Savannah Rivers site as the place for the MOX project. Some claim that South Carolina only accepted this mission with great reluctance, and insisted on DOE building a MOX plant so that plutonium would have an assured path out of the State. Well, that argument is bogus for two reasons. 
   First, the 34 metric tons of plutonium is not presently at Savannah River. The vast majority of it is stored at the Pantex plant in Texas. The government does not have an obligation to get this material out of South Carolina because this material isn't in South Carolina. 
   Second, some folks assume that construction operation of the MOX plant somehow guarantees this plutonium material will leave their State. Well, it doesn't. We have testimony on the record from DOE making very clear that Yucca Mountain will be full to its authorized capacity by the year 2010. Any material generated after that date, whether spent MOX reactor fuel or even vitrified plutonium, will remain in storage 
   onsite until Yucca is expanded or a second repository is built. That means this plutonium material will remain in South Carolina for a long time. And during that time, they're going to be able to sue us for $100 million a year because we haven't moved it. Does this sound dumb? Does this sound like smart business? Not to this Member. 
   I had high hopes that the Secretary of Energy had the background and skills to make a real difference at DOE, and certainly on this project he could have made a difference. But I have lost confidence in him, and it started over his unwillingness to change course on the MOX project when circumstances changed. 
   There is plenty of blame to go around. Not only has the administration stubbornly insisted on ``staying the course'' on this troubled project, but the authorizing committees with jurisdiction have failed to exercise oversight and taken action on MOX. Even the fiscal conservatives in my own party, who were so anxious to criticize every earmark, miss the fact that this project will waste $11 billion of taxpayer dollars. I want you to know under my watch, when I was chairman of this, we gave it zero funding. And I would have liked to have done that. But I understand the pressures on the  chairmen on both the committee and the subcommittee. And frankly, they have reduced the level significantly from the requested amount. 
   I really appreciate the fact that the chairman of the full committee and Mr. Visclosky made a statement, the statement was actually by Mr. Visclosky and supported by Chairman Obey. And the chairman said, ``The MOX plant is one of only a few construction activities supported in the bill. And DOE is put on notice that the first sign of significant cost growth, schedule slip or requirements change, the committee will shut this project down.'' In future years, maybe this project will run off the rails, and I want Members to see what happens here. 
   I offered to the administration and to others not to build this plant the way they're building it. I think it's silly to build 34 metric ton capacity and then have to tear the plant down and send it out to Utah and put it underground. What I really wanted to do, and offered to do, was build a plant that we could design up front to where we could do other types of fuels in this, rather than the weapons-grade plutonium, but nobody seems to be listening anywhere at this point. But I do appreciate the full chairman and the chairman of the subcommittee and their comments. 
   I want to talk about the policy on earmarks. I think we've got that straightened out now. I wish it had been in this bill, but I think it's going to move forward. And I think we fail in our responsibility if we don't do oversight. I think it's good to take out both the President's earmarks and our earmarks. I did that before. Any new starts that were in the bill, I took them out when I was chairman, and I want to congratulate the chairman now for doing the same thing. We need to provide more oversight. 
   I really get upset that the way the Corps of Engineers is done today is we get no real input into that. It's all basically done by an agency within the White House and by some people that we don't even meet with and we don't even know. They are saying what's going to go forward in somebody's community or not going forth in somebody's community; and frankly, we're here and know our communities better than somebody in some agency that we can't find. 
   I want to just conclude by saying I am pleased that Chairman Visclosky has continued the bipartisan cooperation in this bill. I am proud to be a part of a subcommittee that focuses on getting the job done efficiently and does not let partisanship get in the way of doing the right thing for the American people. 
   This subcommittee could not get the job done so well without exceptional staff. I want to thank Dixon Butler, Taunja Berquam, Scott Burnison, Terry Tyborowski and Lori Maes on the majority side for their hard work and dedication. I might say, many of those people worked when I was the chairman before, and I thank the majority for keeping them, and for the good work that all of them have done. 
   I also want to thank Chris Frabotta, our Corps detailee this year, who comes from the Corps' Wilmington District and has served in Iraq. I also want to thank Kevin Cook, Ben Nicholson and Rob Blair on our minority subcommittee staff, and Shari Davenport on the chairman's personal staff and Kenny Kraft on my staff for a great job. We have all worked together on this bill for a number of years, and we are continuing to do that. 
   I just really want to thank my chairman, my partner on this bill. I frankly intend to be as good a partner to the chairman as he was to me when I was the chairman. And the only way we can solve some of the problems of the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy is, frankly, for us to continue working together. 
   Despite my concerns about the level of spending without congressional direction, I intend to support this bill to the full. And I encourage the other members of the committee to do so as well. 
   Once again, I thank the chairman for his courtesy, and I look forward to working with him for a number of years. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOBSON. I thank the gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert) for her interest in this area. She is correct; the committee fully expects DOE to fulfill its commitment, recognizing the exact amount will change because the core research funding in this bill deviates from the President's request. And this DOE funding is in addition to the $15 million the subcommittee is providing NRC to support university programs.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition of the amendment to reduce funding for the Corps of Engineers construction account. And let me give you some perspective on this. 
   This account is already chronically underfunded by the administration, and it has been in the past. And there's already a backlog of several billion dollars of Corps construction projects. 
   Projects already underway, I'm going to talk about one here, just to give you an example of what happens, such as the Olmsted Lock and Dam, wind up costing far more and taking far longer to complete because of funding constraints in this account. 
   The subcommittee is trying to do the responsible thing by dedicating sufficient funds to address this backlog. Our priority is on completing projects that are already underway and limiting new starts. And I can tell you there were a lot of Members when I was chairman that got really ticked off at me, especially new Members, because they had new starts and we wouldn't do them because we said we've got to finish what we've got before we go on to other things. 
   The Olmsted Dam, an example. It was supposed to be completed in 20 years and for a cost of $700 million. Because we didn't do it and fund it right, and money was taken and put into other accounts, that's now grown to $1.5 billion to finish this very needed dam on the Ohio River. And the project still isn't done. We don't have the money to fund all that they could use on this project in any one year. 
   Part of the problem is that this Congress, over the years, keeps adding projects to our account, and then we don't fund them, or we fund them partially, and the cost goes up. 
   I think it would be irresponsible, at this point, with the things that we've put into effect, to stop new starts, to complete projects and get them finished and stop this cost growth, to take this money out now. Frankly, this is one account where I think we could have used more money over the years and we could have done a better job. 
   He is right when we talk about Sacramento. Sacramento, those levees were built years ago, some of them by farmers, some of them by we don't know who. And they haven't been maintained to the degree they should be maintained. And it's a problem waiting to happen. 
   We're trying to take responsible steps, but we've run into the red tape and stuff. The Corps is trying. We've tried to do some things with the Corps. We're continuing to improve the Corps. 
   Frankly, 4 years ago when I became chairman, there were a lot of things wrong with the Corps that we've made right. I think the Corps is doing a much better job today. They've got a lot of new management techniques that we're using that they weren't doing in the past. 
   I'll give you an example. When I became chairman I asked to see their vision for this country and the waterways. They didn't have one. We asked them, What is your 5-year development plan for the waterways of this country? They didn't have one. But they do now. 
   Now is not the time to stop them, because under Chairman Visclosky, and previously, we've started to do the right thing to stop this cost increase and to get this under control. And frankly, if we would take this amendment, we would do great damage to the infrastructure or the future infrastructure of this country. 
   So I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The bill includes a $33 million cut to Nuclear Power 2010. While that level may be difficult for some to accept, I fully support it. 
   Nuclear Power 2010 was designed to facilitate industry decisions to build and operate new nuclear power plants in the U.S. And that would be great for America. We need a dramatic increase in reliable, safe baseload energy; and I would much rather see it come from nuclear energy than from coal plants. 
   Unfortunately, most of the funding that we have provided for Nuclear Power 2010 doesn't go to help industry figure out our untested regulatory process or to identify new sites for plants. Most of the funding in this account has been provided to support the work of reactor designers. There is little uncertainty about reactor design. It doesn't need our support through this program. And there's really no such thing as struggling mom-and-pop reactor design teams. But I do know that we must continue to support design for the next generation of reactors. This bill does just that. It increases our support to the Gen IV nuclear design program by $79 million. That's where nuclear R&D should be funded, not from Nuclear Power 2010. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment. 
   I yield additional time to the gentleman from Florida.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, most of the $142 million proposed as an increase in the account would support research and development of carbon capture and sequestration technology. No matter what energy future one believes in, fossil fuels will play a significant role. This increase would fund the R&D that we've simply got to do to isolate the carbon and store it to reduce emissions.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman from Nevada's amendment, as he might expect and as his colleague might expect. 
   At some point we all have to go beyond parochial politics and do the right thing for the entire Nation. This is a NIMBY approach: ``not in my backyard.'' Under any scenario you might imagine, from the construction of new nuclear power plants to shutting down all existing plants tomorrow, from continuing with the once-through fuel to cycle to beginning to recycle our spent nuclear fuel, we will need the first repository at Yucca Mountain. If we pursue recycling, we can avoid the need to build eight more Yucca Mountains, but we still need that first repository. 
   The Federal Government has a statutory and contractual obligation, already adjudicated in the courts. It is costing us money by not getting it operational on Yucca Mountain. 
   But this is not solely a question about what to do with commercial spent fuel. One-tenth of Yucca's capacity by weight, and up to one-third of its capacity by volume, is dedicated to defense spent fuel and high-level waste. 
   Without Yucca Mountain this material will stay put in places like Hanford, Idaho, Savannah River, and West Valley. Many of these sites already have enforceable cleanup agreements requiring these materials to be shipped off to the geologic repository. 
   I would like to think we don't need a repository, but we do need a repository. We need it now, not 100 years. We need to move forward with this. And my real desire is that we won't have to build eight of them someplace and certainly not in Nevada. But we have got to finish this one off. It is a waste of taxpayers' money not to do it. 
   I urge opposition to this amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I rise in opposition to the amendment to reduce funding for the Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance account. I confess that I don't understand this amendment beyond its superficial attempt to reduce bottom-line spending. This country has already expended billions of dollars in our water resources infrastructure. Much of that infrastructure is quite old and needs major rehab. I would invite any of the Members around that want to go and look, go look at the dams and the locks and the rivers that we have and look at the aging infrastructure that is there. 
   As any responsible homeowner knows, much of critical maintenance is penny-wise and pound-foolish if you put it off. The same maxim applies to our Nation's water resources infrastructure, though with a much larger role at stake. 
   And if we get it wrong, much more than just dollars are at stake. A large part of the failures that caused such a devastating loss of life and property in New Orleans came from inadequately maintained flood control projects. We cannot afford to make this mistake again.  
   Even the President said we have got to increase O&M. The President dramatically increased O&M. What I hear from everybody here is, well, they're always right down there. Well, they're not always right down there. They have never put the right amounts in this bill to begin with when it comes to energy and water, especially the water side. 
   So I oppose this amendment. Cutting funding for operation and maintenance for the Corps of Engineers is foolish and irresponsible at this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (EXPRESSING THE CONDOLENCES OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL E. GILLMOR, A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE OF OHIO -- (House of Representatives - September 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember our good friend PAUL GILLMOR. Just yesterday, the three of us rode together in from Columbus. 
   I saw him in the airport, and I said, Hi, GILLMO. He said, Hi, Honorable DAVE, and we started to talk, as we did often, because we've known each other a long time. 
   And I said, What'd you do, and he told me about going to the floods. And  then we got into boats and he told us about his boat and the times he was having on the lake with his children and Karen, and he was happy. 
   Then we started to talk business, because PAUL wasn't just a legislator. He was a businessman, too, and he was starting a bank in Florida. He says, You want to invest? I said, Well, we've been talking about that. So we talked about that for a while, and he was happy, and we were all happy. We were colleagues, friends. 
   I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for PAUL GILLMOR. When PAUL GILLMOR was president of the senate, I lost an election and got appointed to the State senate that PAUL GILLMOR was president then for a few more weeks before we went in the minority, and he helped pick me. He picked me, and the newspaper read ``Loser Wins.'' But PAUL GILLMOR set me on the way. 
   I've never lost another election, thanks to PAUL GILLMOR. PAUL GILLMOR was always there, and I think his staff knows that. 
   I met a young man then in the State senate named Mark Wellman who was working for PAUL then. He works with PAUL to this day. That's the kind of loyalty people had to PAUL GILLMOR. 
   I know of no politician in Ohio today who doesn't have respect for PAUL GILLMOR and wasn't his friend. He transcended partisanship. He had his way about the things he had to get done, but it never became personal. 
   When we were in the legislature, both sides had great respect for PAUL GILLMOR, and we used to meet together and talk about things together. PAUL GILLMOR was a unique person in that respect because there's always somebody out there that's got it in for somebody, but they didn't have it in for PAUL GILLMOR because he was what I would call a true gentleman. 
   We're SAEs and Ralph's an SAE, too, and PAUL went to Ohio Wesleyan, and I went to Ohio Wesleyan. We went there at the same time. But I would meet people when I got in the State senate, and they said, Do you know SKIP, SKIP GILLMOR? I said, No, I don't know SKIP GILLMOR. I know Senator GILLMOR, but he was SKIP GILLMOR to all the people at Ohio Wesleyan. And they loved him at Ohio Wesleyan, and they still do. One of the first calls I got today was from people at Ohio Wesleyan saying what do we do. I said I don't know. 
   We've lost a good friend. I hope Karen and the children can review the statements that have been made about PAUL today. It's something that is not said about a lot of people. He was a good man, he was a great man, and he was a great father to his children, which is the most important thing, and we're going to miss him.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE RALPH REGULA, THE HONORABLE DEBORAH PRYCE AND THE HONORABLE DAVID HOBSON -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. I want to pay tribute to my colleagues and my friends, Ralph Regula and Deborah Pryce. 
   To be honest, it's a little surreal standing here doing this because I'm joining them in retirement at the end of this term, but I'd like to take a few moments to talk about both of them. 
   Ralph and Mary showed up in Urbana, Ohio when I was running for Congress. And I pulled up in my pickup truck. I had one too. It was burgundy, it wasn't red. That was my campaign color. With a big sign, Hobson for Congress. 
   And Ralph's walking down the street, and I never met Ralph or Mary before. And Ralph says, I've been reading about you; and I think we're going to get along just fine. And he was right. We did. 
   And I came to Congress and I got elected. And I came down here and JOHN BOEHNER wanted to be on the Ag Committee, and I wanted to be on the Ag Committee. And we got in a little tussle about that. And Ralph says, hey, if he wants it that bad, let him have it. You could never do enough for them, and you can never get off the committee. And by the way, there's a transportation bill coming up this year and he said, I think I can get you on that Transportation Committee. And you're going to get a lot of stuff for Ohio. And I did. I got everything that the Governor asked for. And I got a bike trail I didn't really want in the beginning, but Mr. Oberstar liked bike trails, and I showed up for him on some meetings, and suddenly I got almost as much money for bike trails as I did for highways. And I really wanted the highways, but the bike trails turned out to be a great thing. 
   Then Ralph came to me later on. And this is the way Ralph is, and this why our delegation over the years has been such a good delegation, because when he went into the Committee on Committees, he worked to place us all around within the committees so that Ohio had a voice when legislation was being done, whether it be on the authorizing committee or the Appropriations Committee. Ralph had us covered so that our State benefited and our people grew on those committees to points where, at one time, I don't know how many committee chairman we had when we were in the majority, but we had quite a number and we had the Appropriations Committee covered. We were the only State that had two cardinals when we were on the Appropriations Committee when we were in the majority. That was due to Ralph because Ralph came to me and he said, would you like to be on the Appropriations Committee? I didn't ask him. He came to me and he said, would you like to do this? And he was sharing, and that's the way Ralph Regula was. He shared. Ralph Regula shared the whole time he was here, and even today, about what we're all about, of doing good for this country. 
   He's been a mentor to all of us in the delegation. He's been a great friend to Ohio, and he's done a lot of really neat things for Ohio and the country. 
   One of the things we've both done together and it's actually, some money was put in, most of you didn't see it, but it got in there in the CR to take care of the Everglades, because Ralph Regula is probably the father of most of the restoration in the Everglades. And I've helped him do that when I became chairman of energy and water. And the Everglades we have looked at is not a treasure for Florida, or not even a national treasure, it's an international treasure, and we've saved it for our grandchildren and their children if we could get the things done that we need to do. 
   He's also worked very hard for things, not just in his district that he felt were good for Ohio, such as the Cleveland Clinic, NASA Glenn, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. He's done great things with the parks all over the country. He's done great things with research, education. He's just been an outstanding Member for many, many years of this Congress. I consider he and Mary true dear friends. 
   Mary is also very giving. You've heard the good work she's done. But also she was a mentor to my wife when we came. She got my wife into the chairs to become head of the congressional club, all the spouse groups of both the House and the Senate. She got my wife into the chairs, and my wife became president of that, just as Mary had done many years before. Didn't have to do that, but it was their way of sharing and caring for people from Ohio. And we both, my wife Carolyn and myself really appreciate their friendship over the years. 
   Something that Ralph and Deborah and myself have all worked on together is this GME for children's hospitals across the country. Our delegation, when John was here, John became a convert to that, Kasich when he was here because he had a personal situation in his family, and we all worked on that. We all worked on a number of hospital issues. 
   And going back to Ralph, I can remember once when I was in the Speaker's office, I was working on durable medical equipment, and the Speaker finally said to me, shut up, Hobson. You got a billion dollars. Shut up. Get it down. And Ralph said, Dave, you'd better be quiet and we'd better move on. So we did move on. 
   But Deborah, Pat and myself have represented Central Ohio, and Deborah's made a real difference for Central Ohio. And we've all worked together on a number of projects for the community. The Rickenbacker International Intermodal facility is going to create 20,000 new jobs over the next 2 decades. That wouldn't have been done without Deborah's hard work with all of us to try to get this done. 
   The VA clinic in Central Ohio, again a product that we've all three worked on. We had hearings in Columbus on the VA Clinic. All of our districts were impacted by it. Fortunately, it turned out to be in my district, but we all  worked to make sure that's a reality for the veterans of Central Ohio, so that they can get health care in a better situation in their local community. 
   We worked on the Defense Supply Center during the BRAC, which most of the people, it's in my district, but most of the people live in Pat and Deborah's district. And again, we worked as a unit, the three of us worked together. We were partners in this. When she ran for leadership, we were partners to help her get into leadership and be the highest ranking female ever in the Republican delegation, and frankly, in this Congress, until Speaker Pelosi was elected. And that's a real tribute to Deborah and her leadership, but also to our delegation, who all worked together to make sure that Deborah got there. 
   And another place she's been just a tireless advocate on behalf of the Ohio State University and Columbus Children's Hospital. We have great programs in both places that are attributed to Deborah and her hard work. At Children's Hospital in Columbus there's a number of programs there. We just did an autism program that will be great for children with autism, which is afflicting so many young children in our region, and it's going to be working with the Children's Hospital in Columbus, and also with Wright Patterson Air Force base and Children's Hospital in Dayton. And I've had a number of people call and thank Deborah and us for putting this together. 
   And Ohio State, she's been the premier leader for all the stuff that's happened at Ohio State University, which is her alma mater. And she's been tireless in fighting for better quality education, but also in getting the facilities and the programs there to make sure that Ohio State is a premier, leading institution in our region. And frankly, it has moved up, under her tenure, to be, moved up dramatically in the research that it does for this country while Deborah has been representing that facility. 
   And that's even true that PAT TIBERI played the trumpet. But you must have played the whole band because we got a lot more stuff there since you've been here working on this. 
   I think probably in addition to her leadership here of our caucus and working on the health care things that she's done, there's a bill that passed that I think is probably the crowning glory she might share with you of her being here and that was the bill that was named for her daughter, Caroline, and one that dramatically increases funding for pediatric cancer research, and it was signed into law this year. That's a lasting tribute and it's making a great difference in the lives of so many families touched by pediatric cancer. 
   These are two great Members that I've had the privilege of serving with here. 
   In closing, I'd like to say I've really enjoyed serving with them, but I've really enjoyed serving in Congress. It's been an honor for all of us, I'm sure, to have been here to work with our colleagues. And I know when you look on TV you say oh, you watch this floor sometimes and you say, all they do is bicker amongst themselves. Well, you see it here, but you don't see the great work that goes on behind the scenes where Members get together and work together, talk together and get the country's work done. And I think it's unfortunate that the public doesn't understand the great friendships that are here across the aisle and within delegations as we do our work in furthering the work of this country on behalf of all the citizens of this country. 
   So I knew it was time for me to leave. I didn't know RALPH or DEBORAH, where they were going to be at the point, but I made up my decision. We each made up our own decisions. And I knew that it was time to move on. But I've got to tell you, it's been a pleasure to work with everyone in this Congress, and especially our delegation, both Democrats and Republicans. We have not had the rancor between Democrats and Republicans. 
   And I'm really saddened tonight when we do this, not for us, but there's two people who are not here that were dear friends of mine, Paul Gillmor. I wouldn't be here if Paul Gillmor hadn't gotten me appointed to the State Senate. And Stephanie Tubbs Jones became one of my best friends. We traveled all over the world looking at military bases together. And she would, if I flew to Cleveland to see my daughter and we were on the same plane, I didn't have a car there, she would drive me to my daughter's house and take me there, and we became true friends. I took she and her husband on their 25th wedding anniversary. She wanted to go on a codel, and I said I'll give you the best party that you can ever have if you'll go on this trip and get Mervyn to go with us. And those were the days when you could do that. We had a great party for them. And she was a wonderful Member of this Congress. 
   You know, maybe there were some things in the political realm that we all disagreed with. But as people, we all cared about each other, and that's what's important. 
   So thank you for your service tonight, all of us together, and thank you, STEVE, for giving me the time to speak.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Ohioan and a great American, Congressman RALPH REGULA of Ohio. Ralph was elected to represent the 16th Congressional District in 1972 and has served in this body since he was first sworn in as a Member in January 1973. He is the longest serving Member of Congress from Ohio in our State's history with unbroken service totaling 36 years, and he will be retiring at the conclusion of this session. 
   In his second term, RALPH was appointed to the House Appropriations Committee, an unusual act at that time, as Members had historically served multiple terms before being appointed to the prestigious committee. Over the course of more than three decades of service on the committee, Congressman REGULA has made his mark in many areas, and I would like to highlight some of them this evening. 
   First, after having served on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee since 1975, RALPH became its Chairman in 1995 and served in that capacity for 6 years. As chairman his accomplishments are too many to mention here, but I want to address a few of the groundbreaking changes he made that will have lasting benefits well into the future. 
   Chairman REGULA focused on making critical changes to ensure that the most important issues and problems were addressed by the agencies in the Interior bill. Much of what he accomplished didn't make headlines. He insisted on an emphasis on ``taking care of what we have,'' and made tremendous strides in reducing the backlog of maintenance projects on Federal lands, in Indian schools and hospitals and in cultural institutions like the Smithsonian Institution. 
   He instituted a pilot recreation fee program whereby the National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, Forests and Bureau of Land Management charged users of those resources modest fees. The fees were then available for making necessary improvements for the benefit of the visitors to those lands. This concept of recreation fees had many naysayers, but RALPH persisted and worked for years to show the merits of the program. He was right, and as of today, nearly $2 billion has been paid in recreation fees, and those fees have resulted in tremendous improvements in visitor services in our National Parks, Forests and other Federal lands. 
   He was a critical leader on the cleanup of the Everglades in Florida. He insisted that restoration of natural resources should be the primary focus of the program and that the Department of the Interior have a seat at the table to ensure that decisions on water distribution and development were not made separately from, and without consideration of, natural resource restoration needs. 
   As Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, he identified management shortfalls in the agencies under the subcommittee's jurisdiction and helped agencies help themselves by addressing management improvements. For example, he oversaw the complete overhaul of the National Park Service construction program. The program lacked a national priority setting process, and its list of construction needs included many projects that were unrelated to construction projects. Chairman Regula made sure that the entire program was changed to incorporate meaningful measurement criteria for identifying and prioritizing projects and that the management structure was streamlined to ensure that the emphasis was on getting the job done rather than designing grand concepts to justify a bloated bureaucracy. 
   Congressman Regula has had a tremendous impact on energy research and development. He fought for a balanced national energy strategy. He focused limited Federal funds on improving the efficiency and cleanliness of fossil fuels at the same time as we pursued renewable and alternative energy sources. He conducted extensive oversight on what we had gotten for the billions of dollars  invested in energy research since the establishment of the Department of Energy. He continued and expanded critical research on natural gas infrastructure improvements, oil field productivity improvements, developing fuel cells for electric power generation and transportation applications, and decreasing emissions from coal-fired power plants. He recognized that Federal energy research only works when we have a joint government/industry effort and that most major energy breakthroughs have come from industrial research efforts and from small entrepreneurs in the private sector. 
   Ralph, a farmer himself, was the moving force behind the establishment of the Children's Farm at the National Zoo. He worked tirelessly for several years to bring this exhibit to fruition. It provides a ``hands on'' experience for young children to see what life on a dairy farm is like and has become one of the most popular exhibits at the zoo. 
   Congressman Regula continuously demonstrated his strong commitment to doing the right thing for both the Government agencies in the Interior bill and for the American taxpayer. He made sure that the Federal land management agencies made tremendous strides in improving those lands, in reducing their maintenance backlogs, and instituting management improvements. He made sure that energy and mineral development on Federal lands was expanded responsibly and in an environmentally sound manner. He made sure that essential science programs--dealing with critical issues such as satellite imagery, earthquakes. volcanoes, the biological sciences, landslides and mapping--in the United States Geological Survey were maintained. He made sure that priority school, hospital and clinic construction for Native Americans were addressed in annual appropriations bills. 
   Republican term limits in the House required Ralph to give up his chairmanship of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee in 2000. At the request of then-Chairman Bill Young, Regula took the reigns of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee beginning in 2001 and held the position for a full 6 years until 2006. 
   Regula took the chairmanship, having never served on the subcommittee as a rank and file member, but with a good staff and as a quick study, he masterfully managed a bill with the largest domestic spending level in the Federal Government and with many of the most divisive policy issues. 
   George W. Bush had just been elected President and had come to Washington with a major domestic policy objective--the improvment and accountability of our Nation's education system on behalf of our children. During that first year, Regula held hearings on the administration's budget request for the three cabinet departments and nearly 500 programs funded in the bilI, putting together a balanced, bi-partisan bill. At the same time, Congress' education commit1ees were drafting and negotiating the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB. 
   While endorsing increased accountability and standards for students being included in the new NCLB, Regula, himself a former teacher and principal, knew that the keys to improving student achievement were the teacher and the principal. He provided the necessary funding increases for Title I, Federal funding for the disadvantaged under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act/No Child Left Behind Act, and continued support for School Improvement and Innovative Education grants to help local schools address these new accountability and school improvement standards. Further, he focused targeted funding to improve teacher training and performance within the provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act through programs such as Math and Science Partnerships and the Comprehensive School Reform program. 
   His motto became, ``We need a good teacher in every classroom in this county.'' With this motto Regula knew that a well prepared and well-trained teacher would indeed lead to improved student achievement. 
   Additionally, he provided funding for innovative demonstration programs to improve teacher education, training and performance which are today infusing our Nation's classrooms with teachers from a host of diverse educational and work backgrounds. These programs include Teach for America, now the largest recruiter of college graduates which brings graduates from our Nation's top colleges into our most challenging schools for a 2 year service commitment and Troops to Teachers which provides financial assistance to those retiring from the military to transition into our Nations classrooms. The Teacher Incentive Fund is being adopted by key school districts around the country to incentivize teachers to teach in the most challenging districts and schools. 
   When Regula took the helm of the subcommittee, it was the beginning of year 3 of a 5-year commitment to doubling the funding for biomedical research through the National Institutes of Health, NIH. Our country's biomedical research efforts--supported by NIH and carried out in universities and institutes throughout the country--are premier in the world. Over time, however, the increasing costs of conducting research began to erode the ability of researchers to compete for limited grant dollars, resulting in fewer grants and an increasingly difficult climate for attracting young 
   scientists into health research. The doubling effort received bipartisan support from both Congress and the new administration, and, despite very tight subcommittee allocations, REGULA oversaw the completion of the 5-year doubling effort that brought the NIH research effort from $13 billion to $26 billion annually. Today, this number stands at more than $29 billion in annual health research funding to improve the lives of all Americans. 
   While Federal funding for training of physicians and specialists is provided nearly exclusively through Medicare, Federal training for pediatricians and pediatric specialists had been virtually non-existent when Congressman REGULA took the chairmanship. He understood immediately, though, that the most important years in one's life are the early years and, without a well-trained pediatric workforce, we are not investing wisely in our Nation's children. Therefore, REGULA ensured that Federal dollars were in place every year to assist in training these critical physicians at children's hospitals throughout the U.S. After completing their training, these physicians and specialists are now caring for and treating children across the country, not just where children's hospitals are located. Today, REGULA remains one of this Congress' most vocal advocates of Children's Graduate Medical Education funding. 
   While many in national politics and health policy continue to wring their hands about the number of people in our country without health insurance, REGULA saw the value of community health centers in providing healthcare to the uninsured and under-insured. During his tenure as Chairman, funding for these centers rose from $1.2 billion to nearly $2 billion. Today more than 4,000 service delivery sites exist throughout the U.S., providing primary healthcare to over 15 million people. 
   During REGULA'S tenure, health policy experts became increasingly concerned about our Nation's ability to cope with newly emerging infectious diseases, especially as we watched how quickly disease could travel across the globe with the example of SARS. Further, in the wake of the September 11 tragedy and the anthrax attacks, these same experts called our attention to our vulnerability to biological hazards. Working with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, Ralph provided the key funding to step up the resources of the CDC to protect the Nation and prepare it for possible intentional biological threats against our population. Similarly, with the rise and spread of avian influenza, RALPH'S subcommittee appropriated new funding to help the Nation, as well as at-risk countries in the developing world, improve the ability to detect, prevent, and control a potential pandemic flu strain. Today, pandemic preparedness and response plans are in place at the national, State, and local levels of Government, and research and development is ongoing on both a pandemic flu vaccine and new antiviral medicines. 
   Income support and healthcare payments to the elderly and disabled through the Social Security and Medicare programs are funded through mandatory spending; however, it is the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies Subcommittee that provides the critical administrative funding to ensure that benefit payments are processed efficiently and in a timely manner. While Congressman REGULA knew that ensuring adequate staffing to these critical agencies would never be a top media story or 
   even a leading policy topic, he understood that Americans' dependence on these services required his good management of these agencies and financial support to ensure their efficient operation. Following enactment of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program, RALPH saw to it that the agencies had the financial support necessary to carry out the new program. 
   Finally, very outspoken in his belief that education is the key to our Nation's future in the global economy, RALPH also understood that educational growth is more comprehensive than a traditional classroom. As a result, he is still a leading spokesman for the One Stop Centers funded through the Department of Labor. These community-driven centers assist workers at all points in their working lives with training to improve their skills or to develop them in new business areas. Their training programs come through community colleges, technical schools and other accredited programs. Throughout his tenure as chairman, Congressman REGULA supported these centers with both Federal funding through his subcommittee and through his regular stump speeches about the terrific partnerships these One Stops can have with the businesses and  employees in their communities, thus ensuring the continued economic well-being of these communities. 
   RALPH'S impacts throughout his district and the State of Ohio are too many to name here. Suffice it to say that the residents of our State enjoy benefits of a premier national park in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, improved healthcare institutions, schools, higher education institutions, including medical schools, highway infrastructure and the arts as a result of his work in this body. 
   Throughout these 36 years of service in the House, RALPH REGULA has remained a serious legislator with an open mind and a kind demeanor. He has worked effectively and professionally among his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that the work of our Nation gets done. He has exemplified the words of Ronald Reagan when he said that ``there is no end to what you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit.'' 
   This Congress will greatly miss the steady hand, judgment and leadership of Congressman RALPH REGULA. We wish him all the best as he leaves the Congress. I am sure that he and his lovely and talented wife Mary will continue to do great things on behalf of Ohio and the Nation. RALPH, I know your colleagues here, the thousands of folks at the Departments of the Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and the countless independent agencies funded in those two bills, and, most importantly, the American people will not forget all you have accomplished and the impacts that your work has had in improving our lives.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the fair and bipartisan manner in which the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky) as our chairman has used to put this supplemental report together. I fully support the list of congressionally directed projects that it contains. I encourage Members to support these projects and to vote for final passage of the underlying Energy and Water bill.  
   When we first brought this bill to the floor roughly a month ago, I expressed my concern about the absence of detailed project guidance on how to spend this much money. The supplemental report that is before the committee today resolves that concern. 
   Chairman Visclosky and I, and our respective staffs, engaged in a lengthy bipartisan effort to sort through the thousands of earmark requests that we received. We screened the large number of requests to select the projects that had the most merit and were the best fit for inclusion in the Energy and Water bill. We have complied fully with Chairman Obey's direction to reduce the value of our energy earmarks by one-half compared to the amount we funded in fiscal year 2006. 
   The Corps of Engineers faces an enormous backlog of work, somewhere between $12 billion and $60 billion, and that is before the pending WRDA bill adds another $13 billion of unfunded requirements. There is a significant need for additional funding for water resources infrastructure, above and beyond what the administration requested. This supplement provides another $770 million for specific Corps water projects. Within a total appropriation of $5.58 billion for the Corps, less than 14 percent is dedicated to congressionally directed projects. Every one of those projects is already authorized, and every one has been reviewed by the Corps to be sure they have the capability to execute it. Until we make some progress with the backlog of ongoing work, we continue the past practice of not funding any Corps new starts. 
   On the Department of Energy side, the committee recommended $246.5 million for 263 specific projects, which represents a 50 percent reduction from the amount of DOE earmarks contained in our fiscal year 2006 bill. Many of these projects are intended to demonstrate alternative energy technologies. It is important to note that we are spending billions of dollars on DOE's energy security mission, which includes the research, development, demonstration and deployment of advanced energy technologies. If this research is to be worth the investment, and if this research is to improve our energy security by reducing our dependence on imported oil and reducing the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels, then these technologies must ultimately be adopted by the private sector. 
   Therefore, a significant number of our Department of Energy earmarks are ``green'' buildings to demonstrate alternative energy technologies. It is important that we show the American people that there are alternatives to burning fossil fuels for power generation, for transportation, and for heating and cooling, so that builders and consumers know these alternatives are available and affordable. We intentionally put these technology demonstrations in high-traffic settings designed to get a lot of public exposure, such as museums, educational institutions, and community buildings, in order to maximize the value of these demonstrations. 
   We have a constitutional responsibility to appropriate funds for the Federal agencies. That means we do not simply rubber-stamp the administration's project requests, but rather, we put our own mark on the annual agency budgets. That is what this supplement represents. I support this supplement to our bill, and I encourage the other Members to do so as well.  
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Chairman, as I said, I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
   We used a bipartisan process, and I was very involved in strict adherence to the applicable House rules and a thorough examination of Member requests. This process resulted in funding recommendations for the projects that we considered the most meritorious. This project that this amendment attacks is a legitimate use of Federal funds to further the development of the Department of Energy's mission. 
   In closing, I believe this amendment has no basis and should be defeated, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

   Mr. HOBSON. Let me say this: as the gentleman spoke, this came about when I was chairman of the committee. We relooked at what we were doing for HBCU. I happen to have two in my district. These institutions are generally underfunded and generally don't have the ability to put the emphasis on science and technologies that many of us believe these students should have. This is an effort by the committee to direct that money so we can increase taxes and can increase funding to the Federal Government and to other agencies by getting these people involved in science and technology. So I wholeheartedly support the committee's recommendation and would urge to vote down the amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   The question was taken; and the Acting Chairman announced that the noes appeared to have it.

   Mr. HOBSON. I would like to thank my chairman. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. 
   We have put together, I think, a very good bill. This bill is $31.6 billion. The earmarks and the directed spending in this supplemental we're talking about today is about 3 percent of the bill, it's $1.09 billion. There are 777 projects. This includes the plus-ups to the administration's request. In some cases the administration asked for some money, we decided it wasn't quite enough to finish off something, so we added money to it. 
   Let me talk a little bit about the Corps. The administration requested $4.08 billion for 837 projects. The House adds $777 million for 466 projects. There are no new authorizations or new starts. And sometimes the President asks for new starts, Members ask for new starts; we don't have enough money to do new starts, so we stopped new starts. 
   The earmarks are 14 percent of the total Corps' budget. I might add, when we started with the Corps of Engineers, the Corps didn't have a 5-year development plan, they had no vision of where it really wanted to go. It didn't come from the administration to change that, it came with the chairman and myself working together. We changed that in the Corps. That didn't come out of the administration, those nameless people down there who somehow figure out how they're going to spend the money. At least here we know who's spending the money and we know the projects that we're looking at. 
   Title II. The administration requested $551 million for 146 projects. The House added $72 million for 47 projects. 
   In DOE, in title III, the House adds $246.5 million for 263 projects. This represents less than 1 percent of the total DOE budget, which is $32 billion. This is a 50 percent cut to the fiscal year 2006 level. And I might say on the Republican side, it is now a 40 percent split versus the 60 percent as the majority changed. I think we've done a good job at looking at people's needs. 
   Let me give an example. In my State, ODOT is the big highway people, and they always want to do these big projects. And when I want to do something in my town that really impacts people within my city, they don't have time to do it. And even when I do an earmark, they fight me on the earmark because they want to do the big deals. They want to do the big projects that cost a lot of money. And they take care of people, too. But at the local community, I think sometimes we are better off at what we want to do versus what the large agencies want to do. 
   So I want to thank the chairman, and frankly, the staff, who has looked through all these projects. We've looked through all these projects. We've vetted these projects. And we've done as good a job as I think we can in looking at them. And we're not the technical people, but the staff is more technical. We've gone back on the Corps projects and talked to Corps of Engineers and said, do these projects make sense? Are they executable? Can we get them done? And they've come back and said yes. So we have had a review. 
   I think this is a well done bill. I think the earmarks are essential to Congress doing its oversight. I wish, frankly, we could work better with the administration on their earmarks. We don't know what they're going to do. They don't come and talk to us. Even in the hearings, we have no idea where they're going to spend all their money on the projects they want. 
   I think it would be a better process if we could all work together and have more transparency, and did more things at the local level. And we could take out a lot of the bureaucracy that exists in those huge bureaucracies that we tend to fund without anybody ever questioning how much money they're spending there. 
   And I don't want to pay more taxes either. I think the projects here that we do help the quality of life within the communities where we live. 
   I support the bill. I'm opposed to this amendment. And I would request that Members oppose this amendment.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (DAYTON AVIATION HERITAGE NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK EXPANSION -- (House of Representatives - July 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4199, which would expand the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park to include additional sites associated with the lives and work of Wilbur and Orville Wright. 
   Few technological advances have transformed the world or our nation's economy, society, culture, and national character as the development of powered flight. Therefore, it is important to preserve the historical sites associated the Wright brothers' achievements in the field of aviation. That is what this bill will do. 
   Over the years, the Ohio congregational delegation has worked together to preserve and promote Ohio's rich aviation history. A few years ago, I, along with Congressman Tony Hall, had the privilege of introducing the bill that later became law to designate eight Miami Valley counties and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park as part of a National Aviation Heritage Area. Today, I commend my colleague, Congressman Mike Turner, for his leadership in sponsoring this bill to add two additional sites to the aviation park. 
   Specifically, H.R. 4199 will add Hawthorne Hill, which was Orville Wright's home in Oakwood, and several Wright Factory buildings in Dayton, where the brothers conducted research and testing. These sites would be part of the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, which already includes such historic sites as: Huffman Prairie Flying Field, the Wright Cycle Company Complex, and the Paul Laurence Dunbar House. Together, these sites are an important part to nation's history, and Ohio's cultural heritage. 
   Again, I commend Congressman Turner for his leadership to preserve and promote Ohio's aviation heritage with this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4419.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 28, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. First of all, let me thank the chairman and the ranking member for putting together a good bill. I appreciate the hard work they have done on this bill and on approving this earmark. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike $500,000 in funding to support the expansion of the East Asian Studies and International Business Program at Wittenberg University in my hometown of Springfield, Ohio. 
   This program will give Wittenberg business students the cultural background and hands-on experience they need to compete in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. It achieves this by providing college students a curriculum in which they can learn about Asian language, religion and cultures. This understanding is vital to establishing business relationships, especially abroad. This is an expansion of the program. In the past, this has been truly just a learning experience in an intellectual way, not focused on business. 
   They will immerse themselves in these programs while working for overseas companies through internships and study-abroad programs. In fact, in 1999, James Scott of Yale University and Timothy Cheek of Colorado College wrote that Wittenberg is unique among liberal arts schools in the accomplishments and intellectual breadth of its East Asian Studies program. No other peer school can offer such a distinguished curriculum, covering language, religion, classical civilizations, philosophy, history and the culture of all the major East Asian civilizations. 
   These business outreach programs are of enormous importance, as the global marketplace dramatically increases competition while rendering borders irrelevant. According to the United States Census Bureau foreign trade statistics, U.S. trade with China and Japan, the United States' second and fourth largest trading partners respectively, amounted to over $550 billion in 2006, representing approximately one-fifth of our total foreign trade. 
   I am confused, Mr. Chairman, on this amendment, because there is no reason really to oppose this program at this time, because we owe it to our students to equip them with every advantage as they prepare to face the challenges and opportunities of the global job market of the 21st century. 
   One of these tools we can offer our students is the opportunity to study abroad. The Institute For International Education of Students conducted the first large-scale survey exploring the lasting impact of study abroad programs on students' personal, professional and academic lives. The survey of IES alums found that experiences abroad positively affected their outlook and career choices and remained essential in their lives, even after graduation. 
   One of the most compelling reasons to fund business study abroad programs is to train future global commercial leaders to be more effective in operating in an increasingly interconnected world, taking into account foreign and international political and economic systems. 
   The IES survey found that 97 percent of the respondents said studying abroad increased their maturity; 96 percent reported improved self-confidence; 89 percent played a better role in their ability to handle uncertainty; and 95 percent stated their experience had lasting impacts on their worldwide view. 
   Mr. Chairman, before I entered public service, I was a small businessman. I can tell you there have been numerous occasions where my understanding, or lack thereof, of the background and experience of the person sitting across the table would have helped me much better in negotiating some of the things that I negotiated. A number of those people were from around the world. A better understanding of that, a better intellectual capability. 
   Expanding this program will help this small university in my district present a better challenge to the students that are there. 
   Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge everyone to be opposed to this amendment. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Speaker, we would not be in this unfortunate situation if our colleagues in the Senate had actually passed their bill. The House fulfilled its appropriation responsibilities; the other body did not. 
   I have no problem with my majority colleague on the subcommittee, the distinguished chairman from Indiana. He has involved the minority in the process, treated us fairly, and attempted to protect our interests.  
   Unfortunately, the ground rules established to this resolution disadvantage the House greatly in the negotiations with the Senate. The process adopted by the majority has undermined the ability of the subcommittee to negotiate a good CR and strip out Senate pork. There are a number of significant funding reductions that should have been taken in the CR that were not. 
   Again, I have no fault with my chairman. He tried. But the Senate balked at even citing the need to protect ``important'' Senators. 
   Let me offer a few examples. The fiscal year 2004 omnibus appropriation included a $50 million earmark in the DOE's science account for an indoor rain forest alongside the interstate highway in Iowa, which I opposed, and so did my ranking member at the time, now the chairman. 
   The Department of Energy has been unable to execute this earmark because the sponsor has not produced the necessary non-Federal matching funds. Nearly $45 million remains unspent and unspendable. 
   The House proposed to rescind this earmark, but the Senate refused to consider it. If ever there were a piece of low-hanging fruit ripe to be stripped out of the resolution, this is it. The 109th Congress had its infamous Bridge to Nowhere. The 110th Congress is now building its own legacy, starting with a $50 million ``roadside attraction'' in Iowa. 
   In the NNSA weapons account, the House identified several sources of significant savings. The House proposed a total of $495 million of reductions from weapons activities, but the Senate again refused to accept this reduction because of perceived impact in New Mexico. The final CR contains only $94.5 million of reduction, leaving $400 million of savings untapped. 
   In the fossil fuel account, 2006 funding in Energy included $49.7 million for oil and gas research, which is funded at discretionary spending in fiscal year 2006, but which is now mandatory by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   The House proposed again, rightly, to eliminate this discretionary funding in the CR, which only duplicates the new mandatory funding. Instead, the Senate declared this account to be ``untouchable'' in the strong interest of a particular Senator in West Virginia. 
   Given the House majority passed H.R. 6 to take away perceived windfall profits in the oil and gas industry, it is surprising that it would now allow the same industry to ``double dip'' in the CR. 
   In summary, I would say again that the process being followed with this CR greatly disadvantages the House in our negotiations with the other body. Members should not delude themselves that we have stripped all of the pork from the CR. We have only succeeded in stripping out the House earmarks. Over in the other Chamber, it is, frankly, business as usual. 
   We have had the opportunity to realize a half billion dollars of savings in energy and water portions of the CR and to apply those funds to other priority needs such as education, health care and law enforcement. I hope you all realize that in voting for this continuing resolution today means that you have decided that several hundred million of tax dollars will be better spent on welfare for the nuclear weapons labs than on these other pressing national needs. 
   I encourage Members on both sides of the aisle to vote against this resolution and get rid of the pork.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Mr. Speaker, it's been a tough term for the Ohio delegation. First we lost Paul Gillmor, and now we've lost Stephanie. Too early for both of them in their lives. But I think it's these times when people in the country need to know the friendships that happen in this House. We may differ politically on certain issues, but we don't differ when it comes to making friends and friendships here in this House. 
   Stephanie had that beautiful energy that you will hear about and heard about before about her that we will all remember. She never met a stranger. Wherever we traveled in the world, Stephanie always had that great smile on her face. Whenever we were in Cleveland together--I have a daughter who lives in Cleveland, and Stephanie would give me a ride when I would fly into Cleveland to my daughter's house. She would stop and talk to my grandkids. Even though she was in Dennis' district, she was still working that side of town, too, because Stephanie worked wherever she was.     
   She is a loss to all of us. She worked on issues that transcends this body, these human issues, and the people in her district are not going to forget that, and they truly do have a loss. 
   We traveled together many times to view the troops, and I just came back yesterday from Korea. In Korea, I talked about Stephanie to one of the general officers, and he said, I remember her. When we were in Bosnia, you came there in Thanksgiving and how she related to the troops in her own special way and talked to these young people about what they were doing, what they're going to do in the future. 
   But the most important thing about Stephanie, Stephanie never forgot who she was. She was a friend to all of us, but she never forgot her district. 
   One time, I talked Stephanie into going on a trip with me to Italy, and she said, ``I can't go. It's our 25th wedding anniversary. Mervyn and I want to spend our 25th wedding anniversary together.'' And this was when you could do this. I don't even know if I want to tell this, but she's gone and I'm retiring. So maybe I can tell this story now without going to the Ethics Committee. But I said, ``Stephanie, we're going to give you a party in Venice. You tell Mervyn it's going to be a very romantic time and it isn't going to cost him a cent.'' Guess what. They went on the trip. 
   And even after Mervyn's tragic passing--and I was there with her then--she would recall the great time we had together. And I'm not going to miss her because she's going to be here with all of us, but who's going to miss her is Mervyn, Junior. He's lost not only his mother and his father but his grandparents in a very short period of time, and this is a young man. I hope his aunt can help him, and I hope all of us don't forget this young man and his life. And we're not going to forget Stephanie.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOBSON. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOBSON. Madam Speaker, I want to begin by saying that last night when I was watching the floor debate, my colleague from Connecticut, CHRIS SHAYS, gave one of the best speeches on where we are with regard to the war in Iraq. It was a comprehensive overview of the current situation, and I agree with his views on this debate, and I would like to associate myself with his comments. I hope that my colleagues and those who are following this debate will take a moment to read his remarks. 
   Like Mr. Shays, I rise in opposition to this resolution. This is the wrong resolution to be considering if we in Congress are supposed to be fulfilling our responsibility to provide oversight on how this war is to be conducted. Rather than debating the so-called surge, which is actually taking place, we should be debating how to put policy in place that will bring stability and ensure the security of the American people. 
   Admittedly, the administration has made mistakes in the execution of this war. Many of us, both Democrats and Republicans, have been telling them that from the beginning. Among a number of things that we have been saying has been that they had enough troops to win the war, but they didn't have enough troops to win the peace. But we can't correct those mistakes. What we can do now is to find a strategy on how best to go forward. 
   So the question becomes, what can we do now that gives the Iraqis the best chance to take control of their country, while also allowing our troops to return home with honor? We owe it to the parents and the families of the men and women who have fought and died in this war to not let their lives be lost in vain. That is the message that I have heard many times when I have met with those families in my district and one that many of my colleagues have also heard. 
   Last month, I went on a bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. While we met with the U.S. troops and commanders, we also had a chance to meet with the leaders of those countries, including the prime minister, al-Maliki. He told us that if his country had the command and control equipment and our backing, the Iraqis could begin to take over their own security in 3 to 6 months and that we could begin to redeploy up to 50,000 of our troops. 
   Madam Speaker, we need to make sure that Prime Minister Maliki has the tools and resources to do just that. Frankly, the American people would be better served if that were this debate, instead of this nonbinding resolution. 
   Our focus should be on fixing what needs to be fixed so that the Iraqi people can take control of their country's fate, like they did 2 years ago when they held their first free elections in 50 years. 
   This action will require several steps. For example, as several of my colleagues have already mentioned, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group supports a short term surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad. This is being done. The group also recommended that there be more diplomatic outreach in the region to include countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Syria and even Iran, and this needs to be done by the administration. 
   Further, it is imperative that our U.S. troops begin to transition from a combat role to one focused on training, counterterrorism, force protection and controlling Iraq's borders. 
   My colleagues, the world is watching. Our friends, our enemies are watching and waiting to see what our next move will be. A retreat from Iraq would lead to even more instability in the region and create a haven for terrorist groups who despise freedom and our way of life. 
   What kind of message are we sending when we engage in debate that is essentially a political exercise, rather than one that is on substantive strategy on how to bring stability to the region? 
   Madam Speaker, we cannot accept defeat, but we must insist on making the changes necessary so that the Iraqi people can take the fate of their future in their own hands. There is a phrase that has often been repeated since the war began, and that is as Iraqi forces stand up, U.S. forces can begin to stand down. Defining a workable strategy to achieve that goal should have been the focus of this week's debate, rather than this nonbinding resolution that will not bring us a step closer to stabilizing Iraq and bringing our troops home or achieving stability in this region of the world.  
   Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution.
