<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express to the House my concern about the fact that Chairman Obey and Speaker Pelosi are very, very busy these days. If news reports are to be believed, it's apparent that they're going about doing all of the work of the Appropriations Committee as well as the House almost all alone with almost no input from Democrats or Republicans from the House. 
   Because of that busy schedule, I have been writing to Mr. Obey of late. I have sent him three letters altogether. Last Thursday, I sent him a letter that was signed by the entire Republican membership of the Appropriations Committee urging him to have regular order and full hearings on the supplemental that is before us that represents a huge portion of our spending, and yet there has been no hearing whatsoever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Wolf and Madam Chairman, I can't tell you how much I respect the work that the two of you have done together, and to join on the floor with my friend JESSIE JACKSON in expressing support for this bill, indeed, is a privilege. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise today to support H.R. 2764, the State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs Appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2008. 
   I want to express my appreciation for the work of Mrs. Lowey as well as Mr. Wolf. They are a demonstration project of what we can do when we set partisanship aside and work together on behalf of really our responsibility to lead in this world. 
   This bill is the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences our foreign policy. It provides a total of $34.243 billion including $10.76 billion for State Department operations, international broadcasting, and related agencies, and $23.62 billion for foreign assistance programs. The total is $2.95 billion over last year's level and $700 million less than the President's request. 
   This bill addresses critical issues such as the AIDS pandemic, Child Survival and Health programs, anti-narcotics programs, and our efforts in the global war on terror. 
   Mr. Chairman, it is important that we realize what a critical role this bill plays in the well-being of the world and the security of our Nation. The United States is the last remaining superpower and the sole voice of freedom and democracy around the world. What we do in this bill saves the lives of countless numbers of people in nations that are less fortunate than ours. These funds stabilize fragile democracies around the globe and help our allies in the global war on terror. 
   Now, I know most Members feel they weren't elected to support international assistance programs. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I am sure there are many Members who feel that the United States should dramatically reduce the amount of money we spend around the world and focus our resources on domestic priorities. This sort of isolationist point of view has no place in today's shrinking world. One needs only to look to Europe as an example of a once powerful and influential nation withdrew its resources from around the world and focused inward. What has since been termed as the ``French model'' resulted in massive inflation, high unemployment rates within the country, and severe internal crises. The United States should not follow the ``French model,'' a misguided path that essentially has caused the French to disappear as a powerful force in the world.     
   I remember as a young man attending UCLA I was fortunate to participate in a program that preceded the Peace Corps called Project India. As I joined other young students in traveling to villages around a country where poverty and ever-present caste systems were always visible, I was struck by the importance that personal freedom and opportunity have on the human condition, especially if you had the good fortune of being born in the United States of America. 
   Today, India has outlawed the caste system and is the largest democracy in the world, as well as our strong ally in the global war on terror. I am particularly pleased that in any congressional district there are large numbers of my constituents who are actively involved, advocating for increases in our international assistance program. 
   In recent meetings with the Results Group, with CARE, Bread for the World and others, I have noticed that more and more people are beginning to understand that they, too, have a role in our role for leadership in the world. Theirs are the voices from the grass roots, a perspective that we need as Americans to recognize that we must continue to lead in the world, for indeed, without our leadership, the poor of the world will suffer most. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this fabulous demonstration of work on both sides of the aisle together.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2642, SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 15, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate my colleague yielding me this time. 
   Perhaps the most important counsel I have ever received came from my dear friend and mentor, Dr. Adeline Gunther. ``Gram,'' as we called her, was the founder and guiding light of the University Religious Conference located near the UCLA campus. Gram said to me, ``Always remember, Jerry, what you are not willing to do in order to win.'' 
   Think about that. What you are not willing to do in order to win. 
   Those running the Democratic leadership of the House need desperately to learn that lesson. So enamored with their power after 12 years out of the majority, the Democrat majority is now moving rapidly in the direction of reinventing the authoritarian system that was a part of their control for the previous 40 years. 
   The outrageous movement of the Iraq supplemental to the House floor, without consideration by the Committee on Appropriations and under a closed rule, is the case in point. 
   The supplemental began as a $108 billion request for funding requirements for the troops for the remainder of 2008. This must-pass emergency legislation has now grown to somewhere near $250 billion. A whole array of legislative provisions has been added that could have been and should have been addressed by way of regular order during the appropriations process. 
   Unfortunately, the supplemental will bypass the Appropriations Committee altogether, and through use of parliamentary trickery, avoid the inconvenient input of Democrat and Republican Members who have real expertise in the subject areas involved. 
   Regular order is designed to ensure that people's voices and interests are heard on serious public policy questions as they move through the legislative process. To have the Democrat leadership cut off the people's right to be heard by such a crass parliamentary set of maneuvers results in great harm to the Appropriations Committee and seriously undermines the credibility of the world's most admired legislative body. 
   Only three or four Members, at most, have provided serious input throughout this misguided process. All Members, Democrats and Republicans alike, should be enraged by this arrogant demonstration of dictatorial control. I know from private conversations with many of my friends on the other side of the aisle that there is a great deal of frustration among Democrats with Chairman Obey and Speaker Pelosi for their excessive and abusive control of this process. 
   Madam Speaker, let me assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to exercise every tool available to us to protect the established traditions of the House and the fundamentals of our democratic system. It is clear that Speaker Pelosi is willing to do anything, including stifling the voices of nearly every Member of the House, to win. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to remember the words of my mentor, Dr.  Adeline Gunther, who said, ``Always remember what you are not willing to do in order to win.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. I very much appreciate your recognizing me to respond to my friend, David Obey. 
   I am going to speak just a little bit out of order, for two of my colleagues on the floor, David Obey, the chairman of the committee, and my colleague, Mr. Murtha, the chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, have shared with me, I thought, over some years, the traditional order of this House. I've seen how the committee system works, especially in the Appropriations Committee, making certain that all Members, Democrats and Republicans, had an opportunity to provide input. And now to have us move so far away from that traditional order by way of this process today is a great disappointment to me. 
   I can't help but wonder if maybe there is some lack of commitment to regular order that I had never perceived before. For example, my colleague from San Diego, the chairman of the VA Subcommittee, if he had been given an opportunity, could have marked up and had hearings and otherwise on the VA portions some time ago. 
   This supplemental came from the President well over a year ago. We have had plenty of time to exercise the process in the way that maximizes Members' involvement, remembering that those Members are elected to represent their people at home. 
   And so the procedure we are going through today has undermined that representative process. 
   I think many of my colleagues, particularly those who serve with me on the Appropriations Committee, know that I have a great deal of respect for the senior Senator from West Virginia, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Robert Byrd. While he and I may disagree on issues from time to time, it is fair to say that we both share a deeply held love and respect for this institution. 
   Senator Byrd also reveres the established traditions and precedents of the committee he leads. He understands that we will only truly know what is in the supplemental if it is exposed to the light of day through the regular order committee process. No one, not even the Senate majority leader, is going to tell Senator Byrd to abdicate his devotion to regular order or his responsibility as chairman of his beloved Appropriations Committee. 
   Unfortunately, the adherence to regular order has now been completely abandoned on the House side of the Capitol. Both Chairman Obey and Speaker Pelosi, the sole authors of the House supplemental before us today, have dismissed as ``a nonissue'' those bipartisan voices calling for full committee consideration of this critically important legislation. 
   In conversations with both Republicans and Democrats in the House, it is widely felt that the Democrat leadership has unfairly and wrongly circumvented the House Appropriations Committee process. 
   Further, the House majority has chosen to proceed under a closed rule, eliminating any and all amendments on the House floor, and is intent on bypassing a conference committee with the Senate. In effect, the Democrat leadership has eliminated every conceivable opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to represent the views of their own constituents. 
   I find this sadly ironic, for it was Nancy Pelosi in 2006 who outlined the new Democrat majority's governing philosophy. And I will quote her: ``Bills should come to the House floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate consisting of a full amendment process that grants the minority the right to offer its alternatives, including a substitute. Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee markups.'' 
   As the body knows full well, we have had not an open process, let alone full and fair debate. Nor have we had any amendment process. Nor have we had any hearings whatsoever. So, I ask the Speaker, what has changed? 
   In an October 20, 2006 press release, then-minority leader Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to then-Speaker Hastert, ``The voice of every American has a right to be heard. No Member of Congress should be silenced on the floor.'' 
   My colleagues know that I have expressed grave concerns about Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey being the sole authors of this legislation without any input from other Members with considerable expertise in these subject matters. I am not alone in expressing this concern. 
   Last week, my dear friend and colleague, Marcy Kaptur, voiced her displeasure with Chairman Obey and her own leadership. She said, ``Leadership, by keeping the supplemental too close to the vest and not going through a committee markup, has failed to engage the broader membership. It does disenfranchise the voice of people who don't come from leadership locations.'' 
   I just happen to be the ranking member on this full committee. I saw the text and the heart of this proposal only yesterday in the early part of the afternoon. They have had it for months in the works, but have chosen to ignore entirely the minority in this connection. My colleagues know that I have expressed grave concern about this process before. 
   The House majority leader, Steny Hoyer, has said that it is disingenuous for Republicans to speak out over the Iraq war supplemental bypassing the Appropriations Committee process. He suggested that the House Republicans, while in the majority, had engaged in similar practices. This argument would be convenient if it were, in fact, true. However, we all know that facts are stubborn things. 
   According to the April 29 edition of the Politico, ``There have been about three dozen emergency spending bills in the past 20 years, and a handful has passed without input from the Appropriations Committee, including billions in Hurricane Katrina aid and post-September 11 funds. But none of the Iraq war funding bills has bypassed the appropriations panel in the process.'' 
   Have there been occasions where supplemental spending bills have not been  considered by the full committee? Sure there have. But on those rare instances, such as the aftermath of September 11 and so on, there was bipartisan consensus on the need to act quickly. And we did so by working together. 
   In no circumstance, to my knowledge, did either the Republican majority or the Democrat minority that preceded it ever deny either the opposition party or even members of its own party a seat at the table in writing such critical legislation. 
   Yet here we stand today, debating the merits of a bill that only a handful of Members have even seen. Very, very few Members know what is in this legislation. 
   I ask you, anybody in this room, have any of you, besides David Obey, had a chance to really read this bill and know what's in it in detail? You're going to be asked to vote on it anyway, regardless of that lack of input. 
   Members of the House, Republicans and Democrats, deserve to have their voice heard. By the end of the day, not one Member will have an opportunity to offer an amendment or propose any alternative ideas to this body for a vote. 
   What are Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey afraid of? 
   This is the fifth time since January 2007 that this majority has brought a supplemental appropriations bill to the House floor under a closed rule, violating the entire tradition of the appropriations process. 
   In order for the people's voices to be heard, it is fundamental that the representatives' voices are heard. What is happening here is that we are beginning to lay a pattern to destroy the representative process that allows the people to be heard through the people they send here to represent them in the first place. 
   Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey have effectively said to virtually every Democrat and Republican serving this great body: ``Your voice is irrelevant, and your input is not welcome.'' Again, what are Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Obey afraid of? 
   I believe this practice of circumventing our traditional committee process and ignoring the voices of rank and file Members and their constituents is detrimental to the health of the legislative process. It puts in place a process wherein a handful of powerful legislators become ``the Great Deciders'' of what should or should not be included in this almost $250 billion spending bill. This is not the ``House of the Few Great Deciders.'' It is the ``People's House.'' It is the House of Representatives. We fail to recognize this at our great peril. 
   On May 24, 2002, my friend and my chairman, Mr. Obey, said, and I quote, ``What a shame, when the legislative process is corrupted to polarize a product that should have been used to forge national unity.'' 
   These words are particularly true today as Chairman Obey and Speaker Pelosi put partisan interests ahead of the interests of the Members of the House and ahead of the people of this country. We can do better. And ladies and gentlemen, we must do better.     
   We can do better, and, ladies and gentlemen, we must do better. Vote ``no'' on this package and send it back to where it belongs. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Mr. Speaker, one of the delights of this process, preparing for this bill, has been to go back through the process of the past and look at some of the protestations and expressions of concern by my colleague, now the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee. I love this quote particularly. He says, ``Now this bill is going nowhere. It's going to be vetoed.'' Which bill are we talking about? This one or that one? 
   The American people know that once again Congress is putting partisan political considerations ahead of the needs of the American people. What we ought to do is to stop these political games and go forward with the regular process. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. With that, Mr. Speaker, I have enjoyed in many ways this discussion today. But most particularly, I have enjoyed having a chance to review the comments, sometimes even the lectures, of my colleague, the chairman of the committee, over the years. It wasn't that long ago that I had the chance to be the chairman myself. And earlier today, I used a quote from the then-ranking member of the committee in which he, in part, said, ``The American people know that, once again, Congress is putting partisan political considerations ahead of the needs of the American people.'' 
   He protested so much. In that same conversation, Mr. Obey went on to say, ``In my view, the quickest way to end this political nonsense is to vote `no' on this bill so that we can send the President a bill which is respectable, responsible and can be signed.'' 
   I must say that serving in the ranking member position at this point in time, I couldn't more heartily adopt the words of my colleague when he formerly had a position like mine. 
   In the meantime, this bill goes forward. The chairman knows full well that the bill that was written in the corner of this building by a couple of hands is going nowhere. It is very likely to be vetoed. In turn, he is repeating that very process he was protesting against so strongly not so long ago. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Thank you very much. 
   Madam Chairman, to Zach Wamp, I want to express my feelings about your work on this bill in a couple of ways. 
   First, those of us on the committee who have watched this process go together, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Zach Wamp working together, frankly, seeing people develop a relationship in a job that involves the real business of the House. It is the bill that funds our appropriations process. While it's not the largest bill, it's very important to the fundamentals here. 
   But I have never been quite so impressed as I watched them working with our very fine professional staff, to see them also bring along Members of the Appropriations Committee addressing this bill in a very special way. I wish the entire House could have observed the Appropriations Committee as we discussed Emancipation Hall the other day. 
   Jesse Jackson was magnificent. The interplay between he and the chairwoman and Zach Wamp was worthy of the Appropriations Committee, but very much a reflection of the very best of this House. I couldn't have been prouder than I was observing that conversation within appropriators. 
   With that I want to congratulate you very much for this product. It's a tremendous reflection of our work.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (HONORING RICHARD HENRY ``DICK'' WHITE -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, as we begin our work in the new year, I want to take a few moments to reflect on the passing of a good friend of mine. Richard Henry ``Dick'' White, Jr., a fixture in Washington for four decades, lost his fight against cancer on December 21, and his death took a whole lot of sunshine from the world. 
   Like many who came to Washington, Dick White expected to stay in Washington for a very short period of time. A 1955 journalism graduate of the University of Oklahoma, Dick arrived here in 1965 as a correspondent for the Tulsa Tribune. But rather than return home, he moved to public service, and that work caused him to become a congressional staff member over the next 14 years. He was the top staffer for Ed Edmonson of Oklahoma and Dale Milford of Texas. 
   He left the Hill in the late 1970s to serve as Washington representative on a number of farm-related issues. He later served as the vice president for the Tobacco Institute, and most recently maintained a small public affairs consulting business. 
   Mr. Speaker, it has regrettably become vogue in politics to suggest that lobbying, that is, representing the American people in Washington, is less than an honorable profession. Well, anyone who knew Dick White would strongly disagree. He represented his clients, small businesses, tens of thousands of farmers, hundreds of thousands of workers, with integrity, humanity and a wealth of knowledge. His service helped thousands of Americans be treated fairly when Congress considered policy changes that would affect their livelihoods. 
   I came to know Dick White as a friend after his marriage in 1991 to one of my senior staff members, Letitia Hoadley. To say this pair was a devoted couple is putting it mildly. For the past 15 years they have been inseparable and tenderly have cared for each other through good times and bad. 
   Dick White was always welcome in my office as a member of our extended  staff family. But his optimism and good humor made him welcome anywhere he went. He always added a bit of sunshine on any visit, and left everyone feeling more positive towards the day. 
   Beyond his public affairs interests, Dick was an avid follower of college sports, including Oklahoma football. He loved to travel, especially to the Caribbean. But his greatest joy was to spend time at his weekend cottage in Southern Maryland where he enjoyed boating, gardening and swimming. He loved to entertain. He would revel in a swimming pool full of kids. He was a great listener, and was considered a great grandpa by every boy and girl who was lucky enough to spend time with him. 
   Even as Dick battled cancer in the last few years, he maintained his positive nature, hearty laugh, infectious smile, always a part of Dick's life. In his last summer he purchased a small boat, hired an instructor, and provided a sailing school for neighborhood kids. 
   Dick White is survived by his loving wife Letitia and her family; his daughter, Ann Calvert Brown; son-in-law Stephen Brown; and grandchildren Suzanne Noel Brown and Daniel Calvert Brown. He is also survived by siblings, Miles White of San Antonio, Texas; Elizabeth White George of Belfair, Washington; and Robert White of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, as well as their families, including numerous nieces, nephews and their children. 
   Mr. Speaker, Dick White, a man of all seasons, gave all who knew him a reason to believe in the value of friendship as we go forward in life. He would have told us not to mourn his passing, but rather to celebrate the life he lived in his time with us. In that spirit, I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering a wonderful husband, father and friend to all and to express our warmest good will to his family.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, you all know that I have worked over the years very, very  closely with Mr. Murtha and our chairman Mr. Obey. I think most would agree that some of us make a significant effort to reach out on both sides of the aisle to solve problems where that is possible. 
   In this case, we have a major, major disagreement. I do not presume others to be insincere in their disagreement, but I feel very strongly that we must make absolutely certain that we do nothing to undermine the mission of our troops by way of this debate. 
   There is absolutely no doubt that the message that we will be sending as this bill passes today, in part, will say to the terrorists of the world, including Iraq, that America is not willing to stay and complete the mission. 
   I rarely refer to newspaper items in addressing the House, but I cannot help but note that the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, the Atlanta Journal, et cetera, those newspapers all have expressed grave concerns about combining this supplemental funding for a war with huge amounts of pork. 
   As a result of that, I am going to use an item several times mentioned today as a part of my own close. The item is entitled: ``Retreat and Butter. Are Democrats in the House Voting for Farm Subsidies or Withdrawal from Iraq?'' 
   ``Today, the House of Representatives is due to vote on a bill that would grant $25 million to spinach farmers in California. The legislation would also appropriate $75 million for peanut storage in Georgia and $15 million to protect Louisiana rice fields from saltwater. More substantially, there is $120 million for shrimp and menhaden fishermen, $250 million for milk subsidies, $500 million for wildfire suppression and $1.3 billion to build levees in New Orleans. 
   ``Altogether the House Democratic leadership has come up with more than $20 billion in new spending, much of it wasteful subsidies to agriculture or pork barrel projects aimed at individual Members of Congress. At the tail of all this log rolling,'' and by the way I would not use this next phrase so that Mr. Obey knows that, ``log rolling and political bribery lies this stinger: Representatives who support the bill, for whatever reason, will be voting to require that all U.S. combat troops leave Iraq by August 2008, regardless of what happens during the next 17 months or whether U.S. commanders believe a pullout at that moment protects or endangers U.S. national security, not to mention the thousands of American trainers and Special Forces troops who would remain behind. 
   ``The Democrats claim to have a mandate from voters to reverse the Bush administration's policy in Iraq. Yet the leadership is ready to piece together the votes necessary to force a fateful turn in the war by using tactics usually dedicated to highway bills or the Army Corps of Engineers budget. The legislation pays more heed to a handful of peanut farmers than to the 24 million Iraqis who are living through a maelstrom initiated by the United States, the outcome of which could shape the future of the Middle East for decades. 
   ``Congress can and should play a major role in determining how and when the war ends. Political benchmarks for the Iraqi Government are important, provided they are not unrealistic or inflexible. Even dates for troop withdrawals might be helpful, if they are cast as goals rather than requirements, and if the timing derives from the needs of Iraq, not the U.S. election cycle. The Senate's version of the supplemental spending bill for Iraq and Afghanistan contains nonbinding benchmarks and a withdrawal date that is a goal; that approach is more likely to win broad support and avoid a White House veto. 
   ``As it is, House Democrats are pressing a bill that has the endorsement of MoveOn.org but excludes the judgment of the U.S. commanders who would have to execute the retreat the bill mandates. It would heap money on unneedy dairy farmers while provoking a constitutional fight with the White House that could block the funding to equip troops in the field. Democrats who want to force a withdrawal should vote against war appropriations. They should not seek to use pork to buy a majority for an unconditional retreat that the majority does not support.'' 
   At this point, I include for the Record the Statement of Administration Policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate my colleague's yielding me the time. 
   I will not use anywhere near 10 minutes. But let me say that my colleagues have already expressed their support for the phenomenal work that has taken place over the recent years as we have learned from past tragedies like this. The law enforcement officials, local government, the State people with the Forestry Service in California, and the U.S. Forestry Service have been truly phenomenal. We have learned an awful lot. But I would mention two things. 
   The first is that in terms of managing our forests, we usually find our way very quickly to develop those dollars that are necessary following a fire to respond to the immediate tragedy. Those dollars seem to flow almost upon our call. The dollars that, on the other hand, are much more difficult are those that involve managing the forest long term. It is so important that we recognize that the U.S. Forestry Service does all that they can, but they know  full well that the great difficulty of getting the money for managing that which makes up the ground fire that can destroy a forest, literally can obliterate this territory when we are looking, must be a part of our Federal responsibility. 
   There is little doubt that we will overcome this tragedy. Hundreds and hundreds of homes lost in my own district in and around Lake Arrowhead, California, tragedies for each of those families. But I would say beyond remembering that we must find the money for managing the forests. We also should talk to our constituents about the fact that when faced with a fire tragedy, the first thing that all of our people should do is to respond to those warnings that suggest, when they are called to evacuate, to evacuate. One life lost is too many, and the danger of attempting to overcome a fire near your home, indeed, is a critical decision. I would urge all of our citizens who are faced with this difficulty to respond to those calls for evacuation. 
   With that, I appreciate very much my colleagues' response to our tragedy and I appreciate very much their help.

The House is, indeed, fortunate that the work of this subcommittee this year falls to Chairman Norm Dicks and Ranking Member Todd Tiahrt. They are not only good friends, they are capable legislators who recognize the value of bipartisanship. Clearly they do not agree on each and every single piece of this bill relative to policy or funding; but nonetheless, when they disagree, they recognize the value of communication and sharing information. 
   What makes this relationship even more valuable is it also extends to the professional staff on both sides of the aisle. The working relationship of Chairman Dicks and Mr. Tiahrt, coupled with a reasonable allocation, could produce a very fine product. 
   In this instance, however, an excessive subcommittee allocation has thrown this bill out of balance. More money does not always guarantee a better bill. In this instance, in fact, just the opposite is true. This subcommittee allocation for this bill is $27.6 billion, a $1.9 billion increase over the President's budget request, and $1.2 billion increase over the enacted fiscal year 2007 Interior bill. This subcommittee allocation represents exactly the kind of unfettered spending that so closely identifies the differences of philosophies between House Republicans and House Democrats. 
   And who is going to pay for this increased spending? In fiscal year 2004, 50 percent of the total Federal tax burden was shouldered by the 65 million households earning between $24,000 and $65,000 a year. The vast majority of these taxes are being paid by individuals between the ages of 45 and 54, and with incomes between $55,000 and $77,000 a year. These are middle income families, many of them from the sandwich generation shouldering the financial burden of supporting both young children and aging parents. 
   Middle income families end up paying the bill for expanded government. The 302(b) allocation for this bill guarantees years of payments middle income families do not want it and cannot afford. 
   Mr. Chairman, the Interior bill has great potential of being a truly bipartisan bill. My hope is that Chairman Dicks and Ranking Member Tiahrt will work with their Senate counterparts in conference to fashion a conference report that the House can support and the President will sign.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a motion to recommit. But I want to say first to my colleagues that one of the reasons for my rising with this motion is because there seems to be a good deal of confusion on the part of at least my constituency, and my colleagues' families and constituents at home may have the same kind of confusion. 
   It seems that my people believe that this President does want to lead to a comprehensive energy independence policy that would include the availability to States to drill off their continental shelf, et cetera, to give us an adequate supply of oil to assure our energy independence. And yet those same people believe that it is the President's Congress that is holding up such action. That is, many of them believe that the Congress, the House and the Senate, are controlled by his party. But that is not the case, and our people are confused. The Congress is controlled by the other party who are resisting those proposals that involve the ability to drill off the Outer Continental Shelf, to tap into shale, to develop a comprehensive policy that will lead to energy independence. My people are absolutely dying at the gas pump. Our small businesses are doing the same. 
   So I have a motion to recommit, Mr. Speaker, with the term, I might add, ``promptly'' in it to allow us to act immediately--I misread it. It is not promptly, it is ``forthwith.'' So it would be implemented immediately. I did that because my colleagues on the other side have been complaining about the word ``promptly.'' We want you to be able to act very quickly, not just strike this on a point of order, but allow the people's voices to be heard. Because I can tell you, when you go home, you are going to hear them if you strike this on a point of order. So back to the point, Mr. Speaker. 
   This motion would enact the American Energy Act, a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis that is causing families to pay $4 per gallon for gasoline. Adoption of this motion will increase the supply of American-made energy and will relieve those families, those businesses, and my constituents at the gas pump. It will improve conservation efficiency, it will promote new and expanded technologies. Most of all, it will reduce America's increasingly costly and dangerous dependence on foreign sources of energy. 
   The minute we send them a message that we are serious about home supply, prices will crash. I can guarantee you that. 
   We need to consider all solutions to achieve energy independence. I hope that as we prepare to head back to our districts for the month of August, we can go back to our constituents with the good news: We did something; rather than what this Congress has been doing in the past--nothing. 
   I urge support for this motion to recommit. 
   I yield time to my leader from Ohio, Mr. John Boehner, the Republican leader.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I asked for time simply to have a discussion with Mr. Turner, if I might, regarding his amendment. 
   Mr. Turner, in ancient history I had the privilege of chairing this subcommittee, and during those early years I was very, very concerned with what was happening within the total housing programming, what happens to the money as it flows to communities, et cetera. The focus then was upon section 8 housing. I will never forget my trip to New Orleans to try to see what was happening with money we sent there over a lot of years to the Housing Authority. I met with the Inspector General in the offices of the FBI to discuss what I had seen and some of my concerns. The FBI guy who was there listening to our conversation was heard to say, Congressman, if you really want to get a handle on this, I would suggest that one of the things that you might do is put enough money into the Inspector General's office so you can have a full-time inspector general here in New Orleans, for this fellow flew in from Houston to talk with you today. 
   I heard a while ago that there had been added monies to the Inspector General's office since Katrina. I have no idea what that means in terms of the real volume, et cetera, but I do perceive that there is an ongoing problem across the country. 
   So this discussion, or my reason to talk with you, is I admire very much what you're about. I would hope also, as you go about it, that you work very closely with the chairman and ranking member about finding another source of money. The issue is a very important one, but I'm not certain just how well off the Inspector General is. 
   I yield to the gentleman.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, it was not my intention to speak on any of these earmarks, but the discussion that has gone on between the chairman and the gentleman from Arizona I was listening to upstairs, and it struck me that there needed to be some addition to this discussion. 
   The suggestion that earmarks exploded as of the time the control of the Congress changed in 1995 and began to expand, et cetera, et cetera, is accurate, accurate, but for reasons entirely different than the gentleman from Arizona either realizes or understands. 
   It is a fact that the other party controlled the Congress for 40 years, and over all those years their chairmen, their subcommittee chairmen, their very high-ranking Members around here with years and years of power had developed very solid relationships with the second and third level in the various agencies around this town. And there weren't earmarks; there were phone marks. Key staff and otherwise were instructed to call those second- and third-tier people within the agencies and let them know what they thought the priorities should be. There wasn't a need for legislative earmarks because phone marks had a very significant impact upon the process. And we tend to ignore that reality. 
   When the majority did change, the new majority found that that second and third level of bureaucracy weren't nearly as responsive to people with Rs after their name, or Republicans, and thus they began giving some specific direction as to what their priorities were, thus the term called ``earmarks.'' 
   Further, I think the gentleman does his party a disservice by suggesting that this was our fault. The reality is that even the earmarks where they are represent in the neighborhood of 1 percent of all the discretionary spending available in the appropriations process, and that while the Constitution says that appropriations should begin in the House of Representatives, to suggest that Members having ideas as to what priorities ought to be and even putting it in legislation is wrong, it seems to me, in connection with that, the gentleman is wrong. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, title II of the bill requires HUD to rescind $1.3 billion in the funds that the Congress provided in 2007 or prior years. Frankly, HUD cannot meet this rescission without doing great harm to the most vulnerable of our population, those low-income individuals who are elderly, low-income, disabled persons and homeless families and individuals. As much as 40 percent of the homeless population in this country, Mr. Speaker, as much as 40 percent, are veterans. 
   Congress has always provided the section 8 program with full funding, knowing that if not all the funds were used, they would be recaptured and rescinded and used by the Congress for other high priority programs. However, this bill states categorically that if funds for the section 8 program are more than actually get used by the Public Housing Authority, they may not be recaptured or rescinded, even though they are clearly in excess. 
   Let me quote the report accompanying this bill: ``The Department is not permitted to recapture these reserves for the rescission.'' 
   Just where is the Department expected to go to get these funds? The answer is very simple and very unfortunate. They would, first and foremost, eliminate funding for the construction of facilities that provide assisted living for low-income elderly persons, for low-income disabled individuals and homeless shelters, as well as other permanent housing for the homeless.     
   Let me repeat, other permanent housing for the homeless, as much as 40 percent of the homeless population are veterans. 
   These funds are not in excess. Quite to the contrary, they are very much in use. But construction programs spend out slowly and so the funds are there waiting to be applied towards various stages of construction. Unlike the section 8 funds, these funds would never be in excess. They are simply in the pipeline, fully obligated or committed to specific projects and ready for use. 
   So when HUD takes these funds, it means that facilities for these vulnerable groups will be eliminated. HUD has no other choices since there are no other programs with this much money still available from 2007 or prior years. 
   Mr. Speaker, however you look at it, this is a very bad outcome and every measure must be taken to prevent cutting programs that serve the most vulnerable, especially programs that serve the homeless veterans. My motion to recommit does just that. It protects those programs from being slashed as sacrificial lambs to a new policy that says excess voucher funds are more important than building facilities to house the elderly and disabled and homeless, especially homeless veterans. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), the former chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee and a tireless advocate for housing programs that serve vulnerable populations.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (GAS PRICE RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - May 19, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Iowa for yielding me this time. 
   I must say that I came to the floor with great expectancy that we were discussing something that would actually provide gas price relief. Instead, we have another study that reviews the question of cartels and their impact upon prices of gasoline or oil in the United States presuming that unilaterally America, one way or another, can control what other countries do in terms of their partnerships known as cartels. 
   I must say that it's very clear that there are any number of avenues that can be followed, that should have been followed formerly that can affect the availability of crude oil in the United States. We have a huge, huge domestic supply. 
   In my own State, California, you have heard a bit today about a thing called the Pelosi premium. Frankly I'm not excited much about the Pelosi premium. The fact that the gentlelady from San Francisco is now the Speaker of the House is significant to California, but her district, just like mine, must be suffering as much as everybody with the price per gallon of gasoline at the pump. So together, we've got to try in California to find policy and program that will bring about change. 
   For example, for a long time for appropriate reasons we've been very sensitive about offshore drilling in California because of our beautiful Pacific Coast. We also now know that there are technologies developed and available beyond the site line that could cause us to at least take a look at how we tap that crude oil far off of our coast as a potential alternative supply. Without supply to meet the demand, America is not going to have independence from the Middle East. 
   Look to the south. The gulf region has tremendous potential in terms of future crude development. Could we not have developed policies that are foreign policies dealing with Latin countries to help them technologically better tap those sources so in spite of what goes on in Florida or in Texas or otherwise near the gulf, we could be reaching out in ways to allow that crude oil to become available here in our domestic supply and thereby put pressure on OPEC.     
   The technology that is developing relative to what we do with shale has tremendous potential in terms of tapping our reserves. We know that takes time but it also takes priority. 
   Instead of phony cartel bills, where are the bills that bring forward those policy changes and add to the research, as well as the specific funding for technology to reach into those reserves? 
   My friends on the floor have talked about the fact that it would take 10 years for us to effectively tap resources in Alaska, but for 10 years, those same people have been resisting our tapping into those resources. If we'd begun 10 years ago, that crude oil would be online right this moment, putting pressure on the process to allow us to meet our demand more effectively here at home rather than depending upon those overseas. 
   So, Mr. Speaker, it's time we got onto the policies in both bodies that make sense for America, and I appreciate the time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, this motion involves bold direction to provide the funds necessary to fund all aspects of the security barrier needed to protect our borders. When I say ``all aspects,'' I mean fencing, tactical infrastructure and technology, any and all tools needed by the Department of Homeland Security to secure our porous borders. Under this motion, the funds in the bill would have to be allocated as necessary to meet the goals of the Secure Fence Act, which was passed by this body in the last Congress by a vote of 283-138. 
   Before we can consider so-called immigration reform, we must get our priorities straight and secure our borders. DHS's Secure Border Initiative, or SBI, is working. In FY 2006, we ended the flawed practice of catch and release. In FY 2007, we reduced the apprehension of illegal immigrants along the border by almost 50 percent. 
   Let's take the next step in FY 2008 with the funding provided in this bill and ensure that border security is more than just a term politicians throw around, that it becomes a reality.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss what appears to be one of the most highly unusual decisions made by the leadership of the House by way of combining the Labor, Health and Human Services bill with Military Construction, VA, and all those programs that relate to veterans, and the DOD bills into one package to be sent to the President. 
   It is my understanding that included in this package may be disaster funding relief that could affect wildfires in the West. There may be other popular items that the majority may attempt to air-drop into conference. In theory, the bill itself is supposed to focus upon health care for our citizens across the country, labor programs and education programs, not defense, not veterans programming or other related programs. This package would exclude any DOD bridged supplemental funding for our troops. 
   Last year, a bipartisan group of Members demanded that the administration send a full-year supplemental  request for activities related to the global war on terror. Now that the administration has provided the full-year request, the House and Senate leadership have refused to provide this critical funding for our troops who are serving in harm's way. 
   Additionally, instead of moving the Labor-HHS bill, the DOD bill and the MilCon-VA bills through the process by regular order and holding separate conferences, this omnibus package would be carried as part of the Labor-HHS bill. 
   Frankly, as I talk to my colleagues who know the appropriations process around this place pretty well, they can't quite believe why we're doing this. For each of these bills passed the House separately and individually, they've got programs that are highly supported. There is little doubt that regular order would work if the leadership would allow it to work. 
   Let me be clear on this. The President has already indicated that he will sign a freestanding MilCon bill, and he will sign a freestanding Defense bill. Especially it's important to note that the MilCon bill includes funding for veterans as well, with a commitment for his signature. By not moving these bills individually, the majority is using our veterans as well as our troops essentially as political pawns. 
   Yesterday, I had a conversation with the President's Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten. He clearly indicated that if this package makes its way to the White House, it will be vetoed by the President in this form. Apparently the President delivered a similar message to our Members and the press at the White House yesterday morning. 
   Personally, I think it's outrageous that the majority is proceeding in this way with funding for our troops and our veterans simply to try to push through a 10-plus billion dollar increase in the Labor and Health and Human Services programs. To me, this is nothing more than essentially, at least some would describe it as political blackmail, as well as a poke in the eye to our troops, our veterans, our Members, as well as our President. 
   To the Democrat majority who conceived this misbegotten, ill-conceived legislative strategy, let me say this: You are not only making a mockery of the legislative process, you are intentionally undermining a strong bipartisan desire to fund our troops, provide medical care for those troops, as well as provide funding for our veterans. This approach is kind of like the SCHIP package on steroids. And I believe that it, too, will fail. 
   I do not intend to sign the conference report or vote for it when it reaches the floor. I will also be supporting the President's veto, should he decide to veto this package. Clearly, this is in excess, and it's a fundamental violation of what I think should be the tradition of the appropriations process. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We have, over the last 12 years, had nine omnibus appropriations bills, and where those bills were put together in packages, I objected to that procedure all along the line. But, as a matter of fact, as a matter of fact, negotiations had taken place on the part of both sides of the aisle, and the President signed those bills. He didn't suggest he would be vetoing those bills.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I would speak just for a moment by way of saying that I think in many ways we have demonstrated if we  are not careful with our rhetoric, we can undermine the opportunity we have for bipartisan consideration of very important work in the House. 
   One of the most positive experiences I have had as a member of the Appropriations Committee has been to sit in that subcommittee that deals with Labor-HHS. I have been very, very impressed with the amount of nonpartisan, bipartisan support for fundamental research, for example. Earlier it was suggested that there is not that base of support. It is when we get this partisan confrontation on the floor that polarizes us that we tend to become confused about the real work that is positively done within our subcommittees.     
   Madam Speaker, I must say I would hope that we can do all that we possibly can to try to bring both sides together relative to those research items that I feel have such high priority. 
   Beyond that, I'm going to be later raising a question by way of a motion to instruct conferees that would suggest that the Labor-HHS bill ought to be dealt with by itself. Where the members of that subcommittee worked so hard and have such expertise in this arena to set their work out and complicate it with VA-HUD over issues that relate to veterans is absolutely undermining the appropriations process. 
   So, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I can't help but mention that the preceding discussion must be very enlightening to Americans across the country who may be interested in what we have to say here. It's always been my personal belief that the vast percentage of problems that we face as a people have very little to really do with partisan politics if we can get people together at the subcommittee level to really talk with each other about finding solutions, but clearly, clearly, Madam Speaker, it has to be apparent to almost everybody who had listened today that one side of the aisle in this body seems to believe that the only solution to every problem around is to throw more money at it. That clearly is not the case. Many a solution is found by way of people working together, not just throwing money at some wall. 
   Madam Speaker, in this motion to instruct conferees, I really repeat the point that the subcommittee members who work within the Labor-HHS community have great expertise in the programs within this arena. They spend a lot of energy and time applying themselves to that work. 
   Today we're in a process where we're going to tie that piece of work to a combination of two other bills. It's totally unnecessary. The Defense bill passed the House by very sizeable bipartisan numbers. Indeed, the MilCon-VA bill did the same. To suggest that we can't go forward with Labor-HHS as a separate product, I think this is a very unhealthy reflection on the work of that subcommittee. 
   This motion says the conference can only conference the Labor-HHS bill. They cannot consider adding Defense, MilCon-VA, or other matters outside the scope of the Labor-HHS conference. The Members who serve on the Labor-HHS subcommittee should be making decisions in an open conference regarding the disposition of programs and funding levels in that bill, not other appropriations bills related to the troops, veterans, or other items outside the scope of that conference. 
   Members serve on subcommittees and have the expertise I suggest because they work within those subcommittees. The people on Labor-HHS, very talented in their work, spend relatively  little of their time in the Defense arena, as well as the arena that deals with MilCon and veterans. 
   To air-drop Defense appropriations conference reports and the MilCon-VA bill into this process is absolutely unprecedented, in my view, and is a disservice to our Appropriations Committee. 
   Politicizing these bills and circumventing the normal practice of this and other committees does nothing more than undermine the American people's faith in their government. 
   Let's move beyond purely partisan politics and send the President a freestanding Labor-HHS bill, as well as individual Defense and MilCon-VA appropriations. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the measure before us.  
   Madam Speaker, there is a sense of urgency in the Capitol. We all know that this urgency is real: we have seen the largest U.S. bank failure in history, the demise of century-old Wall Street firms, and a nearly total freeze of our credit system. 
   Everyone, Republican and Democrat, is keenly aware that our economy is in dire straits. It seems increasingly clear that unless we in Congress allow the Federal Government to take bold steps, we are facing a serious recession or worse. 
   Treasury Chief Henry Paulson--backed by President Bush--has laid out a plan that would commit up to $700 billion to relieve the pressure on the credit system by buying bad mortgage debts and other ``toxic assets.'' 
   The American people are rightly furious that their tax dollars will go to ``reward'' the businesses and business people who they believe got us into this mess. Most who have called my office forcefully said ``I've paid my bills, I shouldn't have to pay their bills, too.'' 
   Frankly, I'm furious, also. The idea of spending taxpayer dollars to prop up risky investments keeps me awake at night. It goes against all the principles I have lived by--personal responsibility, smaller government, reliance on the free market. 
   But we cannot afford to simply look at this as angry taxpayers who believe we should just let the greed gamblers fail. The stakes are too great for that.  
   Uncle Sam has been involved in controversial bailouts before. There was the bailout of Chrysler in the '80s and later of Mexico in the '90s. On the optimistic side, in both instances, the dollars delivered were repaid including interest. Thus, some suggest that as our own marketplace improves, these bailouts could very well be repaid and perhaps even lead to some profits. 
   Earlier this week Chairman Bernanke reminded us that Wall Street is an abstraction. The internal credit markets that allow banks to borrow money from each other are hard to understand for our constituents--and for most of us, as well. I have heard constituents--and some members--say we shouldn't worry about the lack of credit between banks. 
   But the failure of our credit system has broad. implications, not only for the high rollers in Manhattan, but also for the families and small businesses of the Inland Empire. 
   When local business owners do not have cash today for payroll but know they will in the future, they can turn to their bank and get a short-term loan to pay their employees, stay open and help build the local economy. 
   When families do not have cash to buy a home or a car, they turn to their bank to get a mortgage, create wealth and help build the local economy. 
   When high school students do not have cash to pay for college, they turn to their bank to get a student loan. When those students graduate, they enter the workforce and help build the local economy. 
   When banks stop lending between themselves, they soon stop lending to everyone else and economic expansion at the local level stops. The crisis on Wall Street becomes the crisis on Main Street. 
   The liquidity crisis is a linchpin of the broader economic crisis facing our constituents. This crisis has already hit our seniors in retirement and those looking at retirement. Even savvy retirement age constituents who made sound investment choices are not immune to our current market downturn. Should we refuse to act swiftly, those who rely on investment income and do not have the luxury of time to wait for long-term market adjustments will have even less money for food, housing and medical needs. 
   In my own district and yours, we are seeing clear signs that a downturn in the financial markets impacts city and county investments and puts important public projects at risk. Can we afford to increase that risk to local growth? 
   There is no question that investing in the market also poses risks, but if we can reduce market uncertainty, those risks are reduced for everyone. That is the only way to protect the investments made by seniors who built our economy's foundation and localities serving our constituents. 
   Allowing the markets to crash and leaving Wall Street to its own devices does punish the decisionmakers who fueled this crisis. But we all know it won't stop there. Millions of Americans will suffer the consequences, even those who felt they were being careful with their retirement nest egg. 
   There is no question that we in Congress must move deliberately and do everything we can to reduce or eliminate the risk to taxpayer funds. And whatever action is taken by Congress, we must make certain that those who got us into this mess do not profit further from the solutions we develop. 
   But we cannot avoid risk. Ultimately, we must face the realization that doing nothing will cause a potential catastrophe, and the suffering won't be felt just on Wall Street. It will be on every Main Street in America.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor the incredible service of my very good friend Ray LaHood. I have had the privilege of serving alongside him as a Member of the Conference and as an Appropriator. 
   I first met Ray when he was a young staffer for Bob Michel. He performed invaluable service in helping Bob be a great leader. Ray's son Darin was looking for work and it was a pleasure to bring him into the extended Lewis family as a part of my personal office. With my encouragement, Darin went on to law school as an attorney in Nevada. I know I share Ray's pride as Darin has returned home to Illinois to run for Peoria County State's Attorney. 
   Ray is a consensus-builder and a common-sense legislator and has distinguished himself as a champion of this great institution. Throughout his time here he has fought vigorously to ensure the Capitol stays the ``people's house'' and that it remains a beacon for motivated and service-minded young people. 
   I know his constituents appreciate his selfless service. His efforts are a testament to the highest level of commitment an individual can demonstrate on behalf of others. I join my colleagues in wishing Ray, Kathy, and his family well.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor my good friend Deborah Pryce whose service to Ohio and her nation has been exemplary. 
   I first came to know Deborah when I was active in a Task Force to elect more Republican women to Congress. Her spirit and enthusiasm impressed me then and it was no surprise to watch her quickly become a leader among her colleagues. In 2002 she was elected House Republican Conference Chair, a position I once held, where she articulated the party's message and helped craft the Republican agenda. In this capacity, Deborah became the highest ranking Republican woman in history. 
   I am particularly touched by the work Deborah has done to fight cancer. After losing her beloved daughter Caroline to this disease, Deborah co-founded Hope Street Kids, a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing funding and awareness of pediatric cancer. Knowing Deborah like I do, she will tirelessly continue her fight against this dreadful disease. 
   I wish her well as she returns home. Congress' loss will be her family's gain. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor my good friend and fellow appropriator Dave Hobson of Ohio. 
   I've had the pleasure of serving alongside Dave as we have fought to make sure our military has the resources it needs to defend our interests around the world. Dave's commitment to ensuring the brave men and women of our armed forces receive the pay, benefits, housing, and quality health care they deserve is second to none. 
   Dave made constituent service a priority during his time in office. He has long sponsored monthly ``Open Doors'' meetings in his district so his constituents could directly share their concerns with him. 
   During his time on the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Dave visited Northern California on behalf of our colleague John Doolittle. Dave brought to our attention the urgent matter of levees and flood control. His expertise on this issue has been critical as California has worked to address this serious problem. 
   Retirement is something to be celebrated and enjoyed. It is not the end of a career, but rather the beginning of a new life adventure. I send my friend Dave my best wishes in all his future endeavors. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to honor Ralph Regula, the second-longest currently serving Republican member of the U.S. House and a man I am honored to call a friend. 
   I thank Ralph for his years of service. He has inspired a legacy that demonstrates the true character and compass on of his Ohio district. During his many years on the Appropriations Committee, Ralph has done magnificent work on many subcommittees, particularly the Labor, Health, Human Services and Education budget, which is the largest discretionary domestic account. He focused on strengthening our education system to meet the demands of a rapidly changing global marketplace, making health care accessible to all, ensuring that the U.S. remains at the cutting edge of medical research, and retaining workforce training programs that provide people an avenue to seek gainful employment. 
   He has been an example of the very best of the Appropriations Committee and has been a Member that colleagues on both sides of the aisle could turn to. While I will miss seeing him in the halls of this great institution, I know he will be happy at hone on his farm in Ohio with his wife Mary and their four grandchildren.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6899, COMPREHENSIVE AMERICAN ENERGY SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - September 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to compliment my ranking member on the Rules Committee for a very fine statement that he made on introduction to his opposition to this rule, and I rise in opposition to the rule myself. 
   The folks at home have gotten the message relative to the level of competence or incompetence of the United States Congress. Polls indicate that our rates are somewhere at the 9 percent range, and there are serious doubts about our capability to effectively address major issues and in a sensible way come to conclusions that make sense for them. 
   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, it was 82 days ago today that in the full Appropriations Committee I personally carried a substitute that would have opened the whole discussion and debate and the possibility of an up-or-down vote of drilling off our Continental Shelf. There is little question there is enough reserves if we will just tap them to assure American energy independence. 
   Since that time, the Appropriations Committee has closed down, literally they have done none of their work. And because of that, we find ourselves in the circumstance where today the leadership is undermining our ability to go forward towards energy independence.  
   Mr. Speaker, a bipartisan majority in the House has been calling for a real debate on energy issues for months now. But it was 82 days ago--during a scheduled full Appropriations Committee markup--that the real debate began. 
   That debate in full committee was short-lived and it ended rather abruptly; the majority leadership ordered Chairman Obey to pull the plug on that markup when it became evident that they would lose a vote on off-shore drilling. The Appropriations Committee has not met since. 
   All year long, the majority leadership has abdicated its responsibility to have the Appropriations Committee proceed under regular order, largely relegating our work to the back-burner. The assumption has been that Barack Obama would be elected President in November. The assumption has been that the House majority would remain the House majority and that an Obama administration would be more inclined to support higher levels of spending in bills reflecting the majority's budget priorities. 
   Such a scenario, assumes that the House pass very few bills, pass a continuing resolution, and leave the future of the remaining bills unanswered until after the November election. But, what if John McCain is elected President? And what if he draws an even harder line on spending than President Bush? What then? Is the Appropriations Committee going to do nothing for the next 4 years? 
   Because the legitimate work of the House is now being dictated by election-year politics, it now appears that the Appropriations Committee will not meet again this year. It also appears that we will not have a chance to debate and consider a legitimate energy bill this year. 
   The vast majority of Americans support an energy policy that includes off-shore drilling for oil and natural gas. But the majority leadership still doesn't get it. Rather than working across party lines to develop a bipartisan bill--a consensus bill--we can all support, the House is being forced to consider a ``take it or leave it'' energy bill that leaves out over 80 percent of known energy reserves off our coasts. 
   This misguided strategy reflects decisions made at the highest levels of the majority leadership. It is especially disappointing to me because in recent years the Appropriations Committee has largely set aside partisan differences to pass all of our bills in a timely fashion. More often than not, we have been able to say, ``We have fulfilled our responsibility. We have done our work.'' But not this year. 
   This year, one issue--the high price of oil and gas--has completely paralyzed the appropriations process and, indeed, the legislative process in the House of Representatives. We are now two weeks away from the beginning of the new fiscal year and what have we done? Nothing! Absolutely nothing! Instead, funding bills essential for every conceivable function of government have been put on a shelf to avoid votes on offshore drilling, on oil shale, and drilling in ANWR. 
   In past years, when controversial issues have come to the full committee, we took them head on.  
   During my service as chairman, we debated and considered raising the minimum wage, the millionaires' tax, and the Truman Commission. I was opposed to each of these amendments but felt our Members--Republicans and Democrats--deserved to have their voices heard. 
   Had the Interior bill been considered in full committee on June 18 as originally scheduled, the committee and the House would not be in this position today. It would have broken the logjam and enabled us to complete our work. And, it would have given Members of the House an opportunity to openly debate the most important issue facing our constituents today. 
   To me, preparing a long-term energy strategy is like preparing for retirement. It doesn't happen overnight but takes careful, thoughtful, long-term planning. Addressing the OCS issue is just one leg of the energy stool (along with conservation, oil shale, renewables, etc.) just as a 401(k) plan is one leg of the stool when planning for retirement. I believe we have to take the long view just as we take the long view when planning for retirement. It can't and won't happen overnight. 
   Republicans and Democrats alike deserve an opportunity to have a straight up or down vote on energy amendments addressing the high price of oil and gas. Again, ``all of the above'' has been replaced with ``take it or leave it.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, I don't recognize this place anymore. Once upon a time, members of the People's House worked together to serve the best interests of our country. Now, we either march in lockstop to the whims of the majority leadership or we are left out of the legislative process altogether. 
   When I first came to Congress, legislation was drafted not by the Speaker of the House but by committee chairmen with jurisdiction over the issue of the day. Members of the minority party had every opportunity to participate in the debate by offering amendments. But those days are no more. Members of the minority party no longer have any rights. We are basically told to ``sit down and shut up'' because the majority leadership knows best. 
   This Member has had enough. And my constituents have had enough. I encourage colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in rejecting this irresponsible approach to governing. Let's work together and openly debate energy policy. Let's vote on a consensus bill that addresses the high price of oil and gas. Remember, our constituents are closely watching this debate. They will remember what we do when they vote on November 4.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would guess there is nobody in the House that has more rural territory than this Member, and the program that my chairman is suggesting we put in the bill is one that is very important to my constituency. I do have serious reservations, however, about the way we got to having to present this in the first place. 
   This Member just received this bill very early this morning. I would guess there may be dozens of Members who have issues that they would hope would be in the bill if they had the time or the flexibility in the approach we handled this bill to have their items considered. So in that sense, I have serious reservations, but it is not my intention to object.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, it was just 2 days ago that we were debating an $800 billion continuing resolution to fund our troops and veterans, protect our homeland, respond to natural disasters and put our country on a pathway towards energy independence. Many Members, including this Member, reluctantly agreed to support the CR to keep the essential business of our government running through March 6 of next year. 
   Now in addition to being asked to pay for a bailout for Wall Street, taxpayers are being asked by House Democrats to swallow an additional 60, that is $60 billion in spending on a laundry list of items I saw for the first time just a few hours ago. This would be laughable if it were not so serious. 
   I was reluctant to support the CR the other day because virtually every dollar was approved without the consideration of the House Appropriations Committee, without floor consideration in the House and Senate, without any amendments or input from any House Member or Senator and without formal House and Senate conference committee work. 
   During our debate we all agreed on the importance of getting the appropriations process back on track. Just 2 days ago we found ourselves back on the House floor making the very same mistakes again, debating an additional $60 billion--$60 billion is a lot of money--in spending legislation that very few have yet seen. There was no committee consideration, no amendments and no debate. One more time, we are presented with a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. So much for getting the appropriations process back on track. 
   The majority is describing this legislation as a ``stimulus package'' to help our national economy. But let's be clear about that. Let's not fool ourselves. This is a political document pure and simple. If these priorities are so important, why hasn't this bill gone through the normal legislative process? We could have, and should have, debated many of the items included in this package, hearing full committee and House floor consideration when we are considering each of the 12 individual bills. But as we know, the majority is unwilling to move individual spending bills and derailed the appropriations process for this entire year. 
   Before you make a decision on this legislation, I ask you to consider three sobering facts: First, of the projected $247 billion increase in the budget deficit in 2008, $226 billion results from additional spending, and $21 billion results from decreased revenues. Second, in 2009, spending is projected to reach 21.4 percent of the GDP for the first time since 1993. Third, balancing the Federal budget by 2013 would require either limiting annual spending growth to 1.4 percent or raising annual revenue growth at 8 percent or a combination of both. 
   So to balance the budget, we either need to raise taxes or we need to spend less. Now I didn't fall off the turnip truck this morning. It doesn't take an economist to tell you that the economy needs our help. And what does this Congress do? It proposes to spend billions and billions and billions more without any offsets in spending. The failure to adhere to pay-as-you-go, or what we call PAYGO, means that this new spending will be financed through additional borrowing, which will increase interest rates and prove a further drag on our struggling economy. 
   In recent days, government has taken steps to bail out the auto industry to the tune of some $25 billion. It has proposed a bailout for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the tune of another $25 billion. It has committed as much as $70 billion to rescue AIG. In the last few weeks, this Congress hasn't found a cause that doesn't need a handout or a bailout. Where does the spending end, Mr. Speaker? Where does it end? 
   In this time of financial instability and national anxiety over the state of our financial market, the first goal of the Congress should be to do no harm. But this legislation does just the opposite. Is it any wonder that the approval rating of Congress is now at 13 percent? If Congress were a business, its CEO would have been fired long ago. 
   Mr. Speaker, there's an old saying: ``No bill is better than a bad bill.'' That is especially true in this case. We would be doing our constituents, our shareholders, the American taxpayer, a tremendous favor if we took our foot off the gas pedal for a while. We ought to be focused on more oversight rather than more spending. Indeed, spending money is not the answer to every problem. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have got a feeling that I have seen this movie before. And believe me, the sequel is always worse than the original. We must display more discipline and demonstrate better judgment in spending taxpayers' money. There is no better time or place to begin than right here now. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this unfettered spending spree. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to take very much time, but I do want to take just a moment to express to the Members that which I have expressed to my chairman in many a forum. 
   This Member has been very, very concerned about the way the appropriations process has been working during this Congress, concerned enough to think that we could very well be on the pathway to destroy the Appropriations Committee, which has historically been the rock of this place in terms of accomplishing real work. 
   I certainly don't point to my chairman in terms of these concerns directly. We have very, very fine members with great experience and talent on each of our subcommittees. On both sides we have fabulous staff people who make a great contribution to this entire arena. But over this last year or year-and-a-half, those people have been heard all too seldom. Indeed, while our staffs do work together weekend after weekend, in turn they know full well we are not producing the product we could if we had a fully-developed bipartisan discussion in every one of these very important subcommittees. 
   It is with that concern that I rise to suggest to the Members, it is long past due that we change the pattern by way of which we are carrying forward our appropriations business. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Chairman, I want to express my appreciation to both Chairman Obey and my ranking member, the gentleman from New York, for the cooperative spirit in which they worked to produce this bill, a very difficult bill in the final analysis. With that, I would like to say to Mr. Obey I very much appreciate his ongoing cooperation as we try to work on all the bills in the appropriations process this year to make some sense out of a very difficult year. I would also like to express my deep appreciation for the fabulous work done by the staff of this committee. 
   And having gone that far, Madam Chairman, let me say that the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education and Related Agencies bill, Labor-HHS, reflects a fundamental difference in opinion on the level of funding necessary to support the Federal Government's role in education, health and workforce programs. Regardless of that disagreement, House Republicans agree that many of the programs funded in this bill are vitally important. The majority party would have the public believe otherwise. 
   In fact, House Republicans have shown the American people over the past 12 years that we recognize the importance of these programs. With history as our witness, we have demonstrated our commitment not in words but in action. 
   It should not be forgotten that it was House Republicans who demonstrated a commitment to fundamental research by doubling the budget of National Institutes for Health. It was House Republicans who bolstered the discretionary budget for the Department of Education by 72 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars. 
   Even with our unquestionable dedication to the programs in this bill over the last 12 years, Republicans stand accused by the Democratic majority of shortchanging fundamental research, shortchanging education, and according to the rhetoric of the day, shortchanging our very future. This rhetoric diminishes all that we do as elected officials, and it does not serve the Congress or our country well. 
   The primary difference is that Republicans believe that we must balance the benefits of these worthwhile programs with the fact that the American taxpayer must pay for them. 
   I know that Chairman Obey feels very strongly about the Labor-H bill. He is now working two full-time jobs as chairman of the full committee and chairman of this subcommittee. He has also devoted one-half of the $20 billion or so increase over the President's budget request in the fiscal year 2008 302(b) allocation to the priorities contained in this bill. 
   The fiscal year 2008 Labor-H bill is $10.2 billion over the President's budget request and $6.6 billion over the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. Chairman Obey has said repeatedly that it is necessary  to increase the subcommittee allocation dramatically to make up for the past funding shortfalls. But I remind the chairman that these programs have grown by $85 billion over the last 13 years. 
   When Labor-HHS Chairman Neil Smith, a Democrat, presented his bill in 1994, total discretionary budget authority totaled $65 billion. If he had predicted in 1994 that this very same bill, which largely covers the same agencies today as it did then, would increase by $85 billion over the next 13 years, the chairman of the full committee, who happened to be David Obey, probably would not have believed it. 
   By any objective standard, whether you are Jerry Lewis or David Obey, $85 billion is a healthy increase, and today the committee is poised to spend an additional $10.2 billion under the mistaken notion that throwing money at our Nation's problems will cause them to fade away. 
   While many of these programs are popular on both sides of the aisle, a $10.2 billion increase is not without consequence, particularly when this bill contains what can rightly be considered lower priority and duplicative programs. For example, the committee-reported bill provides $420 million in 2-year advance appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Most objective observers will agree that providing these resources may be nice to do, but it hardly measures up to providing health care services to the poorest of Americans in terms of its priority. 
   Furthermore, there are a host of programs in the bill that duplicate activities that are funded elsewhere, not just in this bill but in other appropriations bills as well. For example, this legislation continues three programs that deal with violence prevention; one in the Labor Department, another in the Department of Health and Human Services, the third in the Department of Education. There are additional programs within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice that serve exactly the same purpose. Little real oversight was conducted to ferret out unnecessary and wasteful spending on these duplicative programs. 
   Yet another example is the funding the bill provides within the Administration for Children and Families for community economic development. According to this very committee report, these funds are intended to support employment, training, and business development opportunities for low-income residents in poor communities. Services that are already provided by the Department of Labor, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Economic Development Administration. 
   Surely the majority party could have met the very highest priority needs in this bill such as community health care centers or programs providing funding to educate youngsters living in poverty by eliminating duplicative programs or curtailing spending on lower priorities. Instead of making the tough choices between high- and low-priority programs or eliminating the duplication, this bill takes the easy way out: just spend more money. 
   The budget resolution adopted by the Democrat majority earlier this year and the appropriations bills that we are now considering spend some $23 billion more than the President requested. As we move forward with consideration of the fiscal year 2008 appropriations bills, Members of Congress ought to be aware that the average additional burden on the individual taxpayer to finance the spending spree outlined in the majority's budget will amount to roughly $3,000 to the individual taxpayer, $3,000. 
   I know it is difficult for many Members to oppose substantial increases in these popular programs; however, I remind Chairman Obey and our colleagues that these increases are not without consequence. 
   Make no mistake about it. Excessive spending will force the American taxpayer to shoulder the burden of this extra spending. And if past is prologue, we will continue to pass this debt along to future generations. 
   As we complete consideration of our work this week, the House will have approved an additional $20.4 billion in spending above the President's budget request for the next year. This level is $36.4 billion above the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. 
   So where is the Appropriations Committee in terms of getting its work done this year? It is July 17 and the House has five bills left to complete. The Senate has yet to take any of its bills to the floor and likely will not this month. Based on the present pace in both bodies, I have grave concern about our ability to complete our work this year through the regular order process. 
   Chairman Obey is fond of pointing out that the process in the House this year has been delayed by having to complete action on the fiscal year 2007 bills. It is no surprise that he often fails to mention the role that the Senate played in this equation. The Senate failed to complete its work last year, and today history is repeating itself. 
   It is ironically unfortunate that the same type of legislative train wreck is likely to occur again this year. The scenario is becoming more and more apparent with each passing day. While it is only July, if past experience is any guide, a warning is in order. Once again the Senate is showing absolutely no inclination or ability towards moving appropriations bills, setting up the inevitable end-of-the-year omnibus strategy. 
   My colleagues, it has not yet been stated in so many words, but this is, or soon will become, the strategy to complete our work this year. And mark my words, not only will most of our appropriations bills end up in an omnibus, it will be a well-adorned Christmas tree filled with plenty of legislative goodies, perfectly timed to coincide with the holidays.     
   I want to be very clear about this, an omnibus is absolutely the wrong and fiscally reckless approach to completing this year's work. It would inflate the budget deficit, reward bad behavior, and negate any semblance of fiscal discipline demonstrated by this body in recent years. 
   Short of passing our conference reports individually, the best alternative would be to once again pass a clean year-long continuing resolution at the current rate of fiscal year 2007 levels, and without Member projects. That is, of course, an undesirable option. But if at the end of the process the House and the Senate cannot complete their work in a responsible fashion, passing a clean CR will be the best option remaining to complete this year's work. 
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   I rise today to recognize the fact that there may be an amendment later this evening that will address the Marine Corps Training Center at 29 Palms. It's very, very important for the House to know the significance of that facility, the role it plays in the great work of the Marine Corps. The design here is to try to improve and help with that work.

As you know, this is DUNCAN HUNTER's last authorization bill and I honor his many years of service on the Armed Services Committee and his unfailing support of our men and women in uniform. 
   Mr Chairman, unfortunately an amendment has been made in order to strike an important project that would benefit all the marines and their family members who are stationed or who pass through Twentynine Palms marine base. 
   This project is the Lifelong Learning Center. 
   Phase I of the Life Long Learning Center, LLLC, project at the Marine Corps base Twentynine Palms provides a facility to help marines and their families fulfill their educational goals. 
   The project will replace older, undersized facilities with a 17,000 square foot, three-story building which will include classrooms, office spaces, a computer room and other supporting infrastructure. 
   When completed, the LLLC will facilitate more than 40 higher education classes with an anticipated enrollment exceeding 1500 students per term.

   Both KEN and I want our colleagues to know much more about this outstanding couple and their decades of public service. So together, we are asking consent to include remarks in the Record reflecting their lives together and their contribution to our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4156, ORDERLY AND RESPONSIBLE IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. I appreciate the Speaker's help in this matter, but in the meantime, I appreciate my colleague yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, the wheels have finally come off the appropriations process. One need only to look at the sorry state of affairs in which we find ourselves as we address these appropriations bills. 
   Earlier today, the House passed a Transportation-HUD appropriations conference report that is $3 billion over the budget request. The President has said he will veto this legislation. 
   Tomorrow the House will vote to sustain the President's veto on a bloated Labor-HHS bill that is $10 billion over the budget request. That will essentially send the bill back to the drawing board. 
   And if that is not enough, consider this. It is now 3 days after Veterans Day and there is still no sign of the majority moving to considered the MilCon-VA bill, a freestanding bill identical to the MilCon-VA conference report that was removed from the Labor-HHS conference report by a point of order in the Senate, by the way, in the other body. 
   That bill was introduced by Congressman Wicker this week. This legislation, which the President said he would sign, could be brought to the House floor today. It now appears that a Democrat majority has no intent of bringing this legislation to the floor before Thanksgiving. 
   The appropriations process this year has been reduced to what Shakespeare might refer to as ``a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.'' 
   For all of the time and energy put into these bills this year by Members and our overworked, highly professional staff, the end result thus far is all sound and fury and very little to show for it. 
   That leads us to the legislation we are now considering, the so-called bridge fund. Frankly, that legislation is so ill-conceived and damaging to our troops, I hardly know where to begin. 
   First, let me say that we learned that this bill would be considered by the Rules Committee while we were waiting for the Rules Committee hearing on the THUD conference report to begin last night. I was given no notice whatsoever, nor was I provided any opportunity to testify. It is a sad state of affairs when the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee isn't even given the courtesy of paper notice  to testify on legislation as important as this. I can't imagine the wails and screaming I would have heard last year if the ranking member had been put in that position. 
   The House is being asked to consider a funding bill that reflects the priorities of Speaker Pelosi and a deeply divided, extremely left-leaning Democratic Caucus. It attempts to bridge these widening divisions over the war in Iraq through providing funding only on the condition that troops are withdrawn beginning 30 days after the bill's enactment.     
   Our troops are badly in need of funding to continue their mission, but this legislation ties the hands of our Commander in Chief during a time of war, places military decisions in the hands of the politicians, and micromanages our combatant commanders in whom we place the ultimate responsibility for prosecuting military actions. 
   If the majority's goal is to end the war or withdraw our troops, then that should be addressed in separate legislation. The majority cannot have it both ways, pretending on the one hand to support our troops while on the other hand undercutting our ability to prosecute their mission. 
   Men and women of good conscience can disagree about the war in Iraq, but on one thing we must all agree: Our men and women in uniform must continue to receive our unqualified support and the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. 
   By appeasing the wishes of the Out of Iraq Caucus, the Democrat majority has chosen to place partisan politics above the lives and well-being of our troops in harm's way. This action is reckless and irresponsible. There is absolutely no reason why a clean bridge fund could not have been included within the DOD conference report which the President signed yesterday. Again, the Democrat majority chose to place politics ahead of our troops. 
   My colleagues, consider carefully the consequences of our actions here today. Passage of the bridge fund legislation in its present form will signal to the insurgents and terrorists that the United States doesn't have the political will to continue supporting the fledgling Iraqi democracy. Al Qaeda and other enemies of freedom will simply lay in wait until our troops are withdrawn. And with the collapse of this fragile democracy, our efforts, and the sacrifices of our troops, will have been for nothing. 
   There is no question that the President will veto this bill. In the meantime, our troops will face the uncertainty resulting from the majority's mixed signals and lack of a clear commitment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support our troops and oppose this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. I appreciate very much my colleague yielding. And before making the remarks I have in mind, I want to extend my congratulations to the chairman and the ranking member for a very thoughtful effort to put together a very reasonable bill, while it is a bit over the funding levels of the President, and as a result of that I'll probably vote against it. 
   I had not planned to speak on this bill, for I had an understanding from the other side that maybe neither the chairman or the ranking member would spend too much time speaking. 
   I must say that some years ago it was my privilege to chair this subcommittee, and I took that responsibility very, very seriously. I know that the chairman of the committee has been very frustrated with me this year as I've suggested, more than one time, that the solution on the other side to every problem, it seems, is to throw more money at it. 
   And the chairman just was wringing his hands a bit about the section 8 funding in this bill and suggesting we certainly should be doing a better job. 
   Well, let me say, Mr. Speaker, we absolutely should be doing a better job. 
   And back then, when I had a chance to chair this subcommittee, I spent some time with then-Secretary Henry, under a different administration than this one, and he and I went to section 8 housing circumstances and both wrung our hands with some frustration about the way many of those housing authorities are operating and the way they're using the money that we send out there to help the poorest of the poor have a chance for reasonable housing. 
   We found that there were some serious questions to be raised, and that led to a thing called the Housing Fraud Initiative. And we gave extra money to the Inspector General of the Housing Authority, and the Inspector General went around the country, and, indeed, found serious problems in any number of housing authorities about the way the money was being spent that supposedly was designed for the poorest of the poor. 
   It is not a fact that those housing authorities automatically respond in a way that would reflect the best use of our money. And if that's an illustration, indeed, the chairman has made my point. We don't solve problems by just throwing money, especially if we're not willing to follow the money and see if it's getting to the people we pretend to want to help in the first place.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. I appreciate very much my colleague yielding, and I rise also to pay tribute to one of the great Americans who provided a level of leadership in terms of public policy in this House like few have and most would want to be. 
   Gus was a wonderful friend over time, and his best roommate, a guy by the name of Frank Baca served us in and around the Vatican for some years, a wonderful guy as well. They lived a short distance from our house. My bride and I used to walk in the park and run into Gus often. The conversations were about the House first, briefly, but then from there the fact that the best thing about this place, if we will let it, it is a place where people of great difference can become very dear and warm friends. 
   Gus Hawkins was one of the great Americans to ever serve in the Congress. While he has passed, it is a tribute to America that we can have men and women in the House of Representatives of the style and class of Gus Hawkins. 
   I appreciate my colleague yielding.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the chairman of the committee often talks about thoughts and wisdom of Archie the cockroach, but today I am reminded of the words of Yogi Berra, ``It's deja vu all over again.'' 
   It was 1 year ago that the House passed the first of several continuing resolutions to ensure the continuation of government-funded programs in the new fiscal year. 
   My friend, David Obey, came to the floor as the ranking member during the debate to criticize Republicans in the House and the Senate for their failure to pass the annual spending bills by the end of the fiscal year. He spoke of the breakdown of the budget process and vowed that things would be different under a Democrat majority. 
   We are now 4 days away from the end of the fiscal year, and once again the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee is on the floor decrying the breakdown of regular order. The only difference is that David Obey is now Chairman Obey and I am a mere struggling committee ranking member. 
   At this time last year, we had sent President Bush two appropriations conference reports. This year, not one appropriations conference meeting has taken place between the two bodies, even though there are bills available. 
   When we passed the first CR last year, my hope was it would provide strong motivation for Congress to complete its work in regular order. I was hopeful that our colleagues in the Senate would complete their work so we could send to the White House the remaining individual conference reports before the end of our legislative session. 
   I come to the floor today with the same hopeful expectation that the Senate will soon complete its work. But, based on recent history, I'm not holding my breath. 
   My appropriations colleague, Senator Cochran of Mississippi, could not have been a better partner as we attempted to bring regular order to the appropriations process. Unfortunately, Chairman Cochran was poorly served by his own leadership. 
   The breakdown of regular order in the last Congress, indeed the failure to get our bills done, was placed squarely at the feet of the former Senate majority leader who failed to schedule floor time for the consideration of appropriations bills. One year later, the failure of the appropriations process can be laid squarely at the feet of the present Senate majority leader. 
   The House has passed each of its spending bills; and, while I believe these bills spend too much, the House Appropriations Committee has kept its word by completing its work. 
   During my tenure as chairman, the Appropriations Committee was strongly committed to bringing to the floor individual conference reports for each and every bill. I did not then support, and do not now support, an omnibus spending bill in any form. But that is exactly the direction in which the Democrat majority is now moving. 
   I am convinced that moving bills individually is the only way for us to control government spending. Lacking regular order, there is a tendency for spending on the remaining bills to grow out of control. That challenge is particularly acute this year with the Democrat majority writing and passing spending bills that exceed the President's budget request by about $23 billion. 
   We are today passing a CR that continues for the next 6 weeks Federal programs under the terms and conditions established in the 2007 fiscal year resolution. 
   In 6 weeks, I am afraid we will be here once again to pass yet another continuing resolution, and that will lead us well into the free-spending holiday season. 
   My colleagues, we are moving ever closer to a massive year-end omnibus spending bill. That course of action would be an admission of failure on the part of this Congress. 
   At this moment, there is still time for Democrats and Republicans to find common ground on spending. There is still time for the House and the Senate to complete its work in regular order. There is still time to pass and send to the White House individual conference reports. But we must act now. 
   I would like to close by quoting my friend, Mr. Obey, from a past continuing resolution debate: ``This continuing resolution is a monument to institutional failure. This Congress is failing to meet even the most basic and minimal expectations that the country has for it by way of doing our routine business. This is governing in a pitiful way,'' Mr. Obey said, ``and I wish that I could say something more positive about it, but, indeed, I cannot.'' 
   Mr. Speaker, and I would say, ``Madam Speaker,'' if I could find the gentlelady on the floor, ``Madam Speaker, this is deja vu all over again.'' 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, this simple motion is to recommend or recommit. It is a sense of the Congress resolution that recognizes the service of General David Petraeus as well as all other members of our Armed Forces. It expresses our appreciation for his personal sacrifices and those of his family as well as the sacrifices of those who served in the Armed Forces and their families.     
   Further, this sense of the Congress resolution condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the unfair personal attacks made by the advocacy group, MoveOn.org, on the character, integrity and professionalism of General David Patraeus. Such unwarranted attacks should be strongly condemned by Republicans and Democrats alike in the House. 
   I strongly urge a ``yea'' vote on the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I rise today to express my opposition to this emergency supplemental. My colleagues know that I have the highest level of respect for my chairman, Mr. Obey. Together we worked as partners in the 109th Congress, passing appropriations bills through the committee and through the House. Indeed, the Appropriations Committee is at its best when each of us works together across party lines and rises above purely partisan politics. 
   During the last Congress I was privileged to serve as chairman of this great committee, and Mr. Obey was our distinguished ranking member. Today, our roles are reversed, and Mr. Obey is now our chairman. 
   There is no question that if my friend from Wisconsin were permitted to write this bill on his own, this would be a much better product. Instead, the House is being asked to consider a spending bill that reflects the priorities of Speaker Pelosi and a deeply divided Democratic Caucus. It attempts to bridge these widening divisions over the war in Iraq by delivering billions of dollars in unrelated and unauthorized spending under an emergency designation. 
   This legislation ought to focus on our troops. It ought to focus on providing those in harm's way with the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. It ought to respect, not micromanage, our combatant commanders in whom we place the ultimate responsibility of prosecuting military actions. 
   Instead, this legislation ties the hands of our Commander in Chief during a time of war, places military decisions in the hands of politicians, and attempts to buy votes for its passage on the left and on the right by literally promising something to everyone. 
   If the majority's goal is to end the war or withdraw our troops, then that should be addressed in a separate piece of legislation. The majority cannot have it both ways, pretending, on the one hand, to support our troops, while on the other undercutting their ability to prosecute their mission. 
   Men and women of good conscience can disagree about the war in Iraq. But on one thing we must all agree, our men and women in uniform must continue to receive our unqualified support and the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. 
   My colleagues, consider carefully the consequences of our actions here today. Passage of this measure in its present form will signal to insurgents and terrorists that the United States doesn't have the political will to continue supporting this fledgling Iraqi democracy.     
   Al Qaeda and other enemies of freedom will simply lay in wait until our troops are withdrawn. And with the collapse of this fragile democracy, our efforts, and the sacrifices of our troops, will have been for nothing. 
   The fight in Iraq is also critical to the future of Israel. A failure in Iraq will further destabilize the region, posing a direct threat to Israel. We must not let that occur to our friend and ally. 
   There should be no carrot big enough to force Members into choosing between their principled support for our troops in the field and funding for the many unrelated and parochial items sprinkled throughout this bill. 
   Republican Members in the House are simply not going to abandon our principles, and troops in the field, for the promise of pork back in our districts. To their credit, many Democrats also continue to express grave reservations about this approach and about this legislation. 
   Last year Congress sent the President a clean supplemental bill for our troops. This Congress, and our country, would be better served by producing a clean bill free of extraneous spending and unrelated legislative provisions. 
   There is no question that the President will veto this bill. In the meantime our troops will face the uncertainty resulting from the majority's mixed signals and lack of a clear commitment.  
   I am also deeply concerned that the Democrat leadership has brought this emergency supplemental to the House floor under a closed rule without opportunity for Members on both sides of the aisle to offer amendments. 
   During my tenure as chairman, the House considered six emergency supplemental appropriations bills. Of these six bills, the two largest bills, H.R. 1268, was $81.2 billion; the other was a $91.8 billion supplemental. Those two bills primarily focused on the global war on terror. In both instances I worked closely with my leadership and the Rules Committee in seeking rules that permitted open debate, including amendments, on the House floor. And in both instances, these supplemental bills were considered under an open rule. The remaining four bills were noncontroversial and bipartisan in nature and were considered by unanimous consent on the Suspension Calendar. 
   I assumed that Chairman Obey would continue in the longstanding tradition and practice of the committee to advocate open rules on all appropriations bills. Members on both sides of the aisle benefit by a process that supports a fair, honest, open, and transparent debate on the House floor. I was disappointed that Mr. Obey's first bill as chairman, the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution, was considered under a closed rule, with only 1 hour of debate and no opportunity for amendments. 
   Consideration of this supplemental under a closed rule is unprecedented and leaves the minority little choice but to walk away from the tradition of comity that has marked our longstanding work on this committee. 
   By denying Members, both Democrats and Republicans, their right to offer amendments to this legislation, I can assure you that all bets are off on getting our committee work done this year. It simply will not happen. There will be no unanimous consent agreements on the fiscal year 2008 bills. I spoke personally with Mr. Obey about this and asked him to carry that message directly to the Speaker. 
   This legislation is simply too important to have it rushed through the House with no debate and no opportunity for the body to consider amendments. Consideration of this legislation under a closed rule signals to the House, and to the public, that the Speaker has imposed martial law on the people's House. 
   Lastly, I would be remiss not to highlight my reservations about the budgetary aspects of this bill that proposes more than $22 billion in emergency spending items that are completely unrelated to the global war on terror or legitimate emergencies in the Gulf Coast region. 
   I ask my colleagues what does a $25 million bailout for spinach producers, $60 million for the salmon fishing industry, or $5 million for fish breeding have to do with the global war on terror? 
   This legislation also includes authorization language to increase the minimum wage. Again, I ask my friends why can't the committees of jurisdiction in the House and the Senate meet in open conference to resolve the differences between these bills? What place has this provision in a wartime supplemental? 
   In short, much of what is included in this bill is completely unrelated to the global war on terror and has no place in the bill. Sadly, many items are being designated as emergencies for no other reason than to make more room for additional spending on the part of the Democrats under the fiscal 2008 caps. 
   I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider thoughtfully the precedent set by this legislation. Weigh in your conscience the effects of undermining the authority of the President, and future Presidents, and putting at further risk our men and women in uniform. 
   Our Congress, and our country, would be better served by sending the President a clean supplemental free of extraneous spending and unrelated legislative provisions. 
   While I respect Chairman Obey, I cannot support this legislation as it is presently written. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank very much my colleague for yielding me this time. 
   I am very, very appreciative of this resolution being on the floor today. A phrase oft used in the West would suggest that you should ``bring us men to match our mountains.'' And in California such men have made truly a magnificent difference in the way the far West was developed. Leo McCarthy certainly was at the top rank of those leaders. 
   I first met Leo McCarthy when he and I were elected to the State legislature together. We were classmates and colleagues and friends. A supervisor and assemblyman, became Speaker of the House, Lieutenant Governor of our State, a magnificent leader who absolutely wallowed in the business of public policy. He cared about making a difference on a number of issues across the spectrum of those issues that impact people's lives. He was a guy who was devoted to his family, as has been suggested, but also devoted to public service. 
   As we pay tribute to Leo McCarthy today, let us seek other men and women who would so serve, for, indeed, he is an example of the very best among us and reflects the best of our public affairs. 
   Let me say that probably most important to me over the years was the fact that Leo, while he played a very significant partisan role, absolutely knew in his soul that real solutions did not come by way of partisan confrontation. A magnificent leader who I am proud to say was my very good friend.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, our friends on the other side of the aisle are fond of saying that a budget is a moral document. It shows what we care about. I couldn't agree more. 
   The majority's bloated budget blueprint is a clear demonstration to families across America that the Democratic majority in Congress is intently focused on dipping its fingers into their pockets to take more and more of their hard-earned money. It shows that the Democratic majority will raise taxes, without hesitation, to support its addiction to spending. And it shows that Democrats in Congress are not interested in making difficult choices, setting priorities, or rooting out waste in government spending. 
   What we are considering today is the Democrat majority's ``more, more, more resolution.'' More spending, more budget gimmicks, and more taxes. 
   As my colleagues well remember, we held the line on spending last year thanks solely to the President and Republicans in Congress. The President's budget requested this year $59 billion, or a 6.3 percent increase, in discretionary spending over the present fiscal year. Most people would think $59 billion is plenty, but it's not enough for the ``more, more, more budget.'' 
   We hear our Democrat colleagues pay a great deal of lip service to the poor. But here's what failing to extend these tax cuts in the years ahead will do to the poor: 
   Six million low-income American families will no longer qualify for earned income tax credits; 
   Low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit; 
   Roughly 12 million single women with children will see their taxes increase by $1,100 a year. 
   As disconcerting as all of this may be, the real 800-pound gorilla sitting in the corner of the room is the problem, and that is entitlement spending. Presently, mandatory spending and interest on the national debt consumes nearly two-thirds of the Federal budget, and it is rising at an alarming and unsustainable pace. 
   If we ignore the 800-pound gorilla, we are walking away from the dire needs, desperate needs, of the American public.  
   Mr. Chairman, our friends on the other side of the aisle are fond of saying that a budget is a moral document--it shows what we care about. I couldn't agree more. 
   The majority's bloated budget blueprint is a clear demonstration to families across America that the Democrat majority in Congress is intently focused on dipping its fingers into their pockets to take more and more of their hard-earned money. It shows that the Democrat majority will raise taxes--without hesitation--to support its addiction to spending. And, it shows that Democrats in Congress are not interested in making difficult choices, setting priorities, or rooting out waste in government spending.  
   What we are considering today is the Democrat majority's ``More, More, More Budget Resolution''--more spending, more budget gimmicks, more taxes. For the first time in history, the discretionary budget that is being proposed by this majority will exceed one trillion dollars. 
   As my colleagues well remember, we held the line on spending last year thanks solely to the President and Republicans in Congress. In spite of the desire of our Democrat colleagues to spend far more, this Congress passed appropriations bills that totaled roughly $933 billion in discretionary funding. 
   The President's budget requested a $59 billion, or 6.3 percent, increase in discretionary spending over the present fiscal year. Most people would think that a $59 billion increase in spending would be enough. But not this majority. They are proposing a whopping $82 billion, or nine percent, increase over current year levels. 
   In addition to the tens of billions of additional taxpayer funds they're proposing to spend next year, this majority intends to play budget games and increase advance appropriations by another $2 billion above what was provided this year. 
   The notion of advance appropriations is arcane budget talk so I'll try to break it down into real English. The majority is committing an additional $2 billion in funding for next year--remember, we don't pay for it this year, we pay for it next year. 
   My colleague from New York, Mr. WALSH, correctly pointed out during consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Labor/HHS bill that advance funding is a dangerous proposition because if Congress does not keep providing at least the same level of advance funding year after year, drastic cuts will be needed to live within the allocations each appropriations subcommittee receives. 
   I want to address another troubling aspect of this budget proposal. We have heard--and will continue to hear--our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about how this budget cuts taxes. Nothing could be further from the truth. By failing to make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, this budget actually increases the tax burden on American citizens by $683 billion over the next five years. 
   That's a pretty big number, but let me break this number down in a manner that makes sense to the average family sitting around their kitchen table. Under this budget, the average American family of four that earns $50,000 per year will send an additional $2,100 to Washington in 2011. 
   We hear our Democratic colleagues pay a great deal of lip service to the poor, but here's what failing to extend these tax cuts does to low-income Americans: 6 million low-income Americans will no longer qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit; low-income families with one or two children will no longer be eligible for the refundable child tax credit; roughly 12 million single women with children will see their taxes increase by $1,100 per year; and about 18 million seniors living on fixed incomes will be subjected to tax increases of more than $2,100 per year. 
   As disconcerting as the rampant spending is, let's not lose sight of the fact that this budget ignores the 800-pound gorilla sitting in the corner of the room--entitlement spending. Presently, mandatory spending and interest on the national debt consumes nearly two-thirds of the Federal budget and it is rising at an alarming, unsustainable pace. 
   In 1990, we spent the equivalent of $893 billion of today's dollars on entitlement programs--mostly Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Today we are poised to spend $1.6 trillion on those same entitlements. For those who like to talk in percentages, that represents a 74 percent increase in inflation adjusted dollars. We ignore this sleeping giant at our own peril. 
   So my friends, let's ask ourselves this question: who will pay for this budget? The simple answer is our children and our grandchildren. 
   They will pay for it in the form of higher taxes because this budget refuses to make permanent the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 that spurred roughly 6 years of economic growth. 
   They will pay for it in the form of reduced future prosperity because Government will continue to spend and spend and spend. 
   They will pay for it because their Government would consume more and more of what they earn rather than allowing them to invest, create jobs, and improve their quality of life. 
   In short, Mr. Chairman, this ``big government, Washington-knows-best'' budget suggests that politicians and bureaucrats in Washington are better stewards of the public's money than the very families who send it here. 
   My advice to the American taxpayer is this: Hold onto your wallet because the big spenders in Congress are coming to take more of what you can earn. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject the majority's bloated budget resolution. It's time to put Uncle Sam on a diet.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2007 -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to extend my support for the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill. The bill, as recommended by Chairman Murtha and Mr. Young, is a clean bill. It is a good bill. It is a bipartisan bill. 
   This bill provides almost $460 billion for our Nation's defense, an increase of $39.7 billion over the fiscal year 2007 appropriations. It funds the country's priorities during a period where we find ourselves developing a force structure for the future and carrying out a Global War on Terrorism. The bill provides balance with support for development and deployment of near-term capabilities, while investing in the future through robust science and technology efforts. In particular, the bill: 
   Continues the establishment of a strong missile defense against the threats of our adversaries; 
   Furthers the revitalization of our human intelligence efforts, a critical capability lost in the 90's, while maintaining our technical intelligence assets; 
   Focuses the evolution of tomorrow's blue water navy; 
   Grows the force structure necessary to meet the operational demands and reduce the burdens carried by our military families; 
   Addresses the health care needs of our soldiers; and, 
   Does all of these things while providing the necessary resources to train and equip today's forces that are currently in harm's way. 
   I believe, however, that it may be more important to appreciate what this bill doesn't do rather than what it actually does. 
   This bill doesn't bog us down in the useless exercise of academic debate on issues better discussed elsewhere. 
   It doesn't step into the authorizations world with misguided attempts to solve issues associated with topics like Iraq or detainee policy. 
   And, most importantly, it doesn't delay providing our men and women in uniform our unqualified support and the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. I strongly urge my colleagues to preserve this quality of the bill before us today. 
   Over the years that I have been privileged to serve on the Appropriations committee, we have made every effort to leave partisan politics at the door. We have teamed up in a bipartisan fashion to do what is best for the country. This bill follows that longstanding, time-honored tradition. 
   For us to get our work done--for us to be successful--it must remain that way. National security demands that this bill focus on the needs of our troops. In its current form, this bill does that. 
   National security also demands that Congress move swiftly. The House is doing its part and I would urge our colleagues in the Senate to join us in moving this bill--and others--quickly. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge the swift adoption of this Defense Appropriations bill.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, it is most interesting that we would have this discussion this evening. It is not my intention to spend a lot of time on this, but, nonetheless, last year we had a discussion about another project entirely near the Marine base, and I asked the gentleman if he had ever been to the Marine barracks in Washington, D.C., and he had not. 
   In this case to even suggest that there isn't an interest in education within the families that make up our services across the country and the world causes me almost to smile if it wasn't so painful to think that he didn't understand how important this could be to military families. 
   This program involves a model center, developing methods for attracting and training, developing teachers and otherwise, to encourage young people to be involved in math and science. It has now affected literally tens of thousands of students all across the country. It has had a tremendous impact upon military families who are interested in these programs. It has attracted NASA, playing a major role in the fundamental center of the success of this educational effort. Retired employees from companies like JPL volunteer time to help in this effort because it is having an effect upon science education all across America, including literally, literally, hundreds, if not thousands, of student in Arizona alone. 
   Last year we had this discussion. I don't want to take a lot of time, only to say that after the discussion, 50 of my colleagues decided to vote against this program and well over 300 of my friends, our colleagues, thought it was a worthwhile effort. It is indeed one of the models for attracting kids of military families dramatically to math and science across the country, and I urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's recommendation.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, Mr. Young is exactly correct. 
   I don't stand to take credit for all kinds of extra earmarks. But as long as we are talking about it, the gentleman has heard the Predator mentioned a number of times. I think the gentleman knows that the bureaucrats don't necessarily have all the answers, whether those bureaucrats happen to be in the Education Department or they happen to be in the military. 
   Back when we were looking at the Predator, the idea of an unmanned aerial vehicle, it was pretty clear that the Air Force was much more interested in programs where planes were flown by men than in new ideas. The Predator came along, an unmanned aerial vehicle concept, and I had to take credit, my goodness, credit that year when this became implemented for some $40 million of an earmark to advance the RDT&E, the research and development. If that $40 million had not been appropriated, Predator would not have been available in Bosnia. 
   Now, since then Predator has gone forward and done many a thing, and I suppose I should be taking credit for hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of earmarks. But in the meantime, the military does not have all the answers to all the ideas, and, indeed, neither does the Department of Education.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague yielding me this time and rise simply to say that one of the most important things for all of us to recognize on both sides of the aisle is that the American public is absolutely sick and tired of seeing us doing purely partisan battle in the name of serving the public. 
   Over the years, if there's an arena where we have come together in a totally nonpartisan way, it has been in support of our veterans. To hear my friend, my colleague from Texas, this evening painting veterans affairs programs in partisan terms, as though this is a partisan political game, would cause our colleague Sonny Montgomery to turn over in his grave. Absolutely he would find this style unacceptable. 
   Our veteran service organizations know an awful lot better than we do how important it is that we strike a nonpartisan tone. In this arena we have the opportunity to come together, Democrats and Republicans, on behalf of the American people. I urge us to get back to that pattern that says this is not a partisan game. We all, Democrats and Republicans, support our veterans. The record has already been laid out that will make that very, very clear to anybody who would but take the time to read it. 
   Above and beyond that, Madam Speaker, it is very likely that this package will be vetoed by the President, largely because the President is trying to strike a tone which says you don't solve every problem that faces the American public by way of simply throwing money at those problems. There are those who think that government is the only solution and the only way to get to an end is by throwing mud at the wall and hoping some will stick. 
   In the arena that involves fundamental and basic research leading to better health care for all Americans, when we played a nonpartisan role, we have gotten very, very positive results. I think the public recognizes that the sooner we can get this House to come together and bring our people together, the more progress we are going to make. It's long past due that we recognize that we do our best work by going to the subcommittee level and setting aside partisan politics, knowing full well that our Appropriation Committee works extremely well with the give-and-take and compromise that happens at the subcommittee level. Some way this year in this House we have gotten away from this. If we continue on this pattern, I predict that we are going to destroy the Appropriations Committee as we know it. 
   Now, one more thing. The President will veto this bill. I predict his veto will be sustained. Then this House will come back and hopefully in a nonpartisan way, I say to my friend from Texas, in a nonpartisan way pass a bill that reflects all of our support for America's veterans.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, before going to the business at hand, let me say to my colleagues that that moment of silence earlier was something that each of us should take home with us in our hearts this evening. That which has happened in Minnesota is an obvious tragedy to the people affected, those who lost their lives, those who were injured, and, indeed, those we don't know about. 
   In turn, it is a reflection of the reality that across the country we have infrastructure exactly like that in Minnesota that we should all try to raise in terms of the priority of our attention. Indeed, that kind of crisis will come again, and we need to pay attention to it soon. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, this motion to recommit would send the bill back to the committee and report the bill back promptly with an amendment that prohibits any funds in this act from being used to employ a person who is not authorized to be employed in this country and prohibits funds from being used for rental housing assistance to a person who is not authorized to receive such assistance. 
   There is nothing, Mr. Speaker, there is nothing dilatory about this motion. This is not a political piece of chicanery. It only requires that funds in this act be implemented in accordance with the current law and to ensure that sufficient diligence be employed by the USDA and its partners to ensure that these current requirements are followed. 
   Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to be allocating funds and subsidizing individuals who are not in our country legally. 
   Similar amendments have been adopted in several appropriations bills passed by the House this year. Had there been regular order on this bill, I am sure they would have been adopted on this bill as well, that is, those individuals who would suggest that we should not have people who are not legally in this country being subsidized. 
   Now, you are going to hear from my friends on the other side of the aisle that this will kill the bill. That is absolutely not the case. As has been demonstrated by their actions today, they can go to committee, pass these amendments, and then waive procedural issues to bring this bill back to the floor tomorrow. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote ``aye'' on this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate my colleague's courtesy. Almost all that I was going to say about UCLA's prowess in athletics has already been stated for the Record.  
   Having said that, Madam Speaker, many a person looking at the wondrous world of athletics oftentimes thinks only of the 11 banners that involves John Wooden's era as coach of UCLA's basketball team. As has been suggested, one would really miss the point of the fabulous work done at the UCLA campus, way beyond athletics, in academics, et cetera. But indeed, the women's water polo team set the standard by winning the 100th championship when they won one more time. It is a fabulous item to be associated with UCLA and to get this recognition from so many great friends. 
   In the meantime, I want you all to know that my dog Bruin very much appreciates the attention.  
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the UCLA Bruins for being the most accomplished athletic program in NCAA history, having won 100 NCAA championships. 
   Many observers might presume that for UCLA the only game in town is men's basketball. Many walk into Pauley Pavilion and see 11 championship banners, experience the legacy of John Wooden, and presume that's all there is. But for UCLA, that is only the beginning. 
   The UCLA men's tennis team won the first NCAA championship for the Bruins in 1950 and the last 58 years have been witness to an unprecedented record of success. Including the 11 men's basketball titles, UCLA's championship record extends across 16 different programs including multiple titles in men's volleyball, 19; men's tennis, 16; women's softball, 10; men's track and field, 8; men's water polo, 8; women's gymnastics, 5; women's track and field, 5; and women's water polo, 5. 
   UCLA's 100th championship came from the women's water polo team, which won its third consecutive NCAA Division I championship on May 13, 2007. The Bruins, coached by Adam Krikorian, finished 28-2 and have been 90-6 over the past three seasons. Courtney Mathewson scored three goals and Jillian Kraus added two more as the Bruins beat rival Stanford. Kelly Rulon was selected as the tournament's Most Valuable Player. Rulon, Mathewson, and Kraus were joined by Emily Feher and Kacy Kunkel as members to the NCAA All-Tournament First Team. 
   These championships reflect the philosophies of great Bruin coaches like basketball icon John Wooden and volleyball legend Al Scates. Their commitment to hard work, discipline, and sportsmanship has created a legacy of victory unparalleled in college sports. Additionally, the contributions of all the fans, students, alumni, and staff have been instrumental over the years in helping UCLA achieve 100 championships. 
   The list of Bruin athletes who contributed to the school's heritage of victory is a rollcall of the greatest athletes of our time: Lewis Alcindor, Arthur Ashe, Evelyn Ashford, Jimmy Connors, Gale Devers, Mitch Gaylord, Florence Griffith-Joyner, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Karch Kiraly, Jackie Robinson, Bill Walton, and others. 
   I'm especially proud that UCLA is a public university committed to diversity and fulfilling the promise of Title IX. Since 1982, Bruin women teams have contributed 30 championships to UCLA's total. This is enough to put them 11th on the NCAA's all-time champions list. 
   One hundred championships is a reflection of the teamwork that is the hallmark of UCLA athletics and its strong tradition of combining excellence in athletics with excellence in academics. UCLA's commitment to hard work, discipline, and sportsmanship has created a tradition of victory unparalleled in college sports.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. You have not. I would suggest to the gentleman that probably one of the most important things that a Member of Congress should do is to go to the Marine barracks. On 13 Friday evenings annually, approximately 45,000 people enjoy absolutely the best of our Armed Forces displayed by the marches that take place on the Marine barracks on those Friday evenings, a phenomenal, phenomenal experience for those people who care about our Armed Forces, but also know the historic role that Washington, D.C. has played in terms of supporting and building our military. 
   8th Street is known as Barracks Row because of the Marine barracks. But over a number of years, indeed generations, Barracks Row, 8th Street, had deteriorated very, very significantly. The commercial values had all but been eliminated. And right in the heart of it was this fabulous headquarters of the National Marine Corps known as the Marine barracks. 
   It seemed to some of us some time ago that it was very logical to take advantage of that location and the Naval Yard's distance just to the south of it and indeed perhaps even create a Georgetown on Capitol Hill. 
   Over a number of years, with help on both sides of the aisle, the Congress has re-established Barracks Row as a phenomenal spot on Capitol Hill. Today, its commercial value has skyrocketed. It is having a phenomenal impact on the community. The allocation this year for continuing that process is approximately $500,000. We spend in this bill something like $650 million in our Capital Support funds overall. This is a minor piece of all of that. 
   Indeed, Georgetown on Capitol Hill is a very, very worthwhile project. It has been immensely successful. The return on the Federal investment that has taken place over the years is difficult to measure. But it is truly immeasurable in my mind's eye. The contribution it has made to the capital is a very significant one. 
   This amendment essentially would rifle shot at that very project. It is a project we all should, Members of the House, along with our staffs who work and live here, should be very proud as a result of this Federal expenditure. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Chairman, let me say that the Marine barracks are only a small piece of Barracks Row, as the gentleman has suggested. The plaza at the end of Plaza Row is one of the pieces that  needed to go together to make this truly a very successful venture on Capitol Hill on behalf of our responsibility to make certain that Capitol Hill, beyond just our presence here, is a successful and vibrant community. 
   There is absolutely no question that what has happened on 8th Street has been a phenomenal change in the region. It goes beyond the Marine barracks, all the way to the Naval base. I think Members know that not very far away, a new baseball stadium is in the process of being developed. It is going to be a phenomenal region, and this is only one small piece of it. 
   I know the gentleman spends most of his time in commercial ventures in Arizona. I would suggest he might want to go to 8th Street and take a look at the restaurants. I might even buy you a meal there. It would be a wonderful exposure to a fabulous piece of our Nation's capital, and the Congress can be proud of the contribution they have made here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, the purpose of this motion to recommit is simple. It recommits the bill back to committee to make clear that the funding provided to the IRS in this bill is only available to administer, implement, and enforce existing tax laws. 
   The majority party's budget plan includes implementing the biggest tax  increase in history, and this motion would prevent that from taking place. 
   While the economy is not functioning perfectly, the indicators show that the economy is strong. GDP in 2006 was 3.4 percent above 2005.     
   Capital investment increased by 6.8 percent in 2006. Unemployment is at 4.6 percent. Tax receipts increased by 11.8 percent in fiscal year 2006, on top of fiscal year 2005's increase of 14.6 percent. So while Congress and the administration have lowered taxes, the economy has grown and the tax revenues have increased. Implementing new tax increases, as the majority party's budget proposes, will have a chilling effect on our economy and the American family as more of their hard-earned money comes to Washington. 
   While the deficit, which is estimated to be $244 billion in fiscal year 2007, is very troubling, tax collections are at an all-time high. Instead of increasing taxes to address the deficit and possibly reversing economic growth and further burdening the American family, I believe we must put more focus on controlling spending, both mandatory spending, and discretionary programs as well. 
   This motion will prohibit the IRS from implementing new taxes, protecting the American family and our economy. 
   I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I very much appreciate the gentleman from the Rules Committee raising these very, very important questions. 
   Our membership should know, and I think the American public will want to know, that one of the reasons to have a meeting in the dead of the night to make changes in this package is because this package, in the name of helping children, is designed to do much more than that. As a matter of fact, the SCHIP program, in its original form, was an excellent program, working very well to help children who are uninsured, on the margin of poverty. 
   The design of this bill is to expand that program into eventually all children and pushing them off of private health care, et cetera. The real plan here is to set the stage for a movement of the next gigantic step in the direction of what should be called ``Hillary Care,'' national socialized medicine. Literally, that's what they're about. 
   The program has been working very well. It does need some additional funding. These States do not need the opportunity to expand these programs not just to illegals but to children who presently, in high percentages, are already in private health care systems. Their design is obviously a design that goes way beyond the stated purpose for this bill. 
   I appreciate my colleague yielding.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the gentlelady who spoke just before me, our respected Speaker, is a person I have worked with for most of my life in public affairs. Our Speaker suggested that the President was wrong, and, Mr. Speaker, I humbly suggest that in this instance, our esteemed Speaker is wrong. 
   Madam Speaker, it was no secret that this conference report was going to be vetoed. Early on, the President made very clear his intention to veto this legislation because of the Iraq withdrawal language and the many unrelated and costly spending items that have absolutely nothing to do with the global war on terror and recovery efforts on the gulf coast. 
   It is no secret that many Members of the House and Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, had strong reservations about the manner in which this legislation undermined the authority of the President, our Commander in Chief. 
   From the beginning of this process, Members have expressed their concern about how this legislation placed military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than military commanders in the field. The last thing our country or our troops need is to have 535 Members and Senators micromanaging the war in Iraq. That simply is not our job, Madam Speaker. 
   Recent history reminds us that the enemy we face in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other countries that harbor terrorists will stop at nothing to attack the United States and our allies. 
   My colleagues, now is not the time for the United States to back down from its commitment to the war on terror. Now is not the time for America to signal retreat and surrender. Indeed, now is not the time for the House of Representatives to throw in the towel, wave the white flag or signal retreat and surrender in Iraq. 
   How could this Congress walk away from our men and women in uniform? How could we walk away from them now? We must not let that happen. We must support our troops. Our failure to learn the lessons of history, our failure to lead, will result in devastating consequences, including an even greater loss of life and even more resources needed to fight tomorrow.     
   It is absolutely essential that America, the last remaining superpower on Earth, continue to be a voice for peace and a beacon of freedom in our shrinking world. Walking away would further signal to Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, and others that the United States is no longer committed to a successful outcome in Iraq. 
   Before closing my remarks, I want to express my disappointment and dismay at yesterday's political and theatrical display by Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid. 
   The delivery of this conference report to the White House was intentionally delayed so the President's veto would coincide with the fourth anniversary of the President declaring ``Mission Accomplished.'' This display in sending the supplemental to the President was a deliberate and shameful attempt at scoring political points solely at the expense of our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, this veto has been anticipated for some time. The majority party has had ample time to plan and prepare for the next step. Passing a clean supplemental free of arbitrary deadlines and excessive spending is obviously the path we should be following. 
   There is $20 billion, $20 billion, in this package unrelated to the war effort and the gulf coast recovery. That money is designated as emergency spending. Every nickel of this unrelated spending should be removed from the emergency supplemental. All this spending should be debated in regular order through the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process. 
   In closing, I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: You've made your point. You've had your dog-and-pony show. You have posed for political holy pictures on TV. Now what is your plan to support the troops? 
   It is time to put the posturing and political stunts aside and do what is in the best interest of our troops. It is time to do the right thing and pass a clean emergency supplemental free of arbitrary deadlines and arbitrary spending. It is time to support our Commander in Chief and sustain the President's veto. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to do something that I have never done before, and that is to oppose House passage of an appropriations bill. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle, and I use the term ``friends'' sincerely, have produced an 8-month omnibus spending bill that appropriates $463.5 billion. It is legislation that few have seen, which cannot be amended in any way, and that will pass this House after only 1 hour of debate. It is the first omnibus spending bill that I have seen during my time in Congress written and considered without the input of the chairman or ranking members of any appropriations subcommittee, without the input of any Republican or Democratic subcommittee members, without the benefit of a full Appropriations Committee markup, without the standard three days for circulating the bill to committee members before markup, without the standard 3 days for circulating the bill to all House Members after full committee consideration, without any prior debate whatsoever, and without the opportunity to offer even one amendment on the House floor. 
   I do not fault my friend, Mr. Obey, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for he is doing what he is asked to be done by his leadership. He is in the position today because of the former Senate majority leader's complete failure to schedule and pass the fiscal year 2007 appropriations bills. The House and the Senate Appropriations Committee did their work last year, and Mr. Obey and I worked very closely in attempting to see it was fully completed. The Senate leadership did not. 
   As the former chairman of the committee, I know that Mr. Obey feels strongly about maintaining regular order and passing other appropriations bills. I can vividly recall a conversation Mr. Obey had with me shortly after I became chairman when he suggested that perhaps I would be the last chairman of the Appropriations Committee because of the breakdown of regular order. 
   I looked to his comments and have taken them to heart because I committed to him and to our Members that we would pass our spending bills in regular order, and the 2 years I served as chairman we did. 
   Today, my fear is that Mr. Obey may be the last chairman of the Appropriations Committee because of the very concern he expressed to me, the breakdown of that regular order. Shutting both Republicans and Democrats out of the legislative process is a highly, highly unusual circumstance, but that is exactly what has occurred. 
   Both Republicans and Democrats are being denied a full and open debate on this legislation that will spend, as I suggested earlier, $463.5 billion, roughly one-half of the annual Federal budget. 
   Speaker Pelosi and Leader HOYER, both former members of the Appropriations Committee, know that our process is very open and a collaborative one. Historically, appropriations bills are brought to the floor under an open rule to encourage debate and create better legislation. Our spending bills reflect not just the will of the Appropriations Committee but, indeed, the will of the entire bipartisan House. It is not uncommon to have hours and hours of debate and more than 100 Democrat or Republican amendments offered on a single spending bill. That is, until today. 
   The House will debate this legislation today for 1 hour. Not one amendment has been made in order. The Senate, that is, the other body, on the other hand, will have the opportunity to debate the legislation for up to 15 days and with the potential for an unlimited number of amendments.     
   Let me repeat, it is important that the Members hear that. One hour of debate in the House with no amendments, 15 days of debate in the Senate with potentially unlimited amendments. 
   Speaker Pelosi has vowed to run the House in a more open, democratic and inclusive way. A spirit of bipartisanship, she said, would prevail in the people's House. That pledge was put on the shelf so the new majority could complete their first 100 hours agenda. 
   The new majority then promised that business would soon return to regular order with plenty of opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to participate in the democratic process. Members of the House, Democrats and Republicans, are still waiting for the Speaker to keep her word. 
   In closing, I would suggest that our country would be better served by extending for a full year the clean continuing resolution the House and Senate passed in December. That legislation, a mere 19 pages long, contained no gimmicks, no policy changes, and did not reward or punish agencies indiscriminately, as is done in this 137-page package. 
   This omnibus spending bill before us today totally disregards the once proud tradition of regular order within the House Appropriations Committee and violates the longstanding bipartisan customs of the people's House. I urge that my colleagues join me in a ``no'' vote. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, somewhat responding to the majority leader's comment, I can't help but be moved to say that he suggested directly that Mr. Obey had spent a good deal of time with the gentleman from the Senate, Mr. Byrd, the two Members involved in this bill, and beyond that, a good deal of contact with our staff. Beyond those two Members, let me say that this has been a very fine product. It is a staff, nonelected staffperson's piece of work that involves $463.5 billion of appropriations. 
   I must say that it is important for me that the body know that I am committed to reducing the rate of growth of spending. $463.5 billion is a pretty significant rate of growth.     
   But in the meantime, as we go about reducing spending growth, I will also work in a bipartisan spirit to move our bill through the committee and on time and under budget. 
   I will not, however, respond to either intimidation or any threats relative to the way we are handling the appropriations process. The Appropriations Committee will not become a small colony in the empire of this new leadership. 
   We renew our commitment to bills produced by regular order that will serve as a credit to our committee, to the national interest, as well as to the people from our districts we pretend to serve. 
   With that, the leader and I will work further together on this matter, but I am very concerned about the volume of staff direction here where in the final analysis the people know that they are not elected representatives of the House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us is intended to eliminate earmarks to fund a variety of important Federal programs. In spite of those best intentions, however, a close reading of the bill revealed that earmarks were, in fact, left in. 
   Additionally, a number of critical programs affecting new law enforcement, military construction and military families have been shortchanged. In an effort to live up to the spirit of what this bill intended, my motion to recommit would eliminate nearly $600 million in earmarks, other unnecessary spending, and also use those funds to fully fund the Drug Enforcement Administration's effort to combat methamphetamines and other illicit drugs, restore critically needed funds to military construction and military family housing accounts, and reduce the Federal deficit. 
   Specifically, this motion would accomplish the following: 
   First, rescind the remaining $44.6 million from the Senate's rain forest in Iowa earmark, eliminate $94 million unnecessary and unrequested funding for the Denali Commission, funding that is nothing more than a thinly-disguised Senate earmark for Alaska. Eliminate $400 million of ongoing earmarks from the NNSA weapons activity accounts. Eliminate $49.7 million of spending in DOE's fossil energy account, spending that duplicates mandatory funding by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   My motion would distribute these savings in the following manner: 
   First, $50 million for the DEA's efforts to combat meth and other illicit drugs; $275 million for basic allowance for housing; $86 million for critically needed military construction and family housing; $178 million for deficit reduction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, to live up to the spirit of this legislation by voting to eliminate earmarks and put those funds to better use by combating meth, supporting our military families and reducing the deficit. 
   I urge a strong bipartisan vote on this motion to recommit. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield whatever time may remain to Mr. Pearce of New Mexico.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. I very much appreciate my colleague's yielding. It is really a most interesting commentary, your presentation, which summarizes in this rule what appears to be the dominant leadership of the liberal Democratic leadership in the House. That is, in the quest of power, the ends justify the means. Indeed, at this point in our history when the people's House finds itself dominated by leadership who will exercise the ends justifying the means to maintain power, indeed the public ought to be most concerned about their people's House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I in turn, though, want to congratulate, myself, both Chairman Edwards and Mr. Wamp for producing a truly bipartisan fiscal year 2009 Military Construction appropriations bill in the longstanding tradition of this committee. Their work is a demonstration to the House that the Democrats and Republicans can work together to create legislation the majority of our Members can support. 
   As we all know, the Appropriations Committee has steered off course this year because of one single issue which is critical to the American public and which has significant bipartisan support in the House. I do not fault my friend Chairman Obey for the breakdown of the appropriations process this year. While we have had our share of disagreements over the years on overall funding levels and policy issues, he and I have historically worked well together to move our spending bills through the House in a timely fashion. 
   However, this year the largely bipartisan work of the Appropriations Committee has ground to a virtually standstill because of the energy issue. For reasons I do not fully understand, given present pressures on our economy and the increased worldwide demand for oil, the majority leadership has decided to put on the shelf most of the annual spending bills as well as any and all meaningful bipartisan efforts to lower the price of oil and gas. I don't understand this decision nor do I agree with it. We have had an opportunity and we have an obligation to work on a bipartisan basis to develop and pass long-term energy solutions that involve a combination of conservation, alternative and renewable energy sources, and the development of proven resources both onshore and offshore in the United States. 
   This effort to bolster our energy resources would create thousands of well-paying union and nonunion jobs across the United States. The overwhelming majority of Americans favor increased domestic energy production. So what is the downside if we develop energy resources in a responsible, environmentally safe manner? Why is the Democratic leadership standing in the way? 
   Just yesterday a dedicated group of Members, led by our colleagues John Peterson and Neil Abercrombie, introduced sweeping bipartisan energy legislation in an attempt to break the current energy gridlock in the House. I applaud their efforts. We ought to debate their bill openly in the Appropriations Committee and on the House floor before we leave this town for an August break. 
   The mere message that Congress was actually debating energy policy, in meaningful, bipartisan debate, would send a signal to the markets and to the foreign suppliers of oil that the United States is serious about addressing its energy future. That powerful message would send oil prices down almost overnight. I believe that an honest energy debate on the floor of the House would be, in itself, a stimulus package that would have a tremendously positive ripple effect throughout our economy, touching every American business and consumer. 
   Let me respectfully remind my colleagues that it was our Speaker, then the minority leader, in 2006 who outlined the new Democrat majority's governing philosophy, and I quote: ``Bills should come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate. Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee markups.'' Mr. Speaker, that's important enough. Let me repeat. The Speaker: ``Bills should come to the floor under a procedure that allows open, full, and fair debate. Bills should be developed following full hearings and open subcommittee markups.'' 
   As the body knows, we have not had an open, full, and fair debate on energy policy in committee nor have we had any open amendment process on the House floor. In fact, the House Appropriations Committee has not moved any bills through the full committee since June 25 because of a pending energy production amendment supported by a bipartisan majority of the committee members but opposed by the majority leadership. 
   I would remind our colleagues that most of the challenges facing us today have little or nothing to do with partisan politics. At a time when our country is facing daunting challenges at home and abroad, my constituents and your constituents are looking for real leadership. Rather than providing the leadership our constituents deserve, the body is now in a state of paralysis. 
   Again, I remind my colleagues that it was then a minority leader, the gentlewoman from San Francisco, who wrote in an October 20, 2007, letter to Speaker Hastert: ``The voice of every American has a right to be heard. No Member of Congress should be silenced on this floor.'' 
   I encourage each of my colleagues to remind the Speaker of these words so we can return to regular order in our committee work and restore civility and open debate to the legislative process in the House. It is time to set aside partisan politics and get to work. We can do better. We must do better. Let's support our veterans funding bill today and then move quickly to support our constituents by openly debating potentially energy solutions. 
   Again, the House should not leave town for the August recess until it votes to lower gas prices, increase the supply of American-made energy, and promote energy independence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to Mr. Obey for recognizing the fabulous work of Frank Cushing. We expect we'll do more of this as we go forward in the several days ahead of us, but in the meantime, his thoughtfulness is very much appreciated by all of us on this side who have worked so closely with Frank on the appropriations process. 
   It's not my intention to speak extensively on this matter. There are some things that do need to be said. But, nonetheless, all of us know in 7 days it will be Christmas Eve. Tonight I find myself more hopeful than just a few days ago that we will be home, if we choose, by Christmas. 
   Tonight the House is considering a massive year-end omnibus spending package. I must confess that while I  know the broad parameters of what's included in this package, the details are still not widely known. I'm told that it adheres to the President's top line on spending, which is encouraging and, obviously, a step in the right direction. 
   I am pleased that, though, through the weekend negotiations Chairman Obey and other leaders have agreed to drop provisions that would have triggered a Presidential veto. Still, I'm troubled by the fact that these two amendments before us fail to provide any funding to our men and women in uniform in Iraq; yet I remain hopeful that this oversight will soon be addressed by the other body. 
   It's unfortunate that we find ourselves considering an omnibus package at all for it represents to, I think, both the chairman and myself a breakdown of regular order. I do not blame Chairman Obey for this breakdown. 
   This year the House passed each of the spending bills in an orderly fashion. And while I believe that these bills spent too much money, the House Appropriations Committee kept its word by completing its work. The breakdown of regular order, particularly in the other body, is largely to blame, once again, on our failure to complete our work on time in the regular order of the year. 
   Our Congress, our country are best served when we move our individual bills through the legislative process. It is the only way that we can provide adequate oversight, both policy and spending, that is. That challenge was particularly acute this year with a Democratic majority writing and passing spending bills that initially exceeded the President's budget by some $23 billion. The President has been very clear all year long that he would veto any spending bill that exceeded his budget request. All told, the House spending bills, as passed last summer, dramatically exceeded the President's budget request, and yet, for months, the Democratic majority chose to dismiss or ignore the President's clear intent. 
   We are now 78 days into the new fiscal year, and it appears that after months of work by our exhausted committee staff, we are on the verge of having a spending package the President may be able to sign. I say may be able to sign because this package, lacking adequate funding for our troops, is still incomplete. For this reason, I'm not able to endorse legislation as presently written. I cannot and will not support a spending package that fails to provide for the needs of our troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. Where the House has failed to act, I'm hopeful that the Senate will demonstrate its leadership. It is absolutely essential that the Senate support our troops with no strings attached. 
   Before closing, Mr. Speaker, let me take a moment to express my appreciation to all of our staff. As David has expressed, the fabulous work by Frank Cushing, he's been supported on our side, as David has on his side, by very hardworking, very fine people who have been working day in, day out, night and day over the weekends. They have prepared this legislation as best their side would allow them, and our side as well. Many of our staff have not yet put a Christmas tree up and even begun to prepare for the holidays because of the work of the committee. Let me say to each of you, I thank you, thank you for your fine work. All of our professional staff has worked together as a team on both sides. 
   Again, I remain hopeful that the Senate will amend this spending package and quickly return it for our consideration. Until then, I must reluctantly urge my colleagues, I'd include in that even committee members on both sides of the aisle, I encourage our colleagues to oppose this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. I appreciate very much my colleague yielding me this time. Very much I appreciate their making this effort to recognize and remember those people who lost their lives on 9/11 6 years ago. 
   I couldn't help, as I listened to the discussion today, to remember ironically that the Defense Subcommittee of Appropriations was meeting, with full membership from both sides of the aisle, just downstairs from the Chamber. 
   At the time the plane crashed in Pennsylvania in that open lot, with us was John Murtha of Pennsylvania. It was in his district where that plane crashed. The irony, as many know but I cannot help to mention it, that John Murtha is the chairman of the subcommittee at this very moment. At the time, we together recognized that the most important work of the Appropriations Committee perhaps takes place in that committee room, the Defense Subcommittee room. 
   And in this circumstance, when that plane crashed, which indeed likely was headed for the Capitol, that's the best speculation, if the Pennsylvania crash had hit the Capitol, we might very well have lost that entire committee. There are ironies in all of this. 
   As we remember those who lost their lives, let us remember the threat of terror to our very way of life is taking place around the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, we know that this conference report before us will be vetoed by the President because of the Iraqi withdrawal language and the many unrelated and costly spending items that have absolutely nothing to do with the global war on terror or recovery efforts in the gulf coast. 
   It is no secret that many Members of the House and Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, have strong reservations about the manner in which this legislation undermines the authority of the President, our Commander in Chief. Members are also rightly concerned about how this legislation places military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than the military commanders in the field. 
   As I have said many times before, this legislation ought to focus on our troops. It ought to focus on providing those in harm's way with the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. It ought to respect, not micromanage, our combatant commanders in whom we place the ultimate responsibility for prosecuting military actions. 
   My colleagues know that I have great respect for my friend, Mr. Murtha, but I strongly disagree with his assertion that we ought to have 535 Members and Senators micromanaging the war in Iraq. With all due respect, that is not our job. 
   Let me again remind my colleagues, we are not generals, we are not the Secretary of State, and we most certainly are not the Commander in Chief. It is tragically ironic that the House is considering this conference report the same day that General David Petraeus met with Members in closed session on the current situation in Iraq. 
   It was on January 26 of this year, just 3 months ago, that the Senate voted 81-0 to confirm General Petraeus to be the top military commander in Iraq. One would have thought that Members and Senators would trust his judgment following such an extraordinary vote of confidence over 3 months ago. Senator Reid, who supported the General's confirmation, now says, and I quote, ``I don't believe him.'' 
   Recent history reminds us that the enemy we face in Iraq, in Afghanistan and other countries that harbor terrorists will stop at nothing to seek opportunities to attack the United States and our allies. Have we not learned anything from the original World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the Khobar Towers bombing, the attack on USS Cole or 9/11 itself? 
   Al Qaeda will view this legislation as the first sign of the United States backing down from its commitment to the war on terror. It will view the withdrawal provisions contained in this conference report as America signaling retreat and surrender. Indeed, al Qaeda will view this as a day that the House of Representatives threw in the towel, waved the white flag and signaled retreat and surrender in Iraq. 
   Our failure to learn the lessons of history, our failure to lead today, will result in devastating consequences, including an even greater loss of lives, and even more resources needed to fight tomorrow. Just as we have only one top General in Iraq, one Secretary of State and one Commander in Chief, we only have one Speaker of the House at a time. 
   Speaker Pelosi and I have been friends and have served as colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for many years. The Speaker played an important role in supporting the development of unmanned aerial vehicles, a critical and successful military capability that is a key element to the war on terror. She and I worked on that in the Intelligence Committee together years ago. It is puzzling to me that the Speaker would not only openly question the judgment of General Petraeus, Secretary Rice, and our Commander in Chief, but that she would also willingly work to undermine their efforts to secure a successful outcome in Iraq. 
   My colleagues, it is absolutely essential that America, the last remaining superpower on Earth, continue to be the voice for peace and freedom in our shrinking world. Our success is critical. Walking away will further signal to Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and others that the United States is no longer committed to a successful outcome in Iraq. 
   In closing, I ask Speaker Pelosi and my friends in the majority to weigh the implications of supporting this conference report. Even as I hold hope that the Speaker might have a road-to-Damascus conversion, I ask her to weigh the enormous consequences of putting our troops in peril. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this emergency supplemental. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we've heard from a number of sources in the last hour or so that this is the 500th day since the President sent this request for absolutely crucial funding for our troops who are fighting in the Middle East. It's been heard enough that I don't think we need to dwell upon that a lot.  
   Mr. Speaker, today is the 500th day since the President's fiscal year 2008 emergency supplemental request first arrived on the Hill. Oft times we make the mistake of assuming that we're doing the Lord's work in this body. But I remind my colleagues that the Good Lord created Heaven, Earth--and far more--and it took Him 493 fewer days to get it done. 
   It's no secret that I've had misgivings about the manner in which the majority leadership developed and moved earlier versions of the supplemental, without consideration by the Committee on Appropriations and under a closed rule. 
   While the regular order process was never followed, today I'm happy to report that the House has worked in a bipartisan fashion--and come to an agreement--on a funding package that will provide immediate support to our troops in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   This supplemental is long overdue and comes at a time when the Pentagon has already issued guidance to employees on potential furloughs. Clearly, our agreement on this legislation comes not a moment too soon. 
   A whole array of legislative provisions had been a part of the earlier version of the supplemental, including a massive tax increase on American small businesses. While several legislative provisions remain, the tax increase as been removed. 
   This is now a better package, one that provides an educational benefit for our returning troops and their families without placing an additional tax burden on small business--the economic engine that drives our national economy. 
   This package also includes unemployment insurance language that provides far more accountability than earlier versions considered by the House. The new provision includes an additional 13 weeks of coverage but requires that recipients work for 20 weeks in order to qualify for the benefit. From this Member's perspective, I believe this provision has been dramatically improved because it now requires that the recipient earn the benefit.  
   I'd like to make one additional observation as I close my remarks. Our friends and neighbors in the Midwest need to know this: Congress is prepared to help you get back on your feet as you respond to the great floods affecting your region. This legislation provides needed, targeted funding to address the many challenges you are now facing. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a package that should receive the bipartisan support of the majority of our Members today. It is a package the President will sign. I urge its immediate passage.  
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield to the gentleman who played the key role in bringing that conference that we had together yesterday together in a fashion that caused us to be able to be here this evening. 
   I would recognize the Republican leader, John Boehner, for such time as he might consume.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. I thank my colleague from Florida. 
   Mr. Speaker, I have only one good thing to say about the Democrat majority's budget resolution. Unlike the only other budget-related legislation considered by the House this year, at least this resolution, the budget resolution, follows regular order, not like the Appropriations Committee process this year.     
   Having looked at this budget in some detail, my advice to working families is simple: Hold on to your wallet. For the first time in history, the proposed discretionary budget will exceed $1 trillion. Think about that. $1 trillion. This bloated budget blueprint is a clear demonstration that the Democrat majority in Congress is keenly focused on dipping into your pockets to take more and more of your hard-earned money. 
   This budget shows that the Democrat majority will raise taxes without hesitation to support its addiction to spending. And it shows that Democrats in Congress are not interested in making difficult choices, setting priorities or rooting out waste in government spending. While our constituents struggle to keep up with their budgets, to fill their automobiles with gasoline, to buy groceries, for example, Democrats want to spend and tax to continue their dance in the majority.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the last time that Chairman Obey and I were on the floor together, I was heard to quote our friend, Will Rogers, and it had to do about sometimes we talk more than we should. I was intrigued by the fact that while he advised us to never miss the opportunity to shut up, that recently in Latin America there's discussion among Latin leaders in which a fellow by the name of Chavez kept talking and talking and talking, and this is by way of suggesting that we don't really have to keep talking today. I think it was the King of Spain, David, who said, ``Por que no te calles?'' If I could repeat that, ``Por que no te calles?'' That is, if we don't talk too much, we'll be all right here today. 
   Mr. Speaker, it is kind of hard to believe that Christmas is less than 2 weeks away and that David Obey provides me with material for my own presentation one more time. 
   While most Americans are Christmas shopping and decorating their Christmas tree, Congress continues to stumble its way to completing its business for the year. Unfortunately, we still have a long way to go, so we find ourselves today considering yet another continuing resolution. 
   It was just 1 year ago the House passed a series of continuing resolutions to ensure the continuation of government funding programs into the new fiscal year. My friend Chairman David Obey came to the House floor as the ranking member during that debate to criticize Republicans in the House and Senate for their failure to pass the annual spending bills by the end of the fiscal year. He spoke of the breakdown in the budget process and vowed that things would be different under a Democratic majority. 
   We are now only, I say, 74 days in the new fiscal year, and once again the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee is on the floor decrying the breakdown of regular order. The only difference is that David Obey is now Chairman Obey, and I'm the committee's ranking member. 
   The breakdown of regular order, particularly in the Senate, is largely to blame for our failure to complete our work in a timely manner. Earlier this year, my chairman was absolutely beating us all over the room because of our failure to pass bills at the end of the year. 
   The Senate leader held up our bills. Mr. Obey knew that we'd passed all of our bills in the House by July 4. The year before we'd done the same thing, and all the bills had been signed by the President. And lo and behold, Mr. Obey finds himself. Frankly David, I thought you had much closer relationships with the Senate than I, but here we are. The breakdown of regular order, particularly in the Senate, is largely to blame for our failure to complete our work in a timely fashion. 
   The President has been very clear all year long that he would veto any spending bill or any omnibus package that exceeded his budget request. All told, the House-passed spending bills exceeded the President's budget request by $23 billion, and yet the Democrat majority chose to dismiss or ignore the President's clear intent, that is, until now. 
   A short time ago, Chairman Obey instructed the committee staff to prepare an omnibus spending bill and pare spending back to exceed the President's request by $11 billion. Not included in this total, there was over $7 billion being designated as emergency spending. 
   Just in the last several days, maybe even hours, the Democratic leadership finally got the message. They came to the realization that the President was, indeed, serious. So it all appears that, after months of work by our exhausted committee staff, work can finally begin on a spending package that the President may be able to sign. I say may be able to sign because the President has not yet seen the details of the omnibus package that will come forward. 
   For good measure, let me make very clear the President will veto any omnibus spending package that contains any controversial policy provisions, any gimmicks or any consequential budgetary sleight of hand. 
   I urge Chairman Obey to resist the urge on his part to add any so-called contingency spending anywhere in this package, as it may lead to a presidential veto. 
   I'd like to close by quoting my friend, Mr. Obey, from a past CR debate. He said, and I quote, ``We are here  today with not a single dollar having been appropriated to any government program that has anything whatsoever to do with the domestic operations of this government. That is a disgraceful performance. And so we are left with the choice of passing this continuing resolution or having the government shut down.'' 
   Again, my friends, these are the words of Chairman David Obey from last year, then Ranking Member Obey. They are particularly meaningful today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Thank you very much, Mr. King and Mr. Chairman. 
   Mr. Speaker, I might respond to the colleagues, this is the longest I have seen you, your presence on the floor in many a year, and your being in the podium. We will not let you get away as you would normally choose to do. 
   But having said that, Mr. Speaker, you know it is not my intention to speak on every authorizing bill that might come along. Indeed, we have enough work to do on our Appropriations Committee, enough to take up the time of our fine authorizers. But in the meantime, it is important for us to say early on, in these first 100 hours, that there are issues that will be brought to the floor that purport to reflect the interests of authorizers that have huge implications in so far as appropriations are concerned. So for this one time I would like to take just a moment to discuss a bit of that. 
   First, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I must mention that this bill is full of new programs, policy directives, performance directives, all kinds of authorizing suggestions, without any indication as to where the money might really be coming from. It is one thing to say that we want to establish a policy. It is another thing to say that we are going to pay as we go. It is an entirely different thing to say exactly where the money will come from. 
   It is very important for the Members to know that throughout this package that purports to deal with the 9/11 Commission, and those recommendations, that we have here to a very significant degree, within the authorizing process, a statement of policy that is little more than a press release. There really are no serious suggestions here as to how we go about solving the problems that are implied by the presentation of this legislation. 
   The tens of billions of dollars that would be required to implement this general statement of policy should not be ignored. It is not good enough to suggest that we are going to balance the budget and pay as we go. The first bill before us provides an authorizing base that does exactly the reverse. 
   We are not in this to confront the Appropriations Committee with authorizers, but indeed it is about time that we begin to lay the foundation for policy and appropriations work that actually reflects the will of the House as well as the appropriations process.     
   Mr. Speaker, I know that you agree with all of that because of your appropriations background.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this legislation before us today. This is a bill full of feel-good promises and sound bites but no realistic approach to becoming a reality. Let me provide just a few illustrations of my concern. 
   First, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I must mention that this bill is full of new programs, policy directives and performance directives authorized at ``such sums as necessary,'' the total of which is likely to reach into the tens of billions of dollars. It proposes carving out $250 million from passenger ticket security fees as a ``one-time deposit'' for research, development, and deployment of Explosive Detection System checkpoint technology. But, because there is no guarantee this amount can be covered by current collections, it will likely require a direct appropriation. In other words, it proposes a new cost, with no offset. 
   While some of these programs are worthwhile I am unsure how the new majority plans to actually fund them. This is a classic demonstration that the majority's pledge to offset any new increases in funding is, at this point, nothing more than an empty sound bite. 
   Absent new appropriations, there is little chance these programs, policy directives, and performance objectives will see the light of day. For example, this bill requires the inspection of 100 percent of the over 11 million U.S.-bound seaborne cargo containers within five years. While DHS currently inspects 100 percent of high-risk cargo, estimates to physically inspect 100 percent of sea-bound cargo, including those containers shipped by trusted  partners, run in the tens of billions of dollars not counting additional manpower and operational costs. Even the editorial section of this morning's Washington Post describes the majority's container security proposal as a ``waste of money'' with a ``marginal benefit'' and no ``realistic cost estimate''. 
   Additionally, estimates to physically inspect all cargo on passenger planes for a single year exceed $500 million and may require up to an additional 8,000 screeners at a cost of $400 million per year. And on top of these annual costs, there is an upfront investment of over a billion dollars for equipment installation and facility modifications. Still, this legislation casually calls for 100 percent inspection by the end of Fiscal Year 2009. 
   Mr. Speaker, throwing money at a problem is not the solution. In fact, since 9/11, Congress has made steady and substantial, yet realistic, progress in many of these areas. In Fiscal Year 2005, we called for the tripling of the percentage of cargo screened on passenger aircraft, required quarterly updates on meeting this goal, and directed the development of standards and technology to reduce manpower requirements. 
   We continue to target all high-risk cargo inbound for the United States. We also support expansion of our Container Security Initiative, which will place actual Customs and Border Protection employees at 58 of the world's largest ports, covering approximately 85 percent of the U.S.-bound shipping containers by the end of this fiscal year. Last year, the 109th Congress passed the SAFE Port Act, which, among other things, created pilot programs, each designed to test the possibility and viability of achieving 100 percent screening overseas. Through the Secure Freight Initiative, the Administration has set up 9 of these pilot programs. 
   While we appreciate the new majority's attempt, this bill is little more than a press release full of unfunded mandates that has little chance of becoming law. Real reform begins with committee and subcommittee hearings and mark-ups, and ends with a negotiated product that contains substantive yet realistic reform. This bill fails that, and many other, tests.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be with you. On this occasion, we are addressing one more time a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission. I must say that while it is very important that we get the House to seriously review those matters and see what next steps we should be taking, I feel pretty strongly that it is important that the two sides of the aisle work very closely together regarding this. This resolution would create a new panel of the Appropriations Committee that would, in part, duplicate work already performed by the Intelligence Committee. 
   Unfortunately, this substantive change in committee jurisdiction is being proposed without benefit of the kind of bipartisan input that I personally appreciate and think causes the place to work an awful lot better. The present structure in intelligence oversight was developed following the recommendations of the Pike and Church committees in the 1970s. It took years to develop and execute a quality congressional restructure for intelligence oversight. 
   Something of this importance and sensitivity requires more than just an hour's consideration on the floor. It deserves a thorough review by the committees of the House and all of us who are concerned, from various jurisdictions, about these matters. 
   I recognize that this is an oversight bill; and with tongue in cheek, I congratulate the new majority for that kind of oversight, drafting legislation without any input from the Republicans of the House. 
   While I am grateful to Mr. Obey for his efforts to reach out to me personally, I am deeply concerned that no substantive consultation occurred between the majority and the minority, particularly at a leadership level. 
   Further, I am very concerned that we not jettison the oversight regime that is in place without knowing for certain that we are going to replace it with something that goes beyond just simply getting in the way of the oversight process. I am afraid that what we are doing here is talking about oversight. Instead, on the other hand, we are defusing effective oversight. 
   It is important that we recognize that one more time we are putting out press releases and producing very little in terms of substantive results. 
   Madam Speaker, as I said, it is a delight to be with you, and I appreciate the time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - November 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, I had planned to make a 10-minute, maybe even a 20-minute speech this evening expressing my concerns about the Labor-HHS conference report. However, given the late hour and Members' desire to join their families for the Thanksgiving Day holiday, I will submit my written statement for the Record. 
   As I do so, Madam Speaker, I am reminded of the words of my friend Will Rogers, whose statue stands outside the door of this very Chamber. He said, ``Never miss a good chance to shut up.'' 
   With that, I urge a vote to sustain the President's veto, and I yield back the balance of my time.  
   Madam Speaker, here we are on November 15th and only two appropriations bills have been sent to the President--only one of which was enacted. I must confess that I find it quite ironic that the majority party spent the better part of the beginning of this year criticizing Republicans for not getting our work done in a  timely fashion when now those same critics find themselves in an identical, or perhaps even worse, situation. 
   For those of us who serve on the Appropriations Committee, this will be the sixth time we have voted on this bill this year. Six times! It is the fourth time the full House will have voted on it. 
   The fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies bill reflects a fundamental difference in opinion on the level of funding necessary to support the Federal government's role in education, health, and workforce programs. Regardless of that disagreement, House Republicans agree that many of the programs funded in this bill are vitally important. The majority party would have the public believe otherwise. 
   The recent rhetoric we have heard with respect to the president's veto of this bill diminishes all that we do as elected officials, and it does not serve this Congress or our country well. It is targeted at raw, base emotions rather than fact. It is intended to 
   mislead the American people. It is, in short, intended for political gain. 
   The primary difference between the parties on this bill is that Republicans believe we must balance the benefits of these worthwhile programs with the fact that the American taxpayer must pay for them. 
   The vetoed bill that we are being asked to consider today is nearly $10 billion over the President's budget request and $6 billion over the fiscal year 2007 enacted level. It represents roughly half of the $22 billion the majority party in this Congress wants to spend over what the president requested. 
   When Labor-HHS Chairman Neil Smith--a Democrat--presented his bill in 1994, it totaled $65 billion. If you had predicted in 1994 that the very same bill--which largely covers the same agencies today as it did then--would increase by $85 billion over the next 13 years, the Chairman of the full Committee--who happened to be David Obey--probably would not have believed it. 
   Let's put that into perspective. In 1994 the Defense bill spent $242 billion. The Defense bill signed just this week spends $459 billion. That is an 89 percent increase over thirteen years for a function that is quite clearly and constitutionally the primary responsibility of the Federal Government--defending our home, our citizens and our way of life against foreign threats. This bill contains a 130 percent increase since 1994--it has more than doubled in size! 
   By any objective standard--whether you are Jerry Lewis or David Obey--that is a healthy increase. 
   And today, the House is being asked to override the president's veto and spend nearly $10 billion more than was requested and $6 billion more than last year under the mistaken notion that throwing money at our nation's problems will cause them to fade away. 
   Under the mistaken notion that the Federal Government is the panacea-- 
   That government health insurance is the answer for the uninsured; 
   That the judgment of bureaucrats in Washington who contribute only 9 cents of every dollar spent to educate our children is superior to the judgment of parents and local school districts who face very different circumstances across our country; 
   That job training is somehow the responsibility of the Federal Government rather than of schools, private employers and individuals. 
   I contend that government is not the long-term solution. While government offers safety net programs that I support, these programs are and should be short-term solutions to help our fellow citizens move toward self-sufficiency. These programs are meant to be a hand up, not a hand out. 
   As we move forward with consideration of these FY 2008 appropriations bills, Members of Congress ought to be aware that voting to override the president's vetoes on this and other appropriations bills--in short, voting to support this majority's spending spree--will increase the average annual burden on the individual taxpayer by roughly $3,000. 
   That is $3,000 that cannot be used to buy food, to save for college, to pay for health insurance, or, for that matter, to contribute to public television. 
   Finally, I must express my dismay at remarks made by the chairman of the committee with respect to the fate of member projects if this veto is sustained. I would hope that my colleagues do not take the bait on what I consider an inappropriate threat that suggests that members care more about pork than they do about bad fiscal policy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, in the last several days we have said all that we perhaps need to say about the omnibus. We have discussed every inch of it. We all know about the amendment on the Senate side. And, because of that, I am going to give up my 20-minute speech. 
   I would like to take just a moment nonetheless to ask the Members to join me in paying a very special tribute to one of the most beloved and respected staffers on Capitol Hill. 
   After 3 years as my staff director, Frank Cushing is leaving the committee at the end of the year to pursue other opportunities. With more than 25 years of Capitol Hill experience, Frank leaves behind a record of integrity and service that few can match. 
   I got to know Frank in 1995 when he served as my clerk on the House VA-HUD subcommittee of appropriations, a position he held until 2003. In very little time, I saw that Frank was one of those rare staffers who not only loves and respects this institution, but he in turn is respected and trusted by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   Prior to his service in the House, Frank held numerous positions in the Senate, including staff director, both majority and minority, of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and clerk of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. More than one professional on both sides of the aisle have said to me, and I would quote them, ``You are fortunate if you have been trained in this business by Frank Cushing.'' 
   Frank, we are going to miss you. We want you to know that, as we express our love for you and for Amy, the entire body wishes you well and wishes your family Godspeed. Thanks, Frank.  
   Mr. Speaker, we are now just 6 days away from the Christmas holidays. I know the Members and staff are eager to get home to their families so I intend to be very brief in my remarks today. 
   The House is considering a yearend omnibus spending package that, I must confess, is a much better product than what we considered Monday evening. I reluctantly opposed  both amendments passed by the House 2 days ago because they failed to provide for our troops in harm's way in Iraq. Fortunately, the Senate has now addressed this oversight. The Omnibus returns to the House a much better and complete bill. 
   Because this spending package adheres to the President's top line on spending, and it contains funding for our men and women in uniform in both Iraq and Afghanistan, I intend to support this legislation. And, I'm pleased to say that all indications are that the President will sign it. 
   Before concluding my remarks, I want to thank Chairman Obey and the fine committee staff for their tireless efforts this year. Few people realize the tremendous amount of work that goes into the appropriations process each year. 
   The Appropriations Committee is the workhorse committee. Chairman OBEY and our staff have worked very long hours to produce this legislation, and they deserve our gratitude. David, it is time for you to go home to Wisconsin and for me to go to California for a few weeks. It's time to let the staff catch up on some long overdue family time for the holidays.  
   Mr. Speaker, I am going to take almost no more time except to recognize a couple of my colleagues for unanimous-consent requests. 
   I first recognize the gentleman from Florida, my chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Bill Young.

Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I find this conversation to be very interesting, and I noted that there is a tendency not to accept authorizing language in this instance because of a very specific problem, and because the authorizing committee has not acted. I, frankly, think there are a number of circumstances, including the next amendment that is even more significantly an authorizing problem that probably ought to be stricken as well. But if we are going to be consistent here, let's be consistent. And, indeed, I would be more than willing to join my colleague in communicating with the authorizing chairman in connection with this. But perhaps the time to draw a line is now and say we are not going to authorize in this bill and then see how they respond to us.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are few Members of Congress who have more open territory than I do in my district. There is enough space there to put four eastern States easily and have room left over. I have rural schools and problems that very much reflect the concerns that have been expressed here. 
   But at the same time, I must say to the chairman and to the House, I was sitting in my office observing the discussion early when the Doolittle amendment was up. I was about to come to the floor because the chairman of the full committee was beginning a discussion regarding who taxes too much or too little, and who spends too much and too little, and we will have that conversation as we go forward. But that is what caused me to want to come to the floor. 
   In the meantime, Mr. Doolittle had a very specific problem that was going to be taken care of, and it was objected to because it was legislating on an appropriations bill. Because of that, I am going to be pretty tough on this. The reason I reserved in this case, even though it affects my own district, it is my intention to ask that the amendment be stricken.

   I understand the point that the chairman is making, and I am very appreciative of it. 
   The bill, as you know, was slushed with an awful lot of money above and beyond what we anticipated. Before we got the last $3 billion we had a fine bill. It strikes me that as we were slushing, we might have put some money in this category if we were so concerned about it. 
   But in the meantime, there is little doubt that because of the need for consistency here, if we are going to be striking language in the fashion that I saw as I was sitting in my office, selectively, then it seems to me we ought to try to at least raise the flag of consistency, and it is my intention to do that here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   It was on February 5 that the President sent his emergency supplemental request to the Hill for our consideration. Today, Congress is poised to finally send the President a package that he can sign. 
   The days, weeks, and months that have passed since the supplemental request first arrived on the Hill have been long on politics and short on substance. The Speaker and the majority leadership have spent valuable time at our troops' expense taking symbolic votes for the purpose of placating the Out of Iraq Caucus. 
   No political party has a corner on virtue, but the Democrat majority's reluctance to act swiftly on funding our troops clearly calls into question its commitment to our men and women in uniform. 
   As a longtime Member of the Appropriations Committee, I cannot recall a time that legislation has come to the floor under the committee chairman's name that the committee chairman apparently plans to oppose, and yet that is exactly what is occurring today. 
   My colleague, Chairman Obey, has indicated that he, like most of his caucus, is going to oppose the piece of this emergency supplemental that supports our troops, and he is going to support the piece of this emergency supplemental that funds political pork. Perhaps my friend from Wisconsin would be more comfortable in replacing his name with mine as the chief sponsor of the troop-funding bill. 
   The funding package before us today contains $17 billion in unrequested Federal spending. While a small piece of this funding addresses legitimate needs, its designation as emergency spending serves only one purpose: to make headroom for even more Federal spending in the fiscal year 2008 appropriations process. 
   I urge my colleagues to consider this: In the last week, four appropriations subcommittees have marked up bills for the coming fiscal year. Already, these four bills are $9.1 billion above the President's budget request and provide $21.8 billion above the 2007 enacted level. The committee has yet to mark up another eight bills. By the time the committee completes its work, it will propose over $20 billion in new spending beyond the President's request for next year. Between the emergency supplemental and the fiscal year 2008 bills, the Democrat majority has proposed spending an additional $37 billion. 
   I am deeply dismayed that this legislation was written without any consultation whatsoever with the minority. The Speaker's public pronouncement of a desire to work across the party lines, to say the least, runs hollow once again. What makes this more astounding is that Speaker Pelosi, Majority HOYER and Mr. Clyburn, the distinguished majority whip, have been longtime members of the Appropriations Committee. They know that our committee process has historically been a bipartisan, or even, in its ideal form, a nonpartisan process. The majority party clearly made a decision early on not only to abandon our troops, but to abandon any semblance of bipartisanship in this process. That does not bode well for our remaining work this year. 
   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on the Obey amendment, providing critical funding to our troops, which I gather Mr. Obey is going to vote against, and strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the Obey amendment providing $17 billion in spending unrequested and unrelated, I would describe as pork, to hurricane relief or the global war on terror. I gather Mr. Obey is going to vote against supporting our troops in the first instance and for pork in the second. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of the time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I had not intended to speak on this matter, but the rhetoric has gotten my attention enough that I thought I should share with the American people as well as my colleagues my early experience in public affairs. 
   I will never forget running for a school board, and people were talking about the Federal Government's beginning to get involved in education. I remember saying to those people, let us be very, very careful about going to Uncle Sam to finance our schools when traditionally that is the highest of State responsibilities, and they cooperate with local districts to provide for our schools and control them. 
   Uncle Sam then gave only 10 cents on the dollar for education, and those who gave the 10 cents wanted to tell us more and more what to do in our local school districts.     
   All these years later, I must say it's like 50 years later, we continue to want to tell people what to do in their local schools, and we're now giving them 90 cents on the dollar. Those who are talking about free gifts for people who are providing for educational activities, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, eventually the folks who are sending their children for school, one way they will pay for that education, one way or another. For you could, in those days, I'm not sure what the figure is now, but in those days you could take every family that made $100,000 or more, and anything above that $100,000, tax it 100 percent, and you could run the government for 30 days. 
   The people are not stupid. They know, as you're playing games with them suggesting, oh, Uncle Sam has a free lunch here some way, the folks that you're talking to are having to pay the bills in the final analysis regardless, because all those rich people, you tax them 100 percent, and they will not run your government more than 30 or 60 days. And who pays for the rest of it? 
   Another point that is very important, in my view, the rhetoric that suggests that the Federal Government should do everything centers around the reality that the Federal Government has a responsibility to provide for the national defense, make an effort to provide security and freedom in the world, and then make sure our local government and our State governments are healthy. They are not healthy if you so discourage industry that they leave the country in order to be able to get their work done and produce the products that we need. Those rich oil companies that you're talking about, they're leaving the country. The light bulbs we were talking about earlier, they're all made in China. It's about time we recognize that Uncle Sam does not have every answer. 
   I'm going to vote ``no'' on this bill, in spite of what the gentleman from California said earlier. I have the privilege of being the ranking member on the committee, but I'm going to be voting ``no'' because it is about $2 billion over the President's budget request, and the agencies around know they don't need as much money as you folks want to spend on them. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Madam Speaker, the motion I have at the desk is a motion to recommit to recognize the fact that right now this country faces a crisis on its borders. 
   Illegal immigration not only affects those of us who represent States on the border, it is a pervasive problem across the country. The Homeland Security Appropriations bill that passed the House earlier this summer included significant increases for more Border Patrol agents and other border protection efforts.     
   The homeland security bill represents an important piece of our immigration enforcement system, but it does not fund all of it. It is this bill that funds prosecution and incarceration of the most violent criminal aliens, such as drug dealers, human traffickers and gang members. It is this bill that provides critical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies that are on the front lines of the immigration problem. 
   As we increase our border enforcement efforts in the Department of Homeland Security, we must make sure that the Department of Justice has the funds it needs to fully prosecute and incarcerate all of the criminal aliens arrested by the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In addition, until the Federal Government is able to secure its borders, we must provide our local governments with sufficient resources to reimburse them while they protect our communities. 
   Because my colleague from California, DAVID DREIER, former chairman of our Rules Committee, has been most involved in this issue and is on the point of our attempting to find a solution in California, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Dreier to round out this discussion.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are continuing our debate on the emergency supplemental with a discussion of a separate measure that includes billions of dollars of spending completely unrelated to the global war on terror or legitimate emergencies in the gulf coast region. 
   This is an extraordinary amount of unauthorized spending, spending that is not offset in any way, contained under the emergency designation. As the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, and the committee's former chairman, I believe the House must firmly hold the line and reject this unnecessary spending. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle can, and will, argue that some of this spending is justified. Members can correctly point out the need for additional funds to address wildfire suppression or agricultural assistance in various regions of the United States. However, I would urge that many of the needs addressed in this bill could, and they should, be addressed in regular order through the fiscal year 2008 funding bills. 
   Sadly, many items are being designated as emergencies for no other reason than to make more room for additional spending under the fiscal year 2008 caps, which, incidentally, we still do not have. 
   When the new majority assumed power earlier this year, it committed to restoring pay-as-you-go, the practice of offsetting spending increases with spending decreases. As I mentioned earlier, none of the proposed spending included in this package has been offset in any way. 
   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, our colleagues should be aware that the President has indicated that he will veto this legislation due to the excessive nonemergency spending it contains. I urge our colleagues to show spending restraint by opposing this package.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (PROVIDING FOR REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AND DEFENSE CONTRACTORS FROM IRAQ -- (House of Representatives - May 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, if today's actions by the House are any indication, it appears that the Out of Iraq Caucus within the Democratic majority is now running the legislative agenda of the Congress. 
   How else can one explain that the rule governing consideration of debate of funding of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan provides only two legislative options with regard to U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan? 
   The first, which we are now debating, is an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq. The second, which we will debate shortly, rations funding to our troops over a 60-day period. Both options are short-sighted, and they are also dangerous. 
   My colleagues, where did this bill come from? 
   I gather it was hastily written and introduced last night in an attempt to obtain votes for the Obey Iraq supplemental we will be considering a little later. 
   Indeed, the consideration of this withdrawal legislation is nothing more than an attempt by the Speaker and the majority leader to appease members of the Out of Iraq Caucus so they will support the second version offered by Chairman Obey. 
   Once again, the majority has brought legislation to the House floor under a closed rule without an opportunity for amendment or meaningful debate. Not only is this an abuse of the legislative process, it is an overt violation of the longstanding traditions of the House. The majority is making a mockery of the time-honored customs of this body. That, in and of itself, is shameful. It is the People's House and the people of our country who suffer when open debate is stifled in order to preordain a legislative outcome. 
   Fortunately, this legislation, which embraces surrender and defeat, will not pass today. Most Members of the House, both Republican and Democrats, have grave reservations about the manner in which this legislation undermines our troops and the authority of the President and the commander in chief. 
   Members on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern about the effects of an ill-conceived military withdrawal. And Members are rightfully concerned about any legislation that places military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than the military commanders in the field. 
   The last thing our country or our troops need is to have 535 Members of the House and Senators micromanaging the war in Iraq. Recent history reminds us that the enemy we face in Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries that harbor terrorists, will stop at nothing to attack the United States and our allies. They view the consideration of this measure and the Obey bill we will consider shortly, as a sign of weakness. 
   Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are watching us closely, hoping this lack of resolve will prevail. We must not let that happen. 
   My colleagues, now is not the time for the United States to back down from its commitment to the war on terror. Now is not the time for America to signal retreat and surrender. Indeed, now is not the time for the House of Representatives to throw in the towel, wave the white flag or signal retreat and surrender in Iraq. 
   How could this Congress walk away from our men and women in uniform? How could we walk away from them now? We must, we must support our troops. Our failure to learn the lessons of history, our failure to lead will result in devastating consequences, including an even greater loss of lives in the future. 
   It is absolutely essential that America, the last remaining superpower on earth, continue to be a voice for peace and a beacon for freedom in our shrinking world. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the McGovern/Out of Iraq Caucus bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, Will Rogers once said, ``If you find yourself in a hole, the first thing to do is to stop digging.'' 
   My colleagues, the majority now finds itself in a hole, and contrary to Will Rogers' advice, it continues to dig. Indeed, this ill conceived emergency supplemental is evidence of a majority party in complete disarray, unable to develop consensus on supporting American troops, and unwilling to work in a bipartisan manner with the minority and the President to develop a way forward. 
   This legislation rations funding to our troops over a 60-day period and dishonors the long-term sacrifice and service of our men and women in uniform. It is legislation that says to the troops, we support you conditionally today, but don't expect Congress to support you 2 months from now. 
   I ask my colleagues, is this the message Congress wants to send to our troops? 
   Is this the message we want to send to al Qaeda? 
   Is this the best a divided majority can do?  
   This legislation has caused me and others to question the majority's commitment to our troops. No political party has a corner on virtue, but the majority's reluctance to fully fund our troops clearly calls into question its commitment to our men and women in uniform. 
   It is no secret that Chairman Obey is a strong supporter of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a program that receives broad bipartisan support. In recent years, Mr. Obey has supported advanced appropriations for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. 
   Is it an accident that Chairman Obey, who advocates funding Kermit the Frog and Clifford the Big Red Dog 2 years at a time, now wants to fund our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan 2 months at a time? 
   What does that say about the majority's commitment to our troops during a time of war? 
   Why is the majority setting our troops up for failure? 
   Mr. Speaker, it is time that we take funding our troops seriously and move beyond the gamesmanship and the partisanship on display today. Supporting our men and women in uniform is not a joke or a game. It is among the most important responsibilities each of us has as elected officials. 
   I was hopeful when the Speaker emerged from the White House last week signaling her willingness to work with Republicans and the President to craft a troop funding bill worthy of bipartisan support. Instead, Speaker Pelosi has chosen confrontation over cooperation and has demonstrated unwillingness to compromise. 
   Chairman Obey and his leadership have dramatically rewritten the Iraqi supplemental bill without any input from the minority, and unfortunately, the result will be the same as the last supplemental. 
   One more time it appears that the majority is more interested in appeasing the left than supporting our troops. One more time the House is being asked to consider a bill that is going nowhere fast. Even the Senate is opposed to this piecemeal approach to funding our troops. One more time, the House is preparing to approve a supplemental that the President will veto. 
   Today I am left scratching my head trying to determine which bill is worse, the one before us now or the one vetoed by the President last week. 
   Frankly, I believe the bill before us today is considerably worse than the measure vetoed last week. I will take a moment or two to explain why I think that. Under this proposal, the President is required to report by July 13 on the specific progress the Iraqi government has made in meeting 16 specific goals. 
   Once this report is received, only the chairman, only the chairman of the Appropriations Committee can introduce a joint resolution to release the funds. He is not required to introduce the joint resolution, and no other Member can do it. 
   Secondly, in an almost unprecedented move, this supplemental includes the rule under which the joint resolution will be brought to the floor. And under this rule, the only amendment made in order is the one that mandates the withdrawal of troops from Iraq within 6 months. 
   Further, this legislation includes a new reporting requirement that the President provide a detailed monthly accounting of the combat readiness status of Iraqi forces. The supplemental dictates that this report be made publicly available at the Department of Defense's Web site with a link to the detailed data. As a result, we will provide, not only to the public but also our enemies, the detailed readiness report and potential vulnerability of Iraqi security forces. We do not release this kind of information to our own troops. In fact, we keep it classified. Why would we ever mandate that the United States provide al Qaeda a blueprint for targeting Iraqi vulnerabilities? 
   Lastly, this supplemental includes a number of questionable legislative provisions otherwise known as earmarks, including a land transfer in Pennsylvania and a flood control earmark in New York. 
   Before closing, I want to express my profound disappointment over these emergency supplemental appropriations bills coming to the floor again under a closed rule. This is yet another violation of the longstanding tradition of the committee and the House. 
   Mr. Obey's first two bills as chairman, the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution and the first Iraqi supplemental, were both considered under a closed rule. These will be the third and fourth appropriations bills under Mr. Obey's chairmanship brought to the floor with a closed rule. It is pretty obvious we do not have very much input from the general membership regarding these bills when they are on the floor. 
   I have spoken with Chairman Obey about this concern, and expressed my belief that these bills, and all other committee bills, should be considered in regular order under an open rule. I say these supplemental bills, because my friend, Chairman Obey, and his leadership have decided to split the ag, disaster, wild fire, rural schools and salmon relief funding into another bill that will be considered either later this evening or maybe even tomorrow. 
   Following consideration of both bills, the majority is apparently planning to wave a magic wand in a feat that would make even Houdini proud to merge them into one single package as it heads over to the other body. 
   Albert Einstein was correct when he said, and I quote, ``You cannot simultaneously prevent and prepare for war.'' 
   The bottom line is this, the majority cannot have it both ways. The majority cannot say it supports the troops as it pulls the plug on funding. You either support the troops or you do not. 
   My colleagues, let us not signal that America is preparing to walk away. Let us not send the wrong message to America, to our troops, let alone to al Qaeda. 
   We must provide our full and unconditional support to our troops during this time of war. We must support our commanders in the field. We must support the President, our commander in chief. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this piecemeal, ill-conceived approach to funding our troops. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, in closing, let me repeat that one more time it appears that the majority is more interested in appeasing their left, that is the left in their caucus, than in supporting the troops. 
   One more time, the House is preparing to approve a supplemental that the President will veto in no small part because it tells our enemy we are ready to wave the white flag.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer this very simple and straightforward motion to recommit. 
   Included within Mr. Obey's emergency supplemental proposal is legislative language that requires the President to report by July 13 on the specific progress the Iraqi Government has made in meeting 16 specific goals. Once this report is received, only the chairman of the Appropriations Committee can introduce a joint resolution of approval to release any additional funds to our troops in Iraq. 
   The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee is not required to introduce the joint resolution of approval, and no other Member can do it. The authority that this gives the chairman of the committee to introduce or not introduce legislation is unprecedented. 
   Further, in an almost unprecedented move, this supplemental includes the rule under which the joint resolution will be brought to the floor. And under this rule, the only amendment made in order is one that mandates the withdrawal of troops from Iraq within 6 months. 
   Mr. Speaker, this legislative language sets dangerous precedents that should be of great concern to Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   My motion to recommit strikes this legislative language in section 1331, the so-called fence language, limiting the availability of funds for our troops. This ill-conceived language not only grants the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee extraordinary authority, but also preordains the rule by which the joint resolution will be brought to the floor. 
   I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion to recommit.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   In doing so, I rise to offer a very simple, straightforward motion to instruct conferees on the fiscal year 2007 emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
   The motion to instruct simply insists that House conferees support the previously adopted House position with regard to a timetable for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. This motion, which I will oppose, puts Members on record as either fully supporting our troops or agreeing to a surrender date in Iraq. It is that simple. 
   It is no secret that many Members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats, have strong reservations about the manner in which this legislation undermines the authority of the President, our commander in chief. Members are also rightly concerned about how this legislation places military decisions in the hands of politicians rather than the military commanders in the field. 
   This legislation ought to focus on our troops. It ought to focus on providing those in harm's way with the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. It ought to respect, not micromanage, our combatant commanders in whom we place the ultimate responsibility for prosecuting military actions. 
   Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress are many things. We are elected to represent the interests of our constituents from our congressional districts. However, as presently written, this legislation makes the dangerous assumption that Congress also has an on-the-ground role in prosecuting the war in Iraq. 
   In closing, let me remind my colleagues of this: We are not generals. We are not the Secretary of State. And we are most certainly not the commander in chief. 
   The vote on this motion to instruct will signal whether Members of the  House are willing to provide our men and women in uniform with our unqualified support or whether Members will fully embrace a timetable for withdrawal and surrender. 
   I urge a ``no'' vote on this motion to instruct.

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague dealing with this time and circumstance. I do not intend to take a lot of time. 
   But it is important for all those listening, and who were concerned about this issue, to know that we take this matter very, very seriously, and our motion is a serious one. It is my view that a ``yes'' vote for this bill is a bill that will undermine the potential effectiveness of our troops for the remainder of the time that they remain in Iraq, and that a ``no'' vote is the only way, the only way to express support for our troops' efforts and guarantee, in many ways, the opportunity for success. This legislation ought to focus on those troops. 
   As I said earlier, it ought to focus on providing those in harm's way with the resources they need to complete their mission successfully. Further, it ought to respect, not micromanage, our combatant commanders who have the responsibility for carrying forward this war successfully. 
   It's no secret that many Members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats, have strong reservations about the manner in which this legislation undermines the authority of the President and the Commander in Chief. It is not acceptable that we find ourselves suddenly presuming that we can afford to have 435 Commanders in Chief by way of this House. 
   It breaks, in my judgment, some of the fundamental traditions of the Appropriations Committee, which calls for an open process whereby we can deal with each other in as close as a nonpartisan way as possible. Indeed, a ``no'' vote on this legislation expresses strongly our concern for allowing our troops to do their work, to do it effectively, and to get home as soon as possible as we continue to be the voice, the significant voice for freedom remaining in this world.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for those very, very poignant remarks laying the foundation for all of us to understand just how serious this challenge is that we are about. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the resolution before us and urge those who are voting for it, or considering it, to carefully reconsider their decision. 
   Section 1 simply expresses all of our support for our troops who are fighting for our freedom and freedom in the world in Iraq. 
   All of us agree with that piece of the statement, and each of us has expressed our support and encouragement to our troops in our own way and our own time. 
   The second section challenges the President's, actually the Commander in Chief's, request for a surge in Iraq. 
   Much has been said about our going to Iraq because of the prospect of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the madman Saddam Hussein. We presumed their presence, as most of the leaders of the world and most of the intelligence communities of the world so presumed. Not finding weapons of mass destruction does not set aside the importance of eliminating the force of Saddam Hussein from the face of the Earth. 
   It was my honor to lead one of the early trips to Iraq following the fall of Saddam. We were about to consider an $87 billion supplemental to help finance our presence in Iraq. I wanted to take a team of Members who would reflect much of the Congress, so that trip included conservatives and moderates and liberals. It also included within us Members who had voted to support going to war and those who had voted against it. 
   We visited most of Iraq, Mosul, Tikrit. We spent time in Baghdad. We visited the killing fields where over 500,000 bodies of Iraqis lie, Iraqis who were murdered by Saddam Hussein. We saw the golden palaces and visited the industrial sites suffering under Saddam Hussein's neglect. We saw the economic conditions, the handbasket conditions left by Saddam Hussein. 
   We stopped out of country on our way home to consider the fact that there was this supplemental appropriations before us when we returned, some $87 billion, discussing what we had experienced. And the experience had a tremendous effect upon all of our colleagues. It is properly summarized by the statement of one of our Members who said: ``You all know where I have been coming from. I voted against the war. But after we have seen what we have seen over this long stay in Iraq, I am afraid what I am about to do is going to be very, very unpopular at home but I don't know how we can do anything else. Sometimes,'' he said, ``you have to be ahead of your people; sometimes we are elected actually to lead.'' 
   That was almost 4 years ago. And fast forward to today. Saddam Hussein is gone, he is dead, and he is buried. But the extremists jihadi Islamic terrorists remain and continue to impact the entire Middle East. That is why we must succeed in Iraq. That is why we cannot afford to withdraw troops now. 
   Watching our floor debate last night, my wife turned to me and said, ``They want us to redeploy or withdraw. They want us to retreat.'' She said, ``George Washington did not retreat when our country was in danger.'' She questioned why we find ourselves in this kind of circumstance today. 
   I was reminiscent of that early time in our history when our Nation was threatened. The French came to our rescue, our assistance, and indeed played a major role in our future Commander in Chief himself being successful. 
   Americans should never forget that. The Statue of Liberty stands on Ellis Island as a reminder of the French view of that young America, its potential, a land of hope where freedom could reign and opportunity indeed might abound. For that and many other reasons we love France, and the French people are our friends. 
   But France is not entirely the same country at this point in its history. She no longer provides such a leading light for the world. No longer is it presumed that the French language should be the language of the international world. Today, about 10 percent of the French population is Muslim. Much of that population is middle class and something less than a middle-class opportunity. 
   Within that group, there abounds the voice of Islamic extreme. There are those who advocate jihad and who would wipe France as we know it off the face of the Earth. 
   We should not consider withdrawing now, because a stable Iraq is vital to our national interests and is an important part of our ability to promote peace and economic opportunity in the entire world. It is a critical battleground in our war against terrorism. 
   If we succeed in Iraq, we will have taken a gigantic step towards stamping out the source of terrorism that exists in that part of the world. If we are not 
   successful in Iraq, we will meet extremist Islamic activism elsewhere. 9/11 was only a part of a beginning. If we do not stop extreme Islamic jihadists in the Middle East, we will see it again, and most likely we will see it again here at home. 
   Review with me for a moment where we have been in Afghanistan and Iraq and where it may take us. Al Qaeda was nurtured and gained strength in Afghanistan. America had played a key role in forcing the former Soviet Union to cease its incursion in Afghanistan. The Islamic extremists who surround the likes of Osama bin Laden took advantage of the vacuum of Afghanistan, and used it as a training ground that would provide the terrorists an opportunity to spread their jihad around the world and spread terrorism with it. 
   America cannot allow the likes of Osama bin Laden to have places like  Afghanistan to serve as training grounds. It is in our vital interests to see that Iraq, for example, does not serve as a recruitment and training ground for the forces who oppose freedom and oppose our very way of life. 
   Make no mistake about it, there are forces in the Islamic world who do not believe we should exist. They may be relatively new or small in number, but there are those of Islamic jihadist extreme who are committed to the death of the nonbelievers. There are those on the extreme Imam fringe who teach hatred for the infidels in mosques all around the world. 
   We do not want to believe in such extremism as a country or a people, but the true believers want all of us to be dead, all Englishmen, all Germans, all French people, all Americans who are not committed to their belief. The heathens should be dead. How else would one be able to convince men, women, and children to strap themselves with bombs and kill the innocents by the thousands? If not death to all infidels, how else would a mother praise Allah as her young child explodes as a bomb in a crowded train station? 
   The war on terror goes well beyond Iraq. But make no mistake, that war will not be won by walking away from Iraq. 
   The President has called for a surge of just over 20,000 troops. That request does not flow from a naive presumption that maybe, just maybe the battle for Baghdad can be won by a few brave men. 
   The call for these troops is a change in strategy, a strategy that suggests that, with the leadership of such brave men committed to taking the Iraqis out front, can lead the way to a successful change in Baghdad, indeed, a change throughout Iraq; a strategy that the President would suggest involves clearing areas of Baghdad, clearing other areas throughout Iraq, stabilizing them, and then providing the real opportunity for democratic growth and change in Iraq. 
   A successful stabilization of Baghdad indeed is only the beginning point in Iraq. To me, this kind of change is the real hope for the people, not just of Iraq, but of the entire region. To me, that is the definition of success in Iraq. 
   If we are successful, we will have changed the face of the Middle East. A successful Iraq will send a great message to the likes of Iran, Syria, Yemen, and Indonesia. 
   The chance for a long-term peace and the chance for stability in the entire Middle East is the great strategic interest of the United States saving tens of thousands of lives are worth a great commitment by the world's only remaining superpower. The economic values that are to be gained from stabilizing the region are impossible to estimate, but they can be measured in multiple trillions of dollars. 
   But what happens if we walk away now? Also difficult to estimate, but here are but a few of the possibilities. And listen to the possibilities: 
   First, instability is replaced by a new kind of centralized authoritarian control potentially, perhaps an arbitrary government with Saddam-like controls. Shia would very likely be in charge, and force would be exercised in the name of stability. 
   Beyond that, Kurdistan in the offing; an insecure Kurdish population to the north would do all it could to provide for its own protection. The prospects of independent Kurdish region or state would create major tension between Turkey and Baghdad and that new region in northern Iraq. Beyond that, Sunni Iran would look upon the new direction of Iraq with great concern because of sectarian differences.     
   Fourth, the jihadist extremists of Islam would have increased sway in the entire region. The threat of terrorism all over the world would be a reality to those who would but look. Indeed, the prospects, to say the least, should be frightening to anybody who will but look. 
   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Speaker, all of our country, please realize that this is not the time to walk away. This is the time for the only remaining superpower in the world, America, to lead on behalf of freedom, to lead on behalf of people who are looking for opportunity and change for the entire world. 
   Mr. Buyer, I very much appreciate your extending me this time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with serious reservations about the process, or rather the lack of process, governing the development of this year's end spending bill. 
   This package is made up of several components. We have just heard from the Defense Chairman. It also includes the Homeland Security bill and the Military Construction-VA spending bills, all of these together total some $603 billion; a continuing resolution for nine spending bills funded at fiscal year 2008 levels; emergency spending totaling something in the neighborhood of $23 billion; and other provisions costing even billions more. 
   If you are like me, you have a great many questions about what is actually included in this package. The simple truth is this: Very few people have any idea what is in it. During this time of economic uncertainty, our constituents are demanding oversight, transparency and accountability from Congress. 
   Last Friday, I began writing a letter to the three leaders writing this legislation. My message was simple: Given the size and scope of this spending bill, it is paramount that House Members and Senators of both parties be active participants in crafting this bill. I felt then, and I feel now, that it is essential that chairmen and ranking members of our Appropriations subcommittees be at the table during substantive negotiations. 
   I didn't send the letter, Mr. Speaker, because on Saturday morning I was told that the key elements of the spending bill were already in place and that there would be no Member or Senator participation. In other words, no full Appropriations Committee consideration, no meetings involving the key chairmen and ranking members, and no formal House-Senate conference deliberations. 
   I am convinced that the completion of this legislation without the full participation of Members and Senators will result in lasting long-term damage to not just the Appropriations Committee, but also to the institution, the House of Representatives that I love. It also leads the House and Senate into an unprecedented dangerous territory by handing the sole decision-making authority on national spending practices to a handful of elected leaders and a whole lot of unelected staff members. 
   It is not as if these leaders were negotiating 12 individual spending bills that had passed the House and the Senate. This year, the House has passed one funding bill. The Senate has not passed any. Over the last 2 years, out of the 24 regular order bills, the Appropriations Committee in the House has produced exactly one regular order conference report. 
   The challenge of developing and passing a Federal budget requires full active participation of Members and Senators in the full Appropriations Committee, on the floor of the House and Senate, and through an open House-Senate conference committee.     
   By the way, I might mention it was suggested on the floor earlier today that the chairman of our committee indicated the reason we haven't had a full, open committee hearing regarding this process was because Members tend to stand up and pontificate in open hearings. 
   Well, let me suggest that may very well be the case, and I wouldn't suggest that our chairman was ever known for pontificating, but, in the meantime, this lack of Member involvement is absolutely unacceptable. All year long, the majority leadership has chosen to ignore regular order. The assumption has been that Barack Obama would be elected President in November, and that he would support higher levels of spending all across the board. 
   But join me in this question: What happens if John McCain gets elected President? And what if that President draws an even tougher line than President Bush? What does that mean? Does that mean, Mr. Chairman, that we won't have Appropriations Committee meetings or hearings or bills for another 4 years? It is an interesting question. 
   When I first came to Congress, legislation was drafted by Members with jurisdiction over the issues of the day. Members of both parties had every opportunity to participate in the debate by offering amendments. 
   Today, whether you are Republican or a Democrat, you no longer have any opportunity to participate, no opportunity to offer amendments, no opportunity to settle meaningful differences in the committee and on the House floor or in the conference between the House and the Senate. 
   My colleagues, this is no way to govern. We ought to work together, produce spending bills through a legitimate committee process and return to a full and open debate in committee and on the House floor. 
   Let me say that I did have a conversation just yesterday, indeed a cursory conversation, with my chairman, Mr. Obey, about what's in this bill. I appreciated that opportunity to chat for a few minutes about this horrendous process as well as this bill. 
   Let me say that the issue that seemed to have paralyzed the process this year, and caused the committee to essentially close down, involves the majority's unwillingness to address the high price of oil and gas. That issue is finally, at least in part, addressed with this bill. Had we dealt with the OCS moratorium in June, the committee probably would have completed all of its bills, but we chose not to let that process go forward. 
   It is now late September, and, finally, the voices of millions of Americans, financially drained from paying $4 a gallon for gasoline, they are finally being heard. Section 152 of the CR represents a gigantic step in the right direction relative to energy independence. We actually suspend the moratorium on drilling in the United States. 
   Now, frankly, depending on who is elected as President, we may have to worry about that next year. I mean, a President could literally be involved in reestablishing that moratorium and thereby hampering America one more time. 
   In closing, I don't believe we should shut down our government. We must support funding for our troops, our veterans, and protect our homeland. Each of the 535 House Members and Senators should have played a role in shaping this bill. 
   It is time that we insist upon a return to regular order. It's certainly time that we get back to that which the Speaker promised, an open and transparent process with everybody's involvement, Members, but also the public as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I proudly reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of California. (CONSOLIDATED SECURITY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE, AND CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2009 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>

   Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I do have one additional speaker. He doesn't happen to be here, but if the Members would bear with me, I would like to take just a moment on my time.  
   For just a moment I would like to suggest that because this is likely the last time we will be addressing Appropriations Committee business this year, I want to commend eight of our colleagues who serve on our committee who are leaving Congress at the end of this year to pursue new challenges and new opportunities. They are Bud Cramer, Tom Udall, Ralph Regula, Jim Walsh, Dave Hobson, John Peterson, Ray LaHood and Dave Weldon.     
   All told, with these retirements, the House is losing over 100 years of cumulative Appropriations Committee experience. The skill and knowledge that they bring to the committee each day will be sorely missed and not easily replaced. 
   Let me take a moment in a long-standing tradition of our committee in the House to thank each of our retiring colleagues for their friendship, their service, and their fine bipartisan work. Let's stand together, Republicans and Democrats, to show our appreciation and say thank you to our friends and colleagues.
