<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 EXTENSION -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, while I will not oppose this bill, even though it has not gone through regular order in the committee process, I continue to have serious reservations about further putting off the critical issue of FISA modernization. I also have significant concern with the failure of the majority to ensure a long-term and effective solution to the critical problem of ensuring that our intelligence community has the tools that it needs to detect and protect potential terrorists. 
   Last August, Congress acted on an overwhelming bipartisan basis after months of prodding to pass the Protect America Act and close significant intelligence gaps against foreign terrorists in foreign countries. The failure to clarify the authorities of our intelligence professionals on a long-term basis had clearly jeopardized America's ability to detect and prevent potential terrorist attacks and to effectively collect intelligence on foreign adversaries. 
   The Protect America Act expires on Friday, February 1. This temporary extension will now push that date to February 15. While elements of surveillance under the Protect America Act could have temporarily continued without an extension, the failure to act permanently on the lapsing authorities still ultimately threatens the capabilities of the intelligence community to react with speed and agility to new threats and changing circumstances. 
   We cannot continue to make excuses. We cannot continue to avoid our responsibility to deal with this vital issue. National security should not be on a week-to-week lease. I think both the President and Members on our side of the aisle have made clear that our patience with further delays to this vital legislation will be extremely limited. 
   Democrats have failed to do their job on this critical national security issue, even after Speaker Pelosi boasted last August that they would act as soon as possible. Their partisanship on this issue clearly has failed. A bipartisan Senate solution, acceptable to the President, has been available for weeks, but has been held up by liberal activists over the issue of retroactive liability for third parties who may have helped the government to detect potential terrorists. 
   Madam Speaker, columnist Stuart Taylor recently pointed out that holding the private sector hostage to ideological extremism is a ``risky game.'' It is a risky game for our national security and may chill cooperation in future emergencies. He wrote: ``Most Americans would want the telecoms to say yes without hesitation. But the telecoms would have reason to say no, or delay for a few dangerous days to consult their lawyers, if liberals get their way in a battle currently raging in Congress.''  
   Holding Telecoms Hostage: A Risky Game  
   Suppose that the next big terrorist attack on our country comes two weeks after a new Democratic president has taken office. Simultaneous suicide bombings devastate 20 schools and shopping malls around the country, killing 1,500 people. The intelligence agencies believe that at least 20 more trained jihadists, including American citizens, are in the United States planning follow-up attacks. 
   The president is told that the best hope of stopping a second wave of attacks is to immediately wiretap as many calls and e-mails as possible from and to every private citizen who has been to Pakistan or Afghanistan since 1999. These hundreds of domestic wiretaps, with neither warrants nor probable cause to suspect any individual of terrorist ties might well violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
   The president nonetheless asks the major telephone companies to place the taps for 30 days while the administration seeks congressional approval. He or she also assures the telecoms in writing that the new attorney general has advised that the Constitution empowers the president to temporarily override FISA during such an emergency--a controversial theory never tested in court. 
   Most Americans would want the telecoms to say yes without hesitation. But the telecoms would have reason to say no--or delay for a few dangerous days to consult their lawyers--if liberals and libertarians get their way in a battle currently raging in Congress. 
   The issue is whether to immunize these same telecoms retroactively, as President Bush and a bipartisan majority of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (including Chairman Jay Rockefeller IV) urge, from liability for having said yes to Bush's warrantless surveillance program during the unprecedented national crisis precipitated by the 9/11 attacks. 
   The telecoms face more than 40 class actions seeking hundreds of billions of dollars in damages for their roles in the Bush program, which they agreed to after being assured that the attorney general had deemed the program lawful. 
   Allowing this litigation to continue would, as a group of highly respected former Justice Department officials wrote in a joint letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``produce perverse incentives that risk damage to our national security,'' because ``both telecommunications carriers and other corporations in the future will think twice before assisting any agency of the intelligence community seeking information.'' 
   This particular group includes Jack Goldsmith, James Comey, Patrick Philbin, and John Ashcroft. They (especially the first three) won bipartisan applause for leading a rebellion in 2004 against overreaching claims of power by Bush, who chose to secretly override FISA not just for a few weeks but for years. 
   ``Given our experiences,'' the former officials wrote, ``we can certainly understand that reasonable people may question and wish to probe the legal bases for such intelligence activities.'' But the proper forum is the congressional oversight process, they asserted, not ``a public lawsuit against private companies that were asked to assist their nation.'' 
   Such leading Democrats as former Sen. Bob Kerrey, former Rep. (and 9/11 commission Co-Chair) Lee Hamilton, and former Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti have also called for immunizing the telecoms. 
   On the other hand, People for the American Way, like other liberal groups, argues that immunity would ``protect telecoms that knowingly violated law.'' But the telecoms did not violate the law--even if Bush did--according to an October 26, 2007, Senate Intelligence Committee report urging adoption of the immunity proposal as part of an important bill updating FISA. 
   The committee, after forcing the administration to show investigators the relevant presidential and Justice Department documents, found that the record showed that the telecoms ``acted on a good-faith belief that the president's program, and their assistance, was lawful.'' Courts have for centuries seen such a good-faith belief as grounds for immunizing from lawsuits private parties that heed government officials' requests for help in protecting public safety, especially in emergencies. 
   And, in fact, hardly anyone in Congress thinks that the telecoms should (or will) be forced to pay huge damages to the plaintiffs, who after all have suffered no real harm. So why are some senators, including Patrick Leahy, the Senate Judiciary Committee's senior Democrat, fighting the immunity proposal? 
   The real reasons are election-year pressure from liberal groups and the hope that the lawsuits will force public disclosure of information embarrassing to the Bush Administration. Leahy said in a press release that he opposed giving retroactive immunity to the telecoms because that would reduce their incentives to protect privacy and ``would eliminate the courts as a check on the illegality of the warrantless wiretapping of Americans that the administration secretly engaged in for almost six years.'' 
   Leahy may well be right that some aspects of the highly classified wiretapping program were illegal. Indeed, Goldsmith, who took over the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in late 2003 and later touched off the above-mentioned rebellion, has publicly called the still-secret OLC surveillance memos that he inherited a ``legal mess.'' 
   In my own view, Bush's decision to secretly override FISA for a time immediately after 9/11 was probably a lawful exercise of his war powers. But his legal rationale became weaker and weaker when he continued to override the law for months and years without seeking congressional approval. 
   It is one thing to say that the president has inherent power to disregard an outdated law during an emergency in which immediate action might save many lives. It is something else to say that the president can secretly continue to disregard that law for several years without ever seeking to amend it. (See my 1/28/06 column.) 
   But doubts about the legality of Bush's actions are no justification for holding hostage telecoms that relied on the administration's assurances of legality and were in no position to second-guess its assertions that the surveillance program was essential to national security. 
   Not, that is, unless we want to risk that the telecoms, credit card companies, banks, airlines, hospitals, and other private companies--whose cooperation is essential to finding terrorists before they strike--will balk or delay when the next president seeks their help in an emergency. 
   And to keep things in perspective, let's remember that even if Bush did violate the law, the terrorist groups targeted by his surveillance program have taken thousands of American lives; that the program itself has apparently caused no serious harm to anyone (except terrorists); and that no evidence exists that Bush or anyone else has ever made  any improper use of any intercepted communications. 
   Opponents of immunity say that the telecoms have nothing to fear in court if they can show that they acted lawfully. And it does seem most unlikely that the telecoms would ultimately lose; the lawsuits face huge obstacles, including the state secrets privilege and doubts about the plaintiffs' standing to sue, as well as the strong evidence that the telecoms acted lawfully. 
   But even a remote risk of massive liability for doing the right thing in the past might deter some from doing the right thing in the future. And in the vast, interminable, unpredictable, often perverse meat grinder that high-stakes litigation has become in this country, victory in court would come only after many years of expensive legal battles, uncertainty, downward pressure on stock prices, and publicity damaging to the telecoms' international business interests. This prospect might drive them to accept a nuisance settlement that would yield millions of dollars for the plaintiffs' lawyers and very little for anyone else. Indeed, that's what many plaintiffs' lawyers are hoping for. 
   Some senators and others have proposed ways to relieve the telecoms of monetary liability while keeping the litigation alive to force a healthy public airing of information about what Bush and his aides did. One such proposal would have the government cover any damage awards; another would place a very low cap on any damages; a third would ask the FISA court to decide whether the telecoms broke the law. Such expedients would be better than no protection at all. But they would not give the telecoms the finality and the relief from litigation costs that they want and deserve. 
   In any event, it seems unlikely that any kind of litigation against the telecoms will yield much new information about what Bush and his aides did. The main reason is that any such evidence is probably inextricably intertwined with operational details of the surveillance, which are highly (and properly) classified. And lawsuits against the government, which would be unaffected by immunizing the telecoms, would be a more logical vehicle for exposing whatever can properly be exposed. 
   But the bottom line is that a remote chance of exposing any Bush misconduct is simply not a good enough reason to run even a small risk of losing potentially lifesaving intelligence. And it's simply unfair to hold hostage private companies that thought they were helping to save lives and did nothing wrong.  
   Partisan political points and the nonexistent rights of radical jihadists shouldn't be more important than giving the most effective tools to the intelligence community to detect and prevent attacks. As soon as the Senate passes this comprehensive bipartisan bill, the House should consider it immediately in order to send a responsible bill to the President as quickly as possible. 
   There is bipartisan agreement that Congress must act immediately to ensure a long-term effective solution that empowers intelligence community professionals to act with speed and agility against foreign targets, provides retroactive liability protection for third parties who may have assisted the government after 9/11, and ensures that court orders will continue to be required for any surveillance targeting Americans. 
   We should stop the bipartisan obstructionism and move forward with permanent legislation to fully ensure the protection of the American people and their civil rights.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to talk about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But before we talk about this very important piece of legislation which the Congress extended in the waning hours before we went on our August recess, I think it is important that we put this in context. 
   As Members of Congress and as my colleague here, Mrs. Wilson from New Mexico joins me, we serve on the Intelligence Committee. We recognize that the American people have laid upon us the responsibility to do everything in our power to assist and give the intelligence community the tools that it needs to prevent another terrorist attack against the United States. 
   And make no doubt about it, when you take a look at what bin Laden and others in al Qaeda have said, their intent is to attack us and to attack us again and again. 
   In 1998, bin Laden, in a series of interviews, was asked about his intentions. One of his quotes was: ``To kill the Americans and their allies, civilians and military, is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all of the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.'' That was February 28, 1998. 
   He was asked about the possibility of acquiring chemical or nuclear weapons. His response to those questions, again in 1998, was: ``Acquiring weapons for the defense of Muslims is a religious duty. If I have indeed acquired these weapons, then I thank God for enabling me to do so.'' 
   He goes on in another quote, December 1998, to say: ``If I seek to acquire such weapons, this is a religious duty. How we use them is up to us.'' 
   So we have known of the intentions of bin Laden, al Qaeda and the radical jihadists for a long period of time.     
   We experienced many of their attacks during the 1990s, whether it was the first attack on the World Trade Center, the attacks against the USS Cole, the attacks against our compounds in Saudi Arabia, or our embassies in Africa. Of course, it all culminated on 9/11 with the attacks in New York, Washington, and the crash in Pennsylvania. 
   It is exactly these kinds of activities, these attacks against our homeland or against our interests in other parts of the world that we seek to prevent. We want to make sure that the intelligence community works with other intelligence communities around the world, because we recognize that it's not only the United States and our homeland that is vulnerable; but we recognize with the attacks in London, the attacks in Spain, the killing of van Gogh in The Netherlands, the plots that were recently disrupted in Germany, in Denmark, the airline plot that was disrupted a year ago, we recognize that the statements that bin Laden made in 1998 are still the way that they think and what they want to do in 2007. 
   If you go back, if you go to his most recent statement, or one of his recent statements around the anniversary of 9/11, again here's what bin Laden says: However, there are two solutions for stopping it. The first is from our side, and there he's talking about the radical jihadists, and it is to continue to escalate, to continue to escalate the killing and fighting against you. This is our duty and our brothers are carrying it out, and I ask Allah to grant them resolve in victory. 
   The second solution is from your side, meaning our side. It has now become clear to you and the entire world the impotence of the democratic system and how it plays with the interest of the peoples and their blood, by sacrificing soldiers and populations to achieve the interests of the major corporations. 
   He wants to attack and sees it as his religious duty for radical jihadists to attack the West, to attack the United States and to escalate, and as I said earlier, his quote from 1998, he seeks access to chemical and nuclear weapons. He seeks access so that they can determine how to use it. 
   It's our responsibility, again, to give the intelligence community and give the military the tools necessary to prevent bin Laden, to prevent radical jihadists, to prevent al Qaeda from successfully attacking the United States. 
   I yield to my colleague from New Mexico to talk a little bit about FISA and perhaps also put some context in why this is so important and why the intelligence community is so important as we try to intercept the communications of foreign terrorists like al Qaeda, like bin Laden, like radical jihadists to prevent these kinds of terrorist attacks from occurring again in the future. I yield to my colleague.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. And this is not a partisan issue. The vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, talking about the objectives of al Qaeda: keep in mind there isn't any doubt here about the intentions of the terrorists. They've made it very clear. They want to get hold of a nuclear weapon. So this is not an idle threat. It's a very serious one. Lee Hamilton, a distinguished Member of this body, former Member of this body, vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission and a Democrat who did a wonderful job in leading the effort of that 9/11 Commission. 
   One of our colleagues here in the House talked about, again, their intentions and talked a little bit about what his reaction was to September 11. His quote is: It did answer the one question we didn't know about September 11: how far would they go. What September 11 said is they will go as far as they want to, that there's no red line, that there's no sense of decency, no innocence, that our world has changed in a very real way. Those are the words of our colleague from Connecticut, CHRIS SHAYS.  
   And then if we go back to Lee Hamilton: There is one threat because of the consequences that just rises above all others and that is the possibility of a terrorist getting hold of a nuclear weapon. They've made it very clear that they want to get a hold of a nuclear weapon. It's not an idle threat. It's a serious one. It's our responsibility not as Republicans, not as Democrats. This is an American issue. It's got to be an American priority. It is about preventing a nuclear terrorist attack. 
   And I yield to my colleague.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Reclaiming my time, and I think that's exactly right, that we take a look at the past but most importantly that we set the right objective, the right milestone looking forward; and I think as a Congress we ought to commit to the principle of prevention. 
   We need to commit to diplomacy and international cooperation, commit to homeland security. That includes our ports, our borders, not just our skies. Let's commit to a nonpartisan approach that applies the knowledge and wisdom of all of our elected officials. Let's learn from 9/11 the goal and the objective of making sure that we will prevent the next 9/11 from occurring. 
   I'll yield.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Reclaiming my time for just a minute. When we take a look at the threat that we face today, it is a fight against radical jihadists. As my colleague pointed out, this is a fight that is very different than what we fought in the cold war. But even in the cold war we had a very specific strategy laid out and a very specific objective. Now, we need to transform our intelligence community to make sure that it is as good and as quick. Actually, it has to be better and it has to be quicker, than radical jihadists. These people who have perverted their Islamic faith to achieve what they hope will be ultimately a world in which their view of Islam dominates everyone, and you either bend to their will or you are killed. Remember, their objectives are very simple: They want to take down the government in Iraq; they then want to destabilize the region; eliminate the State of Israel; establish their caliphate, Northern Africa, Southern Europe, the Middle East, reaching down into Asia, and they want to put it under sharia law; and, at the same time, they want to continue on in the West. 
   Remember, that for radical jihadists, as they look at the rest of the world they say, you have three options: you have the option to convert to Islam; you have the option to pay the tax, the hadid, or you will be attacked and you will be killed. And that is how they view the rest of the world. And that is why, when you take a look at the statements of bin Laden, al Qaeda, and other radical jihadist groups, it is why they are so focused and why bin Laden, in one of his latest messages, said that they need to escalate their efforts against the West. They need to escalate the killing. And why, if by the grace of God he is given a nuclear weapon, he will decide whether they  will use it or how they will use it. It is why we need to use every tool at our disposal, tools that we refined and that we learned how to use during the cold war. 
   We developed a great capability against the former Soviet Union, against other enemies during the cold war, and we ought to now take our knowledge of how these tools worked, how we put them in practice, to make sure that we got the information that kept us safe, that prevented the Soviet Union from ever being able to attack us and attack us successfully. How did we develop those tools to make sure that we got the information that we needed at the same time that we protected American civil liberties, privacy and American rights and the American way of life? 
   We had a good balance. We got the intelligence that we needed. We kept America safe. We had a period of 50 years where we developed these tools. We developed them at their various intelligence organizations where we refined the practices in such a way that they are now positioned as we target them at different threats, and perhaps a more serious threat than what we have ever seen before, radical jihadists. These are the tools that will enable us to meet our commitment of saying we will do everything we can to prevent a successful attack against the homeland. 
   I will yield to my colleague.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Just to talk a little bit about the difference between the threat that we face with radical jihadists versus what we faced in the former Soviet Union. 
   You know, when we developed some of these tools, they were targeted against a specific location, an embassy in Washington, D.C. or embassies overseas. We knew who these individuals were; we knew where their locations were. I mean, it is a nation-state. They carried passports of certain countries. We knew where their embassies were and all of those kinds of things. They were relatively easy to identify, and the threat wasn't necessarily imminent. 
   What we now face with radical jihadists is we have got groups of people who, as we have seen in taking a look at their own words, have a passion for attacking the United States. And there are all different kinds of levels within this group. You have got the radical jihadists who are clearly linked to al Qaeda who take direction from al Qaeda. We call it the al Qaeda Central in the Pakistani-Afghan border region, the Fatah, the federally administered tribal areas. So you have got that network that is committed on a larger scale to attacking the West. And then you also have individual cells that might be franchises of radical jihadists who have aligned their goals and their missions with al Qaeda but may not be directly linked or taking their direction. And then that goes all the way over to the thing that we see with homegrown terrorists, people who may have become radicalized in a local mosque, or individuals that may actually become radicalized through the Internet. 
   So, the intelligence community needs to be focused on each of these types of threats in different ways, and it is a very difficult threat to get a handle on.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. If you take a look at the information right almost immediately after 9/11, as the President convened the bipartisan leadership of the House and Senate, along with the bipartisan leadership of the Intelligence Committees, they recognized that the FISA law wasn't going to work against this new kind of threat. So almost immediately, as the President consulted with this bipartisan leadership of the Congress, they talked about exactly what is this threat that is out there. And as they took a look at the statements, as we did earlier tonight, of what bin Laden was saying, what others in the al Qaeda organization were saying about we want to attack the West, we may use a nuclear weapon, we made a portable nuclear weapon, or something like that, they were unsure of exactly what the threat would be and they were unsure of what the organizational capabilities of the radical jihadists and al Qaeda were. So they made a decision. They said, we are going to do everything, we are going to unleash the NSA onto radical jihadists and intercept their communications so that we can determine and get a better insight as to exactly what they are doing. Because the President and the leadership, bipartisan leadership, recognized that it was their responsibility, and they made a commitment back then that said, we are going to do everything in our power to make sure that we prevent another attack against the United States. 
   So they took the policies and the practices, and they made the decision to adapt it and extend it to recognize the changes that had taken place in technology. The current Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker Pelosi, briefed four times in the first 12 months of this effort, talking about exactly how it was working, who was being targeted, the information that was being collected, the kind of impact that it was having on the threats against the United States and how American's civil liberties were being protected. And consistently over a period of 3 to 4 years, as Members of Congress, we are consulted and briefed on this program. They all walked out of those briefings saying, this is essential, this is a necessary tool to prevent another successful attack against the United States.     
   That all changed when the New York Times published the existence of this program. It made America less safe. It tipped the radical jihadists off as to what some of our capabilities might be. They changed the way that they communicated. They changed the way that they operated. 
   But the end result is this is still an effective tool and a balanced tool that we now need to bring up to date through the legislative process. We did that in August. 
   I yield to my colleague.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Reclaiming my time, as the gentlelady recognizes, when Admiral McConnell, the Director of the National Intelligence Agency, the former head of NSA during the Clinton administration, I think, for three or four years testified in front of our committee that on occasion, in military activities involving the security and safety of American soldiers, that there were instances where there was a requirement, the safety and the security, not of the homeland, but of our troops who are in harm's way that it required the intelligence communities to go to a court in the United States to be able to listen to foreigners, terrorists, jihadists to get the information that was necessary to protect our troops. And in a time of war, as we talked about it on an Amber Alert, whether it's 12 hours, whether it's 24 hours or whatever, that's too long. And if you're a soldier under fire, or at risk, you want the intelligence community to have every tool to keep you safe and from preventing the terrorists from being successful where you are because, in your environment for the terrorists to be successful, the terrorist objective is very simple. They are over there, you are over here. You're in a hostile environment. Their objective is to kill you. It becomes very, very real for them.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Baker, a former official at the Justice Department spent a considerable amount of time with the committee explaining to us exactly how the emergency process works. And so often people have focused on just the last part of the emergency process saying, call the Attorney General and he'll approve it. And that can take, that can be almost done at the speed of light. The Attorney General knows the call's coming, and it's kind of like you can get the approval very quickly. If that were the full extent of the emergency process, it might work. But Mr. Baker, in his testimony, says the emergency process, there are complications to it. I don't mean to sit here today, that you push a button, or it is not like, click, buy now on the Internet. It does take time. 
   He goes on, so why does it take time? So the 
   intelligence community has to do their investigation, make a judgment about what targets they want to pursue, when they've done that; and when they've reached a point where they realize that they need to do collection immediately, they start talking to us. The ``us'' is the Justice Department. 
   Going on, he says, then we work through the legal facts, the legal issues, the factual issues, at the same time that they are dealing with the technical stuff that they need to do. Then, when all of that is ready and they tell us we are ready to go, and they say, yes, we resolved all legal issues, we have no problem; then they call the Attorney General. Calling the Attorney General and getting an answer back, it's not like super-time intensive unless a complicated case. Oftentimes we'll go down, prebrief the Attorney General what the case is all about, what the request will be, so that when the call comes, it can happen quickly. 
   But before that call is made, Mr. Baker goes through, we work through the legal facts, the legal issues, the factual issues at the same time that they are dealing with the technical stuff. Then, when that's all ready, and this is what my colleague from New Mexico is talking about, this is what the two inches of legal documents preparation that needs to be done before these folks in the Justice Department and in the intelligence community feel comfortable enough calling the Attorney General or one of his designees and saying, hey, it's time to go up on an emergency FISA.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Until we fixed it. But in the FISA, you know, there was not a commonsense exception. I'm sure that there are lots of people in America today who have paid a penalty or whatever, believing that what they were doing was, you know, it's just common sense. And they went in front of a judge or maybe they got called in front of a committee in Congress and they found out that their definition of common sense happened to be very different than maybe what the Members of Congress would have defined common sense; and when they got in a court of law, they found out that there wasn't a common sense objective or a common sense exception and found that they'd violated the law.

So even before the attacks of 2001 and the implementation of the terrorist surveillance program, for 21 years the intelligence community had developed a strict regimen of here is what we do if our surveillance  touches on an American to make sure that we protect the civil liberties, and that whole process for 23 years has been able to be reviewed by the Intelligence Committees of the House and the Senate, and those procedures from 2001 were extended and applied in the same way under the terrorist surveillance program.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Let me reclaim my time for a second and answer a part of that. My colleague from New Mexico touched it. When in a legal proceeding we get a warrant against an individual, or a criminal proceeding here in the United States, we target that individual and all of the calls or all of the communications of that individual then are monitored. Some of these calls may be the kind that the criminal system wanted to intercept, talking to another drug kingpin or whatever. But at the same time they may pick up a call from his mom, his kid's teacher, his dentist, a pizza guy, or whatever, and those are all listened to. 
   What some folks wanted to do on an alternative to this FISA legislation that we passed in August was a guarantee that when you targeted this foreign terrorist, somebody that we knew was a foreign terrorist and you have to guarantee that that person, whoever he is talking to, is also going to be a foreigner, you kind of sit there and say, wow, how do you do that? This cell phone has an area code of West Michigan; so if someone is calling me and has this number, they are probably calling West Michigan. No, I am in Washington, D.C. And for my BlackBerry, if they call my BlackBerry, it has got a West Michigan number on it, I could be in Europe. You don't know where they are going to call, but they said you have to guarantee that it's going to be foreign to foreign. You can't do that.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague. 
   One of the jobs that I have here in the Congress is to serve as the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee, also having served as the chairman on the Intelligence Committee. 
   Today I rise in support of Congressman Wolf's privileged resolution on cyber security to salute him for his efforts to educate this House and the American public about the growing threat to U.S. commerce, our national security, and the privacy of the American people. 
   Unfortunately, some on the other side have attempted to scare the American people into thinking that the gravest threat to their privacy comes from our Nation's hardworking intelligence professionals. That's absolutely not true. Mr. Wolf, in this resolution today, reminds us that the real threat to America's privacy and the safety of Americans comes not from within, but from those who would do us harm from overseas. 
   Mr. Wolf had the misfortune to personally experience this fact when computers in his office were compromised by hackers from China, the Chinese, in 2006. I agree with my friend from Virginia that his office computers probably were targeted because of his long record of speaking out against human rights violations in China. 
   While I can't discuss the specifics of what we know, I can tell you that the leadership of this Congress, Republicans and Democrats, are well aware of the cyber espionage threat that exists. But what has this Congress done? Instead of working to modernize and strengthen our Nation's surveillance capabilities, the Democratic leadership  of this Congress has sought to tie the process down in bureaucracy, in red tape. Some have sought to vilify the intelligence professionals we ask to form the first line of our Nation's defense. 
   And in some cases, instead of talking about the threat to America's privacy posed by foreign cyber espionage and hackers, they instead point the finger of accusation at our intelligence professionals and innocent patriotic businesses that may at this point be helping to protect the Nation, the very same intelligence professionals and businesses we may turn to to help protect our Nation from the cyber threat. 
   The threats we face are real. These are not just simple viruses, these are sophisticated attacks on a new electronic battlefield. They jeopardize America's security--politically, economically, and militarily. It's a global problem with multiple threats. Some of my colleagues have talked about earlier, there has been reports about what Russia did in Estonia. We know what countries have done against the United States. 
   So Congress does need to face this and face this issue very seriously. Congress needs to ask tough questions about trade and technology deals involving Chinese finance and businesses. One of the things that we know, while my colleague brings up China in this instance, and the Chinese, we know that it is a global threat. But specifically about China the message is very, very clear, consistently over and over the Chinese cheat. 
   We also need to focus on the real threats our Nation faces, not those imagined for partisan gain. And most importantly, and most urgently, again, to make sure that our intelligence professionals on the front lines have the tools that they need to keep us safe and to attack this cyber threat, this Congress needs to pass the Senate FISA bill now. Because this law not only affects how we track the radical jihadists who threaten us, it will also impact how we confront the cyber threat as well. 
   This is a very sophisticated problem, it is a very serious problem. I congratulate my colleague for bringing it forward. This is an issue that I believe we can work on a bipartisan basis. We need to work on a bipartisan basis. But we need to do first things first, and the first thing we need to do now is get FISA passed, and do it soon.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the efforts to enhance protection for whistleblowers in the intelligence community, a goal that I wholeheartedly endorse. It is important that personnel within the intelligence community have appropriate opportunities to bring matters to Congress so long as the mechanisms to do so safeguard highly sensitive classified information and programs. The bill before us raises significant issues in doing so that need more considered review. 
   As chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during the last Congress, I learned firsthand from whistleblowers about intelligence programs that the administration had not reported to the Intelligence Committees, despite its statutory duty to keep us fully and currently informed. I communicated my strong concerns directly to the President. I would vigorously defend the individuals who provided me with this important information from even the slightest reprisal. 
   So I strongly support the underlying intention of the provisions of the bill intended to protect the intelligence community. Unfortunately, however, that part of the bill was not coordinated with HPSCI, and it suffers from a number of problems that I believe need to be fixed. 
   First, the bill would conflict with the provisions of the existing Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, which has already provided specific mechanisms to permit whistleblowers to come to Congress, while simultaneously protecting sensitive national security information from unauthorized disclosure to persons not entitled to receive it. 
   Second, the bill violates the rules of the House by encouraging intelligence community personnel to report highly sensitive intelligence matters to committees other than the Intelligence Committees, which were created to solely and appropriately deal with and safeguard information regarding sensitive intelligence programs. 
   This is simply not a jurisdictional issue. The real issue is one of protecting highly classified intelligence programs and ensuring that any oversight is conducted by Members and staff with the appropriate experiences, expertise, and clearances. Our intelligence oversight should be conducted to determine how best to enhance our national security, protect civil liberties, and not to get press coverage. 
   Third, this bill would make every claim of a self-described whistleblower, whether meritorious or not, subject to extended and protracted litigation. It would also substantially alter the application of the judicially established state secrets privilege in those cases, forcing the government to choose between revealing sensitive national security information to defend itself or losing in court. Judges recognized the privilege precisely because they understood that such a Hobson's choice is fundamentally improper and unfair and could harm national security interests. The current law works to screen frivolous whistleblower claims and recognizes that our national security interest should not be managed by lawsuit. Those considerations must continue to be protected. 
   I agree very strongly with the principle that intelligence community whistleblowers should be protected from reprisal, and would look forward to working with the Oversight and Government Reform Committee to accomplish this goal. However, until those changes are made, and those issues are addressed, I would encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank the gentlelady for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, let's be clear of the purpose of today. We face a real test of what this House of Representatives stands for and who we, as Representatives, really are. 
   Do any of us really believe that the resolution in front of us today is a serious piece of legislation? Does it properly recognize all of America's military and other national security professionals who defend us day and night? What of the hundreds of folks in the Intelligence Community that are ignored in this resolution, who each and every day are working hand in hand with our Armed Forces trying to achieve success in Iraq? 
   Does this resolution discuss or force a debate on the really tough issues of who it is that hates America and others so much that they are willing to kill innocent men, women and children? Again, this resolution comes up short. 
   What is the threat, and how should America respond? That is the debate that we should be having on this floor. This resolution is all about staying the course. It says, Support our troops and don't engage in new tactics; just keep going down the same path. That is not good enough. 
   There are people who hate us enough to want to kill. I speak of militant Islam's hate for America, a hate that extends to others, including Muslims. And these militant Islamists kill, they kill violently and indiscriminately, but this resolution is silent on the threat that we face as a Nation, and it is silent on how we should respond. 
   Who are these radical Islamists, and what should America's response to this threat be? We face this on a global basis. What is America's response to jihadism? How will America win this war against this calculating enemy? And how will America lead the world once again in the face of such a ruthless threat? 
   The resolution that we are debating today simply asks, Do you support America's fighting men and women, and do you support or oppose a tactic in a battle that is only one front in the war with these military jihadists who are bent on the destruction of the infidel America and others around the world. 
   Let me say to my colleagues that I don't believe I am wrong in saying that this debate is really about whether or not America is a great Nation that leads in the face of difficulty. Nor do I believe that I am wrong to question what actually happens when this debate and vote are over. Have we really helped the American people understand the threat? What message do we send to our troops in harm's way? And what is it that the American public needs to understand so that it can better understand the challenges that we face? My own answer, Mr. Speaker, was that we need to understand the consequences of failure. We need to fully understand the nature of the threat that is posed now, and moreover in the future, if we fail in the larger war against militant Islam. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me outline some things about this very real threat to our very existence that needs to be known by the American public and, indeed, this body. This is not a global war on terror. I have never liked that term, I don't know why we keep using it. This is a global war with jihadists. We are not at war with a tactic, we are at war with a group of militant Islamists who hate us and who hate much of the rest of the world. What is a jihadist, other than someone or some group so full of hate that they are willing to kill? 
   I have a passion for understanding this threat. And thanks to a great deal of superb research done by many experts on the subject, in particular the author Mary Habeck, we have been enlightened as to who these individuals are, and perhaps also get an insight into the question of why do they hate, and why do they hate so much that they are willing to kill. 
   I can tell you that these militant Islamist jihadists are a fringe element of Islam who have very specific ideas about how to revive Islam, return Muslims to world power, and how to deal with their enemies. They are committed to a violent overthrow of the existing international system, and to its replacement by an all-encompassing Islamist state, the Caliphate. 
   Mr. Speaker, in studying this threat, this militant Islamic jihadist threat, we must also understand why Iraq is such an important element of their war against the West. This is where the letter from al Qaeda's number two leader, Zawahari, to the late al Zarqawi outlining the Islamic Caliphate that would stretch from Indonesia across the Middle East and Africa is instructive. In that letter, Zawahari outlines a four-stage plan to create this religious empire. 
   Stage one. ``Expel the Americans from Iraq.'' Expel them in defeat. I fear that this debate may be the first step in that process. 
   Stage two is to create an Islamic religious government in the old Mesopotamia, that is, Iraq, developing it and supporting it ``until it achieves the 
   level of a Caliphate,'' until it fills the void stemming from the departure of the Americans. 
   Step three is to extend the jihad way to secular countries neighboring Iraq. The jihadists will attack heretic Muslims, as they define them. 
   And stage four is the clash with Israel, because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity. 
   Let's be clear about this. This jihad is about them. It is about their god, their religion, before it becomes anything about anyone or anything else. That's right, it is about them before it is about us. 
   The militant jihadists believe that Islam worked well for over a thousand years, spreading a true gospel, a unified society that followed the Shari'a, a law handed down by God. They believe that the modern world has forsaken that pure religious life, and they believe that only in a Caliphate governed by the Shari'a is the way to return to that pure life. 
   This is the world that they now want to recreate and force on the rest of the world. That is why they are fighting and that is why they are killing. They see today's world as one where unbelievers, the United States, Japan and others, dominate politically, culturally, militarily and economically. This directly assaults their religious beliefs, as in effect, much if not all of the world is controlled by unbelievers, unbelievers who must be destroyed, including secular Muslim states in the region. 
   To illustrate, let me quote from Osama bin Laden's Fatwa. Listen to what these people tell themselves and each other: ``There is no more important duty than pushing the American enemy out of the Holy Land, no other priority, except Belief, could be considered before it. There is no precondition for this duty, and the enemy should be fought with one's best abilities. If it is not possible to push back the enemy except by the collective movement of the Muslim people, then there is a duty on the Muslims to ignore the minor differences among themselves. Even the military personnel who are not practicing Islam are not exempted from the duty of jihad against the enemy.'' 
   It should be clearly understood that a central tenet of jihadists' beliefs is the belief that God is one; he has no equals, he has no partners. This is important. If one believes that God is one and all that matters of rule giving or law making belongs to him, no human being, no government could make laws or alter the Shari'a laws of God. This would be, for all intents, setting oneself up to be the equal of God. Herein lies the problem that these militant Islamists have with the West and secular Muslim countries. This belief is applied equally to infidels and Muslim heretics. 
   The bottom line is that any government or order of law other than Shari'a is illegitimate. This belief, in their minds, justifies the killing of heretical  Muslims and non-Muslims alike. This is not recent thinking. A prominent early 20th century Egyptian Muslim ideologue named Hasan al Banna professed this point about Muslims and nonMuslim heretics. He stated, quote, we will not stop at this point, but we will pursue this evil force to its own land, invade its western heartland, and struggle to overcome it until all the world shouts the name of the Prophet and the teachings of Islam are spread throughout the world. All religion will be exclusively for Allah. 
   He went on to say that this violence would not be to avenge wrong suffered, nor to kill the unbelievers, but to save mankind from its many problems. Are we starting to get a picture of who the enemy may be? It is also important that jihadists' interpretation of Islam is they will reject any system of laws not based on Shari'a. 
   Democracy. Why do they hate us? Democracy, he claimed, is the ultimate expression of idolatry, giving reason for the hatred of Western values. This is about them, it is not about us. 
   Al Banna is not the only studied ideologue. Another name, Sayyid Qutb, wrote, ``Islam has a mandate to order the whole of human life, and that the Western idea of separation between religion and the rest of life is, quote, a hideous schizophrenia that would lead to the downfall of white civilization and therefore its replacement by Islam.'' 
   Qutb maintained that political and religious ideology of the jihadist is derived directly from the Koranic argument that God, unique and without partner, is the only being of sovereignty. Therefore, the only role for national leaders is to implement God's laws. This gives the jihadists their belief that attacking secular or Muslim heretic societies is justified. Qutb basically justified all-out warfare on all of these societies. 
   Where does that leave us today? It leaves us with a discussion that should be much deeper than the resolution that is in front of us. The resolution in front of us is a shallow political document. 
   Let me return to Osama bin Laden's Fatwa against the West. Let me use his own words. In calling on all Muslims, he says, ``The explosions at Riyadh and Al-Khobar is a warning of this volcanic eruption emerging.'' 
   To further his murderous goals, bin Laden then went on to outline the terrorist approach to his holy war to by saying, ``It must be obvious to you that due to the imbalance of power between our Armed Forces and the enemy forces, a suitable means of fighting must be adopted, i.e., using fast-moving light forces that work under complete secrecy; in other words, to initiate a guerrilla warfare where the sons of the nation, and not the military forces, take part in it. And as you know, it is wise, in the present circumstances, for the armed military forces not to be engaged in conventional fighting with the forces of the crusader enemy, unless a big advantage is likely to be achieved and great losses induced on the enemy side. That will help to expel the defeated enemy from the country.'' 
   He goes on, ``Therefore, efforts should be concentrated on destroying, fighting and killing the enemy until, by the grace of Allah, it is completely defeated. The time will come, by the permission of Allah, when you will perform your decisive role so that the word of Allah will be supreme and the word of the infidels will be the inferior. You will hit with iron fists against the aggressors.'' 
   The modern words of bin Laden alone do not adequately explain the current militant Islamic threat to the United States and its friends around the world. Again in their own words, this quote from a senior al Qaeda leader, quote, Islam became to be the only hope in jihad under the banner of Islam to become a solution for all of the enemies of America and of those weakened nations, even to the leftist and peace groups in the Christian world. Whoever follows the writings of some of the Western authors will find that some of them started to declare, through their writings, about the American tyranny, that there is no hope to face America other than through the armed Muslims. To the extent that in one of the demonstrations that included hundreds of thousands against globalization and war in Italy, the demonstrations carried a picture of bin Laden placing Che Guevara's hat on it, drawing him to be a Che Guevara look-alike. They wrote under his picture, ``anti-American.'' Through this action they expressed that the symbol of today's Islamic jihad is the only solution to face America.     
   Mr. Speaker, here is the true threat to America and the West: this militant Islamic jihad, a jihad that spans the globe, including attacks in Bali; in Spain; the United Kingdom; in the Philippines; in Kashmir; in Kenya; in Jordan; Israel; Nigeria; and, yes, in the United States and Iraq. What is not being discussed is this global problem, this threat to peace and stability everywhere in the world. Why, I ask, is the focus so keenly on Iraq as the problem, the only problem for us to debate? Iraq is not the problem. It is but one front in this larger war. The American people are not being well served by our leaders and the media that are solely focused on the conflict in Iraq. This is but a single front in a much larger war. 
   Mr. Speaker, let me close with these final thoughts about the militant Islamic threat we face not only in the front in Iraq but, indeed, around the world, including here in America. 
   There is a fundamental clash of civilizations at work here. There is a fundamental belief by the jihadis that Islam must expand to fill the entire world or else falsehood in its many guises will do so. This belief includes their facts that democracy, liberalism, human rights, personal freedoms, international law, international institutions are illegal, illegitimate, and sinful. Democracy, and in particular the United States democracy, is the focus of their wrath because it is considered the center of liberalism. This is not an enemy with whom we can negotiate. We must contain them and defeat them. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us does not address this threat, a real threat to our very existence. We are at war, and I fear we don't even know that we are under attack. This myopic resolution does not recognize or address that threat. 
   I urge my colleagues and the House to vote ``no'' on this resolution.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Do any of us really believe that the resolution in front of us today is a serious piece of legislation? 
   Does it discuss or force a debate on the really tough issue of how big this conflict is? 
   Who is it that hates America and others so much that they are willing to kill innocent men, women and children? 
   Again, it does not do that. There are people who hate us enough to want to kill. I speak of militant Islam's hate for America, a hate that extends to others as well, including Muslims. And these militant Islamists kill. They kill violently and indiscriminately. 
   Who are they? 
   What should America's response to this threat that we and others face on a global basis be? 
   What is America's response to jihadism? 
   How will America win this war against this calculating enemy? 
   How will America lead the world, once again, in the face of such a ruthless threat? 
   What is a jihadist, other than someone or some group so full of hate that they are willing to kill?     
   I have a passion for understanding this threat. These Islamic jihadists are a fringe element of Islam who have very specific ideas about how to revive Islam, return Muslims to world power, and how to deal with their enemies. They are committed to a violent overthrow of the existing international system and to its replacement by an all-encompassing Islamic state, the caliphate, as it is called. 
   This is more than just about Iraq. It is a much bigger problem. It is also clear that this jihad is about them, their god, their religion before it becomes anything about anyone or anything else. That is right, it is about them before it is about us. And that is why this resolution comes up so short because it does not address all of these issues. 
   Madam Speaker, I would like to yield to my colleague from California (Mr. Campbell).

We don't see a discussion of what the global threat is from these jihadists who hate democracy, who hate other heretic Muslim states, who want to establish this caliphate that spreads throughout the Middle East, spreads into Europe, across Africa, into Asia. It lacks the concept of putting it into a bigger picture. 
   There is no alternative plan. Really, if you vote for this resolution, what you are voting for is you are voting for stay the course. Support the troops; don't try a new strategy or tactic.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. As I said, as we deal with this bill, 18 days is a long time, yet the leadership of this House still has done nothing to appoint conferees on the Senate bill to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which passed the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support and is supported by a majority of the House. The Democratic leadership continues to block this bill, even though a number of responsible Democrats support it and the bill will pass if brought to the floor. 
   It was 18 days ago, it was 3 weeks ago that it was brought to the floor to have a 3-week extension, on top of a 2-week extension, on top of a 6-month extension. It is time to move this bill forward and to again give our intelligence community the tools that they need, the enhanced tools that many recognized after 9/11 that the intelligence community needed to keep America safe. It is time to bring up the Senate-passed FISA bill. 
   In the 18 days since the expiration of the Protect America Act, we have already seen multiple examples where our country's ability to follow up on potential threats has been significantly impaired. 
   In Tampa, the Transportation Security Administration stopped a man trying to board a plane with a box cutter in his backpack. Officers also found books in the backpack titled ``Muhammad in the Bible,'' ``The Prophet's Prayer,'' and ``The Noble Qur'an.'' There may be instances in that situation where there may be intelligence clues that we would want to follow up. We want to know whether there are any connections to foreign terrorists and whether at that very moment there may be other people in other airports trying to board planes with box cutters. 
   We don't want our intelligence officials to have to wait for lawyers to fill out voluminous paperwork in order to obtain permission from a Federal judge to follow up on those leads. Precious time could have been lost while an attack was in progress. 
   Last Friday, authorities found toxic ricin, or perhaps toxic ricin, in a hotel room in Las Vegas. Absent any evidence in the hotel room to prove probable cause that the ricin was tied to international terrorists, it may have been impossible for the intelligence community to follow up on any evidence that may have pointed to a suspected tie with foreign terrorists. 
   These are the things that happen in the United States. When you take a look at other things that are happening around the world, our troops in harm's way in both Iraq and Afghanistan, our brave men and women who are serving in the embassies in the Foreign Service around the world today, it is important that our intelligence community be given the tools and the techniques to keep Americans, our servicemen, our embassies, and our foreign personnel safe. 
   It has now been 18 days. The majority promised us that they could deal with this issue, first they said in 6 months, then they said in 2 weeks, then they said in 3 weeks. It has clearly been much more time than that, and every day that we delay, we lose a little bit of our capability to track the threats that face this country. 
   The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee has said the same thing. The Director of National Intelligence has said the same thing. So now for 18 days our capabilities have slowly been eroding, but each day piles on to the loss that we had from the day before. 
   There are real threats out there. There are real threats to Americans, to our troops, and to other individuals serving overseas. It is time to make sure that our intelligence community has all of the tools that it needs to keep America safe. We need to join with the Senate. We need to join with the 68 in the other body who overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan FISA modernization bill that gives the intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe. 
   I call on my colleagues and the leadership on the other side of the aisle to support this motion to recommit, to send a clear signal, and then to move forward on an overall bill. Because if this passes today, what it will do is send a clear signal.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 89, which expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as Dutch American Friendship Day. 
   On April 19, 2007, the United States and the Netherlands will mark 225 years of unbroken diplomatic relations. It is the United States' longest existing diplomatic relationship. 
   My parents emigrated to the United States from the Netherlands when I was 3 years old. I am deeply proud of my Dutch heritage and feel that I have a special connection to both countries. As Russell Shorto notes in ``The Island at the Center of the World,'' Americans are indebted to the culture of tolerance that was present in 17th-century Dutch Manhattan, where men and women of diverse races and religions lived in relative peace for the first time in the New World. 
   Dutch ideals such as individuality, freedom, hard work, and human rights have flourished in the United States; and our two countries can and have worked together to confront common challenges to our very similar societies. Last year, my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Chris Van Hollen, and I created a bipartisan Congressional Caucus on the Netherlands, a group that I hope will deepen our understanding of the ways in which we can continue to keep working together as allies for the mutual benefit of our countries. 
   The United States and the Dutch have proven to be outstanding allies, allies for over 200 years. The Netherlands was the first country to salute the American flag after the Revolutionary War. It was one of the first to assist the United States and recognize the threat from radical militant Islamists and has graciously provided Members of Congress and others with critical access to their unique and innovative perspective on water management and flood protection in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. 
   Put simply, the value of the relationship between our two countries and the opportunities that exist to learn from each other should be deeply appreciated and recognized. 
   I encourage all Members to support H. Res. 89 to honor Dutch and American friendship and celebrate the historic ties between our countries

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding.  
   I think they are absolutely right, we need to take a look at this in the bigger context. We have to set the stage for how we got to this point. 
   It's September 12, 2001. The President is meeting with his advisers. They're trying to identify exactly what this threat is from al Qaeda, how serious is this threat, what other activities or attacks might they be planning against the United States. And the President says: I need my intelligence and military folks to get the answers to these kinds of questions. Tell me what the threat is and tell me what the tools are that I need to implement to keep America safe. 
   They come back with a series of recommendations, saying here's what we know, here's what we don't know about the threat. They come back and say, here are the different options that are available to us to get the information that might be able to answer some of these questions. 
   The President and his leadership team consider the various options. They say, you know, we need to bring Congress into this to take a look at exactly what tools we're going to implement and make sure that we do this in a bipartisan basis and we do it in a basis that is consistent with American values and American law. 
   On October 25, the President and Vice President convene a meeting. The President's national security team comes up and they say, here's the tool that perhaps can be used. The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is there. The Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee is there. The ranking minority member of HPSCI is at the meeting. She's accompanied by the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. That's right. Back in October of 2001, the Speaker of the House was briefed on the various tools that could be used to keep America safe. 
   November 14, 2 1/2 weeks later, the chairman of HPSCI, the ranking member, yeah, that's right, the current Speaker of the House, was briefed on the tools that were available and could be used, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the vice chairman. 
   March of 2002, the chairman of HPSCI, the ranking minority member of HPSCI, that's right, the current Speaker of the House, was in the meeting. 
   June of 2002, the chairman of HPSCI, the ranking minority member of HPSCI, that's right, again, the current Speaker of the House is brought in, is briefed on this program, and said this is the tool that we want to use, this is the tool that we need to use to keep America safe. 
   Four times in about 9 months, the current Speaker of the House was briefed on this program, about what the tool was, the kind of information that we were expecting to get and, after a period of time, the information that we were collecting that would keep America safe. 
   I was not in those meetings. I was not one of the select group of people that was informed. You would think that they would say, what are the civil liberty implications of this? You know, how are we using these tools? Where does it fit within the legal framework of America to keep us safe? And who's going to be working on this program? Who do we need to partner with? And there might have been certain companies or individuals that were identified as saying, these folks are going to partner with us and have partnered with us because they can help provide us with the information that will keep us safe and do it in a legal way. 
   Since that time, and since this program became public, there has been all kinds of accusations out there. But the bottom line is, there may have been people, there may have been companies and corporations that, when the President and Congress went to them and said, we need your help to keep America safe, they may have stepped up to the plate and provided us with the assistance that we knew that on a bipartisan basis the executive branch and Congress said, we need to do this, and we need to do it in a way that protects civil liberties, and we need to do it in a way that is legal and consistent within the law. 
   And the bottom line is, this is dealt with in the Senate bill. They recognized the help. They don't throw these people under the bus after we asked them to help.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Speaker, what we try to do in the Intelligence Committee is to define the threat that is out there. We know that radical jihadists, al Qaeda, that it is a real threat. We attempt to provide our intelligence community with the tools that are necessary to give us, as policymakers, and others the information that is necessary to keep America safe. And at least some of us are in the business of prevention, making sure that there is not another successful attack against the United States; others are in the mode of, well, let another attack, if it happens, we want to be in a position to prosecute. 
   When we get down to FISA, I went through this earlier, October 25, 2001; November 14, 2001; March 5, 2002; June 12, 2002, Members of the House of Representatives were briefed on this program. Our Speaker of the House was briefed on this program, understanding what the program was, or hopefully understanding or at least asking the questions to get understanding about what the program was, what it intended to do, and the kind of information it was going to get, and the legal boundaries, the legal ramifications, and who was participating in these programs. 
   Now what they want to do and some want to do is throw these companies that were the Good Samaritans that decided they were going to help us, just throw them under the bus, even though, on a bipartisan basis, the legislative branch and the executive branch asked these folks and decided that these were the things that needed to be done. 
   The impact of this is this is having a chilling effect on all of those individuals and corporations that, from time to time, are being asked to help to keep us safe. It is like saying we saw what you did to these other folks. We are not going to be next. We are going to have to wield a fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders.  
   Again, it is the tradition and the experience and background of what some want to do to the intelligence community. Under President Clinton, there were massive cuts in the intelligence community. We devastated the community through the Deutch doctrine, where we cut back on human assets. And now we are doing it again. We won't give the intelligence community the tools that they need. We focus on global warming and we focus on partisan investigations. That will not keep America safe. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, today is day 12, day 12 of diminished capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community to go out and get the information that they need to collect to keep America safe. 
   Our National Director of Intelligence, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee all have said that with the failure of the House to act on restoring and approving a FISA modernization bill America's capabilities erode each and every day. 
   So what is the House going to do today? S. 2478, naming a post office; S. 2272, naming a post office. The third bill we'll consider today, naming a post office. The fourth bill, naming a post office. We'll do four other noncontroversial bills. 
   And then what we will do? Will we take up FISA modernization? No, we will do the same thing we did 2 weeks ago: we will go home. 
   The schedule for Friday? On Friday, no votes are expected. Our capabilities will diminish for 4 more days. 
   ``House Democrats In a Perilous Game,'' is what The Republican of Springfield, Massachusetts, said. ``The House let a crucial deadline come and go without even taking a vote on this matter.'' 
   America's at greater risk because this House continues to fail to act.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (CONGRATULATING THE GRAND VALLEY STATE UNIVERSITY LAKERS FOR WINNING THE 2006 NCAA DIVISION II FOOTBALL NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - January 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank my colleague from Virginia for bringing forward this resolution today. I think it is a wonderful opportunity to educate the colleague from Virginia on the talents that we have in the State of Michigan, especially in western Michigan. I am excited to see how well versed he has become about the Grand Valley State University football team. As he indicated, we rise today to congratulate the student athletes on the Grand Valley State University Lakers 2006 football team. 
   On December 16, 2006, the Lakers football team won the NCAA Division II football national championship by defeating the Northwest Missouri State University Bearcats 17-14. The Grand Valley State University football program has now won championships in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006. 
   The victory capped another storybook season for Coach Chuck Martin. He has coached his team to a 23-3 record, including a 10-1 post-season record after assuming coaching responsibility after a successful stint as the Lakers' defensive coordinator. 
   The Grand Valley State University seniors finished their 4-year run with the Lakers with a 52-4 record, making them the all-time winningest senior class in all of NCAA history.     
   Grand Valley student athletes have displayed great strength, ability and resolve during the 2006 season. They have made the great State of Michigan proud once again. 
   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support the passage of H. Res. 62. 
   Mr. Speaker, I include for the RECORD the full roster of this national championship team and their coaching staff.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, a bill that burdens our troops with conditions and dangerous timetables while simultaneously rewarding politicians with heaping helpings of pork.     
   Providing full funding to our troops standing in the breach in the war against militant radical Islamists should be easy, and it should come without strings attached. 
   The bill before us today sends a terrible message to our brave men and women in the Armed Forces, those who are serving our Nation in harm's way, and gives radical jihadists vital intelligence on potential future troop plans and intentions of the U.S. rather than offering a clean bill with emergency funding for our troops in combat, or allowing an up-or-down vote on the Sam Johnson bill that pledges Congress will not cut off funds for our troops on the front lines. 
   We are being forced to consider a muddled supplemental, replete with pork-barrel spending, risky timetables and other items that do nothing to ensure America's success in the long-term war against radical militant Islam. 
   Rather than the House debating how to win the war against radical militant Islam, with a focus on the current fronts in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are engaged in political theater and not debating national security. 
   The bill before us ties the hands of our military commanders with timetables and measurements that supposedly force troop withdrawal, yet the bill before us contains provisions for targeting al Qaeda and training Iraqi security forces that could leave thousands of troops behind without the authority or the funding to take the fight to enemy insurgents. This is not a good plan. It is not a good place to be. Let's be committed to defeating radical militant Islam, and let's do it today. Vote ``no'' on this bill.

Have they not seen the reports coming from Iraq where al Qaeda in Iraq has now stated that their objective is to use Iraq to launch attacks against Jerusalem and Israel? Have they not read the reports today about a radical Islamist plot to perhaps assassinate the President of the Philippines? Have they not read about the attacks or the arrests in Denmark of radical Islamists perhaps planning an attack in Denmark? 
   What is it that you don't understand about the nature of the threat, that this is a global threat that wants to defeat us in Iraq, that wants to destabilize modern Islamic regimes, wants to eliminate the State of Israel, establish the caliphate and reach for the brass ring, which is to attack the United States? Why are you unwilling to put the Senate FISA bill on the floor and give the intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, we leave today for the President's Day Recess. We leave at a time where we have our troops committed in Iraq, we have our troops committed in Afghanistan, where, in the last 48 hours there have been reports that radical Islamists have perhaps been plotting an attack to assassinate the President of the Philippines, where al Qaeda in Iraq has said that they are going to launch new attacks or additional attacks against Israel, against Jerusalem, where there have been arrests in Denmark of individuals perhaps planning to assassinate, murder the cartoonists, their declaration of war by Hezbollah. 
   And we're going back home without extending the Protect America Act. It's unilateral disarmament. The head of our intelligence community has said that the Protect America Act, that the authorities provided under FISA have been the tip of the spear in keeping America safe. 
   But it is not only about keeping America safe, because the information, the intelligence that we have gathered under the Protect America Act, under FISA, over the last 6 years have kept America safe, but has also enabled us to identify threats and potential attacks against our allies. 
   And what this now does, this unilateral disarmament, means that an important tool in keeping America safe and our allies safe expires on Saturday night. 
   If you take a look at what's happened here, it's the day after September 11. The President, meeting with his national security team, they're looking for ways to identify exactly what the other threats are against the United States, what the capabilities of al Qaeda are. They come back with some  suggestions and ideas, one of which is to use our telecommunications folks, perhaps, and others, to get information and insights into al Qaeda and to radical jihadists. 
   Members of Congress are brought in. The current Speaker of the House was briefed four times, I believe, within the first 8 months in terms of what we were going to do, what we expected to collect and how that would keep us safe. And today, these folks are thrown under the bus. 
   This unilateral disarmament makes America less safe. The President has said, I'm willing to stay until Congress completes its work. I'm willing to postpone or delay a trip to Africa that's been in the planning stages for a long time so that Congress can complete its work. I'm willing to work with Congress to make that happen. 
   The Senate did their job. Senator Rockefeller was being briefed at the same time, 6 years ago, that the current Speaker of the House was briefed. He recognizes the responsibility that they have and that the Senate has to making sure that America keeps these tools in the hands of our intelligence community. They did the right thing. Overwhelmingly, the other body passed a bill that keeps America safe, bipartisan, protecting those who helped our government to stay, to put in place the mechanisms to keep us safe over the last 6 years. 
   And now, the House walks away from this for the next 12 days. And each day that we are gone, our ability to monitor radical jihadists and the threats to the United States begins to erode just a little bit each and every day. But every time we identify potentially a new threat to the United States, we need to go back through a cumbersome process, one that ties the hands of our intelligence community. As al Qaeda and radical jihadists have evolved, and they're becoming more coordinated and more effective in planning attacks against the United States, we're moving back and we're degrading and we are unilaterally disarming. 
   It is a disappointment and a disgrace that this House is leaving today without finishing this business.

   I look forward to working with my colleagues on crafting permanent legislation. 
   Statement by the Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Mike McConnell 
   I have reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House proposal is unacceptable, and I strongly oppose it. 
   The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment. 
   I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I provided last evening to modify FISA and to equip our Intelligence Community with the tools we need to protect our Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - March 11, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, this bill is just the latest example of the complete and utter failure of the Democratic leadership in the House to give the intelligence community the tools that it needs to protect the American people and our allies from radical jihadists who have sworn to wage holy war against freedom in order to impose a radical religious tyranny. I urge my colleagues to oppose this override of the President's veto. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are finding out how tough it is to pass legislation in the intelligence area. But the lesson they need to learn, this is about national security, and national security issues need to be done on a bipartisan basis, can not be done on a purely partisan basis. 
   The debate on this authorization bill is not about a single issue, as some would have you believe. It is about the need to ensure that we give the right tools to our intelligence professionals in this time of enhanced threat. What we should be talking about today is improving this bill so that it can have broad bipartisan support. 
   But we also ought to be talking about FISA, FISA modernization. That is the vote that this House should be considering. That is the tool that our intelligence community has said that they need to keep America safe. That is the tool that, on a broad bipartisan basis, the model for how we should be doing legislation in this area. It's how they did it in the Senate, 68 Senators on a bipartisan basis saying we need to do FISA reform. We need to do it to keep America safe, to keep our homeland safe, to keep our troops safe, to keep our embassies and our personnel overseas safe, and to make sure that we also have the tools in place that so many of our allies rely on to keep them safe. 
   But no, once again, this House moves in a partisan basis. It's been almost 25 days now that the leadership on the other side of the aisle has refused to even bring up for a vote FISA modernization. Each and every day, our capabilities in this area erode. One of the most important and one of the most successful tools that we have used to keep America safe over the last 7 years is slowly eroding. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not even allow it to come up for a vote. 
   The United States continues to employ tough antiterrorist programs because the radical jihadist threat did not end with 9/11. One only has to listen to the statements by bin Laden, his deputy, Zawahiri, to understand the seriousness of this threat, its global implications, and the determination of radical jihadists to strike the American homeland.  
   But instead of doing a bipartisan, national security issue, we continue to move down the path of partisan politics. The majority leadership of this House refuses to see or hear the continuing threat from radical jihadists. Even more troubling, the majority refuses to recognize that tough antiterrorist tools employed since 2001 have protected this country from terrorist attacks.     
   Instead, some have distorted anti-terrorist programs as threats to the American people rather than tools that our intelligence agencies are using to protect us from threats of radical jihadist terrorism. Instead of helping to strengthen anti-terrorist tools, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have established a clear patent of trying to undermine and erode them, undermining and eroding the very type of people that we should be trying to help with this bill, the men and women who risk their lives each and every day in the intelligence community to keep America safe. 
   There is no better example than the outright refusal of the majority leadership to allow a straight up-or-down vote on bipartisan FISA modernization legislation. 
   Again, this is a bill that passed the Senate overwhelmingly, clearly supported by a majority of this House. There's ample reason to be concerned about this abuse of the majority's powers. I'm far more concerned at the impact that these actions are continuing to have and the capabilities of our intelligence professionals to protect our country, our people, and our allies from attack. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's interesting that this debate is about something that hasn't been done for 5 years. What we need to be talking about is what we haven't been able to do for the last 30 days. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about a technique and a procedure that hasn't been used for 5 years, but they're unwilling to talk about the technique that enables us to identify what terrorists may have planned for the United States. 
   They don't want to address giving the tools to Americans who work in the intelligence community that have proven to be effective. They're willing to give our playbook to al Qaeda, but at the same time they've taken away our most effective tool, to try to determine exactly what al Qaeda may be up to. It is probably the most glaring deficiency in this bill, but there are many others. 
   It fails to provide adequate resources for human intelligence. The earmarks we've heard about. It fails to constrain the size of the intelligence bureaucracy. It fails to rationalize how we're going to put the intelligence community together. And then, interestingly enough, it continues the misplaced priorities. 
   We are unwilling to deal with FISA. We are unwilling to give that tool to our intelligence community, but we feel that it's more than appropriate to tell our intelligence community to go out and conduct a formal assessment of ``national security,'' the national security aspects of global warming. 
   Our intelligence professionals in the field need to be really wondering what's going on in the House, where they've now watched us for 30 days avoiding dealing with the tough issue that has proven to be so effective in keeping America safe, and at the same time we're arguing here, and the majority is arguing that, forget about surveilling al Qaeda and radical jihadists, take your resources and study national security aspects of global warming, although there's many other agencies that already work on that. 
   So, shelve FISA. As a matter of fact, don't even talk about FISA. Don't even bring it to the floor. Don't do any work on it. Don't put any proposals out there. Have no bipartisan discussions on where we go with FISA. Leave that on the shelf. Let our capabilities erode. Go out and study global warming. 
   What are the priorities of this House? How are we going to keep America safe when we, on one hand, handcuff our intelligence community, and on the other hand, we're telling them go out and study the national security aspects of global warming? 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Again, the debate is about a bill that the President has outlined in his veto statement is deeply flawed, deeply flawed in the content of what is in the bill as to what it directs the President to do and the limitations that it places on the executive branch in being able to conduct the war against radical jihadists effectively. 
   But it's also clear that the message clearly outlines the deficiencies of what is not in the bill: the inability and unwillingness of the Democratic leadership to bring to the House the Senate-passed FISA modernization bill; a bill that reflects the values of the Speaker of the House; a bill that reflects the values of the current Speaker of the House when she was on the Intelligence Committee in 2001 when these discussions were under way that talked about what do we need to do to give our intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe so that we can better understand the plans, the intentions, and the capabilities of al Qaeda and other radical jihadists. 
   That is where the Terrorist Surveillance Program took root. Bipartisan, the President, the leadership of the House and the Senate, the leadership of the Intelligence Committees, and all of them united in saying we need to give this tool, this Terrorist Surveillance Program, to our intelligence community because it will allow us to collect the information, the data, that we can use to keep America safe. And that program was in place for over 5 years. It was in place and it proved to be very successful. And now for 30 days, almost 30 days, we've been unable to use that tool. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   I applaud my colleagues for speaking with such passion. I wish they had the same passion for addressing the tools that the leadership in the intelligence community have said that they have needed, that our intelligence professionals who are in the field have said that they have needed to keep America safe. And this leadership has been unwilling to bring it up for almost 30 days. 
   The tool that they want, the tool that they need, and the tool that has proven to be so effective is the Terrorist Surveillance Program, which is an updated version of FISA legislation. It takes the FISA legislation, it moves it forward, and it updates it. But for almost 30 days, that tool has been eroding, putting our troops at risk, putting our homeland at greater risk, putting other U.S. personnel who are oversees at greater risk, and putting our allies who depend so often on the work of our intelligence community, putting them at greater risk. As al Qaeda in Iraq has said they want to attack Jerusalem, as Hezbollah has said that they intend to retaliate for the death of Mughniyah 3 or 4 weeks ago, as the radicals seek to destabilize the regimes in the Middle East of modern Islamic countries, people that are working with us in the war and the threat against radical jihadists, our answer to them is we're going to curtail our intelligence activities, and as a result, you will be at greater risk because we are going to be of less assistance. We are not going to be able to give you the intelligence that you've been receiving for the last 5 years because our techniques are limited. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   The Detainee Treatment Act, 2005, prohibits cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, the standard found in the convention against torture. It applies to anyone held by U.S. authorities. We have dealt with that issue. We dealt with it in 2005. 
   What my colleagues don't want to talk about is they don't want to talk about the other weaknesses in this bill. And it's clear, by what their actions have been for the last 4 weeks, they don't want to talk about FISA. 
   As my former ranking member has indicated, it is tough to pass an authorization bill. It is tough to pass legislation. She and I worked together and passed, with our colleagues in the Senate, an Intelligence Reform Act, which in many ways has worked and in some ways we need to go back and take a look at. But one of the things that we learned through that process is to make it work, you need to do it on a bipartisan basis. 
   The problem with this bill is that it is a partisan bill. It passed the Senate with a very narrow majority. It passed the House on a partisan vote. That's not how you're going to get it done. You're going to do it the same way that the Senate has done the FISA bill. 
   But the interesting thing is the model for getting something done, which is a bipartisan bill, which is what we did on intelligence reform, we had Republicans and Democrats who came together to make it a majority; and we also had Republicans and Democrats who opposed us, and it was sometimes very painful. Now, when the Senate has gone through that process and passed a bipartisan bill on FISA, the model, 27 Democrats, 41 Republicans coming together and modernizing FISA, the end result is this leadership on the House side refuses to deal with it. It's on every intelligence issue that we've dealt with in this Congress. 
   When it comes to national security, when it comes to intelligence, there is not an ounce of compromise. It's all about getting everything, and that's why the President vetoed this bill, because it is not a bipartisan bill. There are many weaknesses in it. 
   All the focus on their side is torture. Talk about FISA, which makes a real difference to our men and women in the intelligence community today. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I will yield myself 1 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, it's interesting, as we go through this process and we talk about what's in the bill, the provision that we are talking about, or at least the other side is talking about, is a provision that was dropped in in conference. It came from the Senate. It didn't come from the House. We ought to follow that model. Follow the leadership. 
   It's interesting, we follow the leadership here when it's a partisan vote coming from the Senate; but when it's a bipartisan effort from the Senate, the leadership on the Democratic side will not respond and will not follow.     
   On this bill, we are going to sustain the veto. It is a flawed bill through and through. It would be interesting for this House to do the right thing, to have a vote on a national security issue, the modernization of FISA, to bring that vote. I am very much afraid that we are going to go home Thursday or Friday of this week and we are going to go on a 2-week recess and, once again, we will not have dealt with the modernization of FISA. 
   That means that we will go through a period of 6, 7, 8 weeks of eroding capabilities, each and every day becoming more vulnerable to radical jihadists and other groups who want to harm America. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   It is interesting to talk about waterboarding. It hasn't been done for 5 years. It is interesting to talk about we are going to get rid of cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment. We did that in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005. It is prohibited, prohibited on any person that is held in U.S. custody. So it is easy to talk about those things. 
   It is time that the House start doing the hard stuff and the heavy lifting. That heavy lifting has now been put off for almost 4 weeks. And my fear is that we will leave without having resolved the issue between the House and the Senate, and we will go away for 2 more weeks because the House and the Democratic leadership refuses to do the heavy lifting and refuses to do the hard stuff. They are willing to go back and do the stuff that was done in 2005 and address issues that haven't occurred for over 5 years. But when it comes to keeping America safe and doing what is necessary and giving the tools to the intelligence community to keep us safe, leadership of this House is unwilling to act and is unwilling to do what is necessary.

It is too bad that there is no sense of urgency to give our individuals in the intelligence community the tools that they need to keep us safe. 
   The Senate has passed FISA. We should do the same thing. And we should do it before we go home. We need to start doing national security issues in a bipartisan basis. The longer we continue going down this path of making national security and intelligence issues purely partisan, some might call them purely political issues, we risk the security and the safety of the American people.

   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues today to sustain the President's veto. This is an ill-advised bill. This goes back to what we did in the 1990s, ``bugs and bunnies,'' telling our intelligence folks that it is time to focus your resources and your skills on studying the national security implications of global warming. 
   There are many problems with this bill. But the sense of urgency that we have in the intelligence community today is, as my colleague from California pointed out today, we are going to tell al Qaeda exactly what may happen. We are going to give them our playbook. And at the same time we have limited our ability to listen to radical jihadists. 
   It is now 26, 27, 28 days since FISA, or the Protect America Act, has expired. How many more days will my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  wait before they take up this legislation from the Senate? Will it be one more day? Will it be three more days? Will it be two more weeks? Will it be two more months? How much greater do you want to increase the risk to the homeland, to our allies, to our troops, before you act? 
   The Speaker of the House shortly after 9/11 agreed that we needed to act. It is beyond me why she doesn't want to act now and why we don't have that sense of urgency. It is time to bring FISA to the floor, and it is time to sustain the President's veto.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   What is this Congress thinking? Some of my colleagues are scaring the American people into believing that the men and women in the intelligence community are spying on them. In reality, our intelligence professionals are focused solely on identifying and stopping the threat from radical jihadists. 
   What's this Congress thinking? Some of my colleagues want to reward opportunist trial lawyers who are suing the very companies that stood up in America's hour of need. We should recognize what these companies did and protect them from these frivolous lawsuits. 
   What is this Congress thinking? Some of the key leadership in this House, including this current Speaker, were fully briefed and involved in developing the strategies that were implemented to keep America safe in the aftermath of 9/11. Now some are running from those decisions. They should take responsibility for their actions.     
   At the funerals last week for the victims of the recent terrorist attack in Jerusalem, Rabbi Shapira delivered a eulogy charging the government with not doing enough to keep Israel safe, for not delivering the strong leadership to face down a deadly enemy. That same enemy wants to attack America. 
   The 9/11 Commission said, ``Terrorists could acquire without great expense communications devices that were varied, global, instantaneous, complex, and encrypted.'' 
   As Rabbi Shapira last week questioned the leadership of his country, and in light of what the 9/11 Commission told us years ago, I ask the leadership of this House are we doing enough. 
   Is the 2001 FISA law adequate? The answer has been, and continues to be, a resounding ``no.'' 
   Are we doing enough to protect America, our troops, and our allies, when we go home without finishing this crucial work on intelligence surveillance? Is it acceptable to have our intelligence capabilities continue to erode? Continuing down this path is dangerous. 
   I hope that when we return, America will not have its own Rabbi Shapira, our own Rabbi Shapira asking, Why did Congress go home without finishing its work? Why didn't the Democratic Congress do better? Why didn't the House recognize the danger and the threat? 
   We should complete this work today. We should vote on the Senate bill. Why are we going home? Why are we going home with the work unfinished one more time?

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding. And as we go through the next period of time, we may have the opportunity to have more of a dialogue to talk a little bit about the energy issue and the challenges that we are facing as a Nation. 
   Of course you and I remember that early in August when Congress recessed, we were on this floor that Friday where a number of us had signed up for the opportunity to address our colleagues but most importantly to address the American people on the issue of energy. And we can sign up for 5 minutes, but our colleagues on the other side of the aisle said, ``No, we're going home,'' and they shut down debate. 
   We came to the floor. We continued talking on the floor as they turned down the lights, as they turned off C-SPAN as they attempted to lock the press from covering the issues as to exactly what was happening here on the floor of the House. 
   We continued that process for the next 5 weeks until Congress belatedly came back into session this past Monday. And as my colleague has indicated, we came back into session, and we've done no meaningful legislation. We haven't dealt with the issue of the threats of radical jihadists. We haven't dealt with health care, we haven't dealt with energy. Prices back in my district have again spiked up this week even though the price of oil has come down about 30 percent of its high of $147. You know, prices at the pump spiked back up this week 
   And for some people, the issue of energy is an inconvenience. Paying a little bit more or paying a lot more at the pump is an inconvenience to some people. But I can tell you in July, I spent a part of a morning at the gas station pumping gas. People would come in; I would help fill up their cars. They would fill out a survey for me. I would spend some time talking to them. And for a number of these people, filling up their tank is now a hardship. 
   And I think you and I would agree that we wish they had a proposal on the other side of the aisle. We wish that they would bring energy to the floor of the House for us to debate because this problem is only going to get worse. 
   I live in a northern State. Today my constituents are challenged with the price of filling up their gas tank, because I went through the district during August. I found people who drove as much as 40, 50, 60 miles one way to work. So they're putting on 80 to 100, 120 miles a day. Filling up their gas tank is a hardship. 
   In those same areas, when we get to November, December, January, they're  also going to get hit with home heating costs. A double whammy. They're going to fill up their pump or their car at the pump, and then they are going to have to go home and pay the heating bills for their house. And these folks are unwilling to build a plan to address that right here on the floor of the House. 
   Now, they went into a caucus today, and we see how they're writing their legislation. It's kind of like we're going to get a plan that can get 218 Democratic votes. They're not going to introduce a bill. They're not doing to take it to a subcommittee, have hearings on it, have people come in and say, you know, here is what we really like about your bill and what we think really works, and we think this may be a weakness. People proposing amendments, they vote on amendments, the bill gets better, it goes to full committee, you go through the same process, and it comes to the floor of the House where again, people like you and I who might not be on a committee of jurisdiction, if we've got a good idea or something that we think is a good idea, we have the opportunity to present it to our colleagues and have it voted on to see if it can be part of this final package. That's not the process they're going to use. 
   They're writing a bill in secret, and we have no idea what it is. And I would guess, you know, we thought maybe it would come out Friday. They're not going to hit that deadline. They're maybe coming out with a bill Monday or Tuesday. It will probably be a thousand pages, and they will say, Congresswoman, here it is. Here is our energy plan. Congressman, here it is. We will say, What is it? They will say, Read it. And it's like, whoa. 
   And we already know what it's going to be. We're for all-of-the-above: Exploration, drilling for American oil, natural gas, we're for conservation, we're for higher fuel efficiency standards and automobiles and those types of things. We're for alternative technology and investing in wind, solar, geothermal, and all of those types of things recognizing that to fix the problem on energy, we need an all-of-the-above solution because nuclear alone won't fix it, drilling alone won't fix it. T. Boone Pickens is right. We can't drill our way out of this problem. But we can help. 
   Right now one final comment, and then we can talk about this. 
   Sitting on the Intelligence Committee we know where we're getting the oil from. We get a lot from Canada, a lot from Mexico. These are two reliable allies, although there is some instability from Mexico. After that, the neighborhood gets to be pretty ugly. 
   Nigeria. Nigeria is a great country, but it has a tremendous amount of instability and corruption. 
   You then go to the Middle East. A lot of these folks are not our friends. 
   You then go to Russia. Ask the Georgians. Is Russia a reliable ally? Ask the people in Ukraine. Is Russia a reliable ally? Russia has started this. Russia, a couple of years ago, was the country that said, or through their policies, indicated that they were willing to use energy as a political tool by threatening to cut off natural gas to places like the Ukraine. And in many ways we're funding our enemies. 
   Bottom line on this. This year we will run about a $600 to $700 billion trade deficit. If we became energy independent, our trade deficit would approach zero. Trade deficit isn't manufacturing. It's none of these things. It's energy. And if we invest in that, we could move forward.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. If the gentlelady will yield for a minute. 
   I thought it was pretty interesting on the floor when the minority leader on the floor, Mr. Boehner from Ohio, was talking about a procedural vote here on the floor and said, ``Will you allow a vote on the American Energy Independence Bill?'' And the answer after he asked that question three or four times, the folks on that side of the aisle started saying, ``No, no, no,'' meaning they don't want to have a full and complete debate on energy. 
   What really makes me concerned is that they're going to throw up--we know what they're going to--we're for all-of-the-above. They're going to come out with a plan later on, who knows. I wouldn't even call it a plan. They will come out with a piece of paper, and as we dissect it, it will be none-of-the-above. They're not for nuclear, they're not for drilling offshore, they're not for drilling in Alaska.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I think we all know the context of the world that we live in today. America is under heightened threat. 
   We also know that, if we go back to May 21, the Director of National Intelligence has said our intelligence agencies must obtain a court order to monitor the communications of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity who are physically located in foreign countries. Foreign intelligence, foreign terrorists in foreign countries, and we need to get a court order. 
   The end result is we have significant gaps in gathering the information that we need to keep America safe. That is why we need to vote against this previous question, and why we need to do an update of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act today. 
   But in light of these threats and this context, what has been the response? What's been the response of this Congress and the other side? 
   Only a couple of weeks ago, we decided that we would give al Qaeda more information about our Intelligence Community. We decided that Congress would mandate that we declassify the top line. In the intelligence authorization bill that we did earlier this year, we said we want a national intelligence estimate, not on al Qaeda, not on Iran, not on Syria, not on North Korea, but we want it on global climate change. We gutted some of our key funding for intelligence operations, and we have done absolutely nothing on updating FISA, even though we are under heightened threat and we are talking about foreign targets, foreign intelligence from individuals who are located overseas. 
   We need to update FISA, and we need to do it before we go home. Weakening our national security and weakening our intelligence effort in these times is the wrong thing to do. 
   We used to talk about our inability to connect the dots. What we now have is a majority that is unwilling and unable to give our Intelligence Community even the capabilities to go out and connect the dots that keep us safe. 
   Make no doubt about it. We are weakening our intelligence. We are making this country more vulnerable, and we need to act, and we need to act before we go on recess.

   I think, as we all know, the Iraq Study Group did allow for a surge in troops on a temporary basis to allow us to achieve our objectives. 
   Also, as a previous speaker, I was negligent in not acknowledging the comments of my colleague from Maryland when he recognized the contributions that were being made by our intelligence folks in Iraq and around the world. 
   There are some who believe and are confused by what they may believe or perceive to be the callous omission of any reference to the contributions being made by our intelligence folks in Iraq today. It is a significant shortcoming of this resolution, and I am thoroughly confused as to why they would be omitted in this resolution, and their contributions. They are working side by side each and every day with our Armed Forces, and this resolution forgets to even recognize that contribution. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would now like to recognize my colleague from Michigan, a member of the Intelligence Committee, who thoroughly recognizes and has met with these people in Iraq and Afghanistan and understands their contributions. He is as confused as I am as to why they do not want to recognize their contributions. I yield 7 minutes to my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers).

   Secondly, it ill defines the enemy. It does not recognize that we are in a global war with radical jihadists who have attacked us around the world. Third, it omits recognizing key U.S. personnel that are serving, and serving ably, in this global war with radical jihadists. Why does it not recognize our intelligence professionals? Why does it not recognize our Armed Forces and intelligence professionals serving in Afghanistan, throughout the Middle East, Africa and parts of Asia? 
   Finally, most ironic, the bottom line of this resolution tells the President to stay the course. That is not good enough. This is a tough enemy. We need to develop and evolve our strategy to be successful.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I would like to be heard. 
   Mr. Speaker, as the distinguished chairman talked about in his closing remarks, and as the majority leader discussed in his closing remarks, the energy security of the United States is directly tied to the national security of the United States. 
   It is beyond me to understand how the proponents of this bill can claim that the legislation before us this afternoon protects the energy independence and energy security of the United States when our critical foreign intelligence capabilities, designed specifically to protect the national security of the United States, continue to degrade. This, of course, happened 11 days ago with the expiration of the Protect America Act. 
   Again the proponents of the bill say the energy security of the United States is directly tied to the national security of the United States. And that is why this motion to recommit should be considered in order. 
   The national security of the United States is directly tied to the effectiveness of the tools that we give to the intelligence community. The same radical jihadist groups who attacked the United States on September 11, 2001 are continuing their plans to attack the United States and its citizens. You don't have to take my word for it. Read the declassified excerpts of the National Intelligence Estimate released by Director McConnell. 
   The majority leader and others who are proponents of this bill have pointed out America's vulnerability on energy issues.

   And as we have said, your words were that this is a national security issue and it is imperative that we deal with it. The majority leader's words, we are talking about the threats to our oil supply and our energy supply, whether it was from Venezuela, whether it was from the Middle East or other parts of the world. We significantly enhance and increase our vulnerability on an energy standpoint when we let the tools of the intelligence community erode and when we no longer have good insight into what radical jihadists may be doing in Pakistan or what they may be doing in the Middle East or what they may be doing in South America when specifically these are the home bases of radical jihadists. You also have to take a look specifically at radical jihadists and take a look at where they are saying they want to act. They want to destabilize many of the governments that provide us with the oil and energy supplies that this country is so dependent on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Today is day 11, day 11 since the Protect America Act expired. 
   The Director of National Intelligence has clearly stated that each and every day that we move past the expiration of the Protect America Act our ability to monitor, to track radical jihadist groups and others, people who want to attack America, would erode. Those comments were reinforced by the chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the other body. 
   The other body did the appropriate thing and passed a long-term FISA, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, bill, enabling our intelligence community to have the tools that they need to keep America safe. It has been 2 weeks since the other body passed their bill. It has been more than 2 weeks of inaction by this House. 
   I guess this House did have action. We went home for 12 days on an extended vacation. I guess this House did have action, we left late in the afternoon yesterday. We worked until almost 6:00 making sure we did not address this FISA issue, this key component of national security. 
   Each and every day we become more vulnerable. How vulnerable does the other side want us to become? Each and every day the other side fights to give more rights to people who might do America harm. Each and every day we undercut the activities of the men and women in the intelligence community who are doing everything that they can to keep America safe, but who find each and every day the other side tying their hands behind their backs and limiting their capabilities to keep America safe. 
   At a time when we are in a very dangerous world, the efforts by radical jihadists to attack us and our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, they do continue. There is an urgency, as far as our troops are concerned, that this issue needs to be dealt with, even though individuals on the other side repeatedly say there is no urgency to deal with this issue. The other side says there is no urgency. Tell that to our men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan. Tell that to our allies in the Middle East, our allies in Israel who the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq has recently said, Let's use Iraq to be a launching pad to attack Jerusalem. Tell that to our allies, the Israelis, who are under threat from Hezbollah. Tell that to our allies throughout the Middle East where the second goal and objective of radical jihadists is to undermine their regimes and overthrow them and establish the caliphate and impose shariah law. 
   It seems that much of the world believes that there is an urgency, as do the President and the other body. The President and the other body negotiated and reached an agreement. We agree with that direction. House Republicans and many Democrats would vote for it, but Democratic leadership continues to stand in the way and prevent this bill from coming up and being considered by this House. There is an urgency, as much as the other side would like to believe there is not. Vote against the previous question and allow the Senate bill to come up for a vote today.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, this debate is about whether or not America is a great Nation that will lead in the face of difficulty. We have come up short. This resolution falls short. It is small and not worthy of this House. Why small? Let me begin with a threat that some either don't understand or refuse to acknowledge. 
   This resolution does not address the fact that the current threat is not just the single front in Iraq, but rather the larger threat of militant Islamic jihadists who hate us enough to want to kill. These militant Islamic jihadists are a fringe element of Islam who have very specific ideas and goals about how to revive Islam, return Muslims to world power, and how to deal with their enemies. 
   They are committed to a violent overthrow of existing international systems and to their replacement by an all-encompassing Islamic state called the caliphate. In explaining his approach to creating the caliphate, centered in Iraq, al-Qaeda's number two leader, Zawahari, outlined a four-stage plan: 
   Stage 1, expel the Americans from Iraq in defeat. 
   Stage 2, create an Islamic religious government in Iraq, developing and supporting it until it achieves a level of a caliphate. 
   Stage 3, extend the jihad wave to secular countries neighboring Iraq. 
   Stage 4, clash with Israel, because Israel was established only to challenge any new Islamic entity. 
   I think you get the picture. 
   Let me also be clear. This jihad is about them, their God, and their religion, it is not about us. These militant jihadists believe that the modern world has forsaken the pure religious life and that only with a caliphate can they return to ``pure life.'' 
   It is this narrow ideology that poses the direct and real threat to us. It is this ideology that threatens not only us, but also includes the belief that killing other Muslims is justified to achieve their radical goals. Here is the true threat to America and the world, this militant Islamic jihad, a jihad that attacks around the globe, including the United States and Iraq. The resolution we debate today does not address this global problem, this threat to peace and stability. Iraq is not the problem, it is only one front in this larger war. 
   The second point. This resolution omits specifically all of the men and women of the Armed forces who are defending our freedoms in other theaters  such as Kuwait, Afghanistan and Bosnia. It says, by not saying, that this Congress may not support troops who will be sent to Iraq. 
   Is this intentional? Is this part of the plan to choke off funding for our troops? I also take great umbrage that this resolution omits and completely slights the incredible contributions to this Nation's security of our dedicated men and women in the Intelligence Community, many serving in Iraq, who provide our combat troops with the information vital to their security. 
   Is this the first step in cutting off their funding, too, returning to the Clinton administration's policies of the 1990s that decimated our intelligence capabilities? 
   Finally, Madam Speaker, I need to address the issue of the consequences of failure. What happens if Iraq collapses due to a sudden withdrawal of U.S. troops? Our enemies have made it clear that they will fill the void. Surely America is wary of the conflict in Iraq, but the difficulty of this conflict does not justify giving into their strategy; yes, their strategy. They believe that they are winning by wearing America down. Will we quit? Do we understand the consequences? 
   Make no mistake, this resolution is a dangerous and naive first step to cutting funding to our troops in an unwise withdrawal from the region. Iraq is not a faraway place where the United States has no interest and where we can pull our troops out of without paying a price in the global war against militant Islam. 
   This debate is not about Iraq, it is about us, us as a Nation of people who will do the right thing. The fundamental question is, Do we have the resolve that will be necessary to defeat radical militant Islamic jihadists that contain bad actors such as Iran, and will we stand and fight for the future of our kids and their kids? 
   We have faced similar threats before. In 1945 my parents were liberated by Canadians and American troops in the Netherlands. They never forgot the sacrifices that were made by brave soldiers and by a great Nation, a Nation on a great mission. 
   America did it for them, but it also did it for itself. America recognized that the threat was a direct threat to America and the world. We then led a global effort to victory. Today we face a very different but, again, a very real threat: radical militant Islam. The challenge to this Congress is to rise to the occasion, to help lead America and to help lead the world to victory. 
   This petty resolution falls far short of that noble and worthy calling. Vote ``no.'' We can and we must do better.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I offer this motion to recommit with instructions. My motion to recommit addresses a glaring inconsistency in this bill with all other Federal education laws by removing a provision that moves us in the direction of national standards and curriculum and puts those decisions back in the hands where they belong, in the hands of our State and local education leaders and, most importantly, parents. 
   Education in this country has always been predominantly a State and local issue, and within that context parents had a protected right to direct their children's education. 
   Even in the years after the passage of No Child Left Behind, the Federal contribution towards educating our children continues to be less than 10 percent, with States, counties, cities, and towns, actually parents and their local communities, providing over 90 percent of their funding to educate the next generation. 
   It is not only appropriate but imperative that the Federal law prevents the Federal Government from telling States and districts and schools what and how they should teach. 
   For example, the No Child Left Behind Act prohibits the Federal Government from mandating, directing, reviewing, or controlling a State, district, or school's choice of instructional content or curriculum.  
   In addition, No Child Left Behind strictly prohibits the Department of Education from endorsing, approving, or sanctioning any curriculum for an elementary or secondary school. 
   The rationale behind these provisions is important. As a Nation, we believe that the people closest to our children should make the decision as to what works best.     
   Children learn differently. Some are visual learners. Some learn best from listening. Others need hands-on opportunities. While there are some things that work well for some groups of children, determining definitively what works at the national level for all children is absurd. Therefore, when the Federal Government says that these five, 10 or 15 specific science curricula are most effective, it is implicitly telling States, districts and schools that they should use these identified options, irrespective of whether that is what is best for their students or their area. 
   Case in point is the current debate regarding the implementation of Reading First. There are allegations that some States and districts took information from technical assistance center employees and, to be fair, some department employees, to be implied endorsements of specific programs, believing that those were the only programs that would be funded under Reading First. 
   No one seems happy about the outcome, yet this underlying bill would create another panel to provide ``recommendations'' that it then requires the Director of NSF and the Secretary of Education to disseminate. 
   Take a look at this motion to recommit. Very simple. Nothing in this act or the amendments made by this act shall be construed to limit the authority of State governments or local school boards to determine the curricula of their students. It very clearly states and adds the clarifying language that it is the State and local school districts' responsibility and accountability for developing and approving the most appropriate, the most effective teaching methods and the most effective content. 
   This Congress has long taken the position that we do not want to develop national curriculum and national standards. This Congress has consistently taken the position that we need and want local control of our schools. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for this motion to recommit, to once again say that parents and local school districts, the ones who know the needs and the names of our children in their schools, are the ones in the best position to make the decisions as to what will happen in the classrooms in their local schools. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the conference report today. I'm disappointed. I do compliment the chairman in an effort to move in a bipartisan direction. I think it's something that both he and I feel is essential, that at a time of risk, whether we're facing radical jihadists or whether we're facing the threat from China, North Korea, Iran, or other threats around the globe, it would be to the betterment of the country if we could reach a position on a bipartisan basis where we could come to the floor in support of a reauthorization or an authorization of the intelligence community. I can't do that today. I don't believe that this bill moves us in the direction that we need to go. 
   Earlier, a colleague talked a little bit about interrogation methods and these types of things. One of the problems that has happened over the last number of years, it's talked about in the editorial that my colleague from Texas referenced, the administration on a bipartisan basis reaching out to Congress, briefing Members of Congress on various programs that they felt were essential to keeping America safe and actually have kept the homeland safe ever since 9/11, have enabled us to put together the strategies and the tactics that have ensured that we have not been attacked again. 
   The problem is these programs have leaked out, whether it's from the community, whether it's perhaps from Congress, or wherever they have leaked out, even though Congress has been involved in the process and has reviewed these processes at their inception. These Members who were briefed and at one time said, yeah, we support these programs, have moved away from them and now that they're public said, well, yeah, we never had all the information; there's nothing that we could do about that. These programs need to be done in secret. 
   There are problems with this bill. I will detail more of these as we go through.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield myself 2 minutes. 
   As I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the conference report on the 2008 intelligence authorization bill. I think that this report does move us in the wrong direction and sets some of the wrong priorities. 
   It rejects the bipartisan approach for congressional authorization of the intelligence community at a time when we really do need to be working together. There were efforts to do this on a bipartisan basis. The end result of the product is that it is not a bipartisan bill. As my colleague from Arizona just stated, last week we had an overwhelming vote to remove earmarks from a national security bill. It went to conference. All the earmarks were maintained in the bill. 
   When we were at conference, my colleague from the Armed Services Committee Duncan Hunter wanted to share his concerns about the bill. Ranking Member Hunter was denied an opportunity to speak at the conference. It is why today Duncan Hunter, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, is opposed to this intelligence bill. At a time when intelligence and defense ought to be integrated and seamless, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee is opposed to this bill. 
   One of the strategies that the President outlined in his reform for the intelligence community was to increase  HUMINT, to significantly increase the size of the HUMINT individuals, people collecting human intelligence, put us on a glide path to significantly increase that critical asset. This bill falls far short of funding that glide path that I thought we had agreed upon on a bipartisan basis, saying if we are going to be effective, we need to have more human intelligence. 
   For these and other reasons, I oppose this intelligence bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, at this time I would like to yield myself 2 minutes. 
   As we continue to talk about the various weaknesses in this bill, let me highlight a few more. 
   The report fails to provide for long-term authorities to streamline the surveillance of foreign terrorist targets, foreign countries. We need this capability to detect and prevent potential attacks to the United States. 
   It has been talked a little bit about that this bill prohibits torture. Torture is already prohibited. The insinuation is that the Members of Congress who were briefed on the interrogation methods back in 2002, 2003, as they were briefed by the administration, that these Members signed off on interrogation methods that constituted torture. I don't believe that the current Speaker of the House signed off on those types of methods. The current Speaker of the House was one of the people that was briefed back in 2002 and 2003, along with other Members. Congress participated fully and had the opportunity to review the interrogation methods. 
   As we capture individuals and decide to determine exactly what information, I don't think we should treat them as outlined in the Army Field Manual. These are not normal enemy combatants, they don't wear a uniform, and we shouldn't be applying military rules to the intelligence community. 
   We talked about priorities. The report on Iran perhaps last week was a significant improvement over the National Intelligence Estimates that we had gotten from the community in previous years. We hope it was better. The one in 2005 the community now says was totally wrong. The conclusions they reached were very, very different. 
   We need to improve our intelligence capabilities. What this report says is one of the key National Intelligence Estimates that we need to develop over the next year is on global warming. We've got lots more important targets and resources. Number one is rebuilding the capability of actually doing estimates and doing assessments before we start moving on to those targets. As we improve that process, let's focus on hard targets, not global warming, which is being discussed in just about every other committee on the Hill today.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   As we continue to talk about this bill, and I agree with my colleague, the chairman of the committee, that as we go through this process, it is a democratic process, that you're not going to get everything that you would like to have. I appreciate the chairman's support on the amendment that we put in place in conference that said if the administration doesn't fully brief both intelligence committees on what happened and what we knew and what we didn't know about the attacks in Syria on September 6 by Israel, that we would fence off funds and they would not be available to the community to spend, because I believe that's an instance where the committee's being fully informed will enable us to better do our jobs because oversight is absolutely essential. 
   But when I take a look at the totality of the bill, I don't believe that it moves us in the right direction. As my other colleague from California just stated, in 2005, when the National Intelligence Estimate came out and talked about their weapons programs, we both, together, voiced skepticism about the quality of the intelligence, not the quality of the analysis, but do we really have in place the sources and methods to make the kinds of conclusions that were made in that National Intelligence Estimate. And I think we both concluded that back in 2005, reaching those conclusions with high confidence, we weren't sure you could do that. 
   Now, in 2007, we find out that in 2005 we were right and the community was wrong. We share some of those same concerns today. It is why it is so important that we build an intelligence community and where I think that this bill comes up short. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. At this time, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes. 
   As we talk about the totality of the bill and why this bill comes up short, let me highlight a couple of other areas. 
   The conference report would subject four key positions, including the head of the NSA, the NRO, to the politicized Senate and confirmation process. If there is one thing that we've recognized through this process and through what's happened over the last few years, it is that the less politics, the less politicalization that we have in the intelligence arena, the better off we are. Creating four new confirmed positions in the Senate takes us in exactly the wrong direction. 
   The conference report would create a duplicate of a cumbersome new DNI Inspector General that would provide little significant new oversight. This is not about whether there should be an Inspector General with very clear powers in the Office of the DNI, but let's make sure that those responsibilities are clearly aligned with the accountabilities and the responsibilities of the Inspector General in the Department of Defense. 
   A number of these agencies in the community are dual functioned. What does that mean? It means that they have reporting responsibilities to the Director of National Intelligence, and they have responsibilities to the Secretary of Defense. And if we're going to create an Inspector General in the DNI, let's make sure that that Inspector General is coordinated with the activities in the Department of Defense. This bill fails to do that. 
   This bill also takes the DNI in a couple of other directions. It grows the staff on a bipartisan basis in the House in a very different position than from where the Senate is. We want to cap the size of the DNI. It's not a doing function. This bill not only grows the size of the DNI; it gives them new responsibilities in terms of science and technology. The DNI was never intended to be a doing function; it was intended to be a coordinating function. This moves it again in the wrong direction. 
   Mr. Speaker, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. Speaker, defeating the threat from radical jihadists is a difficult job. It requires input from the legislative branch. It requires leadership from the executive branch. After 9/11, the administration outlined a series of initiatives. It didn't outline it to the entire Congress because the threat was so new, or some thought so new. The decision to respond to it was very different than what happened in the 1990s, but we recognized we needed to take different steps. The administration brought in people from Congress, the people that the leadership and our colleagues had entrusted with the responsibility to shape an intelligence community. 
   Everyone talks about the President's terrorist surveillance program, the President's financial tracking system, and now, it is the President's interrogation system. What they forget to note, as pointed out in the editorial today, is that in each of those cases, membership from the House and the Senate were involved in the process, in reviewing and setting the direction and implementing the strategies and the tactics that they thought needed to be put in place to keep America safe. Some of those Members that were briefed have moved on to other careers and they are no longer in Congress. Some of those who were briefed back in 2002 and 2003 specifically on the terrorist surveillance program, specifically on interrogation, are still Members of the House. Some are still members of the committee. Others are serving on other committees. Some have moved into leadership positions in the House of Representatives. 
   It is interesting, as the majority leader is speaking and laying out his arguments, it is the Speaker of the House, elected by the entire House, today, who serves the entire House, who is briefed on these programs. Some who have looked at, who have remarked on those meetings said, not only did the people that were in those meetings support the techniques and the methods that were put in place, some actually even asked the question, Is it enough? These things were decided in a process that the House and the Senate and the administration participated in and decided jointly that these were the things that were necessary to keep America safe. Only when they became public, all of a sudden did some of these individuals get cold feet, feet of clay and say, Oh, well, I really didn't know. But when the rubber hit the road in terms of what we needed to do to keep America safe, these people said these are the techniques and the processes, and these are the programs that we need to have in place. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   As we talk about this authorization bill, I think it is also important to talk about it in the larger context in terms of some of the other things that are going on that I believe are weakening our ability to effectively combat the threat from radical jihadists. What are some of these things? Policies that are being advocated by individuals on the other side who are committed to defeating terrorism. I just think they have the wrong strategy. 
   Terrorist phone calls cannot be monitored without court warrants even when all parties are outside of the United States or if the lives of American soldiers are at risk. They want to provide habeas corpus rights for foreign terrorists. Terrorists when captured overseas shall have the right to challenge their captivity in U.S. courts. The right of terrorists to incarceration in the United States. Foreign terrorists being held in facilities outside the United States, including Guantanamo Bay, will be removed from detention abroad and brought into American communities, ending the distinction between lawful versus unlawful combatants. 
   The United States henceforth will recognize al Qaeda terrorists as legitimate combatants and grant them the rights of lawful combatants under the Geneva Conventions. Terrorists shall be afforded due process, attorneys, and protection from self-incrimination. Terrorists will also be protected from enhanced interrogation, even when they have information on pending terrorist attacks. 
   In terms of priorities, funds shall be diverted from tough antiterrorism intelligence programs targeted at apprehending and killing terrorists through intelligence analysis in connection against global warming because some folks from the other side may have implied or said that individuals join terrorist groups not because of radical Islam or hatred of the United States, but because they are unhappy about rising global temperatures and sea levels. Extend Fourth Amendment rights barring unreasonable search and seizures to terrorists. The rights of radical jihadists to avoid searches and seizures shall be protected, even if they are granted more protection than American citizens. 
   Some believe that terrorists have the rights to intelligence leaks. Terrorists have the right to read about classified and antiterrorist intelligence programs in the press because there has not been a vigorous effort either through this committee or through the intelligence community to stop the leaks. And then actually when corporations may help us like the telecommunications companies may have, people who agree to help us will not be protected.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I yield myself the balance of my time.     
   Mr. Speaker, it wasn't all that long ago that this House voted 249-160, a difference of 89 votes, to instruct House conferees to eliminate all earmarks from the fiscal year 2008 Intelligence authorization bill and to fully fund human intelligence collection. The vote was clear, overwhelming, and bipartisan, and 62 Democrats supported the motion to instruct. It appears, however, that my colleagues on the other side have said one thing and done another on earmarks, as the conference refused to eliminate earmark projects from the classified annex to this bill. 
   Today, we are going to offer a motion to recommit that provides all Members, including those 62 Democrats who supported the motion to instruct, to take a decisive step to eliminate earmarks in national security bills. If you are for that motion to instruct, you shouldn't be against this motion to recommit. Putting it in the positive, you should be for this motion to recommit because you were for eliminating earmarks a week ago. 
   This motion would make our priorities clear by eliminating provisions providing for earmarks to allow those funds to be directed to improve intelligence collection. As I explained on the floor last week, and as the bipartisan support for the motion indicated, I believe that a consensus is developing among Members that programatic authorizations should be determined solely on their national security merits, absent other compelling circumstances. 
   This motion is clearly about priorities. America is at war. We are engaged in a struggle against radical jihadists, as well as facing threats from China, North Korea, Iran, drug cartels, and those types of things. Taxpayer dollars that are currently slated to be earmarked to individual Member projects should be applied to our most critical areas of need and should serve our Nation as a whole during this crucial time. 
   It is clear that the earmarks that are in the bill generally have not gone through the same rigorous substantive review and evaluation that intelligence programs receive in the formulation of the President's budget. It is critical to our world position that we fully understand the military capability of, and threat posed by, other nations. It is essential that human intelligence activities are fully funded so that we may make fully informed decisions concerning our national interest. 
   Our dedication of resources to human intelligence is a direct investment in the security of this Nation as a whole and the safety of the men and women serving on our behalf. It is also a direct investment in those areas that we know we are weakest in: human intelligence. This motion would eliminate all earmarks. It shouldn't be controversial. But these funds could be put to far better use in human intelligence and other programs. These are programs that we need. 
   Some of these earmarks have been described clearly as wasteful government spending. This bill has not provided adequate support to the intelligence community activity at the forefront of the ability to protect our national security. 
   It is not possible to describe all of these programs. Many of them are classified in their nature. But I can't emphasize enough the importance of these programs and the funding and the necessity to fund these programs at this time. 
   We are a Nation locked in a struggle, facing continued uncertainty and other threats around the globe. The men and women of the front lines of this struggle rely heavily on human intelligence for their own safety every day. The House should not diminish its support for a robust, empowered, and capable intelligence community that provides our first line of defense. It is time to properly focus our priorities. 
   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this motion to recommit and will support me in my opposition to this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (IMPLEMENTING THE 9/11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, for a bill that is supposed to carry out a series of partisan campaign promises on national security and homeland security issues, what is most notable about this bill is actually the many areas that it highlights where there has been bipartisan agreement, not only on the provisions of the 9/11 Commission that should be implemented, but just as importantly, those recommendations that should not be implemented. 
   In the 109th Congress, the House acted to address many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. A number of these reforms were included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act, in which the Intelligence Committee played a prominent role. Others were addressed and refined in later legislation. 
   On intelligence matters, many of the items in this bill are duplications or slight modifications to initiatives that were already put into place during the preceding Congress, such as support to the fusion of border intelligence and provisions to facilitate greater information sharing on homeland security. 
   As another key example, this bill would create a new Office of the United States Coordinator for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism. This duplicates and complicates the work of the National Counterproliferation Center created in the Intelligence Reform bill. 
   I also think it is important to point out that contrary to campaign promises, this bill does not implement all of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. Let me note a few, the intelligence budget, and paramilitary activities, that it does not address at all. 
   This bill is following the lead of the previous Congress and not implementing the two recommendations  that were not warranted, declassifying the amount of the intelligence budget and making the Department of Defense the lead for all paramilitary operations. These decisions were right for our national security on the merits in the last Congress, and they are still right for our national security now. 
   I appreciate that this bill follows and reinforces Republican positions on these issues where the 9/11 Commission recommendations were not good policy. This bill also curiously omits another explicit recommendation of the 9/11 Commission that the majority party's representation on the intelligence oversight committee should never exceed the minority's representation by one. If the new majority wants to claim that it has implemented all of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, it cannot pick and choose to implement all of its recommendations except the ones that involve their own power. 
   Later today, the House will also consider a resolution that purports to address the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to consolidate intelligence oversight in Congress and enhance the influence of the authorizing committee on the appropriations process. The proposal will not accomplish the objectives sought by the 9/11 Commission. 
   The 9/11 Commission recommended that the authorizing committee also become the Appropriations Committee. The last Congress thought that that was a bad idea, and we didn't do it. The proposal in front of us today will further add complication and confusion by creating a third group in the House with responsibility for intelligence. Actually, in the last Congress, we pretty much achieved what the 9/11 Commission was trying to accomplish, where we had basically a seamless integration of the Intelligence Committee authorizations bill reflected in the appropriations bill. 
   I also want to point out that this bill was flawed in much more than its failure to promise to fully implement the commission recommendations. As ranking member and former chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I am concerned that parts of it have significant potential to impact our Nation's critical intelligence programs and capabilities. Even worse, these provisions were developed outside of regular order, without any participation from the relevant committees. 
   I want to briefly note my concerns with two of these provisions. Section 1433 of the bill would require the United States to ``develop a common coalition approach'' with respect to detainees. This proposal is much broader in scope and effect than the actual recommendation of the 9/11 Commission, and it is bad policy. I would hope that all Members of the House would be in agreement that the law should not require the United States of America to ask for the permission of other countries, even our partners, to gather intelligence from and deal effectively and appropriately with detainees and terrorists who threaten our national security. 
   In addition, this proposal would significantly implicate an already challenging area by requiring us to reconcile newly clarified detainee authority with the policies of some nations whose legal authorities protecting human rights are nowhere near as well developed as ours. In addition, this bill would reopen previously negotiated and resolved issues by making the Civil Liberties Board an independent body in granting its subpoena authority. Overall, it would complicate intelligence.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former President and U.S. Congressman Gerald R. Ford. 
   Gerald Ford, who is often referred to as ``Michigan's Greatest Son,'' worked hard wherever his life led him and based his decisions upon what he felt was the right thing to do. 
   A star football player with my alma mater, the University of Michigan, he turned down offers to play in the National Football League to study law at Yale. 
   He then volunteered to serve his country in the Navy during World War II before returning to Michigan to put his law degree to work. 
   He later defeated an incumbent for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives in his own party's primary, which from my own experience is an incredibly difficult endeavor. His colleagues later elected him to the highest leadership position among Republicans in the House. 
   Gerald Ford admittedly did not seek the greatness of the U.S. presidency, but destiny determined that he would become the right man in the right place at the right time. 
   President Ford allowed the country to move forward by pardoning Richard Nixon, although it likely contributed to him failing to win the 1976 election. 
   He helped to unite a divided nation, even when he knew that it would likely result in a great personal cost. He made the decision because he knew that if he did not, our country would spend the months and years looking back and not ahead. For him it was simply the right thing to do. 
   He conducted himself with integrity and character throughout every step of his distinguished career. He set a very high standard for those of us in West Michigan who would follow him to Washington. 
   The legacy he leaves to join his Creator will impact not only the officeholders who follow in his footsteps, but generations of Americans to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, the conduct of oversight of our Nation's intelligence community is one of the most sensitive and complex duties that we have as a Congress. Our committee and other committees took a very close look at recommendations from the 9/11 Commission. We implemented many of them. Some of them we did not implement. 
   We recognized the need to coordinate the strategies of the authorizing committee and the Appropriations Committee. We recognized the need for additional oversight. As a matter of fact, in the last Congress we created subcommittees specifically focused on oversight and increased the number of committee staff that were dedicated to the work of oversight. 
   We also recognized the importance of coordinating between authorizers and appropriators. In the last Congress, the appropriations bill closely mirrored the authorization bill that this House passed. We worked hand-in-glove because we recognized the importance of putting that together and recognized the importance of what the 9/11 Commission recommended. 
   This resolution today goes in exactly the wrong direction. The objective of the 9/11 Commission that was identified was to give the authorizing committee greater, if not sole, influence and control over appropriations, authorizations, and oversight. 
   This resolution creates an additional committee between the authorizers and the appropriators that will add confusion. One of the things that we hear so often from the homeland security folks, from the intelligence folks, is we report to all of these different committees on the Hill, and there is a lack of clarity. It is exactly what is going to happen now. We are adding more confusion to the process, rather than adding and keeping clarity in this process. 
   If you go back to when the committee was first established under the Church committee, there was one issue that was very important: there had to be clarity as to what committee was going to conduct oversight.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, we have talked about the importance, as we have just heard, we have just heard about clear legal authorities; we have talked about the protection of U.S. persons, the need to study this issue in a very important, judicious manner. It's not what happened over the last 4 weeks. Over the last 4 weeks, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were trying to figure out exactly how to bring this vote forward to get the votes necessary to pass it. 
   As we went to Rules yesterday, it was about a half hour before we saw the manager's amendment. As I read through the manager's amendment, this is interesting, and as with much else on FISA, I wonder what this really means and how it really works. Does it really provide us with the clear legal authorities? Are the statements that it makes clear? Will it help our intelligence communities? 
   And while there's a lot of problems in the rest of the bill, I just want to focus on one part of the manager's amendment that is self-enacting today, and that is why I rise in opposition to this unnecessary second rule. It places unnecessary, burdensome restrictions on the intelligence community through a self-executing amendment. 
   More importantly, however, I would like to highlight my concern with a provision of the manager's amendment in this rule that appears to give extremely broad and vague authorities to the executive branch to conduct surveillance on undocumented aliens within the United States. Section 18 of the manager's amendment is bluntly titled: ``No Rights Under the RESTORE Act for Undocumented Aliens.'' No rights under the RESTORE Act for undocumented aliens. Then it goes on to say: ``This act and the amendments made by this act,'' and by ``this act,'' it's talking about FISA, not this bill, at least that is how I would interpret it, ``shall not be construed to prohibit surveillance of, or grant any rights to an alien not permitted to be in or remain in the United States.'' 
   This poorly conceived and ill-advised provision appears to provide an extremely broad and completely blank check to the executive branch to conduct wholly unregulated surveillance on an undocumented alien in the United States. The scope of this is unprecedented. We have never before extended such blanket authority to the intelligence community to collect information on any person within the country, legal or illegal. 
   The language is also as vague as it is broad. My counsel says he doesn't know what the effect of an alien not permitted to be in or remain in the United States means, since it doesn't define those terms by reference to other laws. The overall effect of this provision could be breathtaking in its scope. 
   One of the issues that was supposed to be definitively clarified in this bill is whether or not the enhanced authorities of the Protect America Act or this bill would allow physical searches to be conducted of the homes and businesses of innocent Americans. Since that clarification is supposed to be made in the RESTORE Act, it seems that this provision must be read to permit physical searches of the homes and offices of undocumented aliens.     
   I've got a few questions for the other side that I hope they would take the time to answer when time is yielded back to them. I would like to obtain clarification with respect to a number of ambiguities in the manager's amendment. Would you clarify under which specific laws an alien could be ``permitted to be in or remain in the United States'' under this manager's amendment? Since it does not refer to specific laws, would the President denying someone permission to remain in the United States under this executive authority trigger this provision? 
   The amendment also says that it does not prohibit surveillance of undocumented aliens. Would you further clarify what types of surveillance of undocumented aliens are authorized under this provision? 
   The amendment does not define the term ``surveillance.'' Would it allow surveillance against possible illegal aliens for law enforcement purposes? Would it allow foreign intelligence surveillance to be conducted against transnational smuggling rings? Would it allow surveillance to determine whether someone is an alien not permitted to be in or remain in the United States? Would the amendment exempt undocumented aliens from the physical search requirements of FISA? 
   One final clarification. Does the term ``this Act,'' as I said, I believe it refers to all of FISA, or is it just some section? Could you clarify how that is different than ``the amendments made by this Act''? 
   This is unprecedented in its breadth and its scope, potentially unleashing the intelligence community on people in the United States. The practice in the community today is that when someone is in the United States, they are provided the protections of U.S. law. This takes it and shreds it for illegal aliens, or people who may be suspected of being illegal aliens. 
   And talk about protecting rights, this bill shreds the rights of people who are in this country. It is a significant problem, and this is what happens when you go through a process on this type of technical legislation and do not go through a process that allows the minority or hearings to take place.

   A month after I originally came to the floor to oppose this bill, I now rise in opposition to this flawed legislation, which, disappointingly, has been made worse ever since we started the process. 
   In August Congress finally acted, after months of prodding from Republicans, to close significant intelligence gaps against potential foreign terrorists in foreign countries that jeopardize America's ability to protect and prevent potential terrorist attacks and to effectively collect intelligence on foreign adversaries. 
   Now we have a simple choice: Do we do what is necessary to provide long-term legal authority for our intelligence community to conduct necessary surveillance, or do we reopen that intelligence gap? 
   It now seems that the majority is determined to move a bill intended to make political statements rather than to give intelligence professionals the tools that they need to protect our country. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, the new manager's amendment that self-executed with a rule this morning included broad new language that would treat illegal immigrants differently than other threats to the homeland. This was a poorly conceived and ill-advised provision that has created a lot of confusion. 
   Through the day, when we discussed the rule this morning, as we had the debate tonight, I had a series of questions: Would this amendment allow surveillance against possible illegal aliens for law enforcement purposes? Would it allow surveillance to determine whether someone is an alien not permitted to be in or remain in the United States? 
   During the rule, I was told I would get the answers during general debate. During general debate there was nothing but silence. 
   If we take a look at the bill, for a month we have been dealing with a bill that provided protections and legal protections to terrorists. Overseas terrorists having access to the courts, having warrants, and those types of things were moved. Then today, at the last minute, or yesterday at the last minute, we get an amendment, a manager's amendment, that provides or, it appears, rips away any type of protection for another threat. 
   Is the majority saying that the threat to the homeland is greater for aliens, illegal aliens living in the United States, than state sponsors of terrorism? It appears that it does because they have 40 or 50 pages of protections and a paragraph of exceptions that says: ``No rights under the RESTORE Act for undocumented aliens.'' Many on our side may think that that is a good idea. 
   What this manager's amendment says very simply is if there are no rights under the RESTORE Act for undocumented aliens, maybe we should put that same provision in here for state sponsors of terrorism and agents of sponsors of terrorism. It's very clear. We think that if a threat to the homeland, as identified by the other side, are illegal aliens, perhaps it's also time that we recognize that state sponsors of terrorism pose the same type of threat to the United States. 
   Is the majority saying that illegal aliens are a greater threat to the United States than Cuba, than Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria? It appears from the bill that we have before us tonight that is exactly what they are saying, because they have 50 pages of protections and one page of exceptions. 
   Let's make sure that we treat illegal aliens the same way we treat North Korea and Cuba.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   I come to the floor today opposed to this bill. This budget reconciliation conference report before us today creates five new entitlement programs and abuses the protection of the reconciliation procedures. 
   A number of programs that were a part of discretionary spending, that depended as to whether the money was available in the budget or not and whether we had the money available to fund those programs, determined exactly how much money would be spent on those programs, but now they will be moved into entitlement status. More money, rather than going through a process where we review the spending every year, is on automatic pilot. And sure, the bill says that these programs will sunset, but those of us that have been here for a while know that entitlement programs never sunset. They just grow larger and larger and larger. And the Federal Government and this Congress loses control over that spending. 
   The discussion about the student loan interest, cutting it in half, it goes down and scales down over a period of 4 or 5 years and in the 5th year it comes back to its full amount. Why? Because we can't afford it or the other side hasn't been able to find the 20 to $30 billion that's estimated would actually be necessary to continue this program in the past. Will they find it in the future? Probably. It will be called deficit spending. 
   This bill is a massive attack on the private sector. There are significant increases in new Federal mandatory spending. It grows government one more time. It puts the Federal Government in control of more parts of the education sector, the education process, squeezing out the private sector, squeezing out parents and inserting big brother and big government in the process. 
   But under this administration, when it comes to education, why am I not surprised that we're talking about more government and less parental involvement?

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate rejected transferring al Qaeda terrorists from Guantanamo to facilities in the United States by a vote of 94-3. Senator McConnell stated at that time, ``It is better for the safety and security of the American people that terrorists at Guantanamo Bay are not moved to American communities. It is the sense of the Senate that detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, including senior members of al Qaeda, should not be transferred stateside into facilities in American communities and American neighborhoods.'' 
   Many senior members of al Qaeda are secured at Guantanamo Bay, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who masterminded the September 11 terrorist attacks that killed approximately 3,000 Americans; Majid Khan, who developed plans to poison water supplies inside the United States; Abdul Rahim al-Nashiri, who orchestrated the attacks on the USS Cole which killed 17 United States sailors. This is just a sampling of the people that are in Guantanamo Bay. 
   Are Americans better protected by bringing these terrorists to our homeland, or by keeping captured members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations 528 miles and an ocean away from the homeland? Terrorists held at Guantanamo are treated in accordance with United States and international law and are held at the highest level of security, ensuring that they are not a threat to the United States citizens. 
   Gitmo alternatives include the use of up to 17 military detention facilities. Less secure facilities allow for the recruitment and radicalization of new members within the detention population as well as enhanced escape opportunities. Domestic detention facilities may become prime targets for terrorist attacks on United States soil and they will create uncertainties about detainees' ``constitutional rights.''     
   Standards at Guantanamo are equal to or better than similar institutions in the United States. They are relatively new facilities. They have culturally appropriate meals. They have Korans and respectful silence during Islam's five daily prayers. The detainees receive medical care and at least 2 hours of daily outdoor recreation. An inspection official from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in March 2006 called it a model prison. 
   Bottom line, the Guantanamo Bay facility is a clean, safe and humane facility for the terrorists housed there, as well as a facility that affords security and protection for American citizens. We should accept the Senate language in their bill and make it clear that these prisoners should stay at Guantanamo Bay and that they should not be transferred to facilities in the homeland.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I shall consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Senate rejected transferring al Qaeda terrorists from Gitmo to our homeland. That was a wise decision. That is a decision that my colleagues here in the House should support tonight. 
   Gitmo is a facility that is working. It's working in many different ways. It's keeping terrorists, these terrorists, away from the homeland. It's providing us with an opportunity to get the information that may be necessary and may be helpful in keeping America safe. When the Senate acted, they acted overwhelmingly, 94-3, to say make sure that these individuals do not come to the United States. 
   It provides us with the alternatives and the flexibility that, as we move forward in defeating radical jihadists, that we will have the strategies in place to keep us safe, to get the information that we need, provide us with the background to implement the correct strategies. 
   We are safer keeping these terrorists in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, 528 miles away from the homeland. I encourage my colleagues to vote for this motion to instruct conferees. It is a good motion. It's a good decision, a good direction that was put forward by the Members of the other body; and I hope that we stand with them tonight.

<DOCNO>Mr. HOEKSTRA. (WE NEED TO FIX THE INTELLIGENCE GAP -- (House of Representatives - July 26, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, in the last few days we've received a National Intelligence Estimate, a consensus opinion of the intelligence community that indicates a number of disturbing things. But as we take a look at the information that came out of the National Intelligence Estimate, perhaps the most important thing that it says is that we are a Nation at heightened risk. 
   In some ways, al Qaeda has strengthened itself. We're concerned about the situation in Pakistan, where it appears that in parts of Pakistan al Qaeda may now enjoy a safe haven, a safe haven where it can plan, where it can train and prepare to attack the homeland again. We know that that is the true intent of al Qaeda. 
   In communications that they have recently released, they've outlined  their objectives clearly. Number one, they want to defeat the coalition in Iraq. The second step is that they want to destabilize the moderate Muslim regimes in the Middle East. The third step is they want to eliminate the State of Israel. The fourth step is they want to establish the caliphate, northern Africa, southern Europe and Middle East reaching down into Asia. And then they want to establish Sharia law in these areas. 
   In another part of this recent communication, they indicated that they believe the world is made up of two primary areas: a core, Western Europe and the United States and outlying region, outlying areas; and the Middle East, northern Africa, the parts that make up the caliphate. And what they clearly say is that in today's world, because we have been on the offense, the violence has been in the outlying areas, Afghanistan, Pakistan, northern Africa and Iraq. And what they say is they want to move this violence from the outlying regions to the core. What does that mean? They want to move the violence to Europe and to our homeland. 
   Today, as we face this critical test, today we received a letter from Mike McConnell who is the Director of National Intelligence, building on testimony that the intelligence community provided us in September in 2006, building on information that they gave to us in April, building on a public statement that Mr. McConnell made on May 21 in an op-ed piece in the Washington Post. What does it all say? 
   Our Nation faces an intelligence gap. Think of it. As we face greater risk and a higher security threat than we've faced perhaps in a long time, we have an intelligence gap, a situation in which our intelligence community every day is missing a significant portion of what we should be getting in order to protect the American people. Not only should we be getting it, but we could be getting it, but we have this intelligence gap because we have a 1970s law called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that Members on the other side of the aisle refuse, refuse to update and to modify. 
   The letter goes on, If we are to stay a step ahead of the terrorists and protect the American people, I firmly believe that we need to be able to use our capabilities to collect, now listen to this, to collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets overseas, without requirements imposed by an out-of-the-State, out-of-date FISA statute. 
   Today, for instance, the statute requires that in a number of important situations that we obtain court orders. We need to obtain court orders to most effectively obtain foreign terrorist communications, and remember, this is about foreign intelligence, about foreign terrorists, who are overseas, and we need to get court orders to intercept those communications. 
   The letter goes on, Simply put, in a significant number of cases we are in the unfortunate position of having to obtain court orders to effectively collect foreign intelligence about foreign targets located overseas. 
   Then some say, well, let's just take some of our resources and apply it; we can expedite. Number one, it doesn't solve the problem to prepare these court orders by just putting more people, but to get the right kind of information, to prepare these court orders and get them done in the right way, it would take important analysts and put them in the position of preparing court orders for foreign terrorists and get court orders. 
   We need to fix this intelligence gap, and we need to do it before we go on recess next week.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   The great track record about the FISA bill designed and passed in 1978 was that the intent was to protect American civil liberties, and it has done a very effective job of protecting American civil liberties. 
   Nowhere in this debate over the last week, over the last number of months has about there been allegations that FISA did not work. There was a technical problem with FISA because technology has moved and evolved and the law did not. So the question becomes, take a look at the bill. If we're really intent on protecting Americans, read some sections of the bill. 
   ``We require basket warrants for various targets, various countries.'' How many baskets are we going to put out there and are we going to require the DNI to prepare to bring to the court? 
   And then take a look at what they require to put into the basket. Does this help protect Americans, where we say the DNI needs to go to a court and provide a description of the nature of the information sought for the various baskets, the China basket, the North Korea basket, the al Qaeda basket, the Syria basket? 
   What happens if we outline the type of intelligence we want to gather and we're gathering it and we get something else? Do we need to minimize that? That is a ridiculous requirement. 
   The bill goes on and it says, ``a statement of the means by which the electronic surveillance will be effected.'' This is going to the Court and saying, you need to identify all over the world how you are going to collect intelligence. There are certain intelligence collection methods that only two Members of this House may be aware of. Does that help keep America safe? 
   This is a bad bill. It protects terrorists, not Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   As our previous colleague was talking, I think she laid it out pretty well. Are we going to involve the courts in reviewing our foreign intelligence activities? If you take a look at the bill that is out here, it appears that the court is going to be involved in reviewing our intelligence community activities overseas. This becomes the Terrorist Protection Act, not a surveillance program. 
   Do we want a court reviewing our tactics and strategies for foreign intelligence or foreign individuals in foreign locations and lay it out the way that this bill wants? This is not about theory. This is about protecting the homeland, and it is about protecting our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. 
   Does it make sense that when a commander in the field gets the information or gets leads that may protect their soldiers that, rather than following the lead immediately, the first thing that they do is bring in the lawyers to make sure that they get that information in an appropriate and legal way on the battlefield? Is that giving our troops the tools that they need to keep themselves safe and secure and defeat the enemy? 
   Does it make sense when our intelligence frontline folks, whether it's in northern Africa or in the Middle East, get a lead as to individuals who may be targeting the United States, that the first thing that they need to do is get the lawyers involved to make sure that foreign intelligence is collected in an appropriate way, rather than focusing on what needs to keep us safe? 
   After 9/11, we spent a lot of time working together to put together an intelligence community that would, in the future, be able to connect the dots. With this bill that it looks like we're going to consider this afternoon, we won't have to worry about connecting the dots anymore because we will put the barriers in place that means that they will not even be able to collect the dots. But if you believe that this is a bumper sticker war and this is a bumper sticker threat that we face today, this bill is for you. 
   Take a look at the statement by the Director of National Intelligence. The Director of National Intelligence today is the same individual that served many years under President Bill Clinton as the Director of the National Security Agency. Here's what he has to say about this bill:  
   I have reviewed the proposal that the House of Representatives is expected to vote on this afternoon to modify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House proposal is unacceptable. I strongly oppose it. The House proposal would not allow me to carry out my responsibility to provide warning and to protect the Nation, especially in our heightened threat environment. I urge Members of Congress to support the legislation I provided last evening to modify FISA to equip our intelligence community with the tools we need to protect our Nation.  
   This is an individual who has a 30-year career in this business. He served President Clinton; he's serving President Bush, but most importantly, it is  a career that is distinguished because he has served the country and has kept us safe. Let's respect his opinion. Let's give him the tools that will keep us safe, keep us safe in the homeland and keep our troops safe on the battlefield.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, while we are still taking a look at exactly what this amendment means, it raises some concerns because I think the last thing that some of us want to do is to divert important intelligence resources and assets to take a look at something that happened 20 to 30 years ago at the same time that we are facing the threat that we face today from radical jihadists and other challenges on a global basis. 
   I think my colleague made some compelling arguments as to if there is information available in the intelligence community that would shed some light on these types of issues that the intelligence community should at least report that information to the Intelligence Committee so that we can determine how we should dispose of that information, perhaps make it available. 
   I am assuming that my colleague doesn't envision the intelligence community going out and doing new work to try to assess as to what happened 20 to 30 years ago but to report on the information that they have in their possession at that time. 
   I will yield to my colleague. 
   Is my understanding roughly correct?

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit sends the bill back to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence with instructions for an amendment requesting a national intelligence assessment on the strategic implications of high oil and energy prices for America. 
   I would like to remind my colleagues in the House today that last year, when we did the Intelligence Authorization Bill, over 230 of my colleagues voted for an amendment that would require a national assessment on global climate change and asked the intelligence community to investigate that. This is a much more pressing and a much more serious issue and a much more immediate issue. 
   This assessment would constitute the best analytical judgment of our intelligence community as to the outlook for supply, demand and prices for a variety of strategic energy sources. This assessment would also examine the plans and intentions of key energy-producing and exporting states. But most importantly, this assessment explores the national security implications of America's sworn enemies, such as Iran and Venezuela, using increased energy prices as leverage against us and our foreign policy goals. This assessment is timely and directly relevant to America's national security interests. 
   This amendment stands in sharp contrast to the repeated attempts to divert precious time and scarce intelligence resources to discuss topics such as global warming, topics that merely advance an ideological agenda, rather than keeping this country and the American safe. 
   Take a look at specifically what this motion to recommit asks the intelligence community to do. It asks the intelligence community to look at the plans, the intentions of key energy-producing and exporting nations with respect to energy production and supply. 
   Energy-producing nations are changing their behavior. Why? For them it is less about increasing supply today because they are now flush with cash. Their behavior is changing. 
   It also asks the intelligence community to look at the national security implications of potential use of energy resources as leverage against the United States by Venezuela, Iran, or other potential adversaries of the United States as a result of increased energy prices. Some call this the ``Iran premium.'' 80 percent of the world's oil reserves are controlled by government or national oil companies, many of them unfriendly to the United States. 
   This assessment also would ask for the national security implications of increases in funding to current or potential adversaries of the United States as a result of increased energy prices. This year there will be a transfer of over $2.3 trillion from energy-consuming nations to energy-producing nations. The intelligence community should assess what the impact of that wealth transfer should be. 
   In addition, the community would do an assessment of the likelihood that increased energy prices will directly or indirectly increase financial support for terrorist organizations. 
   In an environment where America receives 60 percent of its energy overseas, where we are dependent on foreign supplies of energy, and where there are no indications that there will be decisions made to increase U.S. production, it is absolutely essential and vital that our national intelligence community does this assessment so that we, as policymakers, can understand the implications of the decisions that we make. 
   We need this assessment. We need to understand how vulnerable we are and the tools that our adversaries may use against us in the future. 
   For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit. Send this bill to committee, where, on the Intelligence Committee, this can be done in a very expeditious way. To make sure that we get this information, this assessment will be required to be brought back to the House of Representatives by January of 2009. 
   With that, I ask for my colleagues' support, and yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield myself as much time as I shall consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, the annual Intelligence Authorization Act is one of the most important bills that the House passes each year. It provides and allocates resources critical to national security programs that are the front lines of America's defense and foreign policies and, most critically, work to detect, prevent and disrupt potential terrorist attacks against the American people. The bill is also essential to ensure close and effective congressional oversight of the intelligence community. 
   There are issues that remain to be worked out as the legislative process continues. But I appreciate the work that Chairman Reyes has done to avoid many of the contentious items that have recently prevented the enactment of an intelligence authorization bill. And I appreciate that the bill reflects areas of consensus on critical national security issues. 
   I believe that this bill is strong in two areas. First, it was significantly improved by seven Republican amendments that were adopted on a bipartisan basis to address what I believe are important issues in priorities facing the intelligence community. Among these, the committee adopted my amendment to remove all earmarks from the bill, a significant step forward. Our intelligence program should be based on only one primary consideration, what best ensures that the intelligence community is able to do its job in the interest of the national security of the United States. 
   The committee adopted an amendment offered by my colleague from Michigan (Mr. Rogers) to limit the size and unintended bureaucratic growth of the Office of the DNI, the Director of National Intelligence. The bill also includes another amendment by Congressman Rogers to require a high-level strategic evaluation of the FBI's progress in transforming its FBI's intelligence capabilities. This process may not be moving forward fast enough to accomplish the needed changes and needs close attention. 
   The bill is also strengthened by significant provisions to improve congressional oversight of the intelligence community and the executive branch which addressed issues I have repeatedly raised since serving as chairman of the committee. These include provisions to clarify that each member of the Intelligence Committee must be fully and currently briefed on current activities. Again, I'm pleased that we're able to take and improve this oversight on a bipartisan basis. Republicans and Democrats on the committee both believe that we need this information to be able to effectively do our job. Some work remains to be done to smooth this out. But we have taken the right steps to move this forward. I appreciate the chairman's work to develop this framework for this important reform. 
   I understand and he understands that the executive branch may not like enhanced oversight and that they have expressed their concern about the provisions of the bill that strengthen the oversight process, including congressional notification, increased reporting and auditing. But there is no single current issue on which there is stronger bipartisan consensus on the committee than our concern that the administration is not fulfilling its statutory duty to keep each member of the committee fully and currently informed with respect to certain intelligence matters. 
   In the past year alone, I joined with Chairman Reyes to call on the President to brief the members of the committee with respect to intelligence regarding the al Kibar facility in Syria. The full committee was not briefed until the day the information was subsequently disclosed to the public. The committee was briefed months too late, and we received the information after the media did. On another matter, the administration has refused to brief all members of the committee even though it has briefed five members of the committee staff. It is clear that reforms are necessary. 
   In addition to these legislative provisions, I believe that the classified annex adequately supports our needs in important areas such as human intelligence collection and contains additional provisions to enhance oversight. While I may not agree with each of the specific authorizations, on balance the classified portion of the bill generally reflects consensus on the programmatic requirements needed to protect our national security. 
   Despite these areas of consensus, I must point out that I have concerns with parts of the bill and the action of the Rules Committee not to make certain important amendments in order. I'm disappointed with certain provisions relating to national intelligence space systems. Certain levels of funding fall short, and the bill fails to stimulate a sense of urgency in overhead architecture and shortfalls. In certain areas, it mandates technical solutions without a complete analysis. 
   I also have concern with what I believe is an unnecessarily complex and unwieldy provision to create a new Inspector General of the intelligence  community. While I support the enhancement of oversight for community-wide issues, this provision would significantly duplicate existing efforts and further grow the size of the DNI bureaucracy. I hope that we can continue to improve the bill as it moves through the process. I also hope that we can work to address concerns that have been raised by the intelligence community with respect to section 425 of the bill concerning the use of contractors. 
   Finally, I need to express my strong concern that the Rules Committee did not make in order an amendment I submitted that would prevent funds authorizing the bill from being used to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States. This provision should not be necessary. I believe that the public consensus that trained terrorists should not be brought into the American cities should be clear and overwhelming. However, there is a significant possibility that lawyers may try to argue that trained terrorist detainees should be released on American streets. This would be judicial activism at its worst, unsupported by either clear legal precedent or statutory authority. Congress must send a clear message immediately on this critical issue. We may have the opportunity to do that later today. 
   On balance, this bill is a workable bill. It needs to be improved. And I look forward to seeing exactly how the amendments process moves forward through the day. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   I am looking forward to, and I am glad that we have had such a collegial discussion about the bill, the process that we have gone through in the committee, to get to the point that we are. 
   Obviously, we are going to go through a process of trying to improve this bill while we are here on the floor today. I can look forward to going through that process. I look forward to hopefully passing an improved bill out of the floor, and then look forward to going to conference and hope that we can continue this same kind of partnership in trying to get, not only a bill through the House, but getting it through a conference process and getting a bill to the President that the President will sign. 
   It is important that the Intelligence Committees, that the House and the Senate, put their imprint on the intelligence community. We haven't been able to do that for 3 years. It is important that we do it and that we do it at this time. The intelligence community needs the kind of direction and the parameters that we have established in this bill, to ensure that Congress can do its work, but also that the intelligence community can do its work within a framework that has been established by the Congress.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment. It was originally going to be offered by my colleague, the distinguished Republican whip. He was called to the White House, and I consider it an honor to move this amendment forward on his behalf. 
   The amendment highlights not only the absolute success of the Colombian Government in its rescue of American and Colombian hostages that had been held for years by a narcoterrorist organization, but also the clear successes of the Colombian Government's efforts after years of close cooperation with the United States. 
   I want to take this opportunity to commend President Uribe and the Armed Forces and the National Police of Colombia on their efforts on this rescue and their many successes in implementing Plan Colombia. The amendment emphasizes the strong need to continue our close cooperation to work towards finishing the job in Colombia. We will continue to follow these issues closely and carefully in the committee, and I appreciate the Whip's efforts to focus attention on this important issue. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, at this time I would like to yield myself 1 minute. 
   Again, this is an amendment that talks about the success of the programs that we have been working on in a bipartisan basis with the Colombian Government, highlighted, of course, by the recent rescue of the American and Colombian and other hostages that had been held for years; but more importantly, we have worked in a participative way, in a collaborative way, in a number of different areas, on the diplomatic front, political front, and also on an intelligence and military front and continue to do that, not only to free the hostages but also to make a firm statement against narcotraffickers that the Colombian Government, the U.S. Government, and others are committed to stopping the narcotraffic which is kind of performing and acting as a cancer in both the United States and Colombia. 
   This amendment by Mr. Blunt that I have the privilege of offering recognizes the participation and the work of the various governments, the various agencies, and the various individuals that have enabled this program to be successful. 
   With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 2 minutes to my colleague from Illinois (Mr. Weller).

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   I support this amendment. In the committee, I offered a similar amendment that would have required a revised National Intelligence Estimate on Iran. The discovery of the al Kibar facility in Syria shortly after the original National Intelligence Estimate on Iran came out clearly suggested that prior assessments with respect to proliferation should be reviewed and reevaluated and the confidence level reassessed. 
   The previous NIE on Iran was so poorly drafted and so seriously undermined by subsequent developments in intelligence that I thought it was necessary for the DNI to go back to the drawing board and start over. While my amendment was not successful, I believe that this amendment helps to address the issues I was attempting to raise.  
   Therefore, I will support this amendment. 
   I yield back the balance of my time

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. At this time, I yield myself whatever time I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to prohibit the use of funds in this bill to discourage analysts from using the words ``jihadist,'' ``jihad,'' ``caliphate,'' ``Islamist'' or ``Islamic terrorist'' by or within the intelligence community or the United States Government. 
   We are dealing with an enemy that speaks in no uncertain terms about its desire to attack our homeland and kill innocent Americans. In a statement released in March, Osama bin Laden said the following: 
   ``God, make the mujahedin in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Islamic Maghreb, the Arabian Peninsula, Somalia, Chechnya, and everywhere victorious. God, defeat our enemies of the Jews, the Christians, and their supporters.'' 
   More recently, in May bin Laden said the following: 
   ``O youths of the generation: Jihad is the only way to liberate Palestine and al-Aqsa Mosque and to regain the orthodox caliphate, God willing.'' 
   Al Qaeda itself uses these terms to describe its fight against America, our allies, and moderate Muslims around the world. Why then would we prohibit our intelligence professionals from using the same words to accurately describe al Qaeda's stated goals? 
   Yet that is exactly what some in Washington are attempting to do. I was dismayed to learn that over the past few months, intelligence bureaucrats at the State Department, the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Department of Homeland Security have issued memos imposing speech codes on how their employees can describe al Qaeda and other radical jihadist groups. They won't even be able to use the words these groups use themselves to describe themselves. These agencies within the intelligence community won't be able to use those words. 
   Mr. Chairman, free speech should not be controversial, nor should candid, accurate, and fair discussion of the self-professed goals of the terrorists that attack our homeland and have sworn to kill more Americans. 
   I find it more than ironic that some who have complained the loudest about politicization in the intelligence community would oppose this simple amendment to prevent the politically correct politicization of our Nation's intelligence community. We all know that political correctness can be the enemy of clarity. 
   We also know that radical jihadists have made repeated efforts to stifle free speech in the West, including the murder of Dutch film maker, Theo van Gogh, and frequent death threats against authors, cartoonists, and journalists. 
   Let's not give the radical jihadists a victory here by imposing a speech code on America's intelligence community. 
   With that, I will reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   This is absolutely about political correctness. If we can't use the words that our enemies use to describe themselves and their activities, when they say jihad is the only way to liberate Palestine, and we go to local law enforcement, when we go to others in America and we describe the motivations and the intentions of those who wish to do us harm, I ask my colleagues, how do you expect the intelligence community to explain the behavior or the motivation of our enemies? Do we expect the intelligence community to say these are kind of bad people that may want to do us harm? We can't really use the words that they use to describe themselves because we've restricted the access of those words. 
   How will America understand the nature and the character of our enemy if we can't use the words that they use to describe themselves and we need to come up with a whole new language that is totally out of context with the enemy and the nature of the threat that we face today? 
   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I just need to clarify that the process that was used for the earmarks on this bill did not follow all of the rules that we had agreed upon in the committee and perhaps inconsistent with the Rules of the House. But I do know that they were inconsistent with the agreement that we have in the Intelligence Committee, which is that on a bipartisan basis the chairman and the ranking member would review earmarks, their content, the Member, and would sign off on the appropriateness of each of those earmarks. 
   With the filing of the bill to the Rules Committee, there was at least one earmark that was never brought to my attention and for which I never received a copy of the request from the Member identifying the earmark or a statement from the Member indicating that there was no financial interest along with the earmark. Now, that does not say the earmark is bad. It does not say it was wrong. It is just a process foul in terms of what we had agreed to.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. It is clear that there may be some confusion as to exactly what was or what was not discussed, but the process between staff, the process that is outlined in the committee is clearly that the chairman and the ranking member will go through and review those items that are identified as earmarks, and we will agree on them, and we will agree upon their inclusion in the bill. 
   The bill that was submitted and filed with Rules had at least one, I don't know about the full details, but had at least one earmark that the chairman and myself never discussed and also that, as a ranking member, I had never received what would have been identified as the paperwork that went along with it. The chairman knows that that particular earmark was one that was not discussed as an earmark. I don't think the inclusion and the identification of it as being an earmark in committee when we debated this specific provision was brought up. 
   And so it is a cause of concern. And building on what happened with my colleague from Arizona (Mr. Flake), where the Rules Committee did not identify the earmarks that were part of that bill until 5 hours after the deadline for the Rules Committee, for Members to submit amendments.

And that earmark was not part of that process. When we got the report that accompanied this bill to the Rules Committee, all of a sudden there was a new earmark that you and I had not gone through.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chairwoman, I would like to yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Chairman Reyes, for the cooperative working relationship that we have had as we have gone through this process and as we have developed and built this bill. There are a number of  things in this piece of legislation that I do support, so I appreciate the cooperative working relationship we have had. I appreciate the hard work by the committee on both staffs. 
   You know, it is absolutely important that we provide the Intelligence Community with the information or with the resources, the commitment and the framework with which they can be the tip of the spear to keep us free. We all owe the men and women of the community a deep sense of gratitude for the work that they do each and every day, as they risk their lives to keep us safe. 
   As they well know, let me quote, ``we are in a state of war. And if we have not yet realized that we are in a state of war, when will we realize that''? 
   Some folks may say, well, Pete, what's new? You have been saying that for a long period of time. 
   Actually, I don't believe that, and I don't like to use the term ``war.'' We shouldn't elevate the people that pose this threat to the United States as being soldiers or representing a nation-state. They are thugs. They are murderers, and they are terrorists. 
   These are the words of Ayman al-Zawahiri from an interview that he just gave last week, a video. Those are the words that he says. He says that they are at war. We need to recognize that that is how they view the U.S. and how they view the West. 
   We have continued a number of initiatives that were begun in the last Congress. I feel good about that. Building global collection capabilities, rebuilding HUMINT capabilities, working on the overhaul of the Intelligence Community. 
   But I think we do need to affect and address the weaknesses in this bill. This bill significantly cuts from the President's budget request in a very important area, human intelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency, and cuts that directly affect our efforts in Iraq. 
   I agree with the chairman. Passing the wrong bill sends exactly the wrong message to our troops. Just like saying we are going to pull out of Iraq on a definite date sends the wrong message, sending a bill that cuts the funding for our Intelligence Community in Iraq sends exactly the wrong message. 
   And telling the community that we want to move their priorities from radical Islam, North Korea, Syria, Iran, restructuring the community, rebuilding HUMINT to focusing on a national intelligence estimate on climate change sends exactly the wrong message. As a matter of fact, what the community will tell you is this hearkens back to the exact things that they experienced in the 1990s, a very depressing decade for the Intelligence Community, a dark decade, a decade where budgets were cut, where human intelligence was cut, where we changed rules for human intelligence and said, we are only going to have good-guy spies. It was known as the ``Deutsch doctrine.'' It said, if we have people on the payroll or we are working with people who have human rights records, criminal violations, we are not going to work with them anymore. 
   And the other thing that we did is we did the politically correct thing, is we moved resources to spy on the environment. George Tenet mentions it in his book. He refers to it as those were the days that the community said we were focused on bugs and bunnies. And we are going right back to that. We are doing the politically correct priorities. We are cutting HUMINT, and we are cutting the resources that are directly supporting our efforts in Iraq against a very deadly and a very dangerous enemy. That is the message that we are sending to the agency that says, we are going back to the 1990s. 
   The community doesn't want to go back to the 1990s. They recognize what had happened at that time. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   Madam Chair, I have a great deal of respect for my colleague, but I believe last year, and she can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe she voted against the bill on the floor. And to characterize our disagreement with this bill as partisan, and to, I assume perhaps in another way, characterize her vote against our base bill last year as something else, her vote as something else, is disappointing. 
   We had a good partnership when I was chairman and you were ranking member. I am disappointed by that. I believe this is a well-founded difference of opinion on the content of this bill. There are clear differences in priorities. As the gentlelady said and others have said, we are a Nation that faces a great threat. 
   We saw earlier this week that threat may have evolved and found its way once again to our shores, in New Jersey. We believe we need to strengthen HUMINT and face the threats that are out there. We believe that we can't be working in the politically correct environment. 
   The message that people are looking for in the field is, what direction is this new majority going to take our Intelligence Community? They are seeing cuts in key activities that support the war, the effort against the threat that we face from radical jihadists, and not applying the resources that we need against targets that we don't know enough about. 
   I think we would all agree on a bipartisan basis, we don't know enough about al Qaeda and how it works and where it is and what its resources are and what its plans and intentions are. We don't know enough about Iran, Syria, North Korea and the people that are proliferating and making this world a much more dangerous place. 
   We will see amendments later on from both sides of the aisle that acknowledge that we are not where we want to be with the reorganization of the Intelligence Community. We have lots of questions about where the DNI, the office of the DNI is headed and whether this structure is going to work the way that some of us worked in a very bipartisan way to reform it with a certain expectation and hope, and what we would get as a result of that: An enhanced Intelligence Community that would be quicker, more nimble and more effective than the threats that we face today. And we need to rebuild HUMINT. 
   And at the same time, we see in this bill a commitment that says we are going to task the Intelligence Community, and the question that has not been answered is what specific skills does the Intelligence Community add to the study of climate change when we are already spending $7 billion projected for the next fiscal year on climate change? What secrets are we going to steal? What are we going to task our HUMINT folks for? What are we going to task our limited resources with spy satellites to do? To assess the political, social, agricultural and economic risk during the 30-year period beginning on date of enactment? And don't say it is not going to take resources. This is a massive undertaking. It is not a throw-away. This is Congress coming and saying the most important national intelligence assessment that the community can complete next year, and you need to do it in 180 days; 180 days with no input from the community on whether they have the resources, the capabilities to carry out this task. We are saying that it needs to be done in 180 days. You need to do it on a global basis, and you need to do it over 30 years, and you need to cover all of these different areas. And by the way, we are not going to give you a benchmark from where to start. 
   Are you going to take the U.N.'s assessment of what may be happening with climate change? Are you going to take a university's assessment on climate change? Where do you start? 
   This is a massive undertaking. It will shift resources because when you tell the Director of National Intelligence Congress wants this done, and Congress we know has been dissatisfied with the national intelligence estimates that we have been given on Iraq and Iran and on a number of other issues, they know they need to get this one right or it better be a very, very good piece of work. They will take this very, very seriously. They will divert resources to get this done, and they will divert resources from the things that we need them to be doing. 
   This bill sends the wrong message to our men and women in the field. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   As we have already talked about a number of times in general debate, the base bill includes a provision that directs the Director of National Intelligence to complete a national intelligence estimate on climate change where they shall assess the political, social, agricultural and economic risk during the 30-year period beginning at the date of enactment of this act posed by global climate change. 
   This is a global study, 30 years, and it is very clear what we want to do with this amendment. We want to make sure that the Intelligence Community stays focused on its priorities which is the threat from radical jihadists, the proliferation and the threats posed by Iran, Syria, North Korea and other countries that over this 30-year period may participate in proliferation, the restructuring of the Intelligence Community, and the rebuilding of HUMINT. 
   These are the key priorities that the Intelligence Community and the Intelligence Committees have been focused on over the last number of years. We need to continue that focus rebuilding this community, rebuilding the resources and the capabilities while, as it was discussed, the information that is going to be used is public information. The direction in the bill says it will be a public report, so the real question comes: What specific value does the Intelligence Community add to this process that makes it so important that we will divert resources from other key priorities to climate change?     
   Why can't this be done in other areas of the government where it is already being done, areas that have already been allocated and been spending dollars in these areas over a number of years in what is projected to be over $7 billion of expenditure in these areas in 2008?

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   I think as you listen to the discussion, the question almost answers itself because the primary question hasn't been answered: Exactly what are we going to task our spy satellites to do? Exactly what are we going to task our human collectors to do? 
   The statistics are very, very obvious in terms of climate change, and there's lots of different, competing ones. Exactly what secrets, with limited resources, are we going to task the intelligence community to go out and collect? And precious analysts that are taking a look at northern Africa and trying to determine exactly what the footprint is of al Qaeda in Algeria and Morocco, Nigeria, other parts of Africa, are we going to ask the CIA stations in those areas to take their time and dedicate it to studying climate change for the next 6 months? It's a totally new task. 
   We have a community that at this point is not even a global community. So we are going to dedicate precious resources instead of expanding the reach of our intelligence community into places where we are not at today, the bigger emphasis is going to be giving them a totally new and different assignment? 
   Instead of tasking our satellites to take a look at exactly what the proliferation capabilities are in China or North Korea, we are going to task them to look somewhere else even though that same kind of capabilities may be available from commercial imagery? Exactly what information does the intelligence community, I mean, it's our business to steal secrets, to find out what the plans and intentions are of those who want to attack the United States. This is information. 
   There are hundreds and probably thousands of people that are very skilled at investigating climate change, predicting what may happen in certain regions of the country and certain regions of the planet, and they are not in the intelligence community. These people have their plate full. The threats are real. We should not diminish the threats. The information is in the public. These are two missions that do not come together. 
   Studying climate change can be done by other government agencies. Stealing the secrets of al Qaeda and North Korea, Iran, other parts of the world, that is the job of the intelligence community. Let them focus on the job that we need them to do. Support this amendment and strike this National Intelligence Estimate.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chairman, as I indicated, I agree with the gentleman's amendment, and I will vote for his amendment. However, I wish that as we were talking about leaks that we were discussing this in a much broader context. 
   The issue of leaks has been something that has been plaguing the community for an extended period of time, so we were not just talking about the leaks of personal identities. We would be talking about the leaks of programs and tactics and strategies that were being used by the intelligence community and used effectively to keep America safe. 
   We have had far too many leaks of highly classified information, and some of us would believe that as you take a look at some of these leaks, some would say that they perhaps have been made for political purposes. 
   The gentleman's focus on the identities of covert CIA officers is commendable, but should include the loss of capabilities because of other leaks as well.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I reluctantly rise in opposition to the amendment, recognizing that it's very similar to an amendment that we actually accepted last year. And the reason we reluctantly accepted it last year, we had a high degree of confidence that if we got into a conference, we would be able to work with the author of the amendment to take a look at it and to make sure that what was finally in a conference report in a bill that we were looking forward to sending to the President would make sure that we took care of some the redundancies and some of the burdensome elements of the amendment. And without necessarily having that same assurance this year, I reluctantly oppose the amendment. 
   I think that it is absolutely critical that we do measure the accountability and the performance of our contractors, but much like last year, we are concerned about the redundancy, the bureaucracy that may result if this amendment becomes law in its present form. It could add significant cost to the contractors as they serve and provide services to the Intelligence Community. 
   So I hope as we go through this process that we will be able to make sure that we work on a bipartisan basis, that we work with the community, that we work with the ODNI to structure this in such a way that both of the requirements are met, that we see and get the performance and, at the same time, that we don't burden contractors or the ODNI with additional bureaucracy. 
   With that, I'll yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chairman, I will yield myself as much time as I shall consume. 
   There's no doubt that the Air America's personnel deserve the recognition for the service that they provided during these critical times in our country in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. 
   But it's very interesting to me that, at this time, as we're considering other amendments, and much of the debate that I hear about contractors and our use of contractors today, contractors are getting hammered each and every day. And then we step back and say, well, you know, we ought to take a look at the contractors of 50 years ago, and we maybe now ought to provide them with government benefits. 
   And I just wonder whether, in 50 years, we'll look back at the service that is being provided by contractors today that in many different areas is not being very well received, and whether we will then recognize the service that they're providing. I hope that we do. 
   But, under this, under the terms of Air America, legally these individuals did not qualify for government benefits. We need to make sure that we deal in a way that is fair, especially to the people that are serving as contractors today. And we need to make sure that we have a consistent pattern of how we deal with contractors in this way, recognizing that their pay comes from a private sector entity, and be very careful about when and where we are going to involve the Federal Government in picking up responsibilities of private corporations.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding and I am thankful for his support and help on this amendment. 
   I would also like to thank my colleague from Michigan for bringing this amendment together. I think we both recognize the importance of this amendment. My congressional district, I think we kind of represent God's country. I represent about 200 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline. I don't think I want to get into an argument with my colleague from Michigan as to how much shoreline he represents from the Great Lakes, but it is well in excess of that number. 
   But we both have recognized that the current Corps guidelines present a distinct hardship to our communities, many of the communities along the Great Lakes. We don't meet the newest guidelines that establish the roughly 1 million tons or whatever of cargo that need to flow through a harbor. And this is a change in the Corps' position. For the last 14 years that my colleague and I have been in Congress, the Corps has done a very, very good job and recognized its responsibility for taking care of these small and medium-sized harbors which they classify as recreational harbors. 
   But they are much more than recreational harbors. For many of our communities they do, we do transfer cargo through these ports, but the harbors form the economic development zone for these communities. And if the harbors and the channels are not dredged, this economic lifeline goes away. And when the economic lifeline goes away, eventually these communities go away. 
   This is a policy that Congress needs to address because, from a disappointing standpoint, the administration has made an administrative decision that these harbors will not be taken care of. Congress needs to speak on this issue. I am glad that we can move this forward in a bipartisan basis and send a piece of legislation to the administration that no longer provides them with the latitude as to whether these harbors will be dredged or not. These harbors need to be dredged. They will be dredged. This is exactly the appropriate message to send. 
   I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for taking the initiative in bringing this legislation forward.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, today our Nation is engaged in a struggle with a brutal and cold-blooded enemy, cold-blooded killers. These are the kinds of folks who will kill people on an airplane and fly it into buildings. They will drive a car through a checkpoint, step out of the car, leave the kids in the back seat, and blow it up. They will attack civilians rather than military targets. 
   It is utter folly to believe that by establishing timelines and saying we are going to pull out today or at some specified date in the future, to believe that by doing that they will evaporate and they will leave us alone. 
   Maybe it is another good cop-bad cop type of ploy being employed by individuals on the other side of the aisle when the majority leader in the other body today declares the war is lost, conceding that al Qaeda has won. Is the other side willing to concede that al Qaeda has won in Iraq, that they have won in Algeria, that they have won in Morocco, that they have won in Afghanistan and that they have won in Pakistan? 
   When do they believe is the most appropriate time to confront the enemy that we face today, if we are not willing to confront them in Iraq, if we are not willing to confront them in northern Africa and the other parts of the Middle East or Asia? Are we going to once again wait until they come to the United States? 
   This is hard and it is tough, but these are cold-blooded, ruthless killers. It is probably inappropriate to call this a war, because the people that we're fighting don't deserve the term of ``soldier'' or ``warriors.'' They are outlaws, they are criminals, and we cannot concede this to them, like the majority leader in the other body did today. Today, he sent a powerful signal to the rest of the world and to our allies that al Qaeda has won and we have lost. How will our allies respond to that message? 
   This motion to recommit is at least a little bit better in that it says we haven't lost, but we're willing to soon surrender and give up this fight. It is a fight that we can't afford to lose. It is a fight that we need to win. 
   Take a look at what they said. This is in their playbook. Defeat this motion to recommit.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I would like to yield myself the balance of my time. 
   In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the President, the leaders of Congress, faced a very difficult situation: to learn more and to better understand the threat that America now faced. They recognized that we needed to move from a mentality of being law enforcement to a mentality of prevention, that we needed to confront, contain, and ultimately defeat radical jihadists if America was going to stay safe. 
   The President, the leaders of Congress, many of whom spoke today, huddled together and talked about the various strategies that they could implement to get a better understanding of this organization called al Qaeda, its leaders, its intentions, and its capabilities. 
   Overarching in their discussions were making sure that the Constitution and the rule of law would guide their behaviors. As they considered various alternatives and discussed these, they implemented a terrorist surveillance program using the capabilities that in many cases are unique to America that could give us insights into al Qaeda, its leadership, and its intentions. 
   It's not the President's program. This program was put together by the President in consultation, sure, with members of his cabinet, but also, very importantly, with consultation on a bipartisan basis with the leaders of Congress. 
   These leaders in Congress were consistently briefed about how the program would work, the kinds of information that was being obtained, and how it was being used to keep America safe, all the while placing a responsibility on yes, the President, but also the leaders of Congress to make sure that the intel community was doing the things it was being asked and was being asked to do things that would be legal. 
   The intel community has performed very well. They have gotten us information that has enabled us to keep America safe. The intel community, this administration, and Congress asked other parts of our economy to participate, private sector companies. They stood up and they did the job to keep America safe. Congress did the necessary job of doing oversight, and in 2004, we reformed the intelligence community. 
   So since 9/11, many things have been done properly. The end result, as we've gone through this process, is that we have kept America safe. 
   I congratulate the Speaker, I congratulate the majority leader, I congratulate my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, Mr. Smith, for working in a bipartisan basis to recognize what needed to be done in allowing this bill to come to the floor and continue to move forward in a slightly different way than how we've been moving forward over the last 6 years. But the most important thing is in a bipartisan basis, we have come together on a national security issue to give our intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, later on, my colleague from California will make a motion to defeat the previous question, as the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) indicated. That will then enable us to address a very serious issue, the problem that, right now, we are blind and deaf to people who may want to attack the United States. 
   As Secretary Chertoff indicated earlier this week, all of the indications are that we still remain very, very vulnerable. The chatter, the signals, indicate more clearly that America is still at risk. And it is not only the chatter. All you really need to do is take a look at what al Qaeda says. They are clear on their intent to attack the United States again. 
   Take a look at what happened in the U.K. 2 weeks ago. Planned attacks in the heart of London, a planned attack at an airport indicate that al Qaeda and radical jihadists want to attack the U.K.; they want to attack in Europe, and they want to attack us in the United States. 
   One of the things that needs to be clear is that what has helped keep us safe is our intelligence community. And as our ability to gain information has changed and adapted over the last couple of years, it has become even more clear that FISA needs to be updated, and FISA needs to be updated now. It needs to be done before we go home in August because if we expect to stay safe, we need to make sure that our intelligence community has all of the tools at its disposal to identify risks, to identify potential terrorists and to identify individuals who want to do us harm. 
   FISA should not be used to protect international terrorists. It should not be used to protect radical jihadists. It should not be used as a screen to protect members of al Qaeda. Remember, FISA was designed in the 1970s, designed to handle a Cold War surveillance of countries like the Soviet Union. Back then and into the 1980s and early 1990s, our intelligence community only needed to be one step faster than the former Soviet Union. We didn't have to be that fast. And the risks and the threats were not as real or as immediate to our homeland as what they are today. 
   Today our intelligence community needs to be one, two, three steps faster than radical jihadists, radical jihadists who use technology and who use the Internet and who use the communications world of today to drive their message and to plan their attacks. We need to be able to penetrate into it and penetrate into it very effectively.     
   Now is the time to modernize FISA. Now is the time to make sure that the intelligence community has the capability to identify the threats and the individuals who may want to attack the United States and make sure that they are in a position to identify these threats and get this information to our law enforcement individuals in the United States in a seamless way. 
   We've made progress in a number of areas in intelligence reform. There's still much work to do, but one of the areas that we have not done is update FISA. 
   Defeat the previous question and allow for the modernization of FISA now.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague from Arizona for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, as I listen to the debate today, I end up having a lot of more questions than I have answers. I have a question as to whether my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that the threat from radical jihadism is real or not. Have they read the latest Zawahiri statement, ``Advice of One Concerned,'' where he goes on to say in the statement, a global system, whose center and heart is the United States and the European Union? As for the rest of the states of the world, they are the outlying states. 
   It goes on to say, the strategy of al Qaeda, the only way to confront them, the core states, according to al Qaeda's theory, is by taking the war from the outlying states to the central states, in which case the damage and consequences of this damage will all take place in the central states. 
   Have they not read the other documents that come from al Qaeda that talk about what their strategy is? Their number one goal and objective is to defeat the United States and the coalition in Iraq, then to move out into the region and destabilize the other countries in the region, eliminate the State of Israel, establish the caliphate, Southern Europe, Northern Africa, the Middle East, stretch down into Asia and then establish Sharia law. 
   Do my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe that radical Islam is a threat to the security of the United States and our allies, or not? If they don't, perhaps pulling out of Iraq is a good strategy. If they do believe that radical jihadism is a threat to the United States, if they do believe that looking at the reports in London, in Europe that radical jihadists actually have attacked in those places and that they may be attacking in the United States or planning to attack in the United States, the question becomes, if you are not willing to fight the threat of radical jihadism in Iraq, where will you engage radical jihadism, in other parts of the Middle East? Should we deploy our troops to other parts of the Middle East? Maybe we should just write off the Middle East and deploy into Northern Africa or into Western Europe, or maybe what we should do is bring them all home and redeploy them here in the United States, because they will follow us home. 
   So the question is, if you do believe it is a threat, where and when will you confront the threat that we face? Others have pointed it out. I have taken a look and read this resolution. I encourage all of the American people to read this bill. What does it say? Very, very little. It says that we will commence reductions of our troops. Commence reductions. 
   Exactly how many do you want to commence reducing? 100? 5,000? 50,000? Then by April 1 there will be a plan for a limited presence. What is ``limited presence''? There are some that would say that the number of troops we have today is a limited presence, because they may not be enough to get the job done. But the bill doesn't define where we go. This is no plan. 
   If this is the way forward, we are in big, big trouble, because it doesn't recognize the threat and it doesn't have a plan as to how we are going to move forward. 
   But there are other things that this Congress should be debating. As our minority whip said, we debated for 45 minutes as to whether cats should be declawed before moving into public housing. 
   The previous question that was defeated earlier today would have enabled us to deal with a real issue, and that is the modernization of FISA, our ability to listen to radical jihadists in other parts of the world as they are communicating their plans and intentions. Today, there is a massive loophole in FISA for radical jihadists who are outside of the United States to communicate, and our intelligence community is prohibited from listening to them. We provide them the full protection of American law, even though they are not United States citizens, even though they are outside of the United States, and even though they are radical jihadists. Let us fix this problem, and let's make sure that we fix it before we go home in August. We should have done it today.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Chairman, you know it's a good day today where we have the opportunity to go back and reauthorize the Corporation for National and Community Service. This is a program that 15 years ago is a program that I supported, and I'm glad that this Congress is going to take the steps to move this program forward and continue the efforts in this area. 
   However, if we're really going to protect the Corporation for National and Community Service, if we are really going to protect the individuals that are working in these types of programs, what we should have been doing today and what we should do is we should extend the terrorist surveillance program. We should pass FISA modernization. 
   You know, 3 weeks ago the majority said that this bill would come to the floor. They needed a 3-week extension to get the bill done. That expires this week. 
   We're going to have a long day today. We'll be here till 2 or 3 o'clock, which I think will be the third week in a row where we will go home early and we will not take care of this vital national security issue. 
   We've had a 6-month extension, we had a 2-week extension. The program now has lapsed for 3 weeks. Each and every day our capabilities erode just a little bit more. And each and every day we remove these capabilities to track foreign terrorists by our Intelligence Community, each and every day America becomes a little bit more vulnerable. Americans living at home, people in this program, our men and women in uniform in Afghanistan and in Iraq, they're a little bit more vulnerable. Our embassy personnel around the world are a little bit more vulnerable. 
   Earlier this week the statement was made, well, you know, we'd maybe like to do FISA this week but the schedule is just too full. We're not going to have the opportunity to get to it. We're not going to have the opportunity to get to it. We're going to be done working some time in the middle of the afternoon and we're going to leave a national security issue laying on the table for the third week in a row? 
   Will the majority deal with this issue next week? Will they deal with it before we go on recess? Or will they allow it to lapse for 6 weeks? How vulnerable does America need to become before the majority decides to act on FISA? 
   I just wonder if the majority's even looking at what's going on around the world, taking a look at the attacks that are taking place in Pakistan, taking a look at the attacks that are happening in Afghanistan, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out of Iran, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out from al Qaeda in Iraq, listening to the rhetoric that's coming out of Hezbollah in Syria and in Lebanon. There are threats against our allies. There are threats against Western Europe. There are threats against our friends in Northern Africa. There are threats against Western Europe, and yes, there are threats against the United States of America. 
   They're not listening to what al Qaeda and radical jihadists and other terrorists are saying. They're not reading what these individuals are saying, because if you were listening to what they were saying, if you were reading what they were writing, and if you were watching what they were doing, you would understand that the threat is real and that it is a grave mistake to  allow this intelligence tool and to allow other intelligence tools to erode continually. 
   Yes, America's more vulnerable today than it was 3 weeks ago. America is more vulnerable today than it was 14 months ago because, on national security issue after national security issue, the other side refuses to give our intelligence community the tools that they need to keep America safe. These tools have developed. 
   They've evolved. They've been working very, very well in protecting America. But for the last 14 months, the majority has not only let these tools evolve and deteriorate, in many cases they've been under direct attack from the majority. Today our intelligence community is paying a price because they do not have the tools necessary to keep America safe. Hopefully, America will not pay a price because the intelligence community hasn't been given the tools by the majority to keep America safe. 
   It's time to bring the Senate bill to the floor. This is a bill that has widespread support, passed by 68 votes in the Senate, supported by a majority of the Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate. 
   Bring that bill to the House. Bring it up right after the GIVE Act. Make sure that we've got the tools in place to keep America safe and to keep the people working in this program and other programs safe.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. I thank my colleague. And I thank all of my colleagues for talking about this important issue. 
   You know, we've been talking about this now for over 7 months. Last August, we passed a 6-month extension. That 6-month extension expired at the beginning of February. We passed a 2-week extension. We got to the end of that, and then the Democratic majority said, well, let's do a 3-week extension. And we said, no, we need to do a comprehensive fix. We need to fix FISA long term. We need to do the telecommunications companies. And then they said, well, we can do that in 3 weeks. An hour ago marked the end of the third week of legislating. 
   They were never serious about getting this done, and they wouldn't have gotten it done when they said they would. At the beginning of this week they said, well, we're not going to get to it this week because our legislative agenda is just too packed full. Here we are at 10 after 4 and our packed legislative agenda means the House stopped business at 3 o'clock.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Unbelievable. But now 5 weeks ago, when we started into this process one more time, we said exactly what my colleague was highlighting, both my colleagues, the terrorists have not stopped. They continue their attacks in Pakistan. Five weeks ago is when they had some major bombings in Pakistan just before the elections. They had the major bombing in Afghanistan. But we also then started hearing from al Qaeda in Iraq saying they wanted to use Iraq to do what? Do you remember? Al Qaeda in Iraq said, we want to use it as a base to attack Jerusalem. 
   And then a major terrorist died in Lebanon. We're not sure exactly what the circumstances were. Some think it's Israel, some others say it might have been Hezbollah itself. But one of the key leaders of Hezbollah passed away, and the statement from  Hezbollah then was, ``we're going to hold Israel accountable.'' And what happened today? Martyr Mughniyah, within the last hour, a TV station affiliated with Hezbollah, said this group may not be affiliated with Hezbollah, but the group, Martyr Mughniyah, as far as we can tell, a new terrorist group, along with the Gaza Martyrs' Group, which may also be a new terrorist group, claim responsibility for the Jerusalem operation. 
   So, with the events of the last 5 weeks, some new identified terrorist groups have popped up. And most likely, if there is any intelligence that our allies, because we said, who is going to be vulnerable by our diminished capabilities? It's going to be America's homeland. It's going to be our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is our embassies around the world, and potentially our allies. With what al Qaeda in Iraq and what the various organizations have now said after the death of Mughniyah, these are new terrorist groups.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. We might have. But the key thing here is if these are new terrorist groups that we didn't know about before, guess what? And our allies, the Israelis, got meaningful intelligence about this group. The law on surveillance would be the law that was in place on 9/10/01, the very law that the President, his national security advisers, our current Speaker of the House, bipartisan leadership in the House and Senate all said would not work. Another example within the last hour. All right. Dynamic situation. 
   And remember, I think we all know that intelligence only works when you do it in a timely way. You know, 2-year-old intelligence is no longer intelligence; it's data. It's information for historical purposes. To keep America safe, intelligence has to be real-time, and the only law didn't do it. 
   Again, when we talked about what potential threats would be, 5 weeks ago we said, you know, there have been people who have been arrested because they were going to allegedly murder the Danish cartoonist. There was a plot in Denmark to do this. And I said, well, that's interesting. But there is another threat on the horizon. Dutch TV refuses to show anti-Koran film as terror alert is raised. What is this? We've known for quite some time that a Dutch parliamentarian was going to do a video on Islam, his interpretation of Islam. I'm not saying whether it's right, whether it's wrong, but as a parliamentarian you would think that he could have the opportunity to express his views on Islam in a country that, I think in Rotterdam now the most popular baby's name is Muhammad. But he was going to give his views of Islam and was preparing a video. And there were allegations that there might be some things that were inflammatory in this video, people saying he might burn the Koran. Who knows. We don't know what's in it. 
   But the Dutch Government now, it just came out that the Dutch, we knew this video was in development, not knowing what was in it, but the Dutch now, the TV networks have refused to show it. But he may release this film on the Internet, which has caused the Dutch, again, a very firm and strong ally in Afghanistan in the war against radical jihadists, the Dutch have gone on a high terror alert.     
   If there are groups, new groups that form as a reaction to this new video, the old law will apply. Our hands will be tied behind our back. Our intelligence community will be limited in its ability to help the Dutch protect their assets. And as we have known from the past, when radical jihadists have an opportunity like this, they don't just focus in on a particular country. They use it as an opportunity to go after modern Islamic regimes in the Middle East, countries in northern Africa, all of Europe, not just the Dutch, and the Americans. But if there are new groups that haven't been identified before, the old rules apply, which means we are more vulnerable. 
   It is absolutely unconscionable that here we are 3 weeks later and once again we are going home without dealing with this. And it's not because of a heavy workload. It's because they don't want to do what the Senate has done. 
   The Senate passed a great bill, 68 votes, bipartisan. And we all know how hard it is to get 68 votes in the U.S. Senate today. But a broad bipartisan bill that gave our intelligence community the tools that they needed, and it gave to the telecommunications companies the help that they needed to do their work. 
   I mean, it's absolutely unacceptable to have one of our colleagues up here today to talk about the intelligence community. Remember the last debate on the last bill, not talking about what our intelligence community is doing to protect American lives. And American intelligence officials, people working in our intelligence community, have lost their lives keeping America safe, and our friends on the other side say what? They're Big Brother. Well, you know what? They're Big Brother, but they are not big brothering America. They're focused on one thing: finding radical jihadists. 
   But these folks belittle the effort of our intelligence community and give the American people the impression that our intelligence community is just looking for ways to destroy Americans' civil liberties. I have met with these people. I know they're focused on a couple of things: protecting Americans' civil liberties as they keep America safe. And to belittle the work of our intelligence community is absolutely unacceptable, and it's really an embarrassment that those kinds of comments are made on the floor of this House.

   Mr. HOEKSTRA. That's exactly right. The individuals in our government. This was never the administration's program. It was never the President Bush program. This was always the American Government's program, because the administration identified what we needed to do and how we could do it and they went to the bipartisan leadership of the House and the Senate, a small group, because if you have these kinds of capabilities, you don't  want it broadcast to al Qaeda and radical jihadists about what your capabilities are. You want to use it as an effective tool. But on a bipartisan basis, the leadership of the House and the Senate and the leadership on a bipartisan basis of the Intelligence Committees in the House and Senate signed off on these programs. 
   The current Speaker of the House was briefed four times in the 8, 9 months immediately after 9/11, and you know what? Number one, now she's not bringing to the floor the very changes that she supported in the aftermath of 9/11, but the companies that we went to and asked them for their help. And when these companies said we know the administration is supportive of this, have Members of Congress been informed, the administration could truthfully say, yes, they have been briefed. They've been informed. They know what we're going to ask you to do, what information we expect to get and how we expect that to keep America safe. They're now throwing them under the bus. 
   But the more important thing is the urgency of today. We need these companies to help us. They help us all the time. And we're having a chilling effect on these types of American businesses that in many ways are helping us in basic law enforcement activities, not only radical jihadists but basic law enforcement, because they're now being told if you help us, recognize that in many cases we're going to throw you to the wolves, which in this case are the trial lawyers. 
   I appreciate my colleagues having this discussion and debate. Thank you very much for allowing me to be a part of this. I need to get going. I was hoping I could say I'm going to a meeting where we are going to work out the final details on FISA, but now that's not the case. I've got to go to a different type of meeting. But thank you very much for furthering the effort on this very, very important issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Mr. Speaker, I think the last speaker set the perfect tone for what I'd like to talk about. He talked about the threat from al Qaeda and that high on their list is their desire to explode a nuclear weapon in the United States. I think their quote goes something along the lines, if, by the grace of God, we get access to a nuclear weapon, we will use it. 
   We know that in their writings they talk about they want to move the violence from what they call the outlying areas of the world, from the Middle East, from northern Africa, from Asia, and they want to move it to the core countries. And they define the core countries as being Western Europe and the United States. It's clear that they want to take every opportunity to attack the United States. And it's great to see one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle acknowledge that threat. Sometimes I really believe, with the strategies that they are proposing, as to whether that threat is really perceived. 
   So what are we going to do in this bill? 
   I find it very ironic that as we move forward with this bill, we're going to give radical jihadists and al Qaeda more information about our Intelligence Community than what they have today. This bill says that we're going to tell al Qaeda, radical jihadists, and our enemies around the world exactly how much we spend in the intelligence community. If that makes us safe or makes us safer, I suppose that the next strategy will be, let's break it down and outline how much we spend in every category. Because if telling them the total number makes us safer, giving them even more detail probably makes us more safe, makes us safer yet. 
   Why would we want to tell al Qaeda more about what we are doing in the intelligence community? 
   And then the other question is, while we tell al Qaeda more about what our strategies and tactics are to confront them, we don't deal with the most pressing homeland security issue that we face today. Our intelligence community has significant gaps as we try to listen and determine what their plans and objectives and strategies are. 
   The Director of National Intelligence recently sent our committee a letter saying significant gaps exist in our intelligence. The National Intelligence Estimate that came out in the last week says that we are at a heightened level of threat. Things are more dangerous perhaps in the United States today than they were earlier this year. We've had this information since the middle of April, that because of changing circumstances and various other issues, this intelligence gap exists. We have this opportunity to change it. 
   So we know that we are at a heightened threat level. We know that there are gaps in intelligence. We are on the verge of passing this major bill, and we decide we're going to take this opportunity. We're going to use this as an opportunity to give radical jihadists more information about our Intelligence Community. But we are not, we are not going to provide the intelligence community with the legislation and with the opportunity and the authority to go in and listen to foreign intelligence by foreign terrorists who are located outside of the United States. They are in foreign countries. 
   I would encourage every single one of my colleagues to read the letter that Director McConnell sent to our Intelligence Committee. It is unclassified. You can see clearly in his statement that a gap does exist, that he does need to get a warrant, and that this is about foreign intelligence on foreign terrorists.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HOEKSTRA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment that we're going to go into another weekend not having addressed the threat from radical jihadism. 
   Just moments ago, this House passed a 9/11 bill supposedly to increase the security and the safety of the United States of America. But since April 12, our national Director of Intelligence, the position that was created in the Intelligence Reform Act earlier in 2004 to specifically provide us with information about the threats to the United States, this organization that was put together to make our intelligence community more effective, the Director of National Intelligence has reported to this Congress now for almost 4 months that there are significant intelligence gaps at the same time while we are a Nation at greater threat than perhaps any time since 9/11. 
   In a letter that Director McConnell recently sent to the Intelligence Committee in an unclassified version, he highlights a situation in which our intelligence community every day is missing a significant portion of what we should be getting in order to protect the American people. He goes on and says this is about foreign intelligence, about foreign targets overseas, and that to collect this kind of an intelligence, what he needs to do is he needs to get a court order. Now, think about this; we need to get a court order to listen to an alleged terrorist, who may be in Pakistan, may be in Afghanistan, but we know that they're outside of the U.S. borders, so it's foreign intelligence about a foreign terrorist outside of the United States, and we need to go get a court order to listen to that conversation at a time when we know that we are at heightened risk. 
   Isn't it ironic that as we pass a 9/11 bill, in the 9/11 bill that we passed this afternoon, the 9/11 bill gives al Qaeda and radical jihadis more information about the United States and about our intelligence community than what they had before. The 9/11 bill says we are going to reveal our top-line spending on intelligence. If we believe that revealing our spending at a macro level on intelligence makes us safer, maybe we should just give radical jihadis a breakdown of how we spend all of our money. 
   So on a 9/11 bill we're going to say, you know, because of leaks in the intelligence community, leaks to the press, we've already told you about our Terrorist Surveillance Program, we've already talked with you and given you details about how we do financial tracking, we've talked to you about interrogations, we've talked to you about prisons and all these types of things, and now we're also going to tell you how much money we spend on intelligence on an annual basis. And remember, just about everybody agrees that the tip of the spear in keeping America safe is how effective our intelligence community is. And now we're going to give them more information about our intelligence community, and at the same time, while our Director of National Intelligence for 4 months has been telling us that there are gaps in our intelligence, significant gaps in our ability to get information about what foreign terrorists may be planning against the United States, at a time when we know that one of their highest priorities is to attack the homeland again. 
   And this is not only about their intentions to attack the United States, but remember, if there is a foreign terrorist in Afghanistan talking to a foreign jihadist or radical terrorist in Iraq and that communications may in some way come through the United States, that information will not even be available for our combat troops in Iraq or in Afghanistan. Not only are we blind for homeland security, we are also handicapping our troops who are on the front lines each and every day. We're not even getting them the information that they could use on a tactical basis to protect themselves, but also to identify where the radical jihadists are, where al Qaeda might be in Iraq, and what they may be up to in Iraq or in Afghanistan or in the United States or in Western Europe, wherever. And the most concerning thing is that we may not even deal with this before we go on recess next week. This needs to be fixed before we go on recess.
