<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (STEM CELL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - June 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, Expanding Stem Cell Research. 
   During the recorded vote on this important bill, I was required to be back in my home district to assist my mother, who is having surgery. 
   I believe stem cell research holds enormous promise for easing human suffering. Embryonic stem cell research could lead to cures that could dramatically improve lives. However, it is important to note that while I disagree with the creation of human embryos for scientific purposes, I agree that embryos created as a by-product of in vitro fertilization, which would otherwise be destroyed, should be allowed to provide greater insight into the myriad afflictions that can potentially be alleviated through stem cell research. 
   As with all scientific endeavors, we must ensure that the limitless bounds of science do not infringe on the beliefs that we hold as ethical human beings. For this reason, I categorically oppose the harvesting of embryos for scientific research as well as any attempt to use our scientific knowledge to clone human beings. 
   I would like the RECORD to reflect that I have been and will continue to be supportive of Stem Cell Research and that I would have voted yea had I been present. Federal support is critical to its success which is why I will continue to support ethical Stem Cell Research.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, invasive animal and plant species know no boundaries. That is why I introduced H.R. 658, the Natural Resource Protection Cooperative Agreement Act. 
   The passage of this legislation today has significance to my district, given the recent infestation at Lake Mead of quagga mussels. These are a species capable of causing massive destruction and billions of dollars in damages. The quagga mussel is a resilient species that multiplies at exponential rates and can cause enormous ecological, recreational, and economic damage. In recent years, the mussel has caused an estimated $5 billion in damages to the Great Lakes region. 
   As the law currently exists, the National Park Service does not have the legal authority to enter into cooperative agreements with neighboring States and local governments or private entities. Rather, the Park Service  must wait until invasive species cross into their lands and waterways before they can be dealt with. 
   Part of responsible stewardship of our local environment is being proactive and not merely responsive to new ecological challenges. H.R. 658 enables the National Park Service to take preventative measures in order to preserve our lands and natural resources. 
   By entering into cooperative agreements with State and local experts, we will be able to eradicate invasive species before they encroach onto Federal lands. We have an obligation to our children and to our community to be responsible stewards of our local environment. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working in a bipartisan manner on this very important issue. 
   I also want to thank my constituent Ann Schreiber in Nevada who has worked so hard to eradicate invasive plant life in my district and recognizes the importance of meeting these challenges head-on. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate this opportunity. I'd like to thank my colleagues, Congresswoman SHELLEY BERKLEY from Nevada and Congressman DEAN HELLER for being cosponsors. 
   I'd like to talk for a moment about the infamous Yucca Mountain project, probably the most studied piece of real estate on the planet as we know it today. That is because the Department of Energy and Members of this Congress are trying to prove to the American people that the Yucca Mountain project is safe. 
   Unfortunately, in the last budget of last year, 60 percent of that budget was spent redoing problems with a broken project at Yucca Mountain. 
   Mr. Chairman, it's broken. Study after study after study have proven that it's a broken project; not only broken, but it's a colossal waste of taxpayers' dollars. Thousands, if not millions of millions of dollars have been spent on investigating the Yucca Mountain project to look at their flaws. 
   My committee last year alone, we looked at thousands of e-mails where the science had been falsified. They've spent over $20 million fixing the project from the research that we had done in my committee. 
   Mr. Chairman, if it was Wall Street that was looking at this project, they would shut it down. Most every senior management personnel at Yucca Mountain and the Department of Energy regarding the disposal of nuclear waste have either quit or left the project. 
   Terrorism is another issue. We're trying to put millions and millions of tons of nuclear waste in one spot. It creates an additional terrorist target. 
   It's an unproven science, but yet we're going to roll this nuclear waste through communities across our country. 
   Mr. Chairman, the bottom line, even if I supported the project, which I don't, even if I was a nuclear industry, which I'm not, I would say it's the biggest waste of taxpayers' dollars. It's literally a hole in the ground. 
   I would encourage that Members of this Congress visit Yucca Mountain. It is a $12 billion waste of money. If I were the nuclear industry, if I were this Congress, I would find another site. I would store it on site or find some other location. 
   The science is broken. Time and time again, we have found that it's a flawed project, it's flawed science. If it were another project, if it was a school bus, if was a space shuttle, with this many errors and this many problems we would stop the project. 
   I encourage this Congress to support my amendment striking $202 million from this very flawed project.     
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I would like to compliment our chairman and ranking member and other Members of this body who have worked very hard to try to help families and working individuals across the country. 
   I would like to talk a little bit about the State of Nevada and some of the challenges that we are facing. State economists today say that they expect that next year our unemployment rate in Nevada should rise to about 8.6 percent and stay there through 2010, a striking example of why we need to pass this legislation. As a Congress, we have failed to pass a comprehensive energy bill, which has caused us serious challenges in Nevada. But let me talk about some of the specifics. 
   Individuals are not traveling to Nevada as they used to, although now is the time to travel. We have some of the best bargains in the world. But I can assure you that because of the cost of living, the cost of fuel, with the highest foreclosure rate in the country in my district alone, we are having some major impacts occur on our families. We need to find a way to help these families immediately, and I applaud Congress for its actions today, for the relief package for millions of Americans. This is one more step to help those working families. 
   As I mentioned, we are facing serious economic challenges in Nevada. We have had three bank failures to date, and I have heard from numerous families over and over again and their neighbors and friends as to the impact of the bank foreclosures. 
   We need to find additional action. This is it. Again, I applaud my colleagues here in Congress for having the foresight, and to the chairman, I appreciate it.

   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, according to 2006 data, nationally, 799,000 children have spent at least 24 hours in foster care and, on any given day, roughly 510,000 children were in the Nation's foster care system. In Nevada, there are currently 5,450 children receiving foster care, including 3,947 in Clark County. 
   My district has faced some unique challenges recently. As Southern Nevadans, we recognize the need for a nurturing environment when biological parents abuse or neglect their own children. Foster families graciously open their doors, and offer love and guidance in the most difficult of circumstances. It is critical we honor these unsung heroes. 
   I would like to thank Chairman McDermott for introducing this bipartisan legislation honoring the selfless service of foster families recognizing the critical role these individuals play in communities across the nation. In addition, the resolution will mark May as National Foster Care Month. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the generosity of foster parents in their districts and throughout the nation during the month of May.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. I appreciate this opportunity. 
   Mr. Speaker, unfortunately an amendment that I proposed was shut out by the Democratic majority regarding renewal energy projects on public lands. 
   As you know, Nevada is on the forefront of a renewable energy. We have the third largest solar facility in the world in my district. 
   I have made some suggestions, so I have had to drop my own bill, since the leadership would not allow this to be heard, to ensure that when leasing or buying Federal lands, developers of renewable energy shall be able to lease or buy the property at existing fair market value. 
   It would expedite the process. We want to make sure if there is a solar or geothermal facility or wind or, whatever alternative energy, it is an expedited process. 
   It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to expedite these applications for renewable energy; direct the Secretary to also prioritize Federal land across the country, which could be used for renewable energy projects, and by local governments. It directs the Secretary to identify all Federal lands around the country that are suitable and feasible for alternative projects. 
   It's unfortunate this would not be heard by the majority party. This is something that is important to move this process along.  
   Mr. Speaker, Congress needs to act now to encourage the development of renewable resources on Federal lands, but as always bureaucracy and red tape are interfering with the process. 
   I am proud to introduce legislation that will remove regulatory and bureaucratic delays that are impeding the development of renewable energy projects on available Federal lands in resource rich states like my home state of Nevada. 
   According to the Department of Interior, there are currently 210 solar energy applications pending with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 217 applications pending with the BLM for wind energy projects. 
   My legislation would help alleviate the bureaucratic hurdles and delays and streamline the application process needed to move renewable energy projects forward as we seek to address the current energy crisis. 
   My legislation will also: 
   Ensure that when leasing or buying Federal lands, developers of renewable energy projects shall be able to lease or buy the public land at the existing value fair market value, not the price of the land once the plant is built and improvements are made; 
   Expedite an efficient process for the submission and consideration of renewable energy projects; 
   Direct the Secretary of Interior to expedite all those applications for renewable energy projects currently in the logjam of bureaucratic delays; 
   Direct the Secretary to prioritize Federal land transfers for renewable energy projects to local governments; and 
   Direct the Secretary to identify all Federal lands around the country that are suitable and feasible for alternative energy projects. 
   A brief reminder of why renewable energy development is important to the Nation: 
   The economic impact of new renewable energy projects is immense--hundreds of thousands of jobs to develop and operate these power plants, bringing new tax dollars into rural communities, where unemployment is high and a boost to the local economies are sorely needed. 
   Renewable power plants reduce the Nation's dependence on fossil fuels and imports, enhancing our national security, improving our balance of payments, and stimulating our economy. 
   Renewable power plants improve our environment, reducing greenhouse gases and clearing our air. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,

<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, the Southern Nevada Readiness Center Act conveys land to the Army National Guard for a readiness center that will provide Guardsmen with access to facilities, technology, and equipment needed to ensure proper training and readiness. 
   Because the Southern Nevada National Guard's force continues to grow, this new facility is crucial. It will better train and prepare our soldiers on the front lines. The center is the first new construction for the Army National Guard in the Las Vegas valley in more than 10 years. The facility will house communications, engineering and medical Guard units. It will include a 200-person theater-style auditorium, distance-learning classrooms, medical examination rooms, a weight room, locker rooms, multiple arms vaults, a kitchen, and a maintenance bay. Soldiers will be able to prepare both physically and technically for missions. In total, between 300 and 400 Guardsmen will train at the armory on a drill weekend. 
   The center will not only help ensure Nevada will be prepared in the event of a crisis or a natural disaster, but also would help ensure that Guardsmen are fully trained and ready for any contingency as directed by the National Command Authority. 
   I commend the National Guard soldiers who volunteer to serve at home and overseas in order to keep our country safe. It is incumbent upon us to provide the proper facilities that will ensure these soldiers are well trained and prepared. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working in a bipartisan, bicameral manner in support of this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me to speak on this important legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (NATIONAL HOMELESS YOUTH AWARENESS MONTH -- (House of Representatives - July 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 527, which seeks to promote greater public awareness of effective homeless youth prevention programs and the need for safe and productive alternatives, resources, and support for youths in high-risk situations. This resolution designates November as ``National Homeless Youth Awareness Month.'' I'd like to thank the leadership for allowing this resolution to come to the House Floor as it highlights a very tragic and important issue. 
   In the district that I represent in southern Nevada, Dr. Fred Preston of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, conducted homeless enumerations in 1999 and 2004. In 2004, Preston reported an estimate of 7,887 homeless people, up from the 6,700 counted in a 1999 survey. A Nevada Partnership for Homeless Youth study released last year estimates that there are 1,700 homeless youths in the valley. According to figures provided by the Clark County Department of Family Services, 483 youth a month, on average, received placements at the temporary emergency ``Child Haven'' facilities during 2005. That figure represents a 61.5 percent increase in average monthly referrals since 2000. These astonishing statistics highlight the need for our support of those important programs that seek to prevent these types of incidents. 
   Many of the conditions that lead young people to become homeless are preventable through interventions that can strengthen families and support youth in high-risk situations. Successful interventions are grounded in partnerships among families, community-based human service agencies, law enforcement agencies, schools, faith-based organizations, and businesses. 
   Preventing young people from becoming homeless and supporting youth in high-risk situations is a family, community, and national concern. Please join me in encouraging all Americans to play a role in supporting the millions of young people who are homeless or who are at-risk of being so each year. H. Res. 527 supports efforts to promote greater public awareness of effective homeless youth prevention programs and the need for safe and productive alternatives, resources, and support for youth in high-risk situations. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (FAIR MINIMUM WAGE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 10, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 2, the Minimum Wage Increase Without Assistance for Small Business. 
   In Southern Nevada, we are fortunate to experience an extraordinary situation in regard to wage earnings and job growth. Since the tragedy of September 11, 2001, our economy has undergone a massive rebound with unemployment far below the national average and wages far exceeding the current federal minimum wage. The primary engine of this economic growth has been our small business community. 
   As a representative of a state who mandates a dollar above the federal minimum wage, the small business community in Nevada will feel the effects of this increase stronger than most states. The Republican alternative to H.R. 2 would provide the incentives our small businesses need to absorb the economic impact of a federally mandated increase in wages. Small businesses in my district, like Metro Pizza, operate on the smallest of profit margins. Sam Facchini, who has co-owned the business since 1987, had this to say about an additional increase to the minimum wage; ``Our business is still adjusting to the most recent minimum wage increase. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. We cannot continue to face unprecedented labor costs and be expected to prosper.'' 
   To meet an increased federal wage standard small businesses need the kinds of incentives for growth that the Republican alternative to H.R. 2 provides. I would like to remind my colleagues that we can only create new jobs through growth in the private sector. To limit this growth for the sake of a sound bite is tempting, but will have a devastating impact on an economy. 
   Certainly, our workers deserve the fairest compensation for their valuable labor. In Nevada, the State Constitution mandates that our minimum wage is one dollar above the federally prescribed level. Increases, however, must be carefully balanced with the ability of the business community to pay these increased wages. For these reasons, my voting record has remained clear, on July 29, 2006 I voted in favor of a similar bill that included a minimum wage increase as well as growth incentives for small businesses.  
   While the vast majority of American workers deserve higher wages, we must ensure that no jobs are lost as a result. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2, the Minimum Wage Increase Without Assistance for Small Business.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2176, BAY MILLS INDIAN COMMUNITY LAND CLAIMS SETTLEMENT -- (House of Representatives - June 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity--and to my colleagues, in a bipartisan effort--to make sure we can maintain restrictions on off-reservation casinos and gambling. 
   I want to point out five key areas, Mr. Speaker, that, I think, are part of the argument. 
   First and foremost, I do support tribal gaming. I think it's been very successful. As a matter of fact, a number of our properties from Nevada are partners across the country with tribal gaming establishments. So, when the rules are followed, I think it's a very appropriate approach to revenues for the communities. 
   But first of all, Mr. Speaker, the bill authorizes an unprecedented expansion of off-reservation gaming. Never before has the U.S. Congress been in the business of deciding whether a community should and can have a casino. I don't think it's the job of the U.S. Congress to make decisions for local and State governments. Does that mean someone from Iowa or from Illinois or from Arizona could come in and request to have a casino in their back yard? I don't think that was the intent of the Tribal Gaming Act. And this is a dangerous precedent. It permits unlimited expansion across this country. 
   Number two, it overrides a careful review process. Currently, Mr. Speaker, if a tribe wants to build a casino, there is a process in place. All the rules must be followed; all inspections must be done. I think that's an appropriate use of the process that's available currently under U.S. law. 
   Number three, it also violates the 1993 Tribal Compact by the Michigan tribes. I know there are arguments on both sides of that, but there was an agreement made in 1993. 
   Number four, as a Member of Congress from the great State of Nevada, one of my jobs is to make sure we can uphold the wishes of a particular State. This legislation overrides the wishes of Michigan people. In 2004, there was a referendum that limited gaming to specific areas that were approved by local and State governments. This has not happened in this case. 
   Number five, I know my colleague from Nevada, Congresswoman SHELLEY BERKLEY, talked about the validity of the land claims. There is a question. 
   But the bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is, should Members of Congress be making a decision for local communities and for State governments on whether there should be tribal gaming or whether there should be expansion? I stand here today in a bipartisan effort with my colleagues from across the aisle, asking for the balance of this Congress to vote ``no.'' It establishes a dangerous precedent expanding casinos across our country without following the proper rules and regulations.

   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, Expanding Stem Cell Research. 
   I believe stem cell research holds enormous promise for easing human suffering for people like my constituents Judy Reich and Jake Page, both of whom suffer from diabetes. Embryonic stem cell research could lead to a cure that could dramatically improve their lives. Federal support is critical to its success which is why I was pleased when President Bush announced his stem cell policy in August 2001. 
   Scientists have learned a great deal about stem cells in the five and a half years since that announcement. Medical researchers believe that embryonic stem cell research has the potential to change the face of human disease. A number of current treatments already exist, although the majority of them are not commonly used because they tend to be experimental and not very cost-effective. Medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat cancer, Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and muscle damage, amongst a number of other diseases, impairments and conditions. 
   Current federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research allows federally funded research be conducted on those stem cells derived before August 9, 2001. Today, only 22 stem cell lines are available to federally funded scientists. The United States Congress has passed legislation which would lift the date restriction and allow federally funded scientists to research a greater number of stem cell lines; however, the President has vetoed this legislation. The legislation would also provide stronger ethical requirements on those stem cell lines eligible for funding including donor consent, certification that embryos donated are in excess of clinical need, and that the embryos would be otherwise discarded. 
   While I disagree with the creation of human embryos for scientific purposes, I agree that embryos created as a by-product of in vitro fertilization, which would otherwise be destroyed, should be allowed to provide greater insight into the myriad afflictions that can potentially be alleviated through stem cell research. 
   As with all scientific endeavors, we must ensure that the limitless bounds of science do not infringe on the beliefs that we hold as ethical human beings.

But more importantly, the tour and travel industry in this country represents number one, two and three in every economy across the United States of America. Seven hundred billion dollars annually is spent on tour and travel, and that's about $109 billion in tax revenues. That's $22,000 a second, $1.3 million a minute, $80 million an hour, and $1.9 billion a day is spent on tour and travel in the United States. It is the largest employer in the country, with 7.5 million jobs. International spending is $108 billion.

   It is an honor to be here to talk about something very critical, I think, to our families and communities across the country. 
   If you recall, last year this body passed historic legislation providing for protection of our children in light of the abuse of our kids throughout schools across the country. We passed legislation to provide for 24 additional States to do background checks on teachers via FBI background and other means through law enforcement. Unfortunately, 24 States were not allowed to, for many different reasons, and that legislation provided for these background checks. Through my amendment that is being proposed today, close to a million kids that are in the Head Start program will have the same tools available to them that we passed just last year to help kids in K-12. 
   There is one tragic example. There is one grantee in this country that between 2001 and 2005 did not perform background checks on their employees. They finally did background checks. Out of 660 employees, close to 106 had criminal charges against them, including first degree murder, involuntary manslaughter, domestic abuse, assault, child abuse, DUI, and violent crimes. 
   Mr. Chairman, my language ensures that Head Start programs will have all the databases containing criminal records available to them to make sure that our parents can feel that their most precious resource, their children, will be safe in the Head Start program.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY AND NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I am here today as an honored Member of the United States Congress, and I appreciate, Madam Speaker, your leadership and that of our chairman and our ranking member on an issue I think is very important to every family in this great country, but most important for those families that are trying to adopt a child or those in foster care. 
   Today, we're recognizing National Adoption Day, which is November 15, 2008. It's for continued awareness of adoption and foster issues. 
   Madam Speaker, can you imagine that there are children today sitting in a living room somewhere across America, possibly watching television, maybe reading a book or playing cards with their friends or another sibling. But imagine if you're that child and a car pulls up in front of your house, and out of it comes one or two individuals that come and knock at your door and tell you that you have to move. You may have been there for a week. You may have been there for a month. You may have been there for a year with this particular foster family. Imagine the pain of that child, realizing that two strangers are coming to the door to take them to another place to reside.     
   Now, most children in our country are blessed they don't face that particular challenge. Again, can you imagine if that same child then is removed from that home and moved to another home, without even a medical record, they may have to have additional inoculation, they may not have their glasses, they may not have all their personal belongings. 
   Madam Speaker, this is why we are recognizing Adoption Day and recognizing foster families across the country, because of the important role that they play in the well-being of our children. 
   Currently, there are 500,000 children in the foster care system around the United States, and there's 130,000 children just waiting for adoption. At firsthand knowledge, in the State of Nevada, we have about 4,000 children a year that enter into the foster care  system, and last year, many of those children were blessed to find a home; 444 children were adopted. 
   I have a family that I recognize this week. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption has provided for us as Members to recognize individuals for their help in fostering homes and creating adoptions, and that's Scott and Kathleen Greenberg of Las Vegas, Nevada. They are proud parents of a 15-month-old son, Evan. 
   They, of course, found it rewarding but also challenging because it took close to 5 years for this loving family to be able to adopt a child. They started in Tennessee. They then worked through Georgia, through different adoption agencies. They now are working through Nevada, but it took 5 years, and each time they had to start over. They had challenges of arranged adoptions; they had challenges of the public system. 
   Madam Speaker, the reason we're here today is to encourage families to adopt these children, to be patient, but also, the legislation, with the leadership of our chairman and our ranking member, should make it easier now for families like the Greenbergs to adopt children. 
   In Nevada, I've worked closely with the foster care program, and I think, like most of us, our children keep coming back no matter what age, but for foster kids, at the age of 18, as they move on from the foster care system, many of them do not have a home to come back to. So in the Nevada legislature we passed legislation to create a program for foster children between the ages of 18 and 21, and we created a fund to help these children with education, with training, with housing, with health care. It's funded through a copying of documents in the county of Clark, and we're raising about $1 million a year right now to help these children in transition. 
   Madam Speaker, I'm here today to ask not only for our colleagues to support this legislation, but in our own districts across the country, remind these moms and dads and these individuals that want to adopt children that we want to make it as easy and safe and a wonderful experience that it can be, and that's why we're recognizing this program today. 
   My great appreciation goes out to Scott and Kathleen Greenberg as the proud parents and to all those other families in Nevada that are part of the foster program, to all the professionals across the country that are working hard to make sure that our children have safe homes. 
   Today, I ask for your support and that of the rest of this body in supporting our resolution which recognizes National Adoption Day for November 15, 2008.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (FOSTERING CONNECTIONS TO SUCCESS ACT -- (House of Representatives - June 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I would like to applaud Chairman McDermott and Ranking Member Weller for their leadership in bringing forward this major piece of legislation that will change so many lives across our country. 
   We have a lot of challenges in our different communities, and one of the largest challenges is how we can help our foster children. 
   Can you imagine a child sitting in a living room, maybe 5 or 6 years old or maybe 10 or 12 years old, sitting in a living room watching television or maybe playing a game. Two strangers come to the door, knock on the door, and say, ``You're now leaving. It's time for you to leave this family, and we're going to take you to a new family.'' Can you imagine the pain of that child? And in some cases it happens time and time again. Imagine two strangers showing up out of the blue to tell you that you have to move to another family. 
   Also imagine if you are a child that goes from family to family that you may not have the right prescription for your glasses and your family may not know that you need glasses, or you may get numerous tetanus shots as you go from family to family. 
   Mr. Speaker, these are some of the challenges that our foster kids are facing today in a system that is broken and needs our help and our assistance now more than ever, and we need to find creative ways to help these children and to help these families. 
   I have two children. Each are in their twenties. And I can assure you that after the age of 18, they keep coming home. And they are more than welcome in my home, but as Chairman McDermott mentioned, there's a lot of children that don't have a home to go to after the age of 18. So in the Nevada State Senate, I passed legislation that I think has changed a few lives in Nevada. I found a creative way to help fund a program between the ages of 18 and 21 for those children that don't have a home. It provides for education. It provides for a place for them to live, for health care, and for training. And it's generating about $1 1/2 million a year today to help these foster kids. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. And, again, I applaud our chairman and ranking member. There are some key areas of the bill that I know have been addressed, but certainly the fact that we now can help families work within families, helping grandparents and brothers and sisters and the extended family to get involved in a far faster, more efficient but also more caring way, plus the fact that there are requirements for the children to be in school and to finish school. 
   So, again, we need to help these kids that need our help the most. And, unfortunately, these children or that child sitting in the living room watching television today does not have high paid lobbyists that are out there pushing the needs of these children. They have Members of Congress and very caring Members of this U.S. Congress but also elected officials across the country. So I stand here today encouraging my colleagues to pass this legislation, to step up and provide these new tools for our local governments and for our communities. 
   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF A NATIONAL VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT WEEK -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 770, which recognizes the goals and ideals of National Veterans History Project Week.  This resolution will help highlight the ongoing efforts of the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress to collect and to document the personal histories of our Nation's greatest heroes, our Nation's veterans. I can't imagine a better way to recognize these heroes. They are amongst us. They are in our families. They are in our neighborhoods. They need some encouragement, but I can't think of a better way. 
   National Veterans History Project Week will focus the Nation's attention on the importance of veterans' history. The goal is to honor veterans and to ensure that their stories are available for future generations. We owe every freedom we have to the service and, of course, the sacrifice of America's veterans and their families. Their experience teaches us about the power of the human spirit and the realities of war. It is incumbent upon us to ensure that their history is honored and preserved. 
   This resolution calls upon the people of the U.S. to interview at least one veteran from their families or their communities, following the guidelines set forth by the Veterans History Project, encourages local, State and national organizations, along with the Federal, State and local government institutions to document, to preserve and honor the service of American wartime veterans. 
   I only wish my father, who passed away in 1995 and was a World War II veteran, had the opportunity to share his history and the past experiences that he had. As a matter of fact, my father was very cautious in even talking about his experiences in the war until the final weeks of his life. I truly only wish that he had had this opportunity to share with his grandchildren. 
   The Veterans History Project relies on the efforts of volunteer interviewers from the veterans service organizations, libraries, historical societies, museums, retirement communities, professional associations, governmental agencies, universities, high school students, boy scouts, girl scouts, and families to contribute to its collection which currently has more than 50,000 individuals. 
   Yes, veterans need some encouragement. They want to be asked. I and a number of individuals that we have interviewed and we have placed their history into the Congressional Record, many of them served our Nation's wars from World War II, Jack Mates, Martin Schlesinger, and Jack Watson. From the Korean War, Johnnie Phillips, from Vietnam, Johnny Kinder, Chuck Baker, and Stephen Long. From the Cold War, Al O'Donnell from Las Vegas. And from Iraq and Afghanistan, Henry Lujan. 
   I am proud to be an original sponsor of this bipartisan resolution. While this issue is not and shall not be forgotten, we need to continue reminding our veterans that we need and we appreciate who they are and what they have done. I believe that preserving the histories of our Nation's veterans is of the utmost importance for us as Americans. This is an appropriate way to honor our veterans and the volunteers to seek and collect those wonderful stories of heroism. 
   I would also like to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Kind from Wisconsin, for his strong support.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 19, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate many Members of this body that are looking for ways to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, but I'm extremely disappointed that they've chosen this project. 
   I must say that I'm afraid some of my colleagues haven't really done their homework. And I appreciate my friend and colleague from Nevada, Congresswoman Berkley, for stating some of the obvious. 
   This particular program is what we need in America. And there is even a Web page today that shows this as an example of what's wrong with America. I want to stand here today and say this is what's right with America. We need to encourage public/private partnerships. Here is an individual that has adopted a charter school, a strong platform with the Republican Party, charter schools. It is a public charter school that he has adopted and writes a check for close to $3 million a year to keep it operating. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. Chairman, I'm embarrassed. This is what's right about America, not what's wrong about America. This particular school is serving a population that needs our help  and assistance. We admit here day after day that we're not funding special needs kids enough, and we are not. This is another example of how we can help this very important population. 
   And again, as my colleague said from Nevada, this is an example of an individual that is giving of his time, of his life to support our community, close to $60 million a year. He is giving to the community $3 million of his own money into this school. 
   Mr. Chairman, I strongly oppose this amendment. And I personally am very disappointed. This is an example of what's right about America. Mr. Agassi has done everything he can to help kids. He helps needy kids at our child welfare program, Boys and Girls Clubs across the community. He's not standing there with his hand out, he's standing there with support. 
   So Mr. Chairman, I ask this body to oppose this amendment, and I am extremely embarrassed.

   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Chairman, I just want to respond to my colleague's comments about charter schools. 
   Having been the co-author of charter school legislation in Nevada in the late 1990s, it truly is a Federal program. We do have funds available through grant processes that help charter schools. Unfortunately, we needed help immediately and this was the way to do it. As a matter of fact, this earmark isn't even in my district, it's adjacent to my district in Nevada. But it is traditional, it is what we do as a Congress. Another example of why I think Members understand their districts better than this full body, which is why we are here today in opposition to this amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. I would like to ask this body to take 2 minutes and listen to something very compelling. This bill does not matter on its face if our children are not safe. This body, with an amendment that I passed last year, has helped protect 27 million more children across this country by providing for school districts that could not in the past do criminal background checks. In this session alone, we passed additional legislation to help kids that are in Head Start by giving them additional protection for 1 million children who did not have that before. 
   An example of what is happening in this epidemic nationwide is we have teachers, we have professionals, we have individuals that are predators, sexual predators following our children. We need to make sure we add one additional tool, and that eliminates barrier to help fund these programs that we passed last session and this session. Head Start alone, one particular program had 660 teachers; of that, they were not inspected for 5 years. They discovered, out of 660 teachers, 100 teachers and support staff had criminal backgrounds. Of that, 50 had serious offenses from first-degree murder to child predator to domestic violence. 
   What I am asking this body to do is to use common sense, allow for these school districts to eliminate one more barrier to help them pay for these backgrounds checks. It is common sense. It is a way to provide protection. It is something that we can do to ensure and add one additional guarantee for our families and our children that they will be safe within our schools.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 4, the Democrat Drug Price Control. 
   Simply put, this measure will limit choice and access to prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare. H.R. 4 changes the new Medicare prescription drug benefit program by requiring government employees to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, instead of retaining the current system that gives seniors wide choices and uses multiple competing health plans and drug benefit managers to deliver benefits. This is not what is best for our seniors.  
   Though Democrats are promising lower drug prices, the potential trade offs for Medicare beneficiaries are too risky to gamble. By stripping the Medicare Modernization Act of the non-interference language, we would put the current choice and access that seniors deserve and enjoy in jeopardy. Instead, this bill opens the door to government bureaucrats picking and choosing what drugs and which pharmacies seniors could use. 
   Because of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit, thousands of seniors currently don't have to choose between groceries and the life saving medicine they need. In my district alone, roughly 87,000 seniors have enrolled and are saving an estimated $1,100 per year according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. 
   The Veterans' Administration, VA, which relies on direct government negotiation, currently excludes nearly 30 of the top 100 drugs used by seniors from its one national formulary. By comparison, the most popular Medicare Part D and Federal Employee Health Benefits Program plans provide coverage for more than 99 percent of the most widely used drugs. Similarly, Medicare and FEHBP enable patients to obtain prescriptions at nearly all private pharmacies while the VA requires patients to either go to VA facilities to get their drugs or obtain them through mail order. Currently, more than 75 percent of VA prescriptions are fulfilled via mail. 
   Additionally, in 1990, the Democratic 1991 budget reconciliation measure which passed Congress gave the Medicaid program access to the low prices achieved by VA. Drug manufacturers, faced with mandated discounts to Medicaid, 15 percent of the market, decided to end deep discounts to VA, 1 percent of the market. In some cases the VA saw 300 percent price increases. Congress had to pass legislation to correct this problem in 1992. Let's not make the same mistake twice. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4, Democrat drug price control.

<DOCNO>Mr. PORTER. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. PORTER. Madam Speaker, the Iraq war is the single greatest issue facing the American people today, and we must get the job done. Which is why I rise today in opposition to H. Con. Res. 63. 
   My prayers go out to Nevada's 26 families who have lost loved ones in this war and the other over-3,000 American citizens that have paid the ultimate sacrifice. I continue to pray for those who are in the war zone today around the world and for the families here at home. 
   Yes, a lot of mistakes have been made, but it is easy on Monday morning to look back and criticize. This war on terrorism is not in the textbooks. It is a war that must continually be reassessed, realigned, and restructured, because war is not perfect. 
   I want to bring the troops home just as soon as possible, as soon as the region is secured. There are no guarantees, but I believe the quickest way to bring our sons and daughters home is to send additional troops for a short period of time. 
   Madam Speaker, I oppose this resolution for three major reasons: 
   Number one, the impact on troops' morale. 
   Number two, there are no solutions today. This resolution sticks with staying the course. 
   And, number three, I believe this resolution puts us in the pathway of cutting off funds desperately needed for our troops. 
   First, on the morale: I have had the honor to be in the Middle East, in Southeast Asia, in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan on three occasions, I believe more times than anyone in our delegation from Nevada. I have looked in the eyes of these young men and women of all ages in the deserts of Iraq, in Bethesda, and in Walter Reed Army Hospital. 
   To a person, morale is at an all-time high. But what I do hear consistently from these folks is they are afraid that Washington has looked the other way. They don't want to be the last man killed, and they are afraid the funds are going to be reduced and cut off. 
   And, you know, I even disagree with Secretary Gates and his perspective, and certainly with the Democrats with their approach that this debate does not send the wrong message. I believe that you are wrong. It does. 
   I received this e-mail just this week from a soldier I spent Christmas Eve with in Baghdad this past Christmas. And he said, ``Congressman, every day we are burdened with stories in the media of the American people wanting to cut and run, with slanted coverage of atrocities and the argument that it is possible to support the troops but not the war. I disagree, Congressman. Someone that supports me by extension supports my efforts to accomplish my mission.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I hope this Congress heeds his words. 
   Another young man from Nevada visited the Capitol last year, wanted a tour of the Capitol, is proud of his uniform, because he was a soldier serving in the Middle East. But he was afraid he would be scorned, not unlike our family and friends that were scorned when they returned from Vietnam. 
   Through this resolution we are going to continue to send the wrong message to those who humbly protect our Nation. 
   The second reason, there are no solutions in this resolution. My father taught me a long time ago that before you complain you need to have a solution to the problem.     
   The Democrats have not presented the American people with a solution, only a resolution that endorses stay the course, which, as we saw in November, is unacceptable to the American people. This is not about leadership. This is unacceptable. I am open for ideas and suggestions as we fight this war on terror, but we must, we must win this war. 
   The third reason, this resolution opens the door to cutting funds desperately needed by our troops. The Democrats have said it time and time again. They are talking about cutting funds for body armor, for food, for military equipment and supplies. 
   This resolution, and their assertion this resolution simultaneously offers support for soldiers but not the President's plan, is disingenuous. I am deeply concerned that this resolution merely opens the door for Congress to move forward cutting off funds for our troops. We have heard it this week, and simply had the Democrats allowed the Republicans to add one sentence that we would guarantee we would not reduce the funds, would have changed the whole outcome of this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity, but this resolution is a resolution of hypocrisy. The American people spoke in November and said we must not stay the course. I cannot support this resolution, and I don't believe the American people do.
