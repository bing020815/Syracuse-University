<DOCNO>Mr. BUCHANAN. (PROVIDING FOR CONCURRENCE BY HOUSE WITH AMENDMENT IN SENATE AMENDMENT TO H.R. 4253, MILITARY RESERVIST AND VETERAN SMALL BUSINESS REAUTHORIZATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me the time, and I rise in support of the resolution. 
   I'd also like to thank my fellow freshman, Congressman Altmire, and I want to thank the chairman of our Small Business Committee, because she has been very bipartisan from day one. She's been very helpful to me, and I think, frankly, this is what the country is looking for. So I want to thank the freshman Congressman. I think this is a very powerful thing. 
   Also, I just wanted to say that I know there's a Senate compromise, and a number of provisions in that are important to me. 
   This resolution incorporates legislation I introduced in May and the House passed in June, creating an important program within the Small Business Administration. This will give our veterans not just a chance at success in a small business enterprise, but provide them with the help and assistance a grateful Nation can offer. 
   My legislation is intended to help veterans through grants, information services and contacts with professionals in their field of endeavor. This Federal support will enhance the ability of veterans to become an entrepreneur in his or her own right. 
   The measure puts an emphasis on providing veterans with the market research, financial options, and technological training important to becoming a successful small business owner. 
   This legislation not only expands the number but the scope of Veteran Outreach Centers. It ensures the opening of more doors in terms of that and the opportunity for women veterans. Assisting our women returning from combat has been an area long overlooked, and it's high time we did something about it. 
   I know in my personal situation, I went in as an 18-year-old in the Air National Guard. At 23, I had a chance to get in business for myself, for a kid that grew up in a blue-collar family, and I've lived that American Dream, being self-employed for 30 years. I want to make sure that our veterans have that same opportunity today for all the sacrifices they are making. 
   I'm excited today that the House will pass a resolution that will help individuals make an important transition from a veteran to a small business entrepreneur, and we are one step closer to having this important legislation signed into law. 
   I urge my colleagues to suspend the rules and support the resolution. 
   Ms. VEL&#193;ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, but I reserve the right to close.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Mack-Castor-Buchanan amendment to provide critical funding for red tide research. 
   Red tide threatens our environment, our health and our economy. But in recent years, the harmful effects of red tide have killed sea life, driven people from our beaches to our emergency rooms, and cost the economy millions of dollars in lost revenues. 
   This is a problem not just in Florida but in other coastal States. 
   Red tide is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Scientists differ on whether it is occurring more frequently and for longer periods of time. There is also disagreement on whether we should try to kill, contain, or minimize the impact of red tide. 
   That's why additional research dollars are needed. And that's why I support the Mack-Castor-Buchanan amendment. 
   My district is home to Mote Marine Laboratory, one of the Nation's premier private marine research laboratories. Mote conducts on-going red tide research and research related to new methods for early detection of red tide, the role of coastal pollution and studies of ways to mitigate and control blooms. 
   This amendment would fund additional research at places like Mote Marine to better understand the issue, and these results of these studies can be used to develop better methods to predict and detect red tide, and if a consensus can be developed, control and mitigate red tide. 
   I want to thank my colleagues Connie Mack and Kathy Castor for working with me on this important issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring legislation, H.J. Res. 21, which would add a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution. The amendment sets the financially responsible goal of balancing the budget by the year 2012. 
   Currently, the national debt is $8.6 trillion. Each taxpayer's share of that debt is almost $29,000. In fiscal year 2006, over $400 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on interest payments to the holders of the national debt. 
   Last year the interest paid on the national debt was the third largest expense of the Federal budget. The debt is increasing by over $1 billion every day. Our economy is ready for us to set this important priority. 
   Last year alone Federal revenues increased 11.8 percent. Receipts this year have grown by 8 percent so far in the first quarter compared to last year in that first quarter. Forty-nine out of 50 States, including my home State of Florida, currently have a balanced budget. It is time that we follow the lead there and balance the budget for the country.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2008 military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill which includes $27.8 million dollars to construct a veterans' cemetery in my District. 
   The funding was part of the President's budget and will allow us to honor our commitment to provide nearly 400,000 veterans living within 75 miles of Sarasota, Florida with a final resting place that honors their military service. 
   The VA has purchased 245 acres of land in Sarasota County and construction is planned for May 2008. The first burials are anticipated in October of 2008. 
   With more than 1,800 veterans dying every day in this country, the timely completion of this project is a primary concern for area veterans and is one of my highest priorities. 
   This funding will help ensure that our goals are met and the veterans who proudly served this Nation and eligible family members can be placed to rest close to home and with the honor and dignity they deserve.

   Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for yielding me the time, and I rise in support of H.R. 4253. I would also like to thank the Congressman from Pennsylvania, Congressman Altmire. He has worked on a bipartisan basis. I appreciate it. It has been a great partnership. And also Madam Chairman, and the ranking member, you guys have done an incredible job this first year. A lot of people said we couldn't work together, but it has been great leadership this year. I also want to thank you for  the opportunity to include a lot of the provisions in this bill. 
   H.R. 4253 incorporates legislation I introduced in May and was passed in the House in June creating an important program within the Small Business Administration that will give our veterans a chance to succeed in business enterprises but provides them with all the help and assistance a grateful Nation can offer. 
   My legislation is intended to help veterans through grants, information services and contacts with professionals in fields of their endeavor. This Federal program will enhance the ability of a veteran to become a successful entrepreneur in his or her chosen field. I know from personal experience, being a veteran of 6 years and an entrepreneur for 30 years, I was able to realize the American Dream, and I think this bill does it. 
   H.R. 4253 puts an emphasis on providing veterans with the market research, financial options and the technological training important to become a successful small business owner. This legislation not only expands the number and the scope of the Veteran Outreach Centers, it ensures the opening of more doors and an opportunity for our women veterans. Assisting our women returning from combat is something that has long been overlooked and overdue. It is high time that we did something about it.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and honor today to recognize and welcome my family's pastor, also my wife, Sandy, and my two children. He's been our pastor for the last 8 years. William Hild, since 1997, has served and led as the pastor of First Baptist Church of Sarasota, Florida. Accompanying him here today is his wife, Beverly, of 28 years; William Hild III, who also attends Georgetown Law School; and his sister, Kathy. 
   Since becoming pastor of First Baptist Church of Sarasota in 1997, Bill has helped to spread the church's ministry throughout our community, the State of Florida, the United States, and even across the world. 
   Under Pastor Hild's leadership, the church has organized over 20 Holy Land trips to Israel, Jordan and Egypt. These trips provide our members with a greater understanding of the Bible and a deeper appreciation of the work of God. 
   Here at home, Pastor Hild was a leader in the recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina. Under his leadership, First Baptist Church of Sarasota donated cash and pledges in excess of $140,000 to help the victims of Katrina. The church also conducted multiple trips to the gulf coast region, delivering food and personal hygiene kits to those affected by the hurricane. 
   I want to thank my pastor, Pastor Bill Hild, for more importantly, his close friendship and guidance to me, and also providing today's prayer. Also, I would like to thank his wife, Beverly, and son, Will, for being with us today and his family and his many friends from back home watching here today on this very special day. 
   Thank you, Pastor Hild.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUCHANAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 16, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to this resolution. I oppose the resolution not for what it says, but for what it does and what it will lead to. 
   As someone who enlisted at the age of 18 and spent 6 years as a member of the Air National Guard, I can tell you firsthand that this resolution will undermine our troops' morale and diminish their ability to accomplish their mission. 
   Passage of this resolution is also a first step towards cutting funding for our troops, and that is something that I absolutely cannot support. 
   Mr. Speaker, the war in Iraq is an important part of the global war on terror. Failure in Iraq will go beyond being a disaster for American foreign policy. Failure would destabilize the country, destabilize the Middle East, and make America less safe. 
   The American people are well aware of al Qaeda's plans to turn Iraq into a staging area to spread global terrorism. Failure in Iraq would also result in diminished influence and credibility for America at a time when global alliances are critical to address threats from Iran and North Korea. 
   Mr. Speaker, this week I have been briefed by the U.S. intelligence officers, foreign ambassadors from the region, and I have reached out to many of my constituents, including Colonel John Saputo, who served in Iraq, and Colonel Lee Kitchen, who served in Vietnam. We all agree that although legitimate questions can be raised about whether this surge strategy will prove successful, the stakes are too high, the threats to America too great to walk away without giving our troops one last chance to restore order in Iraq. Passage of this resolution would deny our military leaders and our troops this one last opportunity. 
   Like all Americans, I want to bring our troops home safely, successfully and soon, but now is not the time for an immediate withdrawal. Now is the time to support our troops, support the values they fight for, and do everything possible to give them the best chance to succeed in their mission. This resolution does nothing to help in those efforts. In fact, it does the opposite. It is for this reason that I must oppose this resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of renaming the Bradenton Main Post Office at 824 Manatee Avenue West as the ``Dan Miller Post Office Building'' in honor of former Congressman Dan Miller. 
   I can think of no better way to honor the public service of this former Florida Congressman than to designate the Bradenton Main Post Office in his name. 
   Dan Miller is a successful Bradenton businessman, educator, and community leader who represented Florida's 13th District in Congress from 1992 to 2003, when he retired from the House. 
   He is a principled and effective leader who was consistently recognized as one of the top fiscal conservatives in Congress. 
   Congressman Miller helped balance the Federal budget for the first time in 30 years by using Federal resources wisely--cutting waste, fraud, and abuse while supporting important programs like the National Institutes of Health, where Dan led the effort to double NIH funding. 
   Dan managed the congressional oversight of the 2000 U.S. Census, the most successful census to date despite many efforts to politicize the process. 
   Congressman Dan Miller is a statesman who commanded bipartisan respect and befriended lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
   He is a man of integrity who kept his word to term-limit himself and serve only five terms in Congress. 
   Congressman, successful businessman, respected educator--I am honored to call Dan Miller a friend and advisor. 
   I am also proud to hold the seat he once held and pleased to pay tribute to him by sponsoring this legislation. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 4342 in honor of former Congressman Dan Miller.

<DOCNO>Mr. BUCHANAN. (CYTOLOGY PROFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 08, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1237, the Cytology Proficiency Improvement Act of 2007. I am a cosponsor of this important legislation, which enhances women's health by establishing a continuing medical education requirement for pathologists and laboratory professionals who examine Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer. 
   I recently toured Sarasota Pathology and heard directly from my constituents about the importance of this bill and its potential to help save lives. 
   This legislation amends the Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988, CLIA, which mandated a cytology proficiency test to be administered by the Federal Government. However, the program lay inactive until 2005, which, because of scientific advancements makes the test obsolete and out of date. 
   Unlike the current CLIA testing model, H.R. 1237, with its annual continuing medical education requirement, will provide the means to increase the skills necessary to identify potential cervical cancer, and will keep pace with new science. 
   H.R. 1237 is modeled after the Mammography Quality Standards Act, MQSA, which was passed in 1992. That bill ensured women would have access to quality mammography procedures. This bill requires similar educational testing for pathologists. 
   The American Medical Association, the College of OBGYNs, the College of American Pathologists, the American Society for Clinical Pathology, the College of Nurse Midwifes, and the Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation endorse the bill. 
   Finally, I want to mention that the Congressional Budget Office has determined that it will not cost the Federal Government any additional expenditure. 
   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of a bill that will greatly improve the quality of women's health care in America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, there is no larger issue in my home State of Florida than the high cost of homeowners insurance. Like many Floridians, my constituents are finding property insurance more expensive and, many times, impossible to get. Skyrocketing insurance is hurting the middle class and it is damaging our real estate market and our economy. Insurance in the State of Florida has gone up 385 percent in last 5 years, 77 percent a year. 
   This bill is necessary to encourage insurance companies to write policies that will work for families and small businesses that they can afford. One of our businesses, and I don't want to leave them out either, in our community, their insurance went from $25,000 to $125,000. They called me and asked me what could they do. I said, ``Well, get some other prices.'' He called back and said there was nobody else that will even write it. One insurance company. They had to have it because they had a mortgage. 
   I am pleased the House will pass a manager's amendment that includes language authorized by my colleague Ginny Brown-Waite. I want to thank her for her leadership on this effort for the last 3 years. She is going to establish a Federal catastrophic fund. This amendment mirrors legislation I introduced with her at the beginning of the year. I also want to thank my Florida colleagues Congressman Tim Mahoney and Congressman Ron Klein for introducing this legislation. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am proud that we have been able to work on a bipartisan basis in Florida.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a simple one. It requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the feasibility of a soldier patient tracking system to improve the medical holdover process. 
   In the aftermath of the Walter Reed scandal, we heard criticism about the medical hold and holdover process, which requires injured soldiers to stay in certain facilities until evaluated and treated. 
   We heard the story of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant John Shannon who testified before the House National Security and Foreign Affairs Subcommittee and he said, ``I had been given a couple of weeks' appointments and some other paperwork upon leaving ward 58, and I went to all of my appointments during that time. After these appointments, I sat in my room for another couple of weeks wondering when someone would contact me.'' 
   The Buchanan amendment would require the Department of Defense to  identify and report to Congress ways of making the medical holdover system more responsive and effective for military personnel like Staff Sergeant Shannon. 
   I believe every servicemember should have complete, on-demand information with respect to his or her status as a medical holdover. No soldier should sit in their room for weeks wondering about their treatment and when their next appointment might be. The Department of Defense must closely examine ways to give servicemembers real-time information regarding the key milestones in their physical and medical evaluation process. 
   By requiring a report to Congress, my amendment would make certain that we are knowledgeable in considering all available options when it comes to improving the medical holdover process for troops and their families. I urge my colleagues to support the Buchanan amendment. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
