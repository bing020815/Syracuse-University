<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF DAW AUNG SAN SUU KYI -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, as well as Chairman Lantos, for his leadership on this issue. 
   Fort Wayne, Indiana, my hometown, is estimated to have 2,000 or 3,000 people from Burma, the greatest number of refugees from Burma in the United States. Many are coming in directly. Many are coming through Washington and Los Angeles and heading to Indiana because of our job situation. It is important to note because as Americans become more internationally aware, just like in Iraq there are different groups, and in Afghanistan there are different groups, it is important to say ``people of Burma'' because the Mon and other subgroups were persecuted by the Burmese inside Burma. 
   What they all agree on is the current situation in Burma is intolerable. The violent suppression of Buddhist monks and the peaceful demonstrators in Burma, they want the immediate, unconditional release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi who is their elected leader. They all know she is the elected leader. Regardless of the differences they have in their country, they elected a leadership and worked together, like what we are trying to do in Iraq and like what we are trying to do with the different tribes in Afghanistan. They chose a leader, and then the leader was locked up. 
   In 1990, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was rightfully elected, and the junta placed her under arrest. This has been going on for 18 years. She has been locked up for 12 of the 18 years since the election. 
   In Fort Wayne, I hear many stories as I talk to individuals who have talked to their relatives who have lived in concentration camps, in effect, more refugee camps; but at times they felt both abused by the Thai Government that wants to move them back to Burma, by the Burmese Government that is trying to chase them out. They have been abused in the camps. They have been raped in the camps, and they have had their money stolen in the camps. 
   We have a huge challenge in America, and it is speaking to broader questions than just Burma, which is how to handle situations, because our area has also become in the top three of refugees from Darfur. One of the challenges we are having is Catholic Social Services has come to me and said we don't have the support system to handle, and the State Department has come back and said what do you want to do, leave the people in the refugee camps? They aren't doing well in the refugee camps. 
   We have to understand that we no longer live in an isolated world. What happens in Burma and the demonstrations you are seeing in Burma and the persecution of the people in Burma, the terrible tragedies in Darfur, what happens in Iraq and Afghanistan impacts all of us. It impacts us in our hometowns. If we are going to be the Nation that welcomes immigrants, there is only so much we can handle, and we need to put international pressure on some of these countries to handle their own regional problems. This resolution helps us move in that direction. 
   They have to have changes in Burma. It is not only unfair to the people who come to the United States; it is unfair to the people trapped in the camps. It is unfair to the monasteries being emptied out in Burma, and it is unfair to the people being persecuted throughout Burma. If we don't stand up and force some changes for human liberties in Burma, we are going to face another type of catastrophe like is happening in Darfur while the world watches.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, it is now March 1, the third month since the Democrat Party took over Congress. For the first 2 months, after campaigning on a platform of reform, after years of complaining about alleged unfair process abuse by Republicans, Americans have been able to watch an unprecedented continued abuse of power in this House. 
   After the abuse of power during the first 100 hours, we thought the aberration would end. Surely basic voting rights would return. In February, the abuse of power continued. The minority was deprived of basic voting rights through most of February as well. 
   The American people voted last fall for change. They don't want to hear us complain about process. But process does matter. We are a republic, where we expect a democratic process, minority protections and the right to vote. 
   Now, to start month 3 of Democrat control, the Democratic Party has brought forth a bill that deprives the American workers of the right to a private ballot. They have moved from abuse of power and undemocratic methods in Congress to applying this abuse of power directly to the American people. 
   Put yourself in the shoes of an average American worker trying to decide whether they want to vote for or against establishing a union at the workplace. You would get lobbied on every side, but at least you get a private ballot. The bill before us today would deprive you of that private ballot. The card check replaces the vote. If a majority signed the card, there is no private vote. So a friend comes up to you with a card asking you to sign and you say you want to think about it. So a group comes encouraging you to sign, maybe even shunning you if you don't. 
   But it gets worse. The process called ``salting'' allows roaming union organizers to go from company to company, not as long-term employees committed to keeping the plant profitable and the jobs in the community, but committed to expanding their special interest union. Often they are heavy influencers, sometimes even a thug or two. You may receive visits from them as well. 
   In the Education and Labor Committee, the Democrats unanimously even voted down an amendment that would have said only American citizens can vote. You now, as an American worker, can have the majority of illegals sign a card and you are now bound to a union. 
   This bill, because of its overt hostility to business, has unfair stiffer penalties for business than unions for the same violation of the law. We wanted to offer an amendment to equalize the playing field, but Congress was denied the right to vote on this and other amendments. 
   The Democratic Party seems determined to eliminate the right to fairness and a private vote in union organizing elections and they won't even let Congress have clear votes on many of the amendments to protect the workers. Yet people wonder why some of us refer to them as the Democrat  party rather than the Democratic Party. Their actions speak louder than their words.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, well, renaming things does not change the facts. A few minutes ago we just heard that somehow the Pledge of Allegiance has something to do with banning secret ballots, and that somehow those of us who favor private elections and secret ballots are anti-God. I just simply do not understand the escalation of that rhetoric. 
   Secondly, one of the senior Members of the other party was just down in the well and said why are we Republicans complaining about a secret ballot, more or less admitting that is what, in fact, they are eliminating, saying that votes are publicly posted. We represent, as Mr. Kline said earlier, 700,000 people. Think why you wouldn't want your vote posted. Are we heading towards posting in private elections and fall elections where there is no longer the secrecy of the private voting box? If you posted who you voted for, you could be subject to all sorts of discrimination. 
   The practical fact here, as I said earlier in the rules debate, is an individual is going to be approached to sign his card that would circumvent a secret ballot. Then other people are going to come up to him. Furthermore, through salting, there are likely to be organizers inside that workplace putting further pressure on him. He may get shunned. He doesn't have the right to change his mind. There are all sorts of subtle, indirect, direct, physical, verbal, and business pressures put when you lose a secret ballot. A card is denying the vote. It is denying the secret ballot, and no tricky wording can change the fundamental fact of what is happening here. 
   I would like to insert into the Record a letter from 16 Members of Congress led by the distinguished chairman of this committee, Mr. Miller, that was sent to Mexico regarding the right to a secret ballot. What he says in this letter, and we have heard it described several ways, that it had to do with a particular question around a particular Mexican election. It states: ``We are writing to encourage you to use a secret ballot in all union recognition elections.'' Apparently what is good for the Mexican worker is not good for U.S. workers.

   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairwoman, as much as I appreciate my friend from New Jersey's comments, in the committee we had a different amendment which said that nobody hired in the last 30 days before an election could vote, and then we wouldn't have had to be discriminatory. But, of course, that was defeated unanimously on the Democratic side. 
   This amendment tries to address it in another way, because we weren't allowed to address it in the other way, and it was defeated. I support this because, in fact, people who aren't committed to the company come in for the sole purpose of unionizing, and we haven't been allowed to address it in any way.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (CONDEMNING BURMESE REGIME'S UNDEMOCRATIC CONSTITUTION -- (House of Representatives - May 05, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, as the representative in Congress of Fort Wayne, Indiana--home to an estimated 3,000 to 3,500 people from Burma, the greatest population of Burmese in the United States--I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 317. 
   Over the last year, Indiana's Third Congressional District has seen a marked increase in the number of refugees from Burma, although Burmese have lived in northeast Indiana for some time. To help them immerse as quickly as possible into our community, my office has been working with Federal and State agencies, as well as local resettlement organizations. Over the years, I've had an opportunity to learn about this Southeast Asian country and its diverse, proud, and resilient people. 
   More than anything, the refugees tell me about the brutal oppression they endured under the military junta in Burma, known as the State Peace and Development Council. Many of these refugees still have loved ones living in destitute, overseas refugee camps, or relatives who have been unable to escape Burma, and they worry greatly about their plight. 
   They also tell me about Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and democratically elected leader of Burma, who has been under house arrest for years, barred from assuming the Prime Ministerial post to which she was rightly elected. Her consistent advocacy of nonviolent resistance against the military junta is inspiring, and it was for her strong leadership that the Nobel Committee awarded her its Peace Prize. The United States must unequivocally support Aung San Suu Kyi as the legitimate leader of Burma. 
   Despite international recognition of its gross human rights violations, Burma's regime continues to use violence and murder to terrorize its own people, most recently during last September's demonstrations. I have spoken in opposition to Burma's military junta for a number of years, and today I am once again condemning it for forcing a referendum that seeks to lend false credibility to an undemocratic constitution. As a cosponsor of H. Con. Res. 317, I am deeply concerned by what the regime will do to retain its tight grip on power. 
   Today, as the House considers this concurrent resolution, I also join my colleagues in being mindful of the terrible devastation caused by a cyclone that ripped through Burma over the weekend. I offer my condolences to the families of those who lost loved ones in this staggering disaster, and I earnestly hope that the regime in Burma will accept international assistance to help Burma's people recover from this tragedy.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting H. Con. Res. 1091 and honoring the life and contributions of the late Charlton Heston. 
   A larger than life figure, Charlton Heston was a World War II veteran, president of the Screen Actors Guild, and chairman of the American Film Institute. He was celebrated--as an Academy Award-winning actor and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
   Throughout his life, when he saw injustice, Charlton Heston did not hesitate to take action. It did not matter to him whether his position was popular. He protested segregation, marching alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King during his campaign for civil rights, and described Dr. King as a ``20th century Moses for his people.'' 
   Never shy to take a stand, Charlton Heston picketed a segregated movie theater premiering one of his own movies. All of us should commend his principled commitment to civil rights. 
   His support for our Nation's Bill of Rights extended to the second amendment. Indeed, for many of us, Charlton Heston's most memorable contribution may have been his fierce advocacy for our right to keep and bear arms. As president of the National Rifle Association, NRA, Mr. Heston famously rallied millions of Americans by holding a rifle over his head and declaring that the Government would take it only ``from my cold, dead hands.'' 
   When our rights were threatened by the Federal Government, Charlton Heston--the face of the NRA--inspired millions of us. This legacy is lasting. And it never mattered to him that his stance wasn't fashionable with Hollywood elites. 
   Not until the onset of Alzheimer's disease did Charlton Heston begin to withdraw from public life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Heston family, especially Lydia, his wife of 64 years. They must be proud of Charlton Heston's life, legacy, and contributions. We all are here.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR NATIONAL GEAR UP DAY -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I wish to speak in support of this resolution. 
   Ten years ago, Mr. Speaker, I worked with Congressman Fattah to author GEAR-UP, and it has been a delight to continue to work with him throughout my congressional career to support this important initiative. For example, as part of the ongoing higher education reauthorization, we were recently able to improve the program to encourage more funding for college scholarships. So I was very pleased to be able to introduce this bipartisan resolution with the Congressman expressing support for the designation of a National GEAR UP Day. 
   Over the past ten years, GEAR UP has sent countless disadvantaged students to college, including many participants in Indiana's 21st Century Scholars program. It is fitting now to look back and appreciate all the success we have seen. According to the U.S. Department of Education, for example, more than 85 percent of the second class of GEAR UP students graduated from high school in 2006, a rate 20 percent higher than other low-income students and more than 10 percent above the total average for all students. 
   Madam Speaker, as we mark GEAR UP's 10-year anniversary, it is also fitting to discuss the many challenges that still face lower-income students attempting to finish college. These challenges are many and varied, but there is certainly more that the Federal Government can do. GEAR UP is an excellent example of the type of program that can make a real difference in kids' lives, but it is also a reminder that tough work lies ahead. I look forward to working with Congressman Fattah and other members on both sides of the aisle to find more solutions to the problems facing these communities. 
   Madam Speaker, I congratulate GEAR UP for a very successful first decade, and wish it even more success in the years ahead. Once again, I strongly support this resolution and ask that my colleagues support it as well.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (SUPPLEMENTAL MINE IMPROVEMENT AND NEW EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 16, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, in our discussion about how to achieve safety in our Nation's mines, there's one issue that, until today, has been conspicuously absent: drug testing. Our late colleague from Georgia, Charlie Norwood, had the courage to introduce mine safety legislation with a drug testing requirement, only to be criticized for ``blaming the victim.'' I would argue that drug testing prevents victims. 
   Now, claims have been made that the Federal Government is not moving fast enough to implement safety changes, that the States are more nimble. In this instance, the other side may have a point. On the issue of drug testing, I believe the Federal Government ought to be following the States' lead. 
   The Commonwealth of Virginia initiated a drug testing requirement in April 2006. Since then, there have been no mining fatalities in Virginia last year, and just in southwest Virginia they had 278 the previous year, more than they've had homicides, not in coal mining but in drug overdoses. 
   The State of Kentucky passed a drug testing law last year, and coal mining deaths in that State are now at an all-time low. Some 433 miners were suspended for positive drug test results. It's just been possible that a disaster has been averted because of the new drug testing law. 
   Yet inexplicably, the same Democrats who champion this misguided legislation because they want to move more quickly on some reforms are proposing that we stall action on drug testing until we can do a study. We don't need a study. The evidence is right here, a front page article in The Washington Post detailing what has happened in Virginia and the problems in mining. The devastating impact of drug abuse was brought into sharp focus in that story. 
   Some may also claim in the response here that this would kill the bill. This obviously would not kill the bill. It would go back to committee. The committee would then pass an amendment, and it could be back on the floor later this week. It's not like we're busy. We're adjourning again in mid-afternoon. This could easily go back to committee and come back later this week. 
   Drug and alcohol testing is a commonsense safety measure that protects both abusers of these substances and those around them. It has the noted benefits of reducing accidents, cutting sick leave, improving attendance, and increasing productivity. 
   The testing program in this motion to recommit is based on the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, which I helped draft when I was a staffer in the Senate, which requires drug and alcohol testing of safety-sensitive transportation employees in aviation, trucking, railroads, mass transit, pipelines, and other transportation industries. 
   Our Nation's laws do not allow the people driving the trucks filled with coal away from the mine to abuse drugs or alcohol. Why would we not ensure that the men driving heavy machinery in the mine are not impaired? 
   If this body has spent valuable time investigating Major League Baseball and its drug testing policy, and I serve on that committee and I support Congressman Waxman's efforts to requiring testing of Major League Baseball players, why wouldn't we do that in mining? 
   I helped draft the first legislation for drug testing in high school athletes. It's been upheld by the courts, and we've passed that numerous times in this House and the Senate. Why wouldn't we do it for mine safety if we do it for high school athletes? 
   I worked on the Small Business Committee with then-Chairman Jim Talent, where we passed the Drug Workplace Act and heard testimony over and over from unions and management about how this can help people who have drug abuse to get addiction treatment. And I voted for the amendment that put more money in for addiction treatment, which is very important, but you have to have drug testing. It's part of getting people treated and to do prevention. 
   This will be a very clear vote. We have plenty of studies. We have mountains of studies. We have evidence that when we do this in schools it keeps people from falling victim to drug abuse and from having accidents. When we do it in the workplace, when we do it in transportation, drug testing works. 
   This is a clean vote. There aren't any excuses. We can bring this back to the floor yet this week. We can pass this, and this will be as clean a vote as you can get on this motion to recommit. 
   I urge you to support drug testing, to support safety, to get people into treatment, to keep mine disasters from occurring, and I urge my colleagues to vote with me ``yes'' on the motion to recommit to ensure strong safety protections and mandatory drug testing. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, it is my intention to withdraw this amendment because of the strong opposition of Chairman Skelton and Ranking Member Duncan Hunter, but I appreciate the Rules Committee making this in order. I believe it is an important step. 
   I know I am going to rain a little bit on the general parade here. I think this is an important bill, it is an important step, but we have oversold the success of Afghanistan. Before my first trip, I knew then that our then Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, wanted to separate the military effort in Afghanistan from other challenges the country faced, just like in Iraq. 
   In Afghanistan, the question was heroin. On my first trip there, I heard our own soldiers reflect the Pentagon attitude by mocking heroin and minimizing its efforts to get rid of it. I attended the briefings back here in Washington as the heroin problem began to pass anything we've ever seen under the Taliban by a factor of four to five times of anything we have ever seen under the Taliban. I asked the question, since we had not removed the regional drug lords from office, how many of the people who voted in that much heralded election could vote against their local drug lords. 
   State Department, Defense Department, DIA and CIA disagreed on the exact number. The highest was 30 percent, the lowest 20 percent. In other words, 70 to 80 percent of the people who voted in that election did not have a free vote because we did not remove the regional druglords from office, and we let the heroin poppy grow without controlling their sources of financing that had penetrated the early parts of the government. 
   This government has, in fact, started to act, as they attempted to assassinate President Karzai, who was clean, and he removed gradually some members of his cabinet. But by that time, the heroin, once again, four times world record, five times world record, four times world record, three times world record, approaching eight to 10 times the total cumulative effect that ever happened before the United States went into Afghanistan. We had sites that we could not hit because we were afraid they were going to shoot down our own planes. 
   What do we think they are buying the new IEDs with? What do we think they are buying the other equipment with? Of course they are getting it from profits from poppy. 
   I did a hearing in our subcommittee, because the British had this effort, ``Afghanistan: Have the British Counter-Narcotics Efforts Gone Wildly?'' On April 1, 2004. This is no new problem. Go arrest the druglords. Our military is afraid they are going to get exploded. How can you go arrest the drug lords? 
   My amendment was simply to say the military needs to support the antinarcotics efforts and the DEA to take down these. You can't send 10, 25 agents out and say go arrest and take down the Helman province. When I went with Congressman Hoekstra and Congressman Ruppersberger and Congressman Shadegg, the four of us went into the Helman province, possibly the only four Members that will ever get there. And when we got there in a Blackhawk ride for 45 minutes, heroin as far as the eye can see going at a high rate of speed. Dwarfed Columbia. This is an incredible problem. The military needs to engage. 
   I agree with Chairman Skelton; we don't have enough troops in Afghanistan. And that makes it a problematic thing of how to support the DEA.     
   This bill is a first step. But we need the military engagement and support,  because you cannot get order, you cannot do alternative crops unless you eradicate the heroin and change a little bit of the market force. We can't subsidize the difference between other products and heroin. It is not possible. 
   We can't do those efforts, and INL and the State Department and DEA and the other agencies cannot do this without military support. This needs to be addressed in the defense bill. It needs to be addressed here in conference. 
   I hope that the chairman here can do it. I hope Chairman Skelton can do it. I hope the administration can do it. But let's understand there is no terrorism funding in Afghanistan. There is no insurgency efforts. There is no corrupt government if you get rid of the heroin. 
   This is a difficult problem. It is multi-faceted. But you need real protection, with real guns, with real transport, with real time, saying that they are going to give logistical support rather than force protection and extremist support, means and effect. For most of the time, the DEA agents are on their own, go in. With 10,000 Taliban, good luck in taking them down. They need more than good luck. They need some help. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos).

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I want to thank the subcommittee chairman and ranking member for plussing up our National Park Service. We are at a very critical junction. We are approaching the 100th birthday, in the year 2016, of the National Park Service.  
   Why do I say we're approaching? Because there are certain moments in time where you can gather and build public support for something that will last from generation to generation. When the first kind of preserved areas were preserved at Yellowstone and the Yosemite Grant and a few of those in the 1800s, it took dramatic intervention from Theodore Roosevelt and the creation under Stephen Mather of the National Park Service. Then it really took in the World War II era, the Great Depression era, the different relief projects that built much of the architecture in our parks because we put people to work, and much of the historic architecture that we see in our national parks came in the WPA and CCC programs. Then nothing really much happened until it started to approach the 50th birthday. When I say ``started to approach,'' when you did Mission 66 and most of the visitor centers you see in our parks today, most of the lodging that you see, much of it at least in our parks, much of the road infrastructure, the sewage infrastructure, everything, came heavily out of this Mission 66 commitment. But you don't just do that in 1 year. If you wanted to be prepared for the 50th birthday, you started a decade ahead. We are getting inside that decade. If we are going to have a vision of where our National Park Service is going to be at 100 years and where it's going to go, we need to start making the investments now. 
   I support, as our Parks Caucus does, the Centennial Act, which also would as part of this build a better foundation as to how we're going to fund parks. But this particular bill puts $50 million in above what we would normally get to start this process. Because if we don't start now, by the year 2016 we won't be able to be ready for the 100th birthday. Part of the question which the National Park Service has been going around talking to Americans all over the country is, where do you want our Park Service to be? How is it going to be different? We need to preserve our natural sites. We have preserved many of those, but we can expand that. We need to expand our cultural sites because our history is a constantly evolving thing, just as Congressman Miller just referred to, the Rosie the Riveter Park and that type of cultural heritage. As we look at Hispanic sites, at African American sites, at Angel Island and various Asian sites, as we look at more urban sites and what's the role of the National Park Service in urban sites, but also how are we going to deal with the Internet age. How can we expand? 
   The National Park Service has more fish and wildlife, has more natural resources at Carlsbad Caverns with bats. How can we use this at other places with grizzly bears, with wolves, with frogs, with trees? And we can learn much of science. How can we interconnect that with our educational institutions? How can we take the Park Service in its 100th birthday to the next level? What are we going to do with interpretive rangers? What are we going to do with our visitor centers? How can we make our heritage, cultural and natural, something that we can preserve for generations and generations? 
   To do that, we need to do that now. We need to start laying the foundation in these appropriations bills, what this bill does. We also need to be looking at a permanent way so the Park Service doesn't have the up-and-down cycles, where we pass additional land things, they don't have money to do it. We give them new homeland security things, and they don't have enough money to do it. We say we want this done and that done by a Park Service but don't give them the annual funds to do it. 
   I'm very pleased that it's in this bill. I hope this is the start of moving towards the 100th birthday. It's a very good start. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for doing that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the ranking member, and I just wanted to share a few thoughts. 
   Many of us on the Republican side have been involved with education for many years. It was my first choice when I was elected in 1994 to go on the Education Committee, much to the shock of everybody on our side. And it has been a challenge because I believe education is the responsibility of the States and local; and yet I passionately believe in the importance of education. 
   I don't know how we are going to compete in the international marketplace if we don't compete on math and science, and if we don't have everybody at basic reading levels where they have an opportunity to blossom. If they don't know how to read, they will not be able to learn how to compete in a worldwide marketplace. 
   And frankly we are not going to do it with cheap labor. We have to do it with value-added labor. We have to have education at the core of any system that we have. The challenge we have in the Federal Government is that the State and local seem to not want to raise their taxes. They don't want to do the funding. They want to come to the Federal Government for the money, and then they don't want any strings with the money. 
   If you ask the Federal Government for money, you are going to get strings. Many of us want to minimize those strings where the thousands flowers bloom, but we are still going to have measurement. 
   I was one who didn't like the national testing idea because I am afraid that a national curriculum is going to be abused by either side to try to drive their ideological agendas. Nevertheless, there has to be some kind of measurement. We need some measurement. If we keep increasing Federal aid to education, then we need to increase accountability. 
   In the parts of No Child Left Behind that are difficult, I know the administration likes to ask, Well, which child would you leave behind? But the problem is 
   if your goal is just to focus on those who are going to be at the lower echelons, we have diverted money to minimal gains in some cases at that level, and backed off in our math and science and in our upper and middle end to the net result that we haven't really moved the system. 
   Nobody argues that No Child Left Behind hasn't made tremendous progress at the lower echelons. Part of the question that schools are legitimately asking right now with the special needs kids, with English as a second language kids, how can they meet continually higher standards? At some point we are more likely to get slower progress or hit a wall, and we are trying to work that through with any new bill. 
   But there are going to be measurements, and measurements are never completely fair. But he who pays the piper picks the tune. To this degree, you want more money from the Federal Government, you are going to get more regulation. We need to be responsible. 
   I hear people say, My daughter is a teacher. She gets frustrated with this because they have to teach to the test. That is partly why I have a concern about the test. I went to an amazing school in New Orleans that got hit by Hurricane Katrina. It is a 100 percent school lunch program, and nobody is failing to pass the test. 
   I asked, Do you teach to the test? She said, No, these are principles that we should have been teaching anyway. So if we teach the principles, they will pass the test. 
   What we are really commenting on, is the test measuring what we want to have, and is that the skill. And if the test is in fact measuring that, then you aren't teaching to the test. But it needs to be fair. Schools with high ESL, schools with high special needs kids are going to need accountability. 
   I thank you for your time and your leadership.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2830, COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - April 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentleman from Texas. 
   While I associate myself positively with the remarks on energy, I rise for a different reason in opposition to this rule. 
   We have been battling with the Coast Guard and their budget submissions from OMB as to why narcotics are not considered part of their terrorism mission. We have made some progress with that, but I had an amendment submitted to reflect that drug interdiction is a homeland security mission as required under the Homeland Security Act. I do not understand why jurisdictional disputes would have stopped this. Both committees, Transportation and Homeland Security, should agree that it's part of terrorism, and both committees need to work on narcotics and make sure, because smugglers are smugglers, whether they're smuggling people or whether they're smuggling contraband. And if we get this mission separated, since every single person in the Coast Guard says their first concern is homeland security, what we wind up is neglecting the narcotics mission. 
   My friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and I have worked on the narcotics issue for a long time. And I would hope that petty jurisdictions in the House wouldn't stop us from moving ahead in a bipartisan way to make sure that narcotics are part of the terrorism mission. I hope this is fixed in any conference report.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (CELEBRATING 90TH BIRTHDAY OF REV. THEODORE M. HESBURGH, C.S.C. -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague who represents the University of Notre Dame. Unfortunately, I only come about 5 miles away as we circle around and share Elkhart County. It is great that we have six Domers in Congress. My colleague is actually a double Domer, which is a great honor. 
   Before I go into my remarks, I want to share something I remember from campus when I was there. The story on campus was: Do you know the difference between God and President Hesburgh? And the answer is: God is everywhere; President Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame. And the reason was, this is what we are honoring him here for today. He went throughout the entire world, not only raising money for Notre Dame, but working to serve justice, working to serve various causes around the world. 
   I rise today in strong support of this resolution by Congressman Donnelly to honor Rev. Theodore Hesburgh for his contributions to the civil rights movement in America, his tireless work to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict, and for seeking peaceful resolution to international conflict. 
   Father Hesburgh, who served as the president of the University of Notre Dame from 1952 to 1987, holds the world record for honorary degrees received at more than 150. He has been honored for his contributions to education, to athletics, to peace, as well as national and international issues. 
   He has earned these degrees, these honors, this praise with his thoughtful approach to many of the most daunting challenges of our time. In the late 1970s, he served on a commission appointed by President Carter to study immigration reform. His commission found that securing our borders should be the first step toward an immigration policy that is thoughtful and beneficial to us and our neighbors. How fresh that sounds for a recommendation he issued three decades ago. 
   His biography on the Notre Dame University Web site says: ``Justice has been the focus of many of his outside involvements.'' He was a charter member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, created in 1957; and he served as its chairman from 1969 to 1972, when he was replaced by President Nixon after criticizing the President's civil rights record. 
   He has argued that nuclear weapons present ``the greatest moral challenge of all time.'' He says nuclear weapons undercut the key just-war principles of discrimination, avoiding killing innocent civilians, and proportionality, using only the force necessary to achieve justifiable defense. While not everyone here may agree with these views, they are thoughtful, inspired by the will to do and represent good and representative of a man who holds peace and goodwill towards men as his central tenets. 
   The title of his autobiography says it all: ``God, Country, Notre Dame.'' Hopefully, those three will never be separated; but if they are, he has the order: God, country, and Notre Dame. 
   I would like to finish with one personal story. The only time I really got to spend with Father Hesburgh, I was head of the executive lecture series at the graduate School of Business at Notre Dame. He asked us to invite David Rockefeller in. He had served for many years on the Chase Manhattan board, and the Rockefellers had never contributed to Notre Dame. When we went to the airport, I saw one of the things my colleague mentioned, and that he was a priest first. He saw he had a few minutes, and so he went and did his prayers right on the airport runway. He made sure that every day he met his duties as a priest first and foremost. 
   My privilege that afternoon, after he spoke to the business school and the graduate students, was to accompany David Rockefeller, the executive vice president of Chase Manhattan, and Father Hesburgh for one simple reason: my job was when President Hesburgh gave me the signal, was to get the Vice President away so Father Hesburgh could do the close because in his heart this man will go to his grave knowing he built the university. 
   He took Notre Dame from a good university to a great international university, and that means you have to do many different things: one was fund-raising, making friends with leaders around the world, then making sure that they saw his dream in South Bend, actually Notre Dame, Indiana, is a separate town, but that they saw the dream of the Fathers of the Holy Cross to build the university there. While they built that university, President Hesburgh was really the transition figure that took it to the university it is today. 
   So we thank him in the international region and for his civil rights commitment, and for building the University of Notre Dame into the great university it is today. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (LANCE CORPORAL DAVID K. FRIBLEY POST OFFICE -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   There are probably no things more upsetting to Members of Congress than to know that the difficult decisions we have made here have resulted in the deaths of young men and women in battle. 
   Lance Corporal David Fribley was actually the first Hoosier killed in action in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. One of the good things that we have seen in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has been a number of post offices and various things being named after these young patriots. 
   I was earlier at a dedication of a football field in Warsaw, Indiana, named Fribley Field, where the community went together and put together a statue and a number of things in tribute for him and his family and renamed the  field and redid the field so that kids could continue to play athletics as he did in Warsaw. 
   He is actually from Atwood. His parents are Gary and Linda. He has a brother, Steve, and a sister, Ann. 
   Atwood is a very small town, not that Warsaw is all that big, in the big scheme of things, but Atwood is a very small town, similar to the one I grew up in, probably about 500 people or thereabouts, between 500 and 1,000, at most. It is on U.S. 30. Many people may go by it. Be careful if you do, there is usually often a policeman there who tries to catch people in a speed trap. The town is just a little ways away. 
   But this is a big moment for Atwood. One of their stars that came out went to Warsaw High School; and even though he went to Warsaw High School, he was known as an Atwood boy. Warsaw is a large consolidated high school in the area, and all the small towns know their individuals there. 
   Vicky Romine, the postmaster in Atwood, requested this from our office and said, because he was an Atwood boy, they wanted to name their post office after him. The three county commissioners in Kosciusko County, Brad Jackson, Ronald Truex and Bob Conley, all sent letters of support to rename this post office after Lance Corporal David Fribley. 
   He graduated from high school in 1996, where he was an all-conference football player and a track and field star. He was on the track and field team at Indiana State from 1996 to 1998 and placed sixth in the shot put at the 1998 Missouri Valley Conference Indoor and Outdoor Championships. He went on to graduate with a bachelor's degree in recreational-business administration from Indiana State University. 
   After college he moved to Fort Myers, Florida, where he began organizing activities for retirees at the Shell Point Retirement Community until September 11, 2001. Right after 9/11, he joined the Marine Corps, saying, ``The greatest gift one can give another is the gift of service. The following is my gift to you and others. With all the strength of my fellow marines, we shall always provide you with the comforting feeling of safety that you have each day.'' 
   He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In 2003, he was deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On March 23, 2003, he died during a battle near Nasiriyah. He became the first Hoosier killed in action in support of Iraqi Operation Freedom. 
   Corporal Fribley was always ready to pitch in, friends and family say. When an uncle took sick, he mowed his aunt's lawn. When a cousin wanted to attend Indiana State, he took her to the sprawling campus, showed her shortcuts and introduced her around. 
   One of his fraternity brothers at Indiana State said: ``David was one of those simple, gentle people. You could ask him to do anything, and he would stop what he was doing and help you. He was one of those people that I trusted with everything. I could go to him with a problem. I could go to him with an issue, and he would always come through.'' 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (COMMENDING GREEN BAY PACKERS QUARTERBACK BRETT FAVRE FOR ESTABLISHING A NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE RECORD FOR MOST CAREER TOUCHDOWN PASSES -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   We're going to be saying lots of nice things about Brett Favre this afternoon, but I want to make sure that he understands the most important thing. In my fantasy football team, the Domers, he's my starting quarterback this weekend. I need a lot of points. I don't want this going to his head that we're passing this congressional resolution. 
   In my little hometown of 700 of Grabill outside Fort Wayne, Indiana, when it was created, a man named Ben Neuenschwander brought a German over named Fred Marolf, and then Fred broke off, and up at the county line he formed a cheese company. And after many years and just a few miles from my hometown, they moved up to where all the cheeseheads go, to Wisconsin. 
   County Line Cheese today is one of the more famous cheese companies in America. And I don't know whether they make the actual cheeseheads that you Wisconsinites wear, but they certainly make a lot of the cheese. 
   That's kind of been my tie to the cheeseheads, because growing up near a plant, you could get the green curds and all that type of stuff. I followed the Green Bay Packers growing up, and they had Bart Starr and Fuzzy Thurston in the line and Jim Taylor, of course Paul Hornung, the Notre Dame great, and you kind of wondered whether Green Bay fans were going to be like Cub fans and all they did was talk about the past. Then along comes Brett Favre. 
   So let me rise today in support of this resolution to Brett Favre of the Green Bay Packers for breaking the world record on career touchdown passes, and the way he handled this with Dan Marino was just amazing for the country to watch as they both praised each other. 
   He adds to his record also for the most passes attempted, the most passes completed and, most importantly of all, the most games won as a starting quarterback. 
   It's only fitting that Favre continue his run on the NFL record books because he's always been a man ahead of his time. He started on his high school baseball team as an eighth grader. He started at seven different positions, including offensive and defensive line, as a ninth grader on a varsity football team. 
   In 1987, he arrived at Southern Miss, and at age 17, was listed as the seventh-string for the Golden Eagles. Midway through the third game of that season, he had become the starter. He would not relinquish that spot until he graduated 4 years later. He would lead stunning upsets of Florida State and, as a senior, Alabama. 
   Two years later, Ron Wolf was hired as general manager of the Green Bay Packers. In his first speech to Packer fans, Wolf revealed that the Packers' next quarterback was a guy they'd never heard of, a guy who had languished as a third-string signal caller of the Atlanta Falcons, a guy named Brett Favre. He traded a running back you've never heard of to Atlanta for Favre, and the rest is history. 
   Well, maybe not all the rest. The Packers are 5-1 this year, and Favre, at 38, is off to his best start in years. Teammates say he's in the best shape of his career; coaches say he is making the best decisions of his career. 
   Could he do it again? Could he win his second Super Bowl? American cheeseheads hope so. For those of us Colts fans, we hope he does well in the final game but doesn't win. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (CONGRATULATING THE PHOENIX MERCURY FOR WINNING THE 2007 WNBA CHAMPIONSHIP -- (House of Representatives - October 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in strong support of the resolution to congratulate the Phoenix Mercury for bringing the first professional  basketball title ever to the Valley of the Sun. 
   The Mercury became the first team in WNBA history to clinch the league title on the road when it defeated the Detroit Shock in Detroit on September 16 to win the championship series 3-2. The Mercury relied on a variety of stars, from point guard Cappie Pondexter to former Connecticut star Diana Taurasi. Penny Taylor, Kelly Miller and Tangela Smith also averaged in double figures as the Mercury set the league scoring record for the second straight year. 
   I remember back in the 1960s when I was in college and things were a tad more sexist. You had half-court basketball. It has sure changed today when you watch the women in the WNBA outshoot and do things that most males wouldn't dream of being able to do. It has truly emerged as an increasingly popular sport and impressive sport. 
   It is no coincidence that all the high scoring occurred under the watch of Coach Paul Westhead, a Shakespearean scholar who taught actual classes while serving as a men's basketball coach. He devised a style 20 years ago as coach at Loyola Marymount that made the Los Angeles school the epicenter and really the founder of the high-scoring, I shouldn't have said that quite that way because there were others who did run-and-gun basketball, but Loyola Marymount was the first team that regularly scored more than 100 points. He took that show to George Mason University in Northern Virginia before returning to the pro game as an assistant a few years later. 
   In 2005, he resurfaced in Phoenix and helped turn a middle-of-the-pack team into a champion. At 68, with titles in both the NBA and WNBA to his credit, he has resigned, but not before helping to bring a trophy to a city that has long waited for one. 
   Congratulations to Coach Westhead and to all the Mercury and its fans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge passage of this resolution to congratulate the Warner Robins, Georgia, All Stars for winning the Little League World Championship in August in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The achievements on the field, Dalton Carriker smacked a 2-1 curve ball from Junsho Kiuchi of Japan over the right field wall to give the Georgia team a 3-2 walk-off victory before 31,000 fans, were, of course, remarkable. 
   Madam Speaker, what happened right after that was even more remarkable and speaks even higher of the players and coaches involved in this great victory. In fact, these boys taught a lesson that we here in Washington would do well to consider. When the Georgia boys saw the Japanese boys slump to the ground in defeat, they rushed to their sides, gave them hugs and physically and emotionally lifted their spirits. They knew the Japanese players were opponents, not enemies. They knew that good, worthy opponents are a blessing. Without opponents who push us, we never put forth our best effort, and our victories are empty and meaningless and trite. 
   The winning pitcher for Georgia, Kendall Scott, summed it up best as to why his team reacted as it did, and, little did he know, why programs such as Little League and other youth sports are so valuable to the character of America's youth: ``They don't disrespect,'' Scott said. ``They are very disciplined, and they are some of the nicest kids you'll ever meet. Just seeing them fall down and cry, you just couldn't let them do that. You gotta pick them up.'' 
   Madam Speaker, when these young men write their ``What I did on my summer vacation'' essays this fall, they will have a dazzling story to tell. They took on the world and won. But, better yet, they taught the world a lesson, that victories can come after the game as well as during it.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3685, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 07, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank my distinguished friend from Washington. 
   Rather than comment generally on the bill here, I am going to focus on the rule. I will talk later on the bill itself. 
   As a senior member of the Education Committee, we went through this debate in committee, and I find it reprehensible that the process we have been following increasingly in this House is to shut off debate, that ironically in a bill that is supposedly expanding rights, we have another narrowly drawn rule that deprived me of offering several amendments that I offered in committee, has a gerrymandered rule for another amendment that is unique in history, has several others put in in the Rules Committee that are very unclear. 
   Let me go through a number of these different amendments. I offered an amendment in committee that was unanimously opposed by the Democrats in committee to eliminate the word ``perceived.'' This is a legal nightmare. There is no other law. There is talk about how ADA has some things vaguely familiar. But it does not say ``perceived.'' How in the world are you going to define ``perceived''? As anybody who has any friends who have worked with and been acquainted with people who have a homosexual lifestyle, there are all types. This is open-ended. There is no list here of what is perceived to be homosexual. How is an employer supposed to figure out whether it is perceived? Does that mean if he is a Christian and has made statements, somebody can file a suit because they perceived they were discriminated, not based on any kind of actions that occurred but something that was perceived? This is a legal nightmare and a precedent that is absolutely terrible, and we can't even vote. We can't even have a vote to strike the word ``perceived'' and have a full debate on the word ``perceived.'' What kind of an open process is that in the House? 
   I also had an amendment that would have provided some protection for Christians who have strong views in the workplace and will insert into the Record at this point a number of cases. An AT&T employee was fired because he wouldn't sign a statement that contradicted his religious beliefs on accepting homosexual behavior. A man was fired at Red Cross for not participating in Gay and Lesbian Pride Month and forcing him to observe that. Others have been fired for other reasons. 
   The question is not whether you can harass somebody in the workplace. That is already illegal. If you mock somebody, that is already illegal. If you commit a hate crime, that is already illegal. The question is, can you as a Christian express your views and not be persecuted? That, yes, in a sense it is at least a plurality of Americans profess Christianity, a smaller percent conservative Christianity, but we are moving so far as to restrict the rights in the workplace of Christians' even ability to hold or say anything about their views. People can't even have Bible studies in some places it has been ruled because that would be offensive to homosexuals in the workplace based on this law in some cities and have been upheld in the court. 
   Now, moving past the two amendments that were unanimously defeated in committee and then we weren't allowed to debate as a whole House, we have an amendment that was added in response to another amendment from Pete Hoekstra in committee that would have exempted Christian colleges. It was unanimously defeated by the Democrats in committee. Then suddenly in the Rules Committee we have it added with a religious exemption. The problem with the religious exemption, and here I would like to put into the Record a number of cases that show the problem with this. Loyola University was deprived of a religious exemption because even though it was founded by Jesuits, its charter requires its president to be a Jesuit and more than one-third of their trustees, they were denied because they didn't meet one of those criteria. A Friends School, a Quaker school, was denied a religious exemption because it had to have multiple proof that everybody there was Quaker and was following every rule. A private religious school was denied for similar type things. A business that wanted to run as a religious world view was clearly denied the religious exemption. An orphanage by the United Methodist Church was denied the ability because it had gone secular. They wanted to come back and be a Methodist church again and they were denied, and these were all court decisions, because they were no longer purely Methodists and they didn't have a right to go back and be Methodist. This is in addition to the 2,500 Christian bookstores in America. Only 14 percent are run by a church. Eighty-six percent are either for-profit or not primarily religious organizations. 
   Under this bill, they will be forced to hire homosexuals regardless of the personal views of Christian bookstores. This is going to happen in various independent organizations that are quasi-part of the church. Sometimes the church will operate a for-profit entity, that runs as a for-profit entity, that would not be predominantly for a religious purpose, but the proceeds go to the church, therefore, they will implement their church beliefs in it, even though it is a for-profit entity. None of that is exempted under this. We didn't even get a chance to debate this amendment. It just came in in the rule. 
   Now, we move to another amendment that suddenly appeared, or I guess we will be debating here on marriage. Somehow in response to debate in committee, they are saying that this won't affect the Defense of Marriage Act. This is another lawsuit amendment because that is directly contrary to the fundamental part of the bill. My amendment tries to address part of this, but quite frankly, it is a legal quagmire. 
   Then we come to amendments that are allowed. We have had some debate on this gender equity for transgender and transvestite. Now, the challenge here is not whether you favor it or are against it. I heard my friend from New York say he was going to vote for it. He can't vote for it. We are not allowed to vote for it. We have been banned from having a debate. What happened to the day when we have a debate, you win or lose? To come in unprecedented, I have never heard, as a staffer or a Member, a rule coming in prohibiting in the rule a vote. This is an in-your-face tactic as part of this bill to not let us debate the religious underpinnings and the religious stuff, not debate ``perceived,'' not debate protections for people who are individuals, not have a vote on transgender, and it's 5 minutes on each side to even debate it. 
   This is an abominable rule. It is a precedent-setting, terrible, terrible rule. I urge people to support my colleague Mr. Hastings' motion on the previous question and to vote against that so we can have some amendments to this rule and then vote against this abominable rule because it sets precedents we will regret for a long, long time no matter which party is in the majority. 
   Examples of Discrimination Against Religious Employees 
   Christian employees who read Bibles during ``diversity training'' reprimanded and spend four years in lawsuits to obtain reversal. The ACLJ filed suit in April 1998 against the Minnesota Department of Corrections on behalf of Thomas Altman and Ken Yackly to force their employer to rescind the reprimands they received in 1997 after they silently read their Bibles at a state-mandated training session called ``Gays and Lesbians in the Workplace.'' The employees contended that the training session was little more than a state-sponsored indoctrination aimed at changing their religious beliefs about homosexuality. Four years later, and several appeals later, the employees were finally vindicated. 
   AT&T employee in Denver fired for refusing to sign company-required pledge to recognize, respect and value sexual orientation  differences within the company. In January 2001, an employee of AT&T was required to sign a new AT&T Broadband Employee Handbook with policies that conflicted with his religious beliefs by condoning the homosexual lifestyle. After notifying his supervisor that based on his religious belief he could not sign the certificate of understanding, he was fired. 
   Christian firefighter suspended for handing out tract entitled ``The truth about homosexuality.'' Madison, Wis., firefighter Ron Greer nearly lost his job for giving his colleagues a tract entitled, ``The truth about homosexuality.'' He was suspended and ordered to attend diversity training for violating the city's anti-discrimination code. 
   Hospice worker fired by gay supervisor for expressing Christian beliefs about homosexuality. Debra Kelly, a former hospice worker in Philadelphia, was fired for expressing her Christian beliefs about homosexuality. Her supervisor, a supporter of ACT-UP, a militant homosexual group, said Kelly was intolerant and unsuited for her position. 
   At Hewlett Packard's plant in Boise, Idaho, an employee with a 21-year record of meeting or exceeding expectations was fired for refusing to remove Bible verses about homosexuality from his cubicle. The employee allegedly posted the Bible verses in response to a poster near his cubicle that he perceived to be promoting GLBT relationships. HP openly admitted that its reasoning for firing the employee was ``his overt opposition to HP's Diversity Advertising Campaign.'' 
   Man fired by American Red Cross for not celebrating homosexuality Michael Hartman was employed by the Red Cross in San Diego. The company sent a mass e-mail to all employees in 2005 promoting ``Gay and Lesbian Pride Month,'' urging them to ``observe'' the celebration. Hartman, a Christian, communicated his religious objections to his supervisors and was promptly called in and told his communication was ``inappropriate.'' Hartmann was fired. 
   Oakland city employees posting a flier on a company bulletin board forced to remove flier and threatened with discipline. Oakland, Calif., city employees Regina Rederlord and Robin Christy formed a group called the ``Good News Employee Association'' and posted a flier on a company bulletin board advertising a ``forum for people of faith to express their views on contemporary issues of the day, with respect for the natural family, marriage and family values.'' After a lesbian employee complained of being offended by the flier, the city removed the flier and threatened the two women with adverse employment action for placing the fliers ``in public view which contained statements of a homophobic nature and were determined to promote sexual orientation based harassment.'' A federal court upheld the city's action. 
   In Portland, Maine, city officials canceled a $60,000 grant for a Salvation Army meals-on-wheels program for senior citizens. Why? As a Christian denomination, the Salvation Army won't provide marital benefits to homosexual employees, thus running afoul of the city's ``sexual orientation'' law. When the Portland's ``sexual orientation'' ordinance was introduced, proponents argued, as they do often today, that it would merely ensure that ``people won't be fired for being ``gay.''

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank our distinguished ranking member. 
   ``Perceived'' is, in fact, a real problem because many businesses simply won't go to court. Obviously they will negotiate or not bother with it. That's the type of intimidation tactics that occur. 
   I am against the underlying bill. I have never hidden that I'm against the underlying bill. I think it's a disaster for Christian bookstores, at least 85 percent of which would fall under this, all sorts of Christian colleges. Even with the well-intentioned amendment that certainly improves the bill that Chairman Miller is offering, it still doesn't fix the underlying problems. 
   One prominent attorney says that basically religious rights have to be trumped by sexual rights in the workplace, and that's the goal of this act, and that this gives religious rights a secondary status in our society to sexual rights. 
   I want to address one other thing, and I apologize for bringing politics into this. In my last campaign, in the last 10 days of my campaign, a cookie-cutter ad was dropped on me that started with pictures of Speaker Hastert and Jerry Lewis. Then a little clip was inserted into the ad that said Speaker Hastert visited my district and that I was proud to have him visit my district. Then pictures of Duke Cunningham came up, and then a picture of Bob Ney came up, then a picture of Mark Foley. Mark Foley's picture came out from the screen, referring to ``Friends of Mark Souder'' and said that Mark Souder has friends who have even had unnatural sex with minors, which was a smear on Mark Foley; nothing was either proven or even directly alleged that way. But for a party that ran cookie-cutter ads, in order to get the majority against me, every half hour referring to unnatural sex with minors that wasn't proven and smeared me, Mark Foley, and others, to stand down here, not allow a vote on gender because they wouldn't want to divide their party on the vote, not allow any direct votes on ``perceived,'' not allow any religious protection votes, and then to attack us for being intolerant when your party used that ad against me and others is a tad cute.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, I would like to insert into the Record a letter from Agudath Israel of America on how this impacts Orthodox Jewish groups and their reasons they are opposing this, and an article by Andrew Sullivan, a gay editor of The New Republic, who correctly points out that, in fact, this does not meet the discrimination standards in the sense of, if we were having a situation in America where gays, homosexuals couldn't get jobs, it would be a different challenge. 
   But I wanted to make a couple of points. There is a great irony to this bill. In the faith-based debate, we couldn't get title VII included, and now the Democrats have included it in this bill. 
   The Democrats opposed the Defense of Marriage Act, and now they are putting it in this bill. 
   Why does the bill exempt the military? Why can government discriminate and the private sector not discriminate? How in the world is this going to be upheld in court, to be able to hold a standard that the military can discriminate, that religious groups can discriminate, but Christian bookstores can't discriminate? 
   Clearly, in this bill the majority has tried to provide political cover, a fig leaf, so they can try to move a bill through, knowing full well that once you have the underlying bill, these other protections are going to be stripped out over time. It is internally inconsistent and ironic that the very people who oppose these things now insert them in this bill. 
   Another irony in this bill is that apparently the Boy Scouts' paid employees fall under this, but their volunteers don't. But this raises a question, what if they get their mileage reimbursed? What if they get expense reimbursement? It leads to a question of what if they go on and off the payroll. What about if they get a tax deduction? A lot of the reasons religious organizations are concerned about this is that is, in fact, a government benefit. Once we have a law that states that discrimination against homosexuals is wrong, this is obviously open to court interpretation, as many others are. 
   This is a bill fraught with so many problems that it should not see the light of day.

   Mr. SOUDER. I want to thank Chairman Miller. As a former Republican staff director on the Children and Family Committee when he was chairman of that, and working with the committee, I found, as he said earlier, that he listened to the Hoekstra amendment committee and made some adjustments that, in fact, occasionally he is right. It's occasional, but occasionally he is right. This addressed some of our concerns. It did not address all of our concerns. 
   As you know, when you are dealing with religious law or any law, it isn't at the heart of the matter, it's at the fringes. In communion, can minors take real alcohol and wine? Can Native Americans smoke peyote? 
   Here we're not dealing, and this amendment helps clarify that, we're not dealing with religious colleges. We're not dealing with the church proper, but law in the United States is we deal with religious discrimination, the ability to deal whether sexual discrimination trumps religious discrimination, which is fundamentally what this bill is about, that people who hold deeply held religious beliefs, which is part of Orthodox Jewish teaching, fundamentalist Muslim teaching and, in the Bible, unlike civil rights, where civil rights were led by William Wilberforce in England, by the abolitionists in America because the Bible was not explicit. But here, in fact, the Bible is explicit. The Koran is explicit. The Torah is explicit. And people have deeply held religious beliefs. So 85 percent of the Christian bookstores in America would not be covered by this protection. Certain types of church camps would not be, depending on how it's handled. Group homes that are often independent and do not have an overt religious message that grew out of the faith message of a church but do not necessarily now have an overtly religious mission, they're part of the outgrowth of the religion, would be covered. They wouldn't be able to have a husband and wife be the house parents under this bill. Religious law is a lot more complex than it was presented today. 
   One of the other challenges here is when we are trying to talk about how do we debate in public life over people of faith and which party are they going to be in, how are we going to reach out to this, the American people have heard in this debate today people who seriously are uncomfortable with this debate. We don't like to talk about this type of thing. I have tried to treat everybody in my life, regardless of how they have been in this Congress or friends back home or people I have worked with, with respect and dignity and do not practice personal discrimination. 
   But I have heard my religion and my religious belief called prejudiced, bigoted, hate-filled, that the predominant religions in America have had their basic beliefs, those who believe in a literal Bible, have seen their faith smeared today on this House floor, and I am very disappointed in much of the tone. I understand the passion. I understand why people who have a homosexual life-style feel they have been discriminated against, but this is a classic question in our country. If, in fact, nobody could get a job, we would be facing a different challenge today. I openly admit that. 
   But the challenge here is do people who have deeply held religious convictions based on the fundamental text of their faith have the right to practice their faith, too, or are they going to be trumped? This amendment is a step, but it's only a step.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   My amendment is very simple. It strikes paragraph 3 of 8(a). It does that because, what this clause does, in the name of protecting homosexuals, actually takes out any ability of any business, any youth home, any group, any organization to have any kind of marriage criteria. This doesn't go to the defense of marriage question directly, although it builds in inherent contradictions, because the last amendment, in attempting to address that, merely bred confusion and contradiction inside of the bill, which will have to be resolved by courts. Defense of marriage makes it so that, for example, somebody married in Vermont or Hawaii doesn't have to have their marital status recognized in Indiana. But it doesn't address the fundamental question of can marriage be a criteria. 
   In fact, this bill even goes beyond that. It doesn't allow you to have any kind of criteria on any type of sexual behavior. It isn't just about homosexual behavior. It isn't clear that any organization can have any guidelines on adultery, on polygamy or anything else, because by eliminating marriage, by eliminating any kind of sexual standards, it's unclear what standards you can have that relate to sex at all. So if you have any kind of ministry goal and aren't a profoundly Christian organization that falls under the very narrow definition of the last amendment, you're in deep trouble here. 
   So you can't find things like we've seen just recently on the Web site that says things like house parents, cottage parents, counselor parents, family teaching couples. Any organization that wants to try to do this cannot do so. This obviously comes in for Christian child care centers. This is going to come in, which are not overtly Christian missions, it's going to come into exercise centers that may be operated by religious organizations. It comes into all Christian bookstores, obviously, into different counseling centers that maybe both secular and Christian counseling will not be covered by their ability to say that in order to do family counseling you have to be married and you have to subscribe to certain kinds of sexual standards. They will be prohibited, because they aren't covered by title VII under a narrow definition of title VII. 
   My amendment would eliminate all this. It doesn't fix the bill. I admit, it doesn't change my opinion on the underlying bill, but it helps solve a deeper problem that was created, and I understand why it was created, because those who want to protect homosexuals didn't want to have a back-door way to, in effect, discriminate against them. But by doing this, they set up another class of discrimination, once again pitting sexual discrimination up against the right to practice religious liberty. 
   I'll reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SOUDER. I appreciate the Chairman's explanation, and there's no use to belabor a point when you've won. 
   At the same time, I do want to clarify a couple of things inside that. 
   A, my amendment is far too weak to reach my own goals, and I realize that. I was hoping it could be adopted because I think it improves the bill. 
   B, I think that the chairman correctly stated the challenge here and the inherent inconsistency in the bill. By merely removing this clause, it didn't allow, in effect, a bill that was intended to protect gay people into other areas, in marriage criteria and other sexual things, because that could have been far more reaching because many organizations have in one man-one woman marriage clauses, also fidelity clauses with the marriage clause, which is why I refer to that. 
   In this mix, however, I understand that in the purposes of the bill, without the protection that you announced, in fact, somebody could try to get around the intent of the bill. And I understand what you're trying to address. 
   So, in conclusion, while my amendment, I think, doesn't fix or still has inherent contradictions, still is going to lead to lawsuits, still lead to all sorts of questions, nevertheless, it will improve the bill. 
   I appreciate the chairman's willingness to support this amendment. It's an incremental improvement. It doesn't fix much, but at least it's another small step. 
   I yield back.

   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   This amendment both would protect transgender in the sense of people who have had sex change operations, and transvestites, people who dress up as the opposite sex, who are not covered, apparently, under the underlying bill. 
   This bill was to come in front of our committee. Ostensibly, partly because there was a major convention, a disruption occurred on the other party's side over this particular amendment, and the bill was withdrawn. Then continued debate occurred, and in committee a number of the Democrat members voted against the bill because this amendment wasn't included, and, presumably, that was going to be so the amendment could be offered on the floor and people would have a right to vote on this. 
   I don't really need a right to vote on it. I think most people probably know where I stand on the issue. But I think that to not have a vote on an amendment like this is a political ploy. It's a political ploy in the sense of what appears to be happening here is that the majority doesn't want to have the embarrassment of their side dividing on an issue. Or maybe they're afraid that our people would actually vote for this amendment and put it over the top to kill the bill, but I would suggest on a vote like this, that would be extremely unlikely. I think it's more that they want to shield their Members from having a difficult vote. Therefore, they can go out and tell the transgender community, oh, we tried, but, in fact, in a very peculiar rule, it appears that the intention is to keep us from calling for a vote and having Members actually show where they stand on this issue, not where they give speeches on this issue but where they actually stand on this issue. Clearly, the word ``perceived'' in an amendment that I had been denied for this bill would have had a huge relevance also to this particular category. 
   The challenge before us as we look at this, and from a conservative perspective, we have heard repeatedly today from multiple speakers, from the opening debate on rules, through the general debate, through here, that we are eventually going to move in this direction. And yet we are told that we as conservatives are paranoiac, that religious organizations are going to be protected, this and that, it's going to be protected. 
   We have seen the Democrats move and add a title VII protection that they opposed over in the faith-based for years on this House floor. We saw them add a defense of marriage clause, which they had opposed for years. We've seen them move even to the point of including, contrary to what the majority leader said that the government is applying this, know that the military is exempt from having this bill applied to them, inconsistency. Clearly, they are willing to tolerate major changes in the majority's position in order to move the bill, which moves people on the other side to ask, what's the point of moving the bill if there are this many compromises? Oh, they've been saying all day long that they're going to expand this bill. Once it becomes law, it's going to go to court to resolve the different things. Hence, some of us believe that many of the things that were added today, on the marriage clause, on the religious exemption clause, the blocking of this amendment to be offered, were to make the bill more palatable. As my friend the chairman of Financial Services said, you can't get everything in the first thing. It's to make it more palatable to, in effect, move it in place. 
   And this isn't the end of the day here. This is the start of a move that many of us who just simply don't approve of the lifestyle, there are many different things we don't approve of, but this is a deeply held position of faith by millions of Americans. And this is an attempt, a start, of what's likely to be an increasing effort to have sexual liberties trump religious liberties. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, it has been 7 years since the terrorist attacks that took the lives of over 3,000 men, women, and children. I join with my colleagues to offer sincere condolences to the families of the victims. We must never forget these tragic events; they have left a wound that will never heal. 
   I also rise to remember and honor the first responders who acted with bravery and heroism on that day and during the recovery period. During one of the worst tragedies our Nation has faced, we witnessed the most remarkable acts of self-sacrifice, courage, and compassion. It is a testament to the American spirit. 
   Since 9/11, we have taken steps to help anticipate and deter future attacks and prepare for a quick and effective response following an emergency. One benchmark of the progress made is the absence of further acts of terrorism on U.S. soil during the past 7 years. This has not been an accident. 
   The men and women serving in our Nation's Armed Forces are pursuing terrorists overseas and warrant our utmost respect and appreciation for their faithful service. Additionally, the 216,000 employees of the Department of Homeland Security deserve our gratitude for their efforts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to gather and analyze intelligence, coordinate with State and local law enforcement, harden our borders, secure our transportation systems, and enforce the laws. 
   We all recognize that our foes are extremely determined and patient; even now they are looking to exploit our open and free society to carry out additional attacks. Our resolve must be even stronger to detect, deter, and respond. There is much more work to do to bolster our security and counter changing threats. 
   Today is a day to renew our commitment to improve our intelligence capabilities, secure our borders, support our first responders in communities large and small, and intensify our vigilance. 
   While the attacks occurred in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania, the Nation felt the reverberations and stood together in unprecedented unity. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan differences and make the security of our Nation and the well-being of our military personnel fighting the war on terrorism top priorities.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the distinguished ranking member and chairman of the subcommittee. 
   Mr. Chairman, I want to point out a tremendous irony that is happening here in the Capitol Building today. In the other body, the President of the United States has come over to lobby for an immigration bill and the other body is considering this. Yet we are debating a homeland security bill where we have had Republicans come down to the floor who say it's too expensive, that it's spending too much money, but if you took this times four on an annual basis for 5 years, you couldn't begin to meet the standards that are in the Senate bill. We have people like Mr. Rogers of Kentucky pointing out that we're mandating Homeland Security to go check everybody in these detention centers but without any money for it. Unless your intention is complete and pure amnesty, how would you do that if you don't fund programs? 
   Mr. Rogers of Alabama pointed out that we don't have a realistic program for training Border Patrol, that it's costing too much. Yeah. Well, how are we going to ramp this up two or three times if we don't have money to do the Border Patrol people? 
   This bill is an advertisement, a walking billboard for the gaping holes in the bill of the other body. On pages 12 and 13 of this bill, and I agree with all these criticisms as we worked through our subcommittee, it says that they have to define activities, milestones and costs of implementing the program for the Secure Border Initiative. You mean they don't have that? You mean they're promising that we're going to have a secure border and they don't even have the cost estimates? Yes, that's correct. 
   Number 2 here on page 12 says, demonstrate how the activities will further the objectives of it and have a multi-year strategic plan. You mean they don't have a multi-year strategic plan? No, they don't. 
   Identify funding and staffing. You mean they haven't done that? 
   Describe how the plan addresses security needs at the northern border. They don't even have the date set for when they're going to develop a plan for the northern border, yet we're debating a bill in the other body that says that we're supposedly securing our border? 
   On page 37, it says, complete the schedule for the full implementation of a biometric exit program or certification that such program is not possible within 5 years. Well, I've talked to US-VISIT. They haven't even been talked to about it. Of course they can't meet 5 years. We're talking 10 years minimum. 
   What are they debating over in the other body? When the American public looks at what's happening in the Capitol Building on the same day and we're passing an appropriations bill that has theoretically looking at a biometric exit maybe in the next 5 years and the other body is acting like it's done, what's going on here? 
   On page 59, there's a direct challenge to the question of our matching system. Now, the other day we had somebody with TB who had the warning on the screen, one we actually caught and we released him. But what we have is a question of are our lists even valid and there are restrictions on that. 
   Other parts of the bill are actually going to delay the implementation of the fence by saying that, for example, 75 percent of the land in Arizona is actually either government-owned, Native-American-owned, it's a wilderness area, it's a range; and it says we have to work out each of those things before we can put any fence in. 
   Another part of the bill says we have to work with State and local governments in their areas. How in the world can the other body be making these promises when this bill points out the gaping holes?

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, I hope to address several questions more deeply in general debates, as well as with some amendments; but as the ranking member of the Border, Port Security and Global Antiterrorism Subcommittee of Homeland Security, I have been spent much of my congressional career working narcotics, immigration and terrorism issues on the border, particularly as narcotics coordinator in Congress. I worked this even before 9/11. 
   In the year 2002, we issued the most comprehensive border report ever done by Congress. We had 11 hearings, include many hearings on the north and south borders. In addition, I have visited every major border crossing, north and south border, multiple times and, in particular, the largest southern border crossings many, many times, almost annually. 
   I have several amendments in this bill related to counternarcotics and terrorism with CBP and with the Coast Guard. But I want to talk briefly here at this point on the border. Thanks to continued funding and the hard work of the people in the Department of Homeland Security, we have made some progress, particularly since 9/11. That said, in case you haven't heard, our borders are still not secure. Not even close. 
   We have three basic interrelated challenges. And if you can't fix one, you can't fix any: terrorism, contraband and illegal immigration. 
   Last week we had an irresponsible individual who decided that despite being told not to travel to Europe, he did. Flying home, he flew to Canada and then crossed our border crossing. The screen was absolutely clear. It said, ``Refer to INS secondary.'' Even though all our border personnel had very clear instructions to place mask on subject, place in isolation, well-ventilated room, if possible, subject has multiple resistant TB, public health risk, among other things, he was waved on through after very brief screening. In spite of this, he was waved on through. Now that means we cannot even keep people we have caught. 
   Then there was this from yesterday: Homeland Security busted three Texas National Guardsmen for smuggling illegals using National Guard vehicles. That was just yesterday. 
   Last year, when I was subcommittee chairman, we heard horror stories on illegals being deported multiple times and coming back in and committing additional felonies. Yet the President of our country is coming over to lobby the other body about bringing a terrible amnesty bill back to life. There is not a Member in this body or the other body who doesn't understand that we have to deal with the people that are here, with H-1B visas, with the huge challenges we have in this country. 
   But this bill demonstrates the fraud of the Senate bill because it has unrealistic border controls that we are just asking in this bill, in clause after clause, for them to report on the costs. We cut the money intended for the travel initiative. How in the world can you do a 380-page amnesty bill if you can't even begin to deliver the basics? 
   Fortunately, the bill before us today starts to address those. The cost is horrendous. I want to go through, item by item, the challenges, the premises behind what the President is arguing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are a number of things that are less than normal procedure tonight, and I want to briefly explain what has gone on here. 
   We have an underlying bill that went through the Government Reform and Oversight Committee that is being offered first. The gentleman from Illinois is correct that that went through unanimously, partly after a contentious hearing and debate. Chairman Waxman and Ranking Member Davis asked if we could just move it without a lot of amendments, move it without contention, because we knew we were coming to the House floor for the major debate tonight. 
   In this major debate, there will be an amendment offered by Mr. Childers of Mississippi that has been worked out in cooperation, proving that in fact when we try, we can work together, and that Congressman Ross and I had a bill to overturn the D.C. gun ban. The Supreme Court took care of the need for that. The District of Columbia came back and attempted to reinstitute the ban. It became apparent from the discharge petition that the will of this House, the overwhelming majority that signed the brief to the Supreme Court, the overwhelming majority of the Senate signed a brief to the Supreme Court, and it became apparent that this House wanted a vote. 
   The Democrat leadership, to their credit, worked out with the NRA and the minority a bill that was acceptable to Mr. Ross and myself and those who had been attempting to overturn this. This will be offered in the nature of a substitute tonight. The underlying bill is not what is in contention here. The underlying bill is a stalking horse for the existing law and the debate we will have here is about the existing law. 
   The fact is that the reason the Supreme Court overturned the existing law is that under existing law if you wanted to protect yourself in your home, you had to have a gun in a  locked cabinet, disassembled, with the bullets in another location. If somebody broke into your house and started firing, you had to go find the key, assemble the gun, find the bullets, put the bullets into the gun and hope your family wasn't dead or you were dead. 
   The Supreme Court argued that American citizens have a preexisting right to defend themselves, and no city or State has the right to take that away. The critical part of that decision was that a militia is in fact not a military, but the militia are the citizenry itself and have a right to home defense and to self-defense. It supersedes any right of a city to abrogate that right. It supersedes the State's right to abrogate that right. It is a right to self-defense in the United States. 
   Now, there will be much debate tonight about the process. But let me make a couple of facts extremely clear. Marion Barry once said that the crime rate in the District of Columbia isn't too bad, except for the murders. That is not quite right, because they are actually up in all violent crime, 67 percent, even though the city has declined in population. 
   Washington, D.C. has been the murder capital of the United States 15 of the last 19 years. It has been in the top three the others. The two cities that have occasionally toppled it from its top rank are Baltimore and Detroit. Both those cities have restrictive laws, in Detroit and in Baltimore as well, hardly making a case that guns do anything to protect people. 
   In fact, John Stossel on ``20-20'' in some interviews had some interesting points. He talked to a maximum security felon, and the unidentified male prisoner said, ``When you go to rob somebody you don't know,'' speaking as if they are armed, ``if you don't know, it makes it harder to rob them.'' 
   He also talked to another prisoner who said, when they said don't gun laws work, wouldn't that affect your ability to get guns? And he said, ``I am not worried about the government saying I can't carry a gun. I am going to carry a gun anyway.'' This isn't about, to use the classic expression, whether criminals are going to have guns. This is about whether citizens have the right to protect themselves.

   Our attempt to reverse the D.C. gun ban was upheld by the Supreme Court, because, in fact, Detroit hasn't, Indianapolis hasn't, no city in the United States attempted to ban handguns, which 85 percent of American people defend themselves through handguns. 
   The second amendment is not any more than when the Supreme Court ruled on integration that States could stand in defiance of a court ruling. States, cities, nobody has a right to stand in defiance of a court ruling.

   I want the record to show because I have great respect for the chairman of the Government Reform Committee, but the fact is I had talked to the minority staff about my concerns with some of the language of this bill because I believe it has factual mistakes in it that suggests that actually handguns endanger people rather than protect people. 
   But I talked to the chairman and to the ranking member, and the hearing that we had had been agreed to by both sides and we went through the process. You specifically told me you will get your vote on the floor and let's not have a fight in committee, so I didn't offer a series of amendments. I certainly had the right, but I chose not to do it.

   Reclaiming my time, you said can you just offer your substitute, and we knew we were going to have that vote on the floor. But what I said was I had a series of amendments, and in discussion with the majority and the minority, I'm not objecting that I didn't have the right to do it; I certainly had the right to do it. What I am objecting to is we had a process that both sides had roughly agreed that we weren't going to challenge the underlying bill. We keep hearing that the underlying bill passed unanimously. It did not have unanimous support in the committee. If we would have had a forced vote, we would have polarized on this, as we would have on the bill. 
   We have moved the bill forward, and that was my point. I believe we are having that debate tonight, but it should not be taken by Members of Congress that there was a unanimous vote in support of this bill as opposed to the substitute that is coming from Mr. Childers.

   Mr. SOUDER. I yield myself 1 minute. 
   Article I, section 8, clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to ``exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over the District.'' That was done by our Founding Fathers. 
   Two hundred and fifty Congressmen signed the amicus brief that said that they felt the DC gun ban should be overturned. Fifty-five Senators signed the amicus brief that said that the DC gun ban should be overturned because it violated a basic constitutional right and, according to Heller, was a pre-existing right to defend yourself, even without the constitutional question. 
   This is not about being a City Council. I don't believe, obviously, you could do gun limitations. The Heller case said there can be limitations. But DC came back with, in effect, a total ban all over again. The reason you have to have interstate commerce is, guess what, they passed a new ban, but there's no gun stores with which to get one gun. The Childers amendment, as I understand it, has a temporary ability to get guns elsewhere because there is no way to defend yourself in the District of Columbia because you can't buy a gun and bring it. And that's why that particular clause is in, regardless of the claims contrary, that this is not about being a State government because in fact----

   That this isn't about whether or not we're usurping State government powers because the State, there isn't a State. We are, in effect, the State government. Normal cities have a State with which to work a check, and it's not a matter of city. 
   When it comes to a constitutional right, whether it's freedom of speech, freedom of religion or any basic right, no City Council has a right to take away.

   Mr. SOUDER. To answer the gentleman's question very directly, my assumption was, after the Heller case, that my bill was dead and that we would not have to revisit it in Congress. I was outraged by the actions of the District of Columbia, and that led to the process of working with those who signed the brief, including Mr. Childers, who's doing the amendment, Mr. Ross, on your side who had been there to act. I did not believe that the District of Columbia was going to do such an egregious bill that said you had to be in imminent danger that put most of those controls in.

Obviously, if the DC government enacted legislation that Congress had faith in, that this bill would likely not go through the Senate and be signed by the President. But we are now moving a bill through that had been agreed upon a number of weeks ago, that I believe is necessary, that I don't believe the DC Council acted in good faith. But we shall see. 
   But the vote's here. We're voting on a Democratic amendment tonight that's been agreed to, that the majority of this House, that the majority of the Senate agrees with, and I think, at this point the United States Congress has lost faith in whether the----

   Mr. SOUDER. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   We earlier had an exchange with my distinguished colleague and friend from Maryland about whether it was needed for us to pass legislation. Let me read from washingtonpost.com right after the Supreme Court decision. 
   ``Mayor Adrian Fenty and his feisty Attorney General, Peter Nickles, stood on the steps of the Wilson Building this week ostensibly to announce how the District will comply with the Supreme Court's rejection of Washington's ban on handguns. But really, they were delivering very much the opposite message. With only the narrowest of exceptions, we're sticking with our gun ban. Don't like it? Sue us.'' 
   Quote, ``I am pretty confident that the people of the District of Columbia want us to err in the direction of trying to restrict guns,'' Fenty told me, smiling broadly at the suggestion that what he's really trying to do is make it as hard as possible for Washingtonians to keep a loaded gun at home.'' 
   Nickles, the Acting Attorney General said, ``it's clear the Supreme Court didn't intend for you to have a loaded gun around the house.'' 
   Quite frankly, that isn't what the Supreme Court said. The Supreme Court says you have a right to have a handgun in your house to protect yourself; that if this bill was, in fact, just what the D.C. City Council was doing, then it won't harm for us to pass this bill. The only danger is if the City Council really doesn't mean to protect the second amendment. 
   We have lost faith. Statements like this were outrageous after the Supreme Court decision, and that a coalition in this House, something that's rare, a majority of Members working together on both sides of the aisle, working--and NRA has been spit out of some people's mouth like it's some kind of evil organization. The NRA represents gun owners and people who believe in family protection all over America. I am not ashamed to be proud that I work with the NRA. And there are Members on the Democratic side, Mr. Childers is offering the substitute amendment with the support of the Blue Dogs and we've worked together, 250 Members, 55 in the Senate. And it's made to sound like it's some kind of little minor group that wants to take over the City Council of D.C. It's a majority of America. It's a majority of the House, the majority of the Senate, this administration who say the second amendment should be protected. And just because you live in a city that wants to take it away doesn't give that city the right to take it away. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. Lewis is certainly the most respected advocate for civil rights in this United States Congress. No city has a right to deprive a constitutional right, even if the majority of people in that State or city favor depriving you. I don't know how D.C. could be less safe. It's the murder capital in 15 of the last 19 years since they instituted the gun law, and the other 4 years they were in the top three. They were not before they instituted the gun law.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I will yield myself the balance of the time. 
   Anybody watching this debate can feel the passion, and they can see some differences based on where people are from. And can you hear the passion from many of those in the urban cities who are very concerned about the violent crime. 
   I believe this solution is not only wrong and doesn't work; it's unconstitutional. But I do want to say a few words that we do need to get control of the challenges in our urban areas. 
   As my friend from Chicago knows well, we've worked together on prisoner re-entry programs; we've worked together on education programs. We need to make sure there are job opportunities. And there are many things we need to do to try to address the problems that the inner cities face. 
   I do not believe the taking away of the constitutional right to bear arms is the way to go. I don't believe it will work. I believe Washington, D.C. is a model of a gun law not working. And besides that, it happens to be the constitutional right of American citizens to defend themselves. 
   The Supreme Court ruled clearly. The City of Washington attempted to defy that ruling; 250 Members of Congress, 55 Senators who signed the amicus brief believed that Congress therefore has to step reluctantly in to try to pass this legislation. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. And I also want to thank the dean of the House, Chairman Dingell, who has been a hero to gun owners all over America for many years, for his willingness to stand up. And I want to thank our new freshman Member, Mr. Childers, and those who are standing with him, because this is, indeed, a historic night. And unless you're a Member of Congress or somebody who is kind of a political junkie, it's hard to figure out exactly what's happening tonight. 
   In fact, a discharge petition is something that, when you sign it, basically would turn the House over to the other party. And if you're willing to stand up to your own party, you could force a vote. I know this because, when we first became in the majority, I was one who was often pulled into a side room, threatened that by bringing down a rule or other things that I was going to destroy the party. In fact, sometimes it's your only way to force things. There is a certain number of votes that are allowed on each side to let a bill go through. 
   But what we're seeing tonight was the courage of some Members on the majority side to stand up and say, look, we want a bill. And as these negotiations move forward, it came to me, as the Republican author, along with Mr. Ross, of the bill to overturn this, of, will you accept somewhat less than the whole, but a bill that actually has a chance to be law. 
   Now, as a Republican, I could have said, you know, I think we'll let them fight and we'll go into the election with no bill, with no vote in the House, and put those who are so-called Blue Dogs in a real spot. But that isn't the way we should legislate. We have Members who stood up, even in their own party, and said we want to broker an agreement. We had Members on our side, in our leadership, agreeing that we will be willing to negotiate. And we had a Democrat leadership willing to sit down and work it out even though the majority of their party doesn't agree with this, and obviously many of them are passionately upset. 
   So tonight is a historic debate. Tomorrow will be a historic vote: Will the will of the House be allowed to work its will as it did on campaign finance reform? And I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for his leadership.

   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentleman from Mississippi. 
   I wanted to clarify for those watching the debate and for the Congressional Record that the one hearing we did have, there were four witnesses. Three of them were Federal witnesses, and Mr. Issa asked each one of them whether the bill that this amendment is amending had any impact on them. All of them said no. They were never asked another question during the hearing, because they weren't relevant to the hearing. 
   The fourth witness was the police chief of Washington, D.C., and she did have an opinion and doesn't agree, obviously, with this amendment. But she is a political appointee of the mayor, and while it may be her personal view, if she held a view different from the mayor or city council, she would have been removed. 
   So it was somewhat inaccurate to present that at our hearing, that somehow the witnesses all felt that there was this imminent danger in the Federal sector, because all three of them said the bill had nothing to do whatsoever with their positions.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   This is a very simple amendment, one that we have debated the basic principle in the Education and Labor Committee. This is a funding limitation amendment that would say, under the National Labor Relations Act, the board can only recognize a union if there has been a private ballot vote. The current law basically says this, although they have an option for card check. 
   This amendment would say that they cannot expend funds to recognize a union that has not been certified through a secret ballot election. It would basically say the board cannot recognize a card checked union as bargaining agent for employees, with the practical effect of requiring that a union be chosen by secret ballot election if it wishes to actually avail itself of any protections under the act. 
   I believe that the right to have a private vote is very important. I believe that it's very easy to do a shakedown in committee but not on the floor during the debates. We had various amendments regarding penalties. We had various amendments, whether illegals could go on the card check, how intimidation could occur on illegals who signed the card check, from both sides, from management and labor. 
   I think the only way to have a fair election that we know that people  want to form a union is to have a private ballot, and that's the intent of this amendment, to restrict the enforcement of anything not allowing a private ballot.

   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time. 
   First, let me read the amendment. ``None of the funds made available in this Act may be used by the National Labor Relations Board to recognize as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees any labor organization that has not been certified as such by the National Labor Relations Board pursuant to section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act.'' 
   Basically, to have this be ruled in order, I would have liked to have made it more precisely targeted towards just the card check. In effect what this says is that in order to be recognized as an exclusive bargaining representative, you have to have a free election. That is my intent. That is the intent of this. 
   Now, why do I feel that we need to do this bill at this time? One is we have a separate bill moving through that would in effect deprive workers of America of the right to a private ballot. But secondly, earlier today or yesterday I should say, with my support, unlike many of my Republican colleagues, I believe in the right to association. I supported the police and firemen's right to organize, and it came under suspension, and I voted for. 
   But here is another card check potential where police and fire would be put in a position where in some cases in towns in my district that oppose this bill, there are five people. With a card check, those people are going to be subject to everybody in town watching who they are, and there's no guarantee if three are pressured into signing that there will be a private ballot. 
   This amendment, and I understand that there are flaws with this amendment and hopefully we could work this out, but this amendment is basically a card check amendment given the fact that not only do we have one bill moving through, but we also had a bill move through last night on suspension that would in effect potentially have police and firemen unionize across the United States in areas where they previously hadn't been and a bill that I supported and believe in the right to association but I also believe there should be a private ballot associated with that right to association.  
   Madam Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, this is a truly historic debate on the difference of philosophy of government. We agree on much of what's in this bill. In fact, my friend from Texas, Congressman Ron Paul, is a purist, capitalist, libertarian, but in fact, we've always had a blended government. 
   And the question is, whether it's through tax incentives, direct spending or loans, we've had a blended economy from the days of building canals and from our beginning; the question is, which way are we going to tilt? Is it going to be a capitalist tilt, or is the tilt going to be government running this? 
   I believe, and I understand that likely today I'm going to lose, I'm going to be on the losing side, but I want to go on record pointing out how in fact extreme this bill is. 
   There is a section, a provision of this bill, however well-intentioned, that reverses the normal role of trying to balance what you purchase with your ability to repay. It's an income-based section 133 open-ended entitlement benefit, regardless of profession, that allows them to cap the maximum loan payment each year at 150 percent of discretionary income and have the remainder of the loan forgiven after 20 years. 
   Under the bill, this means a typical entry-level Hill staffer earning $25,000 a year would never be forced to pay more than $120 a month on their student loans. This would no doubt be popular to our staff, but the American taxpayer I don't believe would approve of this. 
   An income-based repayment program would eliminate once and for all any need for students to weigh their choice of college or university against which type of career they plan to enter after the degree. It's a disconnect with capitalism because you don't have to say, if I get this number of degrees and go this far, how is my job going to repay this? Should I go to a local campus?  Should I go to a lower priced college? It's disconnected now based from your choice of employment. 
   While the government surely has a role in increasing access to education, this program would totally strip any incoming college student from making a responsible choice. It's kind-hearted but reckless. 
   One final example to strengthen the point. Say someone leaves school with an advanced degree and $120,000 of loan debt and takes a job making a steady $65,000 a year. He or she, if they selected to become part of this program, making $65,000 a year and made only minimum monthly payments, using the current 6.8 percent interest rate, the required monthly payment under the program would not even cover the interest on the loan, so that, 20 years later, they would have their $150,000 forgiven, even though they had been making $65,000 a year. That's because the median income in the United States is only $46,000. 
   I believe that we should work with low-income students through Pell Grants, and I support many parts of this bill in targeting, but when you disconnect the economic decisions that you make on your graduate degrees, on what profession and what college, it is State-controlled, economic controlled, not capitalism.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START FOR SCHOOL READINESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - November 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank our distinguished ranking member. 
   I am very supportive of this bill, but I want to share some vague uncomfortability with what I think is potentially happening here in Head Start, and I think it's very important to clarify for this administration and for future administrations what this bill is intended to do and not intended to do. 
   From the time the Republicans took over in Congress, I remember then Subcommittee Chairman Frank Riggs had a number of hearings talking about the lack of an academic focus to Head Start. There was a big debate about what the original role was, but it was supposed to certainly prepare kids who didn't have the same opportunities for their ability to be prepared when they started school. 
   But there's a reason that Head Start, while it was in the old Department of HEW, didn't move with the Department of Education and stayed with HHS. If it was intended to be merely another education program run by educational bureaucrats, run the same way that every other education program was run, it would be over in the Department of Education. It wouldn't have been a grassroots Head Start program with parent councils that voted and participated and ran it. It would have been part of a pre-K program or a kindergarten program run by the public schools. Increasingly, we see this pressure where the public schools are trying to take over the Head Start program. 
   The original origins of the Head Start movement came out of the sixties. Saul Alinsky was an organizer in Chicago. The populist movement and the community action organizations led to a wave of saying, we need programs where local low-income groups are empowered to make their own decisions. What this meant many times was it didn't exactly meet the professional goals or standards of where the public schools thought it should be, necessarily where the professionals in Washington thought it should be, but they were engaged at the community level, participating in a way that we have tried to reach in kindergarten and public schools forever. We can't get  low-income parents engaged. It's one of the biggest challenges we have. Yet in the Head Start program, they were engaged all over the country, whether it was rural low income, urban low income. And then when you talk to those parents, you say, What's it like when you go to school? Well, they don't really want us at the public school. There they want us to do fundraisers or they want us to come to back-to-school night. But participating in the governance, participating in the organizations was different. 
   Now, we had wide support in this body, 91 Members, including Mr. Davis and Congresswomen Loretta Sanchez and Maxine Waters, myself and Ric Keller and many conservatives on the right, who share the concept of empowerment. None of us want malfeasance in office or funding problems, people who aren't accounting. All of us would like to see more professional development. All of us would like to see quantified goals. But in this drift towards trying to use the word ``professional'' all the time, we need to make sure that that doesn't lead to an exclusionary concept that basically says, okay, now really the white middle class is going to take over and run this program like we would like it run. 
   The fact is when you get groups of parents and give them votes, they're going to make some judgment mistakes. We need to have accountability. I am for accountability. We need to have measurement. We need to empower those people. But this can't be a typical takeover project, because I believe that the major reason Head Start has, in fact, worked in communities across the country is it's engaged with the people at the grassroots level. And sometimes when we use some of the language here, what we really mean is we're going to take it away from these people because they're not quite as skilled and that we don't quite trust their judgments as much. 
   Now, I appreciate that there was a strong compromise to the side of parents in the conference committee, that, in fact, the language keeping the voting powers to the parents is still there. And it still says that in any major decision, they get a vote. It still says that when there is a conflict with the other people who are governing this, it has to be resolved. There was an additional clause added that seemed to potentially demean the parent councils, where it says ``meaningful consultation and collaboration.'' Now, that was originally going to replace the vote just like we saw in HIDTAs, the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, where we tried to have the Federal Government, initially in the proposal of the Bush administration, take voting power away from sheriffs and local police chiefs and use the same words ``meaningful consultation and collaboration.'' That is usually a code word for we're going to pat you on the head and invite you to an occasional meeting but not put you in the decision power. 
   What's great about this bill is we left the voting power there and no future administration or this one should mistake that the parents still have the voting power. Any meaningful decision, they have a right to have a vote, and there has to be a resolution with the policy councils. This additional language that was Senate language is supplemental and did not alter the policy council. Of course, parent councils should be a meaningful consultation and collaboration, not just as a ``term'' but real meaningful consultation. They should also have the vote. 
   I want to thank the leadership on the Democratic side and the Republican side in the House and Senate in leaving the real vote to parents. It was a huge victory, a grassroots, bipartisan, liberal-conservative victory that should stand and hopefully will not be undone by administrative interpretation.

   Mr. SOUDER. I thank Mr. Smith for his leadership on this motion to recommit and his long-standing leadership in the Judiciary Committee, and for including the Personal Protection Act in our motion to recommit. 
   This has been passed by the House in two different forms, in the appropriations bill and as a free-standing bill. It is the first clear gun control vote, and possibly the only one we will have this year. It is a matter of whether you believe the District of Columbia should have the second amendment. 
   We can dispute what the Constitution says in other areas, but clearly the Constitution says that people have the right to own and bear arms for self-protection. This legislation has been upheld now, in terms of homes, by the D.C. District Court, but it is only a district court ruling. This would codify it, make it clear that there are not second-class citizens on this second amendment. 
   D.C., while it has had a decline in the homicide rate, it is less than the rest of the country, it has led the country repeatedly. It is five times the national average in murders, in spite of having the most stringent gun control law that restricts the right to bear arms. Up until the D.C. court ruling, for a gun in your home you had to have it locked, disassembled, with a key in another location, without the bullets in it. And when a criminal came into your house, you would have to go find the key for the cabinet, put your gun together, go find a bullet to protect yourself. This needs to be codified by Congress that we passed multiple times. 
   The majority of Members of Congress are sponsors of this bill, and we need to make sure that the District of Columbia residents have this protection. There are many charges made, false charges, machine guns, all this type of stuff. This is the same right that people throughout America have that has been constitutionally upheld, and if we can pass this law, we will once again make the citizens of the District of Columbia have the same second amendment rights as the rest of America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentleman. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to the taking of human life. The question that is before the House is whether or not the Federal Government should force taxpayers to fund a procedure that requires the destruction of innocent human life. 
   Congress has always refused to allow this on the issue of abortion, only allowing Federal funding if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or is because of rape or incest. There is no reason why this same principle should not apply here. Even President Clinton's bioethics council, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, wrote in 1999 that most would agree that human embryos deserve respect as a form of human life. 
   Is it showing respect to kill embryos for research? To allow the seeds of the next generation to be used for the doubtful sake of our own? Furthermore, does it show respect to the consciences of Americans who oppose the research to provide public funding for it? 
   President Clinton's bioethics council also wrote that the derivation of stem cells from embryos remaining following infertility treatments, the killing of embryos that H.R. 3 would encourage, is justifiable only if no less morally problematic alternatives are available for advancing the research. 
   Regrettably, the supporters of this bill seem to have forgotten that advice, and their continued support for embryonic stem cell research seems to display ignorance at the recent developments of stem cell science. Far less morally problematic alternatives are exactly what scientists are continuing to find. We have heard this referred to several times. 
   This was the front page of the Fort Wayne News Sentinel just last weekend: ``Stem cell find gives new hope to compromise.'' In this, in addition to the hearing that we had last year, where we heard multiple scientists receive testify of promising advances in non-embryonic stem cell research, what he points out here is ``the fetus is swallowing fluid and breathing in through the nose. Not only does it travel through the respiratory tract, it gets into the gastrointestinal tract, the bladder and the kidney. The stuff is chock full of fetal cells.'' 
   They are no longer combined but are separated, and that is why the research is working, and that is why so many scientists don't even believe embryonic stem cells will ever work. 
   There are two fundamental questions here: What is the science, and, in this case, we have proven research that is working and additional research that shows incredible promise of working; versus embryonic stem cell going on for 25 years, not 8 years, that is, in humans, 25 years with nothing. Not a single animal. Nothing has worked in embryonic stem cell research. Yet we are underfunding the research that actually works. Why? 
   I would argue the second point, and that is it is political. It has to do with the fundamental question of abortion. We have deep differences in America and in here on the taking of innocent human life at conception, deep differences and honest differences. 
   But why should I, with my view, be forced, and the many Americans who believe this is the taking of innocent life and killing and murder for that matter, why should we be forced to pay for it? I just do not understand the intensity of trying to drive this down our throats.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the taking of human life. 
   Mr. Speaker, the question that is today before the House is whether or not the Federal Government should force taxpayers to fund a procedure that requires the destruction of innocent human life. Congress has always proudly refused to allow this on the issue of abortion, only allowing federal funding if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or is due to rape or incest. There is no reason why the same principle should not apply here. 
   Even President Clinton's bioethics council, the National Bioethics Advisory Commission) wrote in 1999 that ``[M]ost would agree that human embryos preserve respect as a form of human life.'' Mr. Speaker, is it showing respect to kill such embryos for research--to allow the seeds of the next generation to be used for the sake of our own? Furthermore, does it show respect to the consciences of Americans who oppose this research to provide public funding for it? 
   President Clinton's bioethics council also wrote that, ``the derivation of stem cells from embryos remaining following infertility treatments''--the killing of embryos that H.R. 3 would encourage--``is justifiable only if no less morally problematic alternatives are available for advancing the research.'' Regrettably, supporters of H.R. 3 seem to have forgotten this 
   advice, and in their continued support for embryonic stem cell research seems to display ignorance at the recent developments of stem cell science, for less morally problematic alternatives are exactly what scientists are continuing to find. 
   Mr. Speaker, as scientists have worked to find useful therapies using embryonic stem cells, such research has encountered only problems. Such stem cells have shown to be too unstable and likely to form tumors when transplanted into adult tissues. Indeed, despite more than 80 research projects investigating human embryonic stem cells funded by the National Institutes of Health since 2002, to date there have been no verifiable reports of any human clinical trials being conducted using embryonic, not adult, stem cells--in the U.S. or anywhere else.  
   Despite these facts, the sponsor of H.R. 3 has stated publicly that embryonic stem cell research could help cure diseases that affect 110 million Americans. Unfortunately, scientists have been complicit in this deceit. For example, to justify this hype, stem cell researcher Ron McKay has said bluntly that people need a fairy tale. 
   Meanwhile, adult stem cell research continues to show increasing promise. There are currently 72 therapies showing human benefits using adult stem cells. In fact, it seems our whole scientific paradigm of cellular development has been wrong. It now appears that stem cells do not lose their pluripotency as they develop from the embryo to differentiated tissue types, and that adult stem cells are much more elastic than previously thought. This means that embryos are no longer the unique source of 
   pluripotent stem cells we once thought they were. Pluripotency is the real goal; and if that can be found in adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells and the destruction of human life are no longer necessary. 
   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I ask my opponents to consider that they do not need to believe a human embryo is the moral equivalent of a child in order to oppose this bill. Rather, they need merely to consider the drastic step it would be to provide public sanction--through federal funding--for life-destructive research that has, at best, ambiguous potential; when more promising and more ethical alternatives are available. Most importantly, Mr. Speaker, this bill and this research are morally wrong, but also, they are simply unnecessary. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes. 
   Ever since we created the Department of Homeland Security, we have had a problem of what to do with our air assets. 
   This amendment would hold $100 million from the Customs and Border Protection, CBP, Air and Marine interdiction, operations, maintenance, and procurement account until a report is received detailing the number of requests CBP receives from the use of assets and the number of those requests that are denied. 
   One of the problems we had when we, in effect, set up ICE and CBP was to to do with the division called Air and Marine. Air and Marine Division did not stay parked right along the border. The Air and Marine Division has assets down in Colombia. They have assets in the Caribbean, assets in the Eastern Pacific, assets at various points, because the whole point of the Air and Marine Division was both with boats and air to be able to follow in particular drug traffickers, other traffickers of contraband in high value or mass targets in the sense of illegal immigration or of terrorism. 
   But when we put the air assets underneath CBP and they put them under Border Patrol, the nature of what we were doing with our Air and Marine assets have fundamentally changed. 
   As the now ranking member of the Border Subcommittee and a member of the Homeland Security Committee since its creation, I have spent a lot of time on this issue, as well as being head of Speaker Hastert's drug task force. I have spent my entire career working on narcotics issues. This has been a huge issue. In particular, one of our problems right now is that many, if not all, of the critical assets are now more or less chained to the border; that one of the P-3s, which are critical for long-range surveillance, right now, because of their usage, and it hasn't been made a priority because the maintenance is going to the helicopters along the border, all 16, and let me repeat, all 16 air assets that are supposed to be used in counternarcotics are now down for serious maintenance, leaving the counterdrug mission severely impacted. And if we can't work out to some degree over in the Florida and the Gulf of Mexico range, they fixed this short term by having legacy Air and Marine or Customs pilots be the regional Border Patrol people and managing their assets. But along the border, we don't have that luxury. 
   We have been trying in the authorizing committee for some time to get a report from the agency, and I have spent hours with the relevant people in my office, as well as questioning at hearings, trying to get the data of how exactly they are using these assets. What are they denying? ICE can't get the assets to do the big-risk things. This has been one of the historic conflicts between these agencies. 
   I support a picket fence. We need to have a border fence. But you also have to have the ability to go behind and forward and track and take down systems. And Air and Marine is a critical part of this, and we need this report. And I hope that if we can't work this out tonight, that it can be worked out in conference committee, because this must be resolved. 
   May I inquire of the chairman of the subcommittee for a brief, informal colloquy here, would you be willing to continue to work with me on this subject and with the Department of Homeland Security, because it is very critical to how we are going to do counternarcotics and high-risk terrorism and how CBP is going to work with ICE in resolving the Air and Marine issue?

   Mr. SOUDER. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman, and with that assurance, I am not really anxious to hold up any money in this bill either. But I would like them to be accountable to Congress because they have not resolved how they are going to move and deal with Air and Marine assets related to ICE and investigations. They sometimes have even sent helicopters where we needed a P-3. This just isn't functioning, and narcotics terrorism is ripping up this country. We have 20,000 to 30,000 deaths a year. And if we have loads of cocaine coming in, loads of heroin coming into our society, because we have got all our planes lined up on the border and our P-3s down, it will not function. And with your assurance that you will continue to work with this, watch this, and we continue to talk about it between the authorizing and the appropriators, I will be happy to withdraw my amendment tonight.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. Chairman, this amendment in effect transfers money from the alteration of bridges account, $8 million, and $21.5 million allocated from the operating expenses allocated to airborne use of force account, and moves it over to buy a Coast Guard maritime patrol aircraft. 
   The challenge here in Deepwater, which has had admitted problems, but which is one of the most important long-term programs of the Coast Guard for reaching out into beyond just harbor patrol to be able to protect our  country, whether it be illegal contraband, such as narcotics or anthrax or whatever, or high risk terrorists, is that we don't have enough assets that are operating and functional, and part of this is aircraft. 
   The MH-68, the HITRON, leases have expired, and we have moved to the M-65s, which are replacing them in the field. The Coast Guard then requested four more, to bring it up to 12, of assets that go out with the Deepwater Program. This bill already cuts Deepwater $197 million. This is the only Coast Guard plus-up that we would have related to Deepwater. They deeply need these air assets. 
   Now, one of the challenges here is, what is this $8 million alteration of bridges account? The Coast Guard in the report language here, it suggests that the Coast Guard has asked and said we don't have people who maintain bridges and we don't want to do this. The committee is ordering the Coast Guard to do the bridges, rather than the Department of Transportation. 
   We also have a question of what is this $21.5 million, and it looks like it is for an MH-68 that the Coast Guard didn't want in a lease that expired. 
   A former Homeland Security Department official now works for a lobbying firm who has been lobbying the Hill to continue this lease, in spite of the fact that the Coast Guard doesn't want the lease. We have been unable to identify which Members have actually been advocating renewing the lease that the Coast Guard doesn't want for a helicopter we don't need, and they cut the committee request from four to two for a helicopter the Coast Guard desperately needs and wants. This would put that back in. 
   While it is not absolutely clear whether this is a closet earmark, it hasn't exactly been coming forward on the helicopter part or the designation in this bill, which actually doesn't designate the $21.5 million. It asks the Coast Guard to submit a plan. But the lobbyist has been all over the Hill today and recently saying this is for the MH-68 helicopter we don't want. 
   My amendment merely says, let's help Deepwater. Let's give them the helicopter they need and want, rather than giving them money they don't want for something they don't do that the Department of Transportation does in bridges and for a helicopter they don't want with an expired lease.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I believe that what the chairman was referring to was a general account of the things that I referred to which were inside the general account. I am not trying to cut funding for personnel. There is $8 million in the bill for alteration of bridges. The report language says the committee denies the request to transfer personnel devoted to maintaining safe passage of marine traffic. That means that the Coast Guard had requested to the committee that they didn't want these funds. The reason they don't want the funds is they don't have personnel that does bridges. They said this should be, according to your report language, within the Department of Transportation's Maritime Division to do bridges. 
   I don't know what kind of fight is occurring between Transportation and Coast Guard here, but basically the Coast Guard wants the money to do their mission, not to do bridges, and this amendment tries to address this. 
   Then also in the airborne use of force, there is a discussion about the $21.5 million, which just happens to be the amount that the lobbying firm is seeking to continue the MH-68 HITRON helicopter, which is a great helicopter, I have been in it, but it is not armed. It is outdated and they are moving to the M-65s. They have the M-65s on line or in production, the ones that you said that are off-the-shelf helicopters that they are now adapting, of which they had eight and they wanted four more and you gave them two more.     
   The money for the account that they don't want and don't have people to do and the 21.5 for a contract they don't want would buy the additional helicopter that they do want that's off the shelf and merely would need to be added to. 
   I would ask the chairman respectfully, can you identify who is requesting this, because we haven't been able to figure out who's pushing this MH-68 contract of which the amount of money is the exact amount of money. And the lobbyist is all over the Hill saying that that's what this is for.

   Mr. SOUDER. I agree with that. My question then would be, given what we've been hearing and we have been suggested and it is all over that this amount just happens to be the amount that was proposed for the lease and that it's intended for a lease. 
   Will the chairman assure me that in fact the Coast Guard is submitting an independent request to you for 21.5 and it's not intended to buy an MH-68?

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - September 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, there are a number of points I want to talk about tonight on energy. But first I want to say that sometimes people get the feeling that we Republicans refer to alternative energy as something that's kind of window dressing because all we want to do is drill. 
   I have been working with alternative energy issues for over a decade here in Congress. In my district we now have the largest integrated soy diesel plant in the world that Dreyfus has put near Claypool just outside of Warsaw, Indiana. I recently gave an award that I have, a Johnny Appleseed award, who's actually a real person buried in Ft. Wayne, to a local company, Sweetwater Music, which is the greatest online music company in the United States and in the world because it looks like they are going to be certified as the first gold business building in the State of Indiana, at full green standards, first gold higher than platinum. And they're doing it and they did it in a way and the reason I wanted to highlight them is they can pay for the cost of their building with what they've saved in energy. I mean it pays for itself. A green building does not have to be a drawback. 
   At the same time, Merry Lea Environmental Learning Center done by Goshen College also has a platinum standard building. I believe that the wind power is a real alternative. Parker-Hannifin in New Haven, Indiana, I have an earmark set aside to help them with their project. They do coolant systems, and they believe they can get 20 to 40 percent more energy out of each wind turbine by changing the coolant standards. I have worked with solar energy in my district. Water Furnace, a company just highlighted in the New York Times in the last week, by recycling water for heating and cooling, can save an untold number of power plants in the United States if we do that. Nevertheless, representing the number one manufacturing district in the United States. 
   Let me just say this: We need coal, nuclear, and drilling as well as all these alternative energies. I have the largest pickup plant in the world that does the Silverado and the Sierra. You aren't going to power this if we don't have enough oil and gas. I have two huge SDI steel plants that take more energy to make the steel than cities of probably 75,000 to 100,000, possibly even double that, to 200,000, and everything in those cities to power those steel plants. Five new core facilities. Valbruna Steel. We aren't going to do this with a windmill standing up. Those are supplemental power systems. 
   But if we're not going to have every company moving to China, we have to have more energy in this country. The motor homes are not going to be powered by a little solar panel. And they're getting hammered right now, and 58 percent are in my district. The international trucks are not going to be  powered by alternative energy. We need basic energy. 
   And I want to talk specifically tonight about one. We hear about shale oil. This is what it looks like: layers of rock, and then there is a layer that has hydrocarbons that are packed in much like other oil that are in a solid piece like this. This basically is the equivalent of a gold nugget in the gold area because you can see here it is a piece of basically oil that by heating technology, this turns into high grade oil. We have 800 billion barrels of this. We pump right now in the United States 20 million. We have 800 billion in just the west Colorado, southwest Wyoming, and Utah basin. This is not the Rocky Mountains. It's not by the Grand Tetons. It's not by the Rocky Mountain National Park. It's in the big basin in between the mountains because that's where you have the foliage and things that are packed together to do this. 
   Now, you can do it in open-pit mining like tar sands, and that's what you see a lot in the news. But the Mahogany Research Project that Shell Oil has, and you can find it on the Internet because they have now gone public for a reason I will mention in a minute, and Chevron have ways to do this in the ground so you don't have open-pit mining. They've already extracted enough in their pilot projects that we were able to use it in our planes. We don't need oil at $120. Obviously at $40 it isn't profitable. But in between there we have a lot of room to work to get this out of the ground. 
   The reason they have gone public, because they were nearing the point of a larger scale project, the House of Representatives and the Senate banned shale oil drilling. The project has stopped cold. They have laid off the engineers. Chevron and Shell have had to stop. One project has gone ahead on the open-pit mining. But the new stories in Colorado--this is a huge debate right now. Just about a month ago I went out. They have now opened it so Members of Congress can see it because they were trying to keep this technology from each other and the different companies, but basically Shell and Chevron have gone public with this technology because they were about to make it public. But we banned it, 800 billion barrels in the United States that does not have open-pit mining, that in the one experimental that they did already, they have already done the recovery of. It's intense when they do it, but down in the ground, they basically freeze the area around it, as you can see in the Mahogany Project, and get it out. 
   If we're going to keep industry in America, we have to come up with American energy strategies. Do everything, including shale oil.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1429, IMPROVING HEAD START ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - May 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, but in opposition to this rule. 
   I would first like to talk a little bit about some of the unique history of Head Start that I think is important as we move into the discussions of the amendments and the bill itself. 
   Head Start is a moderately successful program. Because it's a moderately successful program, often it's oversold. It's only moderately successful, but it's very difficult to get any program to succeed in the highest-risk populations of America, as we learned in No Child Left Behind and other programs trying to reach those who have been left behind by the economic growth of America, by the opportunities in America, in the low-income urban communities and the low-income suburban communities. 
   To have modest success is actually a tremendous accomplishment in Head Start. So how did Head Start perform differently, and what was the concept behind it that made it unique? 
   On the left and on the right, there would be, for lack of a better word, a populist empowerment faction in both parties. In the sixties, the community action movement said we need to stop the top-down approach and do a more bottom-up approach and involve the communities in poverty themselves in making their own decisions. 
   That entails certain risks, because they may not, when you let people vote their own decisions and make their own decisions, do what government exactly wants them to do, or what college-educated Ph.D.s come into that community and think is best for that community. 
   One of the key debates last year when this came to the floor was whether the Head Start policy councils should allow the parents to have a vote. The bill was altered to take that vote away from parents and basically make the parents hood ornaments; say we have parental involvement, but take the breathing lifeblood of those Head Start programs away. 
   I am very pleased that in this Congress, after seeing the probable defeat on the House floor, had it not been blocked by the leaders of both sides, it is now in this year's bill. Parents will continue to have a vote and continue to make this a grassroots program. 
   But there is another part of this bill that I oppose, and there is an amendment made in order under this rule that makes it even worse, and that is to require 50 percent of the teachers to have a college degree. That sounds like a great goal, but if you understand that this is preschool, and part of the goal here was to get the parents involved, unlike what's happening in the elementary schools and the high schools in many of these urban and rural areas, the parents don't get involved. 
   Partly what happens in Head Start councils is parents get involved. Often they get hired as teachers and teachers' aides. They are from the community. There is research suggesting, and no research to the contrary, that the net impact of moving to this 50 percent requirement in 2013 is going to result in less teachers of color in the urban areas. That's the practical net result. 
   Fewer parents will go to literacy courses and evolve then into getting a GED and helping to teach their own kids. You will miss the magic of this program, which is empowerment and getting the parents involved, which is what we should be looking for in elementary schools. There is an amendment to take the 2013 goal down to 2011, I believe. That makes a bad clause worse. I hope that amendment gets defeated on the floor. 
   There is one other amendment in this bill that is a bad amendment. There is nothing wrong with the amendment, it's existing law. It's what I would call a fake faith-based amendment. If an organization follows all the secular rules in hiring and in principles, they have always been, always been, eligible for government grants. The dispute that has arisen in faith-based is not whether, if you have a secular board and don't impose any religious principles on your organization, you can't proselytize. That has already been ruled by the courts. You can't pray if you get government funds during the time that any program is funded by government. You can't refuse to cover somebody. 
   The question is can a faith-based organization that may have church rules, for example, can only males be preachers or priests? Can you have somebody who is homosexual in a church position in your church? Can you fire somebody for adultery, things that many, if not most, major Christian denominations, Orthodox Jews, Muslim organizations have as rules in their denominations? They are not eligible under the Democrat faith-based rule. 
   This is a legitimate debate. I grant that it's a legitimate debate, and we have had it on the House floor. But we should not pretend that we are protecting faith-based organizations, when we are, in fact, taking away the historic civil rights protection that has always been granted under, quote, faith-based. A religion is exempt from  normal rules in how they hire, because they believe they reflect their faith. 
   Mr. Speaker, I ask to include into the Record an article by Ron Sider, who has written a book that was much ballyhooed in the last election cycle about the faith-based movement not just being conservative right-wingers.  
   The Case for ``Discrimination''  
   I'm a long-time Democrat. In 1972, I organized a group called ``Evangelicals for McGovern/Shriver'' and helped McGovern sweep--well, the great state of Massachusetts. 
   As a Democrat, I have been deeply dismayed by how out of touch with the American mainstream the party has proven to be on the issue of faith-based initiatives, particularly on the issue of the so-called hiring exemption. (For a discussion of other aspects of the initiative, see Joseph Loconte, ``Keeping the Faith,'' FT, May.) 
   A vast majority of Americans believe that as a society we have lost our moral moorings and that we must reaffirm the role of religious faith in nurturing persons of integrity and fostering a just, stable society. It is in that context that we must evaluate the Democratic leadership's opposition to allowing faith-based organizations that accept government funds to show preference in hiring to those who embrace the organization's basic religious beliefs and practices. Democratic President Bill Clinton signed three Charitable Choice bills that explicitly included this hiring exemption. Presidential candidate Al Gore embraced Charitable Choice. But when the Bush Administration's legislation expanding Charitable Choice moved to the Senate in mid-2001, the Democratic leadership blocked even the consideration of such legislation--largely on the charge that the hiring exemption amounted to employment discrimination. 
   In other words, the Democratic leadership has come to believe that religious organizations must give up their long-recognized right to hire staff who share their faith commitments in order to receive federal money that provides needed services to the public. In this, the Democrats are wrong. 
   To begin with, a religious organization's decision to hire staff who share its religious beliefs and practices is not an example of intolerant discrimination, but rather a positive act of freedom. In a free society, a wide variety of organizations--environmental organizations, feminist groups, unions--are left free to select staff who share their core commitments and who agree with their agenda. This right does not disappear if governments choose to request these private organizations to perform some desired tasks. Planned Parenthood, for example, does not lose its right not to hire pro-life staff simply because it has a government contract. It is precisely the denial of this right to religious organizations that would amount to intolerant discrimination instead of the promotion of a free and open society. 
   To equate this positive good with the evil of discrimination on the basis of things like race or disability is pure confusion. Whether we think that religion is a medieval superstition or a true and good contributor to social well-being, all who believe in religious freedom should insist that religious organizations be permitted to hire staff who share their religious beliefs. 
   The obvious fact is that the ability to choose staff who share a religious organization's core beliefs is essential if that organization wishes to retain its basic identity. As Justice William Brennan wrote in Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos (1987): ``Determining that certain activities are in furtherance of an organization's religious mission and that only those committed to that mission should conduct them is . . . a means by which a religious community defines itself.'' A Jewish organization forced to hire substantial numbers of Baptist staffers, for example, will not long remain a significantly Jewish organization. 
   Having staff who share a religious organization's essential religious beliefs shapes the group's identity in a variety of ways. Shared motivation, common values, a sense of community and unity of purpose, shared experiences of prayer and worship (even if they are outside work time in the organization) all contribute to an esprit de corps and shared organizational vision. As law professor Ira C. Lupu said in testimony before a House subcommittee (June 7, 2001), ``The sense of religious community and spirit on which [the] success of the group's efforts depend'' may be hampered if it is forced to hire those who do not share its beliefs. 
   This is important even when, for example, a faith-centered organization chooses to separate by location or time (and fund with private money) sectarian worship, instruction, and proselytization in a program in order to receive direct government grants. This is true for several reasons. 
   First of all, religious activities may be important to the social service program, even though they are voluntary, privately funded, and segregated from ``secular'' government-funded activities. In such programs, holding certain religious beliefs and practices is a legitimate qualification for a staff position, equally as valid as having the right skills and experience. 
   Second, enforced religious diversity can have the effect of stifling religious expression of staff within the agency, creating a climate of fear of offending other staff members with religious speech or actions. Since personal faith is very important to many who choose to work in a religious organization, such a climate can diminish staff motivation and effectiveness. Forced religious diversity can sap a program's spiritual vitality and lead to its secularization. 
   Third, staff often play multiple roles in small organizations. For example, an agency might seek someone to work part-time as a youth minister and part-time as a social worker for its youth mentoring program. Implementing a policy in which religion could be considered as a factor in hiring for some job duties but not others would lead to unnecessarily complicated and impermissibly entangling regulations. 
   But even leaving aside the effects of such regulation on religious organizations themselves, the rationale behind it makes little sense. The fact that a religious organization accepts some federal funds does not mean that it ceases to be an independent, autonomous entity and becomes an arm or agent of the state. Law, precedent, and common sense all argue that a private organization that accepts some government funds still retains its separate identity. This is clearly the case with colleges and universities that receive government funding, scholars engaged in federally subsidized research, and artists and artistic organizations funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. All of these receive government funding, and all maintain their autonomy from the government. Similarly, a religious organization that receives government funds to provide a public service that serves a public good would maintain its autonomy and not be co-opted by government. 
   Moreover, not only does allowing hiring preferences based on religious belief within religious organizations pose no social danger, it is the only way to avoid discrimination and governmental preference of one religious view over another. Using the typology of different types of faith-based organizations recently published by the Working Group on Human Needs and Faith-Based and Community Initiatives chaired by former Democratic Senator Harris Wofford helps explain this point. 
   ``Faith-saturated'' and ``faith-centered'' programs both include substantial religious content in their programs and hire (primarily or exclusively) employees who share their beliefs precisely because their religious beliefs tell them that persons are spiritual as well as material beings and therefore the best results follow when spiritual and material transformation are combined. ``Faith-related,'' ``faith-background,'' and ``secular'' providers do not include significant religious content in their program or consider religious belief in their staffing because their worldview tells them that all that is needed to correct dysfunctional social behavior and social problems is socio-economic, material transformation. All these providers, not just the first two, are grounded in an explicit or implicit religious perspective. Secular providers work at least implicitly within a naturalistic worldview (nothing exists except the natural world) that functions in effect as a religious perspective. Functionally, faith-related and faith-background providers operate with deistic religious beliefs (God exists but never intervenes in the natural world of cause and effect). Naturalism and deism, however, are just as much particular religious worldviews as the historic theism that undergirds most faith-saturated and faith-centered programs. 
   Obviously, if government only funds some private providers of services (i.e., the naturalistic and deistic ones that do not explicitly use religious criteria for staff), government clearly discriminates among religions. 
   Thus far, I have argued that as a matter of principle religious freedom is such a fundamental right that it ought to prevail even if on occasion embracing that overriding principle has the secondary effect of, for example, reducing the number of job opportunities for a particular group. For example, the Catholic Church must, as a matter of principle, be free to live out its religious belief (which I do not share) that only men should be priests, even if the practice has the effect of reducing the number of job possibilities for women. 
   My last point offers an argument, not about principle, but about practical effect. The recent suggestion that extending the hiring exemption to faith-based organizations (FBOs) would in practice mean that African-Americans or gay Americans would suffer a loss of job opportunities is simply wrong. 
   There is a certain tension between two treasured values: on the one hand, protecting the religious freedom and identity of FBOs as they expand their effective services to the most needy; on the other, our society's conviction that except in the case of a narrow range of specific situations, employers should not discriminate on the basis of religion. 
   But do such hiring preferences really result in job deprivation? Hardly at all. 
   First, we are talking about a small percentage of the total jobs in the society. Second, many FBOs pay almost no attention to the religious beliefs of staff. Third, in the case of those evangelical Christian, Orthodox Jewish, and Muslim FBOs that do, virtually all the different religious groups have their own FBOs offering a hiring preference to people who share their own beliefs. 
   For very understandable historical reasons, African-Americans have been concerned that racial discrimination might find  cover under the hiring exemption based on religious belief. This is extremely unlikely to happen. FBOs working in minority communities are run either by people of the same racial group or by whites who have been at the forefront of fighting racial prejudice. 
   What about sexual orientation? Few FBOs ask about or select staff on the basis of sexual orientation. It is true that a number of FBOs do say that staff should not be sexually active outside marriage. But is that really so terrible--especially for FBOs working to overcome poverty in a society where a child growing up in a single-parent household is eleven times more likely to be persistently poor than a child growing up in a two-parent family? 
   Even if the hiring exemption in Charitable Choice were expanded to a lot more government funding streams, sexually (and openly) active gay Americans would face extremely little job deprivation. The number in that group is very small and the number of jobs affected is a minuscule fraction of the total number of jobs. Gay FBOs exist and others can be formed that give a hiring preference to those who share that ethical/religious belief. Surely the well-educated gay community does not want to block an enormously promising way to overcome poverty and social decay for millions of desperate Americans to avoid what in practice would at worst mean only the loss of a handful of possible jobs. 
   Constitutionally, Charitable Choice strikes the right balance between the no-establishment and free exercise clauses of the First Amendment. Morally, it offers promise for major progress in overcoming some of our most intractable social problems. Politically, Charitable Choice and the broader Faith-Based Initiatives have rightly become identified with the widespread sense that we have lost our way morally as a society. By remaining steadfastly opposed to allowing religious organizations to contribute to solving social problems, the Democrats harm our country as well as their future electoral prospects. Only at great peril dare Democrats be on the wrong side of today's widespread embrace of religious faith's crucial contribution to social wholeness. If that happens, they will deserve a repetition of 1972.  
   The fact is whether you are left or right in the faith-based movement, you have to agree that you have to keep the principles of religion if you are going to keep your spiritual vitality. Particularly in urban America and in rural America, the churches and the vitality is what needs to be brought into poverty and reaching out. 
   We can have a legitimate debate over whether government funds should go in there. I believe it would help the programs. It has been an historic right. But the amendment that is in front of us is not a faith-based amendment. It's only allowing faith-based groups to participate if they secularize and drop their unique faith. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would like to insert into the Record a statement on the policy councils from Congressman DANNY DAVIS and me.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, I thank our leader from the Homeland Security Committee for yielding. 
   No congressional decision is more difficult than a vote related to war, and this vote is no different. It is especially difficult when you disagree with the President of your own political party. 
   I voted to support this war because I believe Iraq presented a direct threat to the United States. Iraq had, was developing, and was attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction.     
   Iraq was, at a minimum, cooperating with the funding and harboring of terrorists committed to our destruction. Saddam Hussein was repeatedly defying U.N. resolutions, contesting no-fly zones and blocking WMD inspectors. Our intelligence estimates, never 100 percent accurate, in any case, apparently overstated the immediate risk. 
   But the basic facts remain the same. Knowing what we know now, perhaps we could have waited another 6 to 12 months, which would have given us valuable time to solidify position in Afghanistan. But the decision to go to war was still the right decision, just possibly premature. 
   I would not have supported this war had the initial selling point been a goal of establishing democracy in Iraq. Advancing freedom has always been an ideological goal of our Nation ever since our founding. We have long supported, from the days of Jefferson and Monroe, the causes of dissident freedom fighters. We did this in occupied Eastern Europe, in Saddam's Iraq and Soviet-occupied Afghanistan. 
   But there is a difference between aiding people fighting for freedom and doing most of the fighting for them. I stated from the beginning that after removing the direct threat of the Saddam government, it would be in our national security interests if a republican form of government, a unity government respecting the rights of others, could be established in Iraq. If this government of diverse Iraqis could prevail,  it would be a model for the entire region. We needed to give them a chance for self-governance. But, and this is a big qualifier, it would ultimately be their decision, not ours. 
   On the news we often see Iraqis saying that Americans need to do this or that to provide security. Men and women from Fort Wayne and the rest of Indiana and America can do most of the fighting for the freedom of Iraq only for so long. It is the Iraqis' country. 
   We should have known this would not be easy. It is self-evident that democracy in the Muslim world is not common now nor in the past. A little bit hubris and more humility when we sent our soldiers into this conflict would have been helpful. This is not just hindsight. For example, the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana, Senator RICHARD LUGAR, raised concerns over and over again that pre-planning was insufficient. 
   Certain basic arguments being made by the administration are simply not accurate. To insist that the war in Iraq is not a civil war when the entire world and the Americans all understand that it is, continues to undermine the credibility of those who make it. 
   From the beginning, it had elements of a civil war. The Sunnis had persecuted the majority Shia as well as the Kurds. Vengeance was inevitable. The United States correctly demanded that the sectarian militias be eliminated from the Iraqi national police and the military. I, like many other Members, was asked by the administration to deliver such messages to Iraqi government officials during my visits to Iraq. 
   Our government knew full well that a civil war was going on, even among people we selected to run the government. We had hoped that the early smaller scale civil war could be countered by a strong central government. It is now a large scale civil war, eroding the already limited power of the Iraqi Government. It is now absurd to deny it is a civil war. 
   Making exaggerated statements of progress in Iraq also does not pass the basic credibility test. While we have made sporadic progress, a school or a project here and there, it is apparent to any Member of Congress who visited Iraq a number of years ago and again recently visited that security has deteriorated. 
   Baby boomer Americans especially tend to see everything as Vietnam. A government that denies basic realities has little hope of persuading even its friends. We want our government to tell the truth, pleasant or not. These facts are foundational to the fundamental question currently before us. 
   It is not whether a surge can root out terrorists. Our brave men and women can do this in door-to-door bloody combat, if necessary, and we may be able with extra troops to stabilize some areas temporarily. But then what? The President has also said that unlike past efforts, this time we will hold our gains. With whom? With what? 
   This is the basic underlying issue. Assuming some militias are defeated and others just melt away, how do we plan to keep them from coming back? Is the surge permanent? Even if it were so, far fewer troops are required to root out terrorists than to hold gains. Will we need tens of thousands of additional soldiers to hold any gains? 
   The obvious premise offered by the President is that the Iraqis themselves can hold the gains. Based upon everything we have seen to date, other than in isolated cases, there is no evidence that the Iraqis will fight and die to defend their central government. I have repeatedly heard from returning soldiers that when the gunfire starts the Iraqis by and large disappear. They only seem dedicated when Shia get to kill Sunnis and vice versa. 
   By being bogged down as the main security force in Iraq and increasingly hostile cities, we are undermining our long-term potential to fight the war on terror. 
   For years, we have now been utilizing our National Guard and our Reserves as if they were regular military. Many are about to enter their second 12-month-plus tour of duty in combat, something historically many regular military veterans did not do. Because of the heavy usage, we are starting to short training funds and repair funds for those units. We are finding that employers are getting increasingly nervous about disruptions to their firms. Family objections are becoming more intense. Recruiters are running into increasing resistance. 
   As for our overused regular military, they are facing near exhaustion. What will be the long-term impact on these forces? What impact will this continued burning up of huge sums of military dollars do to our long-term ability to fight? 
   It has been said many times by defenders of this surge that Iraq is the place the enemy has chosen to fight, and this is the place that we must fight. That is partly true. Hezbollah has chosen to fight us on many fronts. Iran is a threat itself, not just in funding Iraq. Terrorists attacked in Madrid, London, Afghanistan, Pakistan and many other places throughout the world, and they continue to try to attack us in the United States. Iraq is not the only place terrorists have chosen to fight. 
   Furthermore, we face threats from North Korea, as the new Castro, Hugo Chavez, presents other challenges. We are sobered by the recent destruction of a satellite by China, potentially the most significant threat we face. 
   If we burn up the support of the American people, our military's ability to recruit, the usage of our Guard and Reserves in Iraq, how do we defend ourselves elsewhere? 
   It is not that this effort in Iraq is a failure, as some liberals claim. We have seen the governments in Libya and Pakistan significantly alter their ways when it comes to supporting terrorists. Hostile governments that harbor terrorists have to ask themselves whether it is worth the risk of military action by the United States, something Iran appears to be debating. And, most importantly, this fact is indisputable: Since 9/11, terrorists have not succeeded in any attacks on American soil. 
   Because of the bravery and valor of our soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq, we have disrupted the terrorists' ability to gather and plan new methods of attacking us. If they surface, we get them. 
   During this period, we have had time to make significant progress in homeland security. While you may have heard that our Southwest border is not exactly airtight, progress certainly has been made. Every month we make additional progress. Our airports are more secure. Our ports are more secure. The PATRIOT Act has given us the ability to track and hunt down terrorists. We have improved both inside the U.S. and around the world our ability to track finances, communications and movement of terrorists. 
   The sacrifice of our brave men and women in the military and their families bought the United States Government valuable time to further prepare our domestic and worldwide ability to cope with terrorism. We will never achieve 100 percent success. But the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq took the battle to them, rather than requiring us to fight at home. 
   But we cannot sustain this intense effort indefinitely. Complete victory over terrorism is unlikely ever to occur. Sometimes you have to reposition and prepare for the broader battle, not exhaust yourself on just one front and then risk defeat in the overall conflict. 
   I beseech our President, Secretary Gates, Secretary Rice and others, never to give up the war on terrorism, but to understand that without significant tactical drawdowns in Iraq our entire counterterrorism and military efforts are threatened. Our Nation can ill afford another decade of defeatism and retreat that seized the United States after Vietnam. 
   All this said, I am going to vote ``no'' on the resolution. The resolution is no surge protection. The battle has already begun. Most of us have individually clearly stated our views and continue to do so. 
   For the United States Congress as a corporate body to deliver a public rebuke to the Commander in Chief during a battle that is already commenced would potentially put our soldiers at additional risk and confuse the world. 
   It is one thing for us to argue about strategy and tactics. It is another to have Congress openly defy the President. The world already knows we have deep divisions in America. The terrorists already know we disagree. But they also need to know that when the  fight starts, as Americans we stand united. 
   The fact is while I do not believe that the surge will succeed, none of us actually knows that it will not work. At this point it seems to me that our position as a Congress should be to encourage success in this mission. We need to support the Iraqis as they take increasing responsibility. What the world should see from us at least is shared hope for victory, not defeatism. 
   But the President does need to understand that opposition to the surge is not just among Democrats. It is even among his strongest supporters. Some of us who deeply share his passion to fight terrorism fear that he is potentially endangering his past successes, as well as our Nation's ability to continue the war on terror beyond this administration. 
   I hope and pray that the surge succeeds. But if it does not, we need to try a dramatically different approach that does not totally abandon Iraq, the region or the war on terror.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I, MARK SOUDER, am submitting the following information for publication in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 6599--The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs FY09 Appropriations bill. 
   Included in H.R. 6599 is a $5,600,000 earmark that I submitted for the construction of Aircraft Ready Shelters and Fuel Fill Stands for the 122nd Fighter Wing located at 3005 Ferguson Road, Fort Wayne International Airport, IN 46809. 
   The funding will be used to construct a two aircraft bay parking shelter addition to the existing two aircraft bay parking shelter providing a total of four parking spots under shelter as required for a base A/C Readiness Shelter. Project consists of the following: Construct reinforced concrete foundation and painted floor slab with grounding points; masonry and metal siding walls; steel frame; and standing seam metal roof; include a high expansion fire suppression system and overhead infrared heating; provide hangar style doors for drive through capability; remove existing asphalt and provide new concrete taxiway entry and exit; provide asphalt transition to the south apron area; construct stainless steel underground piping, reinforced concrete for curbed access pavement, and refueler fill stands. The base requires adequately sized, appropriately configured, and functional aircraft readiness shelters with supporting taxiway system to support four-ship F-16 aircraft mission requirements. Due to previous funding restraints the current shelter facility was constructed with two parking spots with a plan to add two more at a later date. Readiness shelters are necessary for mission support, operations safety, and protection of aircraft and flightline personnel from inclement weather. The project will also provide a refueler vehicle fill stand on the operational side of the railroad tracks to support the flying mission.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank Ranking Member McKeon for his leadership and yielding the time, and I also want to thank Chairman Miller for working with us to develop a bipartisan bill. 
   You hear a lot about the controversies between the parties and the partisanship, but here is a huge piece of legislation that we were able to work through in a basically unanimous way between the House and even the Senate. 
   I want to talk about a few amendments that I worked with. In fact, there was controversy on each one of these things, but we were able to come to reconciliation. 
   One is GEAR UP, which is widely supported, and my good friend, CHAKA FATTAH, developed this concept. I was an original cosponsor. We moved it with a Democratic President and a Republican Congress, then a Republican Congress with a Republican President sustained the program, and now a Democratic Congress with a Republican President. But in that we've made some significant changes that allow GEAR UP to put a 2-1 match for scholarship money because one of the intentions of this was to get actual cash to help students get to college who were low-income, and we wanted to give them a commitment in junior high that we will back them up. And this will help balance that back more to cash to those students. 
   It also allows them to work with the first year of college and to connect with TRIO and others and not just get them there. 
   In the Drug-Free Student Loan provision, which has been much aligned by pro-drug groups around the country, we've clarified the Department of Education's confusion on how best to implement this plus added a warning that the universities and colleges are to tell the students that they're at risk of losing their loan if they're convicted of a  drug crime. They can get it back with a drug test. They can get it back the third time. You can go to college but not at taxpayer expense. 
   We also had an amendment dealing with for-profits' cohort default rates. One of the unintended consequences if you make it too difficult for how many students don't graduate, that for-profit schools would have stopped seeking minority, low-income students, or any subgroup that shows any risk of more defaults of student loans. And we would have had the unintended consequence if we didn't delay the implementation of the 3-year averaging, which we also worked to get, and I appreciate the chairman working with this because this is very important in many of these for-profit technical schools or others that are serving higher-need, less historically graduating percentages. Our goal with GEAR UP, with TRIO, and others is to increase those percentages, but you don't want to punish the colleges that reach out. 
   We also changed in distance education. We made it easier for basically Internet universities or colleges and universities that use that to get accreditation because if you choke the accreditation, you will cut off the expansion and the accessibility. And this is very important for many colleges and universities. 
   Lastly, I had an amendment in committee that was defeated, but Senator Gregg proposed it in the Senate, and this is the Academic Bill of Rights. I'm pleased that not only it passed the Senate but that the House in effect receded to the Senate. This is something that David Horowitz had advocated for many years, and I'm pleased this is in the bill, too. 
   I want to thank Chairman Miller for his work and Ranking Member McKeon.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member, and I stand up in opposition to this bill, not because I don't want to control tuition costs. This bill doesn't control tuition costs. This is a fundamental disagreement about the direction of our government. 
   Do we believe in markets or do we believe in the Federal Government? This is a remnant of the battle where we moved from direct lending over to free-market lending, that this bill, in fact, does nothing to control costs. Inevitably it will lead to the government taking over in direct lending and government having to try to fix costs of lending and then to fix the tuition costs, because there's nothing in here that balances tuition costs. 
   Previously, students and parents, if they had to factor in rising tuition costs and they couldn't get affordable loans, the pressure of the market would come on universities and colleges and alternative forums, and the market would respond, but this bill releases the market pressure. 
   Furthermore, in this bill there are other things that, instead of putting the money for those students who are highest risk and have the least income in Pell Grants, we've expanded into the middle class where the only hopeful pressure for tuition costs would come from. Students who could achieve academic scholarship in most universities can get into the highest universities if they can achieve the scholarship level. Let's look at this debate where it really is. It's in the middle class. It's about does the private sector manage loans better than the public sector and how does that triangle work with the universities. 
   For example, under private sector lending, bad debts have gone down. Why? Because you get financial counseling. There's a private sector incentive to make a profit that results in counseling of saying, will your degree match up your ability to repay or we won't give you the loan. They also put the pressure on the institutions, even with a small portion of the student loan being actual private sector. 
   But there's a provision in this bill, and I don't use this in a pejorative term, I use it in actual dictionary term, is the most socialist provision that I have seen in a bill, and it's the income-based repayment plan. It says that you only take 15 percent of your discretionary income to repay the interest, which then gets capitalized into the capital. Let me use my own personal example. 
   My father, we came from a nice middle-class family but middle class at best, in retailing. My dad told me he would either pay my way through grad school or undergrad. If I wanted to go to grad school, the college of my choice, he had saved a certain amount of money. I would have to live at home and go undergraduate. I got a great education at Indiana Purdue University in Fort Wayne, and then went to the University of Notre Dame. My father would have had no incentive under this bill to do so because in furniture retailing, followed by being a congressional staffer, I did not make enough money that I could have repaid my loan to Notre Dame or my undergraduate loan, and I would have had that loan excused at 25 years. I would have never paid, probably based on my salary, based on inflation adjustment, not a dime on the principal. There would have been no market management on my dad to save the money or on me. 
   This bill, by undermining both the lending premise of the private sector and the personal responsibility of parents and students to balance this, is a purist government takeover of a project that will not reduce the cost of student loans but will expand the power of government and the inefficiencies of government and ultimately damage students of America. 
   No matter how good and tempting it sounds, no matter what the campaign commercials sound like, it is a terrible, terrible bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   This amendment would continue the existing ban on public funding for needle exchange programs in Washington, D.C. We have prohibited this since 1999, so we've done this for 7 years. We generally speaking have had votes in the House and Senate and voted overwhelmingly not to have the taxpayers be heroin dealers. 
   Intravenous drug use is associated with two epidemics, the spread of infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C and illicit drug abuse and the physical, economic and social damages it does. Needle exchange programs do not increase drug abuse. They maintain it, they sustain it, they support the intravenous drug use. 
   Also, over the years, we can argue about the studies and we've argued on this on the House floor over and over about this study and that study. The best that you can say is studies are inconclusive. In fact, recent studies are moving to prove what I have alleged in these debates over the years, that there's no significant impact on HIV infection, in fact, we merely subsidize heroin use. 
   Responsible public health policy and compassion requires us to meet the primary illness, not just the outward symptoms of the disease. Addiction is what fuels HIV risk. Providing needles to addicts isn't going to help end their addiction. It is not compassionate to enable addicts to continue their addiction. What we need to do is get them off. For example, D.C. has actually reduced the funding for drug abuse and addiction treatment. They need to be focusing on addiction treatment, not providing free heroin needles. 
   I want to speak briefly about Vancouver, Canada, which was the model  in the western hemisphere. When they first implemented this program, I visited Vancouver and watched the distribution of needles. They assured me that this was going to get the problem under control, even though they saw rising drug abuse in the center city of Vancouver. By the next time I went up to Vancouver, they had multiple needle sites, that in fact some of the needle sites in downtown Vancouver were competing with each other and arguing over who got to provide the needles. We saw in many of these urban center areas, which has been repeated in New York and in other places where they've had these experimental programs that in fact it has increased codependency because in many of these areas where you see people who are being treated for a variety of different illnesses, you have homeless shelters, and we've seen a rise in codependency because the needle exchange programs and the heroin dealers are down where the needle exchange programs are and we've seen an increase and a rise in this. 
   Recent studies out of Vancouver are continuing to prove on a steady, systematic way that it has been one colossal failure that had been touted on this House floor as a solution to HIV. I believe that it is not only practically wrong for us to provide the funds through taxpayer funds to a program that is not only practically not effective in stopping HIV, it is, I believe, morally and ethically wrong to ask the taxpayers to in effect provide the very needles that keep people addicted to heroin.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I was hoping that we could deal with this issue in a broader amendment and I misspoke. We have a battle on the House floor over direct funding. This is in particular a limitation and I understood that under parliamentary rules my earlier amendment might be tossed out on grounds of trying to legislate on an appropriations bill. 
   In the past, just for the record, the Rules Committee has always protected this amendment because we felt it was absolutely critical not to have the distribution of needles to heroin addicts in our capital city of America. But since the Rules Committee did not protect the general, this particular amendment in front of us doesn't really have a broad, sweeping effect on the District of Columbia but in fact targets two programs that have in fact in the past ineffectively distributed needles and syringes. 
   The general question is, and this is a proxy vote, is do you believe that needles should be distributed to heroin addicts by public enemies, and particularly in our Nation's Capital. Should we repeat in the streets of Washington, DC, what has failed in so many cities in the United States and around the world, in a, I believe, heartfelt honest attempt to reduce HIV virus, instead hasn't reduced HIV virus or at least at best--there is dispute as to that--but has in fact increased and sustained heroin addiction in the United States.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   First, I want to make it absolutely career that I have spent much of my career work on antinarcotics effort, and it is not a cavalier, cheap shot-type amendment here. I have visited the Vancouver multiple times. I have visited the heroin centers in Switzerland. I have been on the streets of New York and other areas where this has purported to do what the gentleman claims it does. It doesn't. The gentleman didn't cite any study, to the degree there are studies. I have already acknowledged they are mixed. But the net impact is it hasn't seen a reduction in HIV use, and it has seen an increase in heroin use. 
   Secondly, as far as Washington DC, they have 80 beds, capacity for 80 beds for detoxification. That is not a serious effort to reduce heroin. 
   Thirdly, we fund the District of Columbia. It is our national capital. You can criticize or say that we micromanage, but, in fact, we provide much of the funding that goes in the District of Columbia, and it is, if not directly, at least indirectly taxpayer funds. Because it is a national capital, that is why it is set up as the District of Columbia. 
   Now, I understand there is frustration with that, but we have also tried to limit any direct or indirect funds to heroin needle exchanges anywhere in the country. This isn't targeted at Washington DC. You can look at my record. I am willing to target anybody on this program, because I don't believe it reduces HIV. I do believe it increases heroin addiction. I do believe that, in fact, it has been a well-intended, as I said, program, that has worked out to be counterproductive. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. 
   First off, we have quoted study after study on this House floor, indirect studies contracted out by different people at different times have, in fact, proven different things depending on what you want to try to prove. The net impact of it is it hasn't reduced HIV, and it has not reduced but, in fact, we have seen heroin addiction go up. 
   Medical associations are on both sides of the record on this issue, because on the early days of this issue it showed great promise, and there was great hope that, in fact, it might work, but that it has not. What we really need is drug treatment, not drug enable willing. What you can see when you go into these difference centers and visit them is, as a matter of fact, some people come in, they see it as a way to get clean needles. But when you analyze the studies, it's not even that those who were using dirty needles used dirty needles less, they use heroin more. 
   During the periods of time where they could get the needles at the distribution points, they get the needles at the distribution points. At other times, when they want to get caught up, they go get the dirty needles. It doesn't even reduce. In a case-by-case basis, there's not proven sustained evidence that it even reduces the dirty needles of those who go to the centers. Unless you have round-the-clock constant track usage in a controlled setting, it simply doesn't have the impact that it claims to have. 
   I believe that this is good Federal policy that we have maintained since 1999, and we should keep this policy. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, as my friend from Wisconsin knows my issue on this commitment goes far beyond the District of Columbia. This doesn't have anything to do with the goal of being a city council member in the District of Columbia. 
   I believe any type of funding of heroin needles is counterproductive, and there are plenty of medical experts on both sides who will make that argument either direction. But evidence is increasingly proving that the one group of doctors, the one group of researchers and the 7 years of legislation here are being proven correct, and time will prove them even more correct. 
   But I do want to address the underlying fundamental question on whether we have a right to legislate in the District of Columbia. 
   Obviously, the Constitution from the founding of this country has treated the District of Columbia differently. It's our national capital. We have increasingly given them more flexibility. 
   I think that that is, generally speaking, a good thing. But we don't have a Fort Wayne, Indiana, appropriations bill that comes to the floor. We get some funding, but there are not special bills that come from taxpayer dollars all over America. Nor is there a northern Wisconsin funding bill that comes to the House floor. 
   When we take large sums of money from our districts that then gets used in policies, in our national capital, that was set up to be different than the other States, with different guidelines and difference regulations, then we do have some obligation to the taxpayers in our district and to our Nation that chose us as the national capital and an appropriations process that set us up where we are taking funds from other States because this is our national capital, and which none of us resents putting funds in because it's our national capital. We use much of the space here, we have put certain restrictions in the city. 
   I believe we are justified then in trying to do wise policies to the degree possible when necessary in the city. But my opposition to heroin needles is not just restricted to District of Columbia. This is bad policy that does not help the HIV problem and does expand the heroin problem.

   Mr. SOUDER. I want to make just two brief points. One is Vancouver, when they were first looking at it because of their at that time rising AIDS rates, which were not nearly as high at D.C., had a similar plan, or met with similar people from the medical community, and they've been proven wrong. Just because you have a plan and it came from the medical community does not mean it will work, and the program hasn't worked. 
   But I do want to make, if I could, one personal clarification. I am more than willing and have worked to put this restriction on every city in America. I don't distinguish Washington, D.C., from others, and I don't appreciate the implication that I would treat it like a plantation. I believe this restriction ought to apply to every city.

   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentlelady. 
   I rise in support of H. Res. 1010. As a cosponsor of my neighbor and colleague Mr. Donnelly's resolution, I appreciate his leadership. 
   I very much appreciate Chairman Frank's backing this and Congressman Capito, and others, because this is an important resolution to recognize the importance of manufactured housing, particularly in the third week of June as the Manufactured Housing Week. 
   As you've already heard, manufactured housing is a largely underappreciated segment of our Nation's housing industry, even though it uniquely provides both high-quality and affordable housing for millions of Americans. 
   Companies in my district are numerous across northern--and particularly north central--Indiana--the center of the recreational vehicles industry, as well as manufactured housing. Fairmont in Nappanee, Four Seasons in Middlebury, Patriot in Elkhart, as well as Liberty in Goshen. Forest River has the Hart Homes. We have Coachman. Fleetwood has a huge facility just south of Fort Wayne in Decatur, Schulte Homes. And I could go on with a list. Up to 4,000 jobs in the Third Congressional District in Indiana are related to manufactured housing directly. 
   Most Americans do not understand how far this housing industry has developed, and the industry suffers from many unfair stereotypes. No longer is manufactured housing the domain of so-called trailer parks on the outskirts of town. In fact, many Americans, even in the typical leafy subdivisions, share a fence with a manufactured home and they don't even know it. For example,  this one from Liberty Homes shows the island kitchen. You see them with vaulted ceilings, four- and five-bedroom homes only for 20, 30, $40,000 less than a site-built home.     
   For example, a beautiful two-story deluxe 2,000-square-foot multisectional home in my district can sell for just over $100,000, as I said, 10 to 35 percent less than a site-built home. They also gain in energy efficiency. The quality of manufactured homes was shown by the fact that on the gulf coast, among those that best withstood the high winds of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita were manufactured homes. Indeed, in some neighborhoods, manufactured homes were the only ones left standing after the storms blew through. 
   Given manufactured housing's dual strength in both superior price and quality, we need to recognize and salute this industry. It is a frustrating time in housing as we look at the those who took advantage in the financing end of people's ability to repay or overvalued the homes. But we need to make sure that low- and middle-income people who are striving for better housing can still have access to affordable housing, and manufactured housing is a critical part of that. 
   We have also seen much alarm in nonscientific facts relating to formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is in the wood. It is not in any particular kind of housing. It's on this House floor. It's in these seats. It's in the Speaker's podium. The question is the size and scale of the unit because formaldehyde is a repellant and an adhesive. And we need to have scientific facts. The fact is that all homes contain wood. It has nothing to do with any particular category. And many thousands of people can have their jobs endangered because of nonscientific political bashing of particular categories. Manufactured housing, in fact, has the same characteristics in this regard as traditional site-built housing. 
   We also need to make sure that as we look at down payment requirements, and how we deal with very difficult subjects as we go into the housing market, that we understand that manufactured homes, in fact, have the same appreciation as site-built homes. It is just often because they are more affordable, the individuals may not have the same income mix. And we need to figure out a way to make sure that people have access to good quality housing, and that is the American Dream. 
   I thank the thousands of workers in my district, Mr. Donnelly's district and across this entire Nation who are providing affordable housing so people can live the American Dream.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION MONTH -- (House of Representatives - February 25, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 930, and especially in support of Indiana Tech in Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
   In my district, Mr. Speaker, there is a huge need for high-skilled workers, and Indiana Tech plays a critical role in helping our region meet this demand. Each year Indiana Tech provides thousands of students opportunities to ``skill up,'' so that they can better contribute to local employers and better provide for their families. 
   According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the top 20 fastest-growing occupations in our country are supplied by career and technical education. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce reports that nearly three-quarters of employers struggle to hire qualified workers. Clearly the need for career and technical education is severe, and we in Congress must do what we can to encourage its growth. 
   In northeast Indiana--as in the rest of the country--a high quality education is critical to obtaining a good, well-paying job. While northeast Indiana is still a manufacturing center of the country, these jobs are becoming increasingly more high-tech and require higher levels of skills and training. Schools like Indiana Tech are helping prepare students for these changes. 
   Mr. Speaker, as competition in our global economy continues to grow more fierce, career and technical education is essential to preparing a well-educated, skilled workforce. I ask that my colleagues join with me in expressing support for Indiana Tech and schools like it. They are critical to the future of northeast Indiana, and they are critical to the future of our country.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (NATIONAL PARKS FUNDING -- (House of Representatives - February 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I wanted to take a few minutes tonight to congratulate the President on the initiative to boost funding for our national parks. Of all the news stories and the ruckus about Iraq and global warming and our borders and the death of Anna Nicole Smith, whatever bumps it out of the news, it has kind of been lost about a major new initiative for the upcoming centennial of the national parks. 
   I say ``upcoming'' because it is actually in 2016, but a number of us in the House several years ago introduced a National Park Centennial Act. Congressman BRIAN BAIRD and I, we formed the National Parks Caucus and in the House led the effort where we had, I believe, 67 Members. We, quite frankly, would have had more, but we systematically were trying to make sure that we had both Republicans and Democrats in relatively even numbers to show it was a bipartisan effort. And in the Senate, Senator McCain and Senator Feinstein were the leaders, along with Senator Alexander. They had strong support over in the Senate. 
   The goal was to try to get rid of not only the backlog in the national parks, but trying to address where our parks were going to head in the next 100 years; that in the national parks one of our challenges has been that we have added homeland security challenges to the national parks because many of the sites that would have the most impact if they were attacked and destroyed are actually in our national parks. Whether it be Independence Hall or the Gateway Arch, for that matter, the Golden Gate Bridge, in addition to the monuments here in Washington, all come under the national parks. That  came out of the budget. It didn't come out of the Homeland Security budget, much like roads come out of the Transportation budget. They had to absorb that, they have had to move rangers in and absorb the Homeland Security costs. 
   Of course every agency is struggling with labor costs, health care costs, pension costs. And the net result of all this pressure on the national parks is, even though we have been steadily increasing funding here, with the additional costs in homeland security, the additional costs on employees and the additional land that we have added to the national parks system, the additional sites we have added, the additional conservation areas under a whole range of heritage areas, national roads and different things that go into their responsibility. 
   The net impact is that many of our national parks, we have seen as much as a 67 percent reduction in actual rangers at the parks. While we have put money on the backlog, a backlog doesn't mean that you have eliminated the problem. For example, if you fix the restroom at a park and you fix a visitors center or you fix a sewer system, because of amortization and declining facility and road use, you are constantly, by fixing the backlog, if you divert your money from your current operating to fix the backlog, it merely means now you are in effect getting a front-log. In other words, you are adding new expenses that then get added to the backlog. So even as we have increased funds here, we have fallen further behind. 
   And the question is what was our national parks system going to look like for our kids and for our grandkids. It is something that can easily get lost in whatever the crush of the day is. If it is immunization, if it is Medicaid, if it is prescription drugs for seniors, if it is border security, it gets lost in the system. 
   For the 50th anniversary that Congress passed sufficiently ahead of time, which is what we are trying to do here, what was called Mission 66, there was a commitment over a number of years to fund adequate funding for the national parks so for the 50th birthday, in 1966, we could see the roads, the visitation facilities and other things set for the 50th anniversary. That is why we require forward funding at this time. 
   This proposal by the administration is not exactly like the Centennial Act, but very similar. It commits dollars from the government, both directly for funding, roughly it looks like around 100 to $200 million a year in direct funding, plus it creates a challenge grant. Now, the fundamental part of our bill was a challenge grant that people could take a deduction, and then whatever the shortfall was from the 270 million we needed annually, the Federal Government would make up the difference. 
   The total here is the same in the President's bill, but it has a direct one-for-one match. Right now, if people give 20 million to the national parks, it will give up to a hundred million with a hundred million dollar match, plus additional to get to that 270 figure. We hopefully can do that up to now to 2016. And I hope this doesn't just put more rangers in the parks, as the President said, and meet the needs that we have in homeland security and infrastructure, but that we realize that our national park System isn't only wilderness, isn't only visitation, it isn't only going to the parks to see what are the classic mountain peaks or the great and wonderful deserts or the volcanoes, or whatever the particular natural park you think of, it is our number one place for historic preservation of buildings, of artifacts. It is the number one, arguably, place that we even have art in America because of all the parks and certain sites devoted to art. But it is more than just that. It is our number one laboratory in America where you still have wildlife, where you have trees and plants and frogs and things that you can scientifically study. 
   And I would also challenge, as we develop this, to look at creative ways that the National Park Service can use the Internet, can use the education to bring this to schools all over America, to families all over America, and not just if you visit the park, a ranger talk that now can draw a few people at the campfire. If we look ahead to the year 2016, that ought to be available on the Internet where in your home, by your own campfire, you can join in with the people that are actually at the campfire. 
   I hope that this passes Congress and that we are creatively looking at where the National Park Service will head in the year 2016.  
   President Pushes Boost in Funding for National Parks  
   WASHINGTON.--National parks would be a big winner under President Bush's 2008 budget, and a plan to match up to $100 million annually in private donations could guarantee increases for a decade. 
   Bush's budget, being unveiled today, would give the National Park Service $2.4 billion next year, administration officials told USA TODAY. That includes a $258 million increase for daily operations, up 14.5%. Since 2002, those funds have risen 1.5% above inflation. 
   The president proposes adding at least $100 million a year for the next 10 years. The funds would be used to hire 3,000 seasonal park rangers, guides and maintenance workers each summer, an increase of more than 50%. In addition, more than 1 million children could be enrolled in youth programs. 
   On top of that, Bush wants Congress to guarantee that the federal government would match philanthropic donations each year, up to another $100 million. Currently, about $20 million is contributed each year by supporters of national parks, such as family foundations. 
   Taken together, the proposals could provide $3 billion in new parks funding over the coming decade. In 2016, the parks will celebrate their 100th anniversary; Bush wants them to be in better shape than they are today. 
   ``I think it can be a source of healing for Americans,'' Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne said. ``This one is not partisan. This one is American.'' 
   The proposal is being welcomed by groups that advocate on behalf of the nearly 400 sites managed by the National Park Service and have been a thorn in the Bush administration's side during lean years. The National Parks Conservation Association was seeking an increase of $250 million in operating funds for the parks. 
   ``This is a renewed commitment that national parks should be a national priority,'' said Tom Kiernan, the group's president. ``It's a catalyzing initiative at a wonderful time for the national parks.'' 
   The proposals would have to be approved separately by Congress. The $2.4 billion parks budget, with its record increase in operating funds, would become final if Congress allocates the funding. The matching-funds proposal would have to be approved by committees with jurisdiction over the Interior Department. 
   Taken together, they would add thousands of new park workers to guide visitors with programs such as interpretive walks and campfire talks. Volunteer coordinators would be added in 44 sites. 
   Seasonal workers have been cut during lean budget years, resulting in a 10-year decline. 
   ``We simply have lost contact people who meet the American public,'' said Stephen Whitesell, superintendent of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park in Texas. ``What they're not seeing are rangers in flat hats.'' 
   Since 9/11, most of the money added to the National Park Service budget has gone for added security in such places as New York City, Washington, D.C., and along the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico. 
   Some of the new funds will be used to attract young people to the parks through Internet programs and podcasts. Kempthorne and others see it as mutually beneficial: The parks would avoid a loss of visitors in future generations, and children would reap the health benefits of the great outdoors. 
   ``We're competing with an electronic world,'' Kempthorne said.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank the gentleman from Florida. 
   Often our differences in this body can be fairly sharp and our disagreements can be fairly significant over which direction our country should actually head, and such debate is very healthy in a democracy and vital to getting good policy. But there are other times when, in fact, we can work together, and this bill is an example where we can work together. 
   There are multiple examples in this bill where we fundamentally agreed, and there were other things we worked through in the amendment process. One important component of this originally Chaka Fattah and I sponsored; it was originally called High Hopes. President Clinton adopted that as GEAR UP as one of his major programs. Obviously, this is a little difficult on the Republican side, but we managed to pass it through in a Republican Congress with a Democrat President. We held it as a Republican Congress with a Republican President. And now with a Democrat Congress and Republican President, GEAR UP continues to expand and be a very effective way for low-income students to have the hope, if they keep good grades and stay out of trouble, to be assured that they can be eligible for student loans, Pell Grants, and other things to provide a promise of a future education. 
   We also worked as we tried to tackle things like long-distance learning and online learning, which is a growth category. I appreciate the majority's willingness to work on how colleges and these new experimental universities can work towards distance learning and expanding without having the heavy hand of government make determinations of when they can and when they can't. There have to be substantive objections, not arbitrary guidelines. And they worked on the language to make sure that was the case. 
   We had another technical issue on cohort measurements on student loans that some private universities, particularly those that are more trade-oriented, as well as minority-based organizations in the original draft of this bill, could have seen them go into default. And many low-income, minority, and trade colleges and so on would have been in deep trouble. But the majority took an adjustment in that cohort. Yes, if a college is underperforming and not providing education that is so necessary to students, it should be disqualified from the student loan program; but we have to make sure that colleges, and trade areas in particular, don't get arbitrarily knocked out because often they're reaching the very people we're trying to attract into higher education. I appreciate the majority. 
   There has also been a provision that I had in the higher ed bill years ago that caused some consternation. I want to make sure that the record shows that we were able to work on the student loan provision that says if you get convicted of a drug crime, you are suspended from your student loan; that we have provisions in this bill, working with the majority, to make sure how the drug tests are done so that if you test clean twice, you can get your loan back. We have provisions here that make it clear that each institution of higher education shall provide each student, upon enrollment, a separate, clear, conspicuous written notice that addresses this question. 
   This was very important because this provision was meant as a deterrence, not as a punishment. If a student is at a party and somebody says, hey, do you want to try this, you ought to try this pot. This will work really well; this will get you high. This meth may keep you so you can stay awake to study, you can say, look, I could lose my loan  here and lose everything I have. It's one more arsenal in your ability to fight illegal narcotics and stay in school. Furthermore, if you're on narcotics, your performance inevitably will drop over time. 
   This provision has received bipartisan support. We have continued to clarify it. And I want to make sure that, unlike previous times when this was interpreted to apply to everybody, or if you had committed a crime before, you could lose your loan, a student is a student is a student. It says, if you have your loan, you can lose your loan. It has nothing to do with people who rehab; it has nothing to do with people who maybe were in college for 2 years, went out, had problems, and then come back. We want those people in school. And I hope the administration this time will interpret this, regardless of which party it is, correctly. And I want to make sure that the Congressional Record shows what the intent of Congress was.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4137, COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - February 07, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. I thank my distinguished friend from Washington State. 
   A little bit of irony here. I had an amendment that we fully debated in committee on students' free speech, and I wanted to offer it today. But isn't it ironic that while I was trying to argue for a student bill of rights and free speech, that we're not allowed to have free speech and a bill of rights in the United States Congress. How in the world, when we're having 27 amendments, and this amendment was overwhelmingly supported by our party, we only have, out of 27, four from Republicans, and two of those are Republican opposed. If we have time for 27 amendments, why can't we have an amendment for free speech? I just don't understand. 
   I never understood the opposition to the amendment, but what an insult to the American people that when we want to debate whether there should be a student bill of rights on campuses, which is being adopted and introduced in many places around the country, that the United States Congress can't even debate on the House floor a free speech amendment and protection for speech in colleges. This is an outrage, an embarrassment, and a humiliation to the Rules Committee. Why 27 amendments, but not one on a student bill of rights? Could it be that it's a difficult vote? 
   David Horowitz, and I will insert into the Record an article, ``In Defense of Intellectual Diversity,'' has been a champion of this problem. Now, we had a very interesting debate in committee. The chairman of the committee said that some of these students who have been complaining should grow up, and cited a case of where he struggled. And certainly when I was a college student in the late sixties and early seventies and wore a button ``I'm proud to be a square'' when most of America wasn't proud to be a square, I certainly had my share of debates, my share of harassment, my share of being yelled down, trying to offer a differing view than the view that was popular in the late sixties. And some of that goes with being on a college campus, but there are examples all over this country where intellectual diversity, intellectual alternatives are being stymied in academia. This amendment would try to protect those rights. 
   Some of it's from the far left; a lot of it is on the conservative side right now. In fact, next Tuesday Ben Stein has a movie coming out, ``Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,'' that will debut about one of those debates in science. Where there is an effort to stamp it out, particularly when you get into government, economics, sociology, philosophy, and so on, increasingly there is a rigidity; and if you disagree you are harassed, your grades can be altered, your papers can be given back to you, speeches and alternative speakers are shouted down. And, yes, there are nominal processes to do it, but if there are nominal processes to do it, what is wrong? This amendment says, for example, ``Individual colleges and universities have different missions and each institution should design its academic program in accordance. Within the context of institutional mission, the college should promote intellectual pluralism and facilitate free and open exchange of ideas.'' Well, that's not very controversial. 
   ``D, Students should not be intimidated, harassed, discouraged from speaking out, discriminated against, or subject to official sanctions because of their personal, political, ideological or religious beliefs.'' Isn't that a terrible, risky, difficult vote? 
   ``Students should be treated equally and fairly, including evaluation and grading, without regard to or consideration of their personal political views or ideological beliefs.'' That's just awful. How could we vote on that in the United States Congress to say there would be no persecution? There is no ``whereas'' clauses here. There's nothing in here that says campuses are liberal, campuses are conservative. We don't have any ``whereas'' clauses that are insulting in here. There is nothing in here that's partisan; I just read you the guts of the bill. 
   Why can't we vote on this? Why is this opposed? Why is it opposed so much that we're not even allowed to debate it on the floor of Congress? How can we say, in a higher education bill, that we believe in inquiry, that we believe in searching for knowledge, but when we had an amendment to protect students who might have a difference of opinion that we wouldn't even allow a vote?  
   In Defense of Intellectual Diversity  
   I am the author of the Academic Bill of Rights, which many student governments, colleges and universities, education commissions, and legislatures are considering adopting. Already, the U.S. House of Representatives has introduced a version as legislation, and the Senate should soon follow suit. 
   State governments are also starting to rally around efforts to protect student rights and intellectual diversity on campuses: In Colorado, the State Senate president, John K. Andrews Jr., has been very concerned about the issue, and State Rep. Shawn Mitchell has just introduced legislation requiring public institutions to create and publicize processes for protecting students against political bias. Lawmakers in four other states have also expressed a strong interest in legislation of their own, based on some version of the Academic Bill of Rights. Students for Academic Freedom is working to secure the measure's adoption by student governments and university administrations on 105 member campuses across the country (http://www.studentsforacademicfreedom.org). 
   The Academic Bill of Rights is based squarely on the almost 100-year-old tradition of academic freedom that the American Association of University Professors has established. The bill's purposes are to codify that tradition; to emphasize the value of ``intellectual diversity,'' already implicit in the concept of academic freedom; and, most important, to enumerate the rights of students to not be indoctrinated or otherwise assaulted by political propagandists in the classroom or any educational setting. 
   Although the AAUP has recognized student rights since its inception, however, most campuses have rarely given them the attention or support they deserve. In fact, it is safe to say that no college or university now adequately defends them. Especially recently, with the growing partisan activities of some faculty members and the consequent politicization of some aspects of the curriculum, that lack of support has become one of the most pressing issues in the academy. 
   Moreover, because I am a well-known conservative and have published studies of political bias in the hiring of college and university professors, critics have suggested that the Academic Bill of Rights is really a ``right-wing plot'' to stack faculties with political conservatives by imposing hiring quotas. Indeed, opponents of legislation in Colorado have exploited that fear, writing numerous op-ed pieces about alleged right-wing plans to create affirmative-action programs for conservative professors. 
   Nothing could be further from the truth. The actual intent of the Academic Bill of Rights is to remove partisan politics from the classroom. The bill that I'm proposing explicitly forbids political hiring or firing: ``No faculty shall be hired or fired or denied promotion or tenure on the basis of his or her political or religious beliefs.'' The bill thus protects all faculty members--left-leaning critics of the war in Iraq as well as right-leaning proponents of it, for example--from being penalized for their political beliefs. Academic liberals should be as eager to support that principle as conservatives. 
   Some liberal faculty members have expressed concern about a phrase in the bill of rights that singles out the social sciences and humanities and says hiring in those  areas should be based on competence and expertise and with a view toward ``fostering a plurality of methodologies and perspectives.'' In fact, the view that there should be a diversity of methodologies is already accepted practice. Considering that truth is unsettled in these discipline areas, why should there not be an attempt to nurture a diversity of perspectives as well? 
   Perhaps the concern is that ``fostering'' would be equivalent to ``mandating.'' The Academic Bill of Rights contains no intention, implicit or otherwise, to mandate or produce an artificial ``balance'' of intellectual perspectives. That would be impossible to achieve and would create more mischief than it would remedy. On the other hand. a lack of diversity is not all that difficult to detect or correct. 
   By adopting the Academic Bill of Rights, an institution would recognize scholarship rather than ideology as an appropriate academic enterprise. It would strengthen educational values that have been eroded by the unwarranted intrusion of faculty members' political views into the classroom. That corrosive trend has caused some academics to focus merely on their own partisan agendas and to abandon their responsibilities as professional educators with obligations to students of all political persuasions. Such professors have lost sight of the vital distinction between education and indoctrination, which--as the AAUP recognized in its first report on academic freedom, in 1915--is not a legitimate educational function. 
   Because the intent of the Academic Bill of Rights is to restore academic values, I deliberately submitted it in draft form to potential critics who did not share my political views. They included Stanley Fish, dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Michael B&#233;rub&#233;, a professor of English at Pennsylvania State University at University Park; Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University; and Philip Klinkner, a professor of government at Hamilton College. While their responses differed, I tried to accommodate the criticisms I got, for example deleting a clause in the original that would have required the deliberations of all committees in charge of hiring and promotion to be recorded and made available to a ``duly constituted authority.'' 
   I even lifted wholesale one of the bill's chief tenets--that colleges and professional academic associations should remain institutionally neutral on controversial political issues--from an article that Dean Fish wrote for The Chronicle (``Save the World on Your Own Time,'' January 23, 2003). He has also written an admirable book, Professional Correctness (Clarendon Press, 1995), which explores the inherent conflict between ideological thinking and scholarship. 
   Since the Academic Bill of Rights is designed to clarify and extend existing principles of academic freedom, its opponents have generally been unable to identify specific provisions that they find objectionable. Instead, they have tried to distort the plain meaning of the text. The AAUP itself has been part of that effort, suggesting in a formal statement that the bill's intent is to introduce political criteria for judging intellectual diversity and, thus, to subvert scholarly standards. It contends that the bill of rights ``proclaims that all opinions are equally valid,'' which ``negates an essential function of university education.'' The AAUP singles out for attack a phrase that refers to ``the uncertainty and unsettled character of all human knowledge'' as the rationale for respecting diverse viewpoints in curricula and reading lists in the humanities and social sciences. The AAUP claims that ``this premise ..... is anti-thetical to the basic scholarly enterprise of the university, which is to establish and transmit knowledge.'' 
   The association's statements are incomprehensible. After all, major schools of thought in the contemporary academy--pragmatism, postmodernism, and deconstructionism, to name three--operate on the premise that knowledge is uncertain and, at times, relative. Even the hard sciences, which do not share such relativistic assumptions, are inspired to continue their research efforts by the incomplete state of received knowledge. The university's mission is not only to transmit knowledge but to pursue it--and from all vantage points. What could be controversial about acknowledging that? Further, the AAUP's contention that the Academic Bill of Rights threatens true academic standards by suggesting that all opinions are equally valid is a red herring, as the bill's statement on intellectual diversity makes clear: ``Exposing students to the spectrum of significant scholarly viewpoints on the subjects examined in their courses is a major responsibility of faculty.'' (Emphasis added.) 
   As the Academic Bill of Rights states, ``Academic disciplines should welcome a diversity of approaches to unsettled questions.'' That is common sense. Why not make it university policy? 
   The only serious opposition to the Academic Bill of Rights is raised by those who claim that, although its principles are valid, it duplicates academic-freedom guidelines that already exist. Elizabeth Hoffman, president of the University of Colorado System, for example, has personally told me that she takes that position. 
   But with all due respect, such critics are also mistaken. Most universities' academic-freedom policies generally fail to make explicit, let alone codify, the institutions' commitment to intellectual diversity or the academic rights of students. The institutions also do not make their policies readily available to students--who, therefore, are generally not even aware that such policies exist. 
   For example, when I met with Elizabeth Hoffman, she directed me to the University of Colorado's Web site, where its academic-freedom guidelines are posted. Even if those guidelines were adequate, posting them on an Internet site does not provide sufficient protection for students, who are unlikely to visit it. Contrast the way that institutions aggressively promote other types of diversity guidelines--often establishing special offices to organize and enforce all sorts of special diversity-related programs--to such a passive approach to intellectual diversity. 
   At Colorado's Web site, for example, one can read the following: ``Sections of the AAUP's 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure have been adopted as a statement of policy by the Board of Regents.'' Few people reading that article or visiting the site would suspect that the following protection for students is contained in the AAUP's 1940 statement: ``Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject, but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject.'' 
   Is there a college or university in America--including the University of Colorado--where at least one professor has not introduced controversial matter on the war in Iraq or the Bush White House in a class whose subject matter is not the war in Iraq, or international relations, or presidential administrations? Yet intrusion of such subject matter, in which the professor has no academic expertise, is a breach of professional responsibility and a violation of a student's academic rights. 
   We do not go to our doctors' offices and expect to see partisan propaganda posted on the doors, or go to hospital operating rooms and expect to hear political lectures from our surgeons. The same should be true of our classrooms and professors, yet it is not. When I visited the political-science department at the University of Colorado at Denver this year, the office doors and bulletin boards were plastered with cartoons and statements ridiculing Republicans, and only Republicans. When I asked President Hoffman about that, she assured me that she would request that such partisan materials be removed and an appropriate educational environment restored. To the best of my knowledge, that has yet to happen. 
   Not everyone would agree about the need for such restraint, and it should be said that the Academic Bill of Rights makes no mention of postings and cartoons--although that does not mean that they are appropriate. I refer to them only to illustrate the problem that exists in the academic culture when it comes to fulfilling professional obligations that professors owe to all students. I would ask liberal professors who are comfortable with such partisan expressions how they would have felt as students seeking guidance from their own professors if they had to walk a gantlet of cartoons portraying Bill Clinton as a lecher, or attacking antiwar protesters as traitors. 
   The politicized culture of the university is the heart of the problem. At Duke University this year, a history professor welcomed his class with the warning that he had strong ``liberal'' opinions, and that Republican students should probably drop his course. One student did. Aided by Duke Students for Academic Freedom, the young man then complained. To his credit, the professor apologized. Although some people on the campus said the professor had been joking, the student clearly felt he faced a hostile environment. Why should the professor have thought that partisanship in the classroom was professionally acceptable in the first place? 
   At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a required summer-reading program for entering freshmen stirred a controversy in the state legislature last fall. The required text was Barbara Ehrenreich's socialist tract on poverty in America, Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America (Metropolitan Books, 2001). Other universities have required the identical text in similar programs, and several have invited Ehrenreich to campus to present her views under the imprimatur of the institution and without rebuttal. 
   That reflects an academic culture unhinged. When a university requires a single partisan text of all its students, it is a form of indoctrination, entirely inappropriate for an academic institution. If many universities had required Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus (Vintage Books, 1992) or Ann Coulter's Treason: Liberal Treachery From the Cold War to the War on Terrorism (Crown Forum, 2003) as their lone freshman-reading text, there would have been a collective howl from liberal faculties, who would have immediately recognized the inappropriateness of such institutional endorsement of controversial views. Why not require two texts, or four? (My stepson, who is a high-school senior, was required to read seven texts during his summer vacation.) 
   The remedy is so simple. Requiring readings on more than one side of a political controversy would be appropriate educational policy and would strengthen, not weaken, the democracy that supports our educational  system. Why is that not obvious to the administrators at Chapel Hill and the other universities that have instituted such required-reading programs? It's the academic culture, stupid.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (HONORING THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD -- (House of Representatives - January 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished former chairman from North Carolina who's been a leader in the anti-narcotics efforts in the Judiciary Committee and elsewhere and a tireless combatant against illegal drugs. I also want to thank Chairman Oberstar who clearly knows the importance of the Coast Guard in the Great Lakes, and Ranking Member John Mica who headed the Drug Subcommittee, who I succeeded as chairman of that subcommittee a number of years ago; Subcommittee Chairman Cummings, who was the ranking member of the Drug Subcommittee over the last 6 years; and my friend Steve LaTourette as well. 
   This resolution has a particular personal importance to me, too, beyond the larger question. The big bust of 42,845 pounds of cocaine was primarily done by the Coast Guard Cutter Sherman. Captain Charlie Diaz served as a detailee to our subcommittee for a number of years, and then was detailed to the Speaker's office, and I want to congratulate Charlie in particular and his crew on the Sherman. 
   It would be nice to claim that we taught him how to do this, but in fact, we're just really glad that while he was here on the Hill learning how we work that he didn't lose the skills necessary to track down the huge loads of cocaine and other things the Coast Guard does. 
   It's also important that in this big bust where they got the freighter Gatun and 14 people just off the coast of Panama, it's critical to have the intelligence. We, earlier, heard about the joint agency effort, particularly JATF, the Joint Agency Task Force, based out of south Florida that is run by the Coast Guard and provides such valuable intelligence. You're just not going to pick up a boat and find 42,000 pounds of cocaine, nearly 20 tons of cocaine. You have to have decent intelligence because when you look at the Bahamas and all those boats out there, we have to have these kind of coordinated efforts, and JATF is a key part of it, and drug intelligence is a key part of it. 
   I want to thank Commandant Allen, Admiral Allen, in particular, for understanding that narcotics are part of the terrorism effort. There's tremendous pressure on the Coast Guard, and in the Great Lakes and Alaska and many places, its fisheries, search and rescue is still the day-to-day what they do. They have all sorts of migrant interventions way out even coming in towards Hawaii, coming off of Haiti, coming off of Cuba, huge challenges in migrant interdiction. 
   They're trying to patrol and have increasing narcotics coming off from the Andean region into the eastern Pacific off of Mexico. We have routes that are going into Guatemala and Panama, like this big interception, biggest bust in the history of the Coast Guard. There are constant challenges. 
   Last year, we had zero deaths from what we just were talking about, 9/11-type terrorism, and 20,000 from drug overdose. Since 9/11, we've lost roughly 120,000 Americans to drug and alcohol abuse and all the violence that associates with that, and we lost 3,300 at 9/11. 
   It's important to understand we're dealing with all sorts of terrorism here, and the Coast Guard has been an important element. As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border, Port Security and Global Anti-Terrorism, I'm one who understands how conflicted they are in their missions: Do they stay at port and protect the port? Are they supposed to be out getting a sailboat that tipped over? Are they supposed to be helping the fisheries? Are they supposed to be trying to get people in the eastern Pacific, as they go out past the Galapagos Islands? What about the Caribbean? 
   They are so multitasked that this Congress has to understand that if we're going to ask the Coast Guard to tackle all these missions, there has to be adequate funding. We have to make sure that not only do the Deepwater ships float, but we also need to make  sure they have them. The controversies over the construction doesn't change the need. 
   As the drug traffickers move further out into the ocean, they have to have the ability to stay at sea longer. They can't keep running back into port because that's when the drug dealers, and if you can smuggle this much drugs, you can smuggle anthrax, you can smuggle nuclear parts, you can smuggle anything. Contraband is contraband. 
   If we aren't out there with a physical presence, if we don't have boats that are fast enough, if we don't have helicopters that can come off, if we can't surround or disable, we're not going to be able to intercept narcotics or other terrorists.     
   I want to commend Commandant Allen, who also basically bailed us out in Katrina, because the Coast Guard has served such an important function in so many areas there is not enough we can do to thank the men and women of the Coast Guard for their bravery, for their ability to do multitasking. And it's very important for this Congress to honor them and to make sure they have adequate funding.

<DOCNO>Mr. SOUDER. (THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE, FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008--Continued -- (House of Representatives - June 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. SOUDER. Mr. Chairman, this debate has been crystal clear. You know,  at times we've kind of passed over each other, but it isn't about abortion. I also want to thank the gentlelady for putting clauses on abortion in the bill. And it's not about family planning, because this doesn't change the family planning fund. 
   There is only one debate here, and that is, should family planning money go to organizations that advocate or perform abortion? And that is really what this is about. Those organizations are restricted under the Mexico City Policy. And that is in fact, in the view of people who are against abortion, providing public funds if you provide the condoms or whatever you're giving in in-kind aid. 
   Now, for example, as a Republican candidate, I'm not likely to get cash funding from anybody on your side of the aisle. But I have a feeling that if somebody donated stamps to me or donated a mailing to me or donated things in my office, your side would view that the same as a cash contribution. And people back home can understand that money this direct is, in fact, fungible. We have had this debate since I've been in Congress on faith-based. Every time the faith-based argument comes up, your side of the aisle argues that giving money to pay for preachers' expenses, for electricity at a Christian organization, is in fact the same as a direct contribution to those faith-based organizations. You can't have it both ways. 
   In fact, this is fungible money. The debate if you're against abortion is, you do not believe that money should go to organizations, taxpayer money, taken and collected from people who have a passionate opposition to abortion as well as those who favor abortion, should go to organizations that advocate that. If you're for abortion, you believe that should be allowed. And that's clearly what we've established in this debate. It's crystal clear.
