<DOCNO>Mr. LAHOOD. (ETHIOPIA DEMOCRACY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - October 02, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2003, the Ethiopia Democracy and Accountability Act of 2007. This important legislation authorizes $20 million for both FY 2008 and FY 2009 to provide economic support for Ethiopia, the oldest independent nation in Africa. 
   H.R. 2003 provides a framework for support programs designed to impact all aspects of Ethiopian society. The bill would provide financial support to human rights groups to continue their efforts in Ethiopia, as well as expand the Voice of America's Ethiopia program. The legislation would also provide economic development assistance, with a focus on meeting the healthcare needs of the Ethiopian people. The legislation also requires the President to submit a report to the Congress outlining a comprehensive plan to address Ethiopia's many economic, security, and human rights issues. 
   Perhaps most importantly, H.R. 2003 places a number of limitations on our country's dealings with the Ethiopian government, requiring that a number of benchmarks be met before the full support of the United States is realized. The Ethiopian Government must allow the media to operate freely; the judiciary must operate independent of government influence; all political prisoners must be released; internet access cannot be restricted; and human rights and democratization groups must be allowed to operate free of government interference. 
   I believe our country can be a positive and powerful influence to the Ethiopians, and I am thankful that this Congress has turned its attention to a people that struggle to achieve the basic human freedoms that we enjoy. I urge adoption of the resolution.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise to say that I wish as a member of the Appropriations Committee, that the same procedure that is being followed for helping the housing industry whereby the Committee on Financial Services held hearings, allowed members to offer amendments, allowed members to read the bill, allowed members to have their say about the bill, we on the Appropriations Committee would be accorded the same opportunity when it comes to a bill that will be considered by the House tomorrow, a $200 billion bill that will appropriate money to help our troops and to fund our troops and to provide them the equipment they need. 
   Now as a member of the Appropriations Committee, none of us will have the chance to read the bill, to look at the bill, and those of us who have been around this House for some time, and members of the committee know that the devil is in the details. We know what happens when bills are brought to the floor when Members haven't had a chance to read them. Things are inserted, words are inserted, dollars are inserted that become a great embarrassment for people as they vote on these bills. 
   And so tomorrow when this bill comes to the floor, the appropriation bill, the $200 billion appropriation bill, I encourage Members to vote against it because they will not know what is in it. They won't know what words are in it or what money is in it because the Appropriations Committee has been shut out from the opportunity to have their say, to offer amendments, to offer an opportunity to change the language in the bill. 
   And really it is disingenuous, I think, to our committee to allow this kind of procedure to take place. We have two very experienced people on the Appropriations Committee in the chairman from Pennsylvania and the ranking member from Florida of the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee who will have little or nothing to say about the bill.

You're going to pass the bill. Why not give all of us a chance to have our say and to at least read it and offer amendments and have our say. What are you afraid of?

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill about children and about health care. Now, all of us in this Chamber have the very best health care insurance in the world, bar none. We should be willing to share those kinds of resources with kids in this country. Why should children have to go to an emergency room when they have the flu? Why should children have to go to an emergency room when they have a cold? Why should children have to go to emergency rooms when they are sick? They shouldn't. Not in America. Not where we have the very best health care in the world. My friends, we should give to our children the access to health care that we have, those of us that serve in the House and the Senate. 
   This is a bipartisan compromise. This is an opportunity to take a Republican initiative, share it, move on and give the opportunity to children. I encourage Members to do that, to play on the Republican initiative that was started years ago and to say, we have a bipartisan opportunity to give good health care to children. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, particularly on the Republican side, to vote for this proposal. 
   I thank the chairman for the time.  
   The debate about whether or not to reauthorize and expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program should be easy. This legislation is the product of a bipartisan group that worked to produce a compromise that should be acceptable to all of us. With the shortfall we have seen in several states over the past year, reauthorization of the program at current funding levels is unacceptable. Earlier this year, Illinois faced a $247 million SCHIP shortfall. Many other states were a similar situation before the shortfalls were addressed with new appropriations. By passing this bill today, we may be able to prevent future shortfalls which jeopardize those state programs designed to cover the costs for low income families who can't afford adequate health insurance for their children. 
   Of the estimated six million low-income children who are not eligible for Medicaid, more than 250,000 children were covered by All Kids, Illinois' successful children's insurance program. More than half of those children live in working and middle class families that make too much to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance. In 2005, more than 25% of all uninsured children in Illinois fell into the $25,000-$35,000 income level range, having nearly doubled from 13% in 2002. At that rate of growth, we must continue to see this program through. With passage of this legislation today, it is estimated that an additional 154,000 Illinois children will be afforded health insurance. An additional 3.8 million children nationwide will be covered. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this vital piece of legislation. It is imperative that we continue to look out for the future health and well-being of this Nation, and that starts with our children today.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (OPPOSING ASSASSINATION OF LEBANESE PUBLIC FIGURES -- (House of Representatives - September 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 548, a resolution expressing the continued concern that we as a Congress and as a Nation have for the Lebanese people and their government. 
   The Cedar Revolution in 2005 led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces that had occupied Lebanon for more than three decades. After the withdrawal, the government of Prime Minister Fuad Siniora committed to creating a strong, democratic Lebanon, free of occupation or outside influence. Lebanon is fighting many enemies of freedom, both within and outside the country. 
   We have all seen the horrific news reports of the assassinations and attempted assassinations of anti-Syrian lawmakers in Lebanon, the most recent occurring just last week. The brave men and women who are struggling to move Lebanon forward have become targets in their own country. Hezbollah and other pro-Syrian factions in Lebanon know that they are in the minority, and have begun a desperation campaign to kill as many of their opponents as possible. Members of the Parliament have had to go into hiding outside of Lebanon, and lay their lives on the line when they return to conduct government business. 
   As Lebanon prepares for presidential elections this November, I believe it is vital that we reiterate our support for Lebanon and her people. H. Res. 548 reaffirms our support of the many United Nations resolutions that condemn Syria and Iran for their continued roles in arming the enemies of a free Lebanon, and expresses our appreciation to the many countries that have contributed funding and personnel to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFL). Our Lebanese friends must know that we stand beside them as they continue to strengthen their government and bring to justice those responsible for the killings. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important resolution.

   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Speaker Pelosi for naming the first African American woman to be Clerk of the House of Representatives. And in doing so, I want to recognize the outstanding service of one Karen Haas. 
   Mr. Speaker, the reason I want to do this is because earlier on in her career, Karen and I both worked for then-Republican leader Bob Michel, and she was one of three or four people that ran the leader's office and did an extraordinary job. She then came to work for Speaker Hastert and had the assignment of trying to find people who could keep this House under control. And because of her extraordinary skill and abilities, Speaker Hastert appointed her Clerk of the House, which is an impossible job because she has to put up with all of us, and she also has to keep the House running. 
   She is an enormously talented woman and has done a great, great job for those of us who serve in the House. Tomorrow is her last day as Clerk of the House, and I thank all of you for giving her a standing ovation for a job well done.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (REAFFIRMING SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF LEBANON UNDER PRIME MINISTER FOUAD SINIORA -- (House of Representatives - May 20, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution and ask all Members to support the resolution. 
   I want to compliment Chairman Berman and Chairman Ackerman and Ranking Member Manzullo for their leadership in bringing this very important resolution to the House floor. 
   No one has suffered more in the Middle East than the small country of Lebanon, caught in the crossfire of many different attacks from many different forces, not the least of which is Hezbollah. This resolution reaffirms the House's strong support for the legitimate democratically elected government, expresses sympathy to the people of Lebanon and condolences to those in Lebanon who have been displaced, injured, and lost relatives as a result of Hezbollah's violent action. 
   It urges the U.S. Government and the international community to immediately take all appropriate actions to support and strengthen the legitimate Government of Lebanon under the extraordinary leadership of Prime Minister Siniora, condemns Hezbollah and its state sponsors, Iran and Syria, for its efforts to undermine the Lebanese Government, including from approximately May 5-12, fomenting riots, blocking roads, seizing buildings, seizing control of West Beirut, and engaging in sectarian fighting in much of Lebanon. 
   The resolution demands that Hezbollah, as a first step toward total disarmament, immediately cease its attacks and withdraw from all areas in Lebanon that it has occupied. 
   The resolution urges the U.N. Security Council to condemn Iran and Syria for their violations of multiple UNSC resolutions and to sanction those nations by banning air traffic between Iran and Lebanon and between Iran and Syria. It urges every country controlling possible transit routes between Iran and Lebanon to impose strict controls to prevent Iran from arming Hezbollah. And it urges the European Union to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist group. This is a very good resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, as someone who has traveled to Lebanon 12 out of the 14 years that I've been a Member of the House, I can tell you that Lebanon is caught in a very, very difficult situation. 
   I want to give credit, also, to President Bush and Secretary Rice for the interest that they've taken in Lebanon. More recently, the President was in the Middle East and spoke out in defense of Lebanon and calling on those countries, including the group Hezbollah, to cease and desist from their activity that they're participating in in this small country. I compliment President Bush and Secretary Rice for their involvement and their encouragement to the country of Lebanon and to the leaders that they met with most recently to become more involved in trying to help solve the problem and detach Hezbollah from the kind of hold that they have on the country. 
   One other thing, Mr. Speaker, I'd like to also encourage the Parliament in Lebanon, who have the responsibility for electing a president and have not taken on that responsibility, and given the fact that the Office of President of Lebanon has been vacant for a number of months, I call on the Parliament of Lebanon to convene themselves and elect a president. This would send a very strong message around the region and around the world that Lebanon is a country that can stand on its own and stand up to these terrorist groups if it has the help from other countries. 
   So I encourage the Speaker of the Parliament in Lebanon to take on the responsibility to call the Lebanese Parliament into session and to elect a president. I think it would be a very, very important move. 
   Again, I thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their interest in the country of Lebanon and the way that they have struck a very strong cord against Hezbollah and their activities in Lebanon. I urge all Members to support the resolution.

   I know of your deep interest in the country, and I know that you've traveled there. 
   The one thing, Mr. Speaker, that I would say to the gentleman is that Prime Minister Siniora did not turn a blind eye on a number of occasions when the bombing was taking place. He called for a cessation of the bombing in the southern part of the country; so I want to be sure the record is clear on this.

   Mr. LaHOOD. I don't want to belabor this to my friend from Ohio, Mr. Speaker, but I want to say this: I visited right after the bombing stopped in the southern part of Lebanon. I visited there, Mr. Speaker, with some other Members of Congress, and I can tell you this: The Siniora government and all government officials decried very much what was happening in the southern part of the country and asked the United States to help in this instance to raise an enormous amount of money to help rebuild the southern part of the country. And President Bush got on the telephone, Mr. Speaker, talked to a number of countries, raised an enormous amount of money, billions of dollars. Siniora, the Prime Minister, went to France and actually met with leaders and raised an enormous amount of money. 
   The country of Lebanon, the Prime Minister of Lebanon, has encouraged the kind of involvement of our country to help raise money to rebuild the south and also to say to those who have taken a place in the country for no other good but to disrupt the country that this is not the kind of activity that they want. 
   And so we do disagree on this, Mr. Speaker, and I do disagree with the gentleman from Ohio. We need to speak out. That's what this resolution does. It speaks out about a group of people in Lebanon whose only goal is to disrupt the country and to try to take over, for no good, and that's why this resolution is well drafted and well written.

But I urge the House to support this resolution because for one of the few times that I've been here in 14 years, it really sets out, I think, the right language that we, as the House of Representatives, want to send as a message to the Prime Minister of Lebanon and to a group there that wants to hurt the country and hurt the people in the country and have set on a course to do that.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank both gentlemen for the time. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1483, legislation to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act to establish six new national heritage areas, including one running through my own congressional district known as the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area. 
   Mr. Speaker, I believe the establishment of heritage areas provides us with a unique opportunity to take a closer look at some of the most culturally significant areas of our country. As a former school teacher, I believe very strongly in the need to study the past in order to understand how we got to where we are today. Many of the issues that shaped President Lincoln's legacy are still relevant today, and it's worthwhile to continue to explore these issues. The establishment of the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area within this bill would accomplish these goals. 
   The purpose of creating this national heritage area in Illinois is to manage, study and promote Lincoln-related historical sites. Scattered throughout the central Illinois landscape are countless places where Lincoln traveled and lived. As children, we're taught the basic history of our country, including the basic facts of President Lincoln's life and legacy. What the history books usually don't teach are the experiences and events that shaped President Lincoln and made him the man he became. By designating this heritage area, we can tie these many Lincoln sites together in order to create a tapestry that will allow us to better understand the influences that shaped President Lincoln's life. 
   During my time in Congress, I've had the unique honor of representing all 11 counties that originally formed Abraham Lincoln's congressional district when he served one term in this very House. The year 2009 represents the 200th anniversary of President Lincoln's birth, and as the cochair of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission, which is in charge of celebrating this event, what better way to honor one of the most prominent figures in American history who affected millions of lives than preserving and studying further those places where he lived and worked and that had a profound effect on his later life. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, as it will lead to an opportunity for all in Illinois and all in our country to really have a better understanding of President Lincoln. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1483, legislation to amend the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act to establish six new national heritage areas, including one running through my own district known as the Abraham Lincoln National Heritage Area.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (LANE EVANS POST OFFICE BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - January 29, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Hare for reintroducing this bill. 
   Last year, when Congressman Evans announced that he was leaving the House because of his very debilitating illness, Parkinson's disease, I introduced a bill, along with the rest of my  colleagues from Illinois, to name the post office in Rock Island in honor of Lane. I did that because I met Lane Evans when he was a young, energetic, enthusiastic young man in 1982 running for Congress. 
   At the time, I happened to be working for the sitting Congressman from that district, a fellow by the name of Congressman Tom Railsback. It was Lane's good fortune that Mr. Railsback lost his primary to a very conservative Republican, and that opened the opportunity, as Phil knows, for Lane to win that seat that had been held for a long, long time by Republicans. 
   Since the time that Lane Evans was elected to Congress, he has distinguished himself with really three particular groups of people in the 17th District. He has been a voice for those people, particularly, in the 17th District who might not have had a voice here in Washington; and I speak of senior citizens who he is beloved by. I speak of veterans who he is equally beloved by, and I speak of the hardworking men and women, the blue-collar workers of the 17th District. Those are the people that Lane Evans truly represented in Washington, D.C., in a way that distinguished his career for 24 years here in the House, but, more importantly, back in the western part of Illinois in a way that I think will not be replicated. 
   Lane was probably one of the hardest-working congressmen, but he is someone who never forgot where he came from. He grew up in Rock Island. He was educated, at least his undergraduate degree, in Rock Island; and he continued to travel back and forth to his district every weekend. That is what made him so popular. 
   When people would come to me and talk to me about the idea of running against Lane as a Republican, I have told people the story that I think there are some people in politics that are impossible to beat, and Lane Evans was one of those people.     
   The only way that Lane would ever leave this place would be voluntarily, which he did at the end of the last term. But it was because of his hard work and his dedication to senior citizens, to veterans and to hardworking blue-collar people in the western part of Illinois that made him a politician and a public servant that set the highest standard possible, a standard that all of us can look to in doing our work. 
   So the least we can do today is name the post office in Rock Island in his honor. I am sure there will be many other honors bestowed upon him. I don't know if Lane is watching this from a television in his home in Moline; but if he is, I want him to know this is one Republican in the House that has great admiration and great respect for him because of the work that he did, and because of the way he represented people from western Illinois. 
   We wish him Godspeed. We wish him good health. We want him to know that he is in our thoughts and prayers today as we vote on the bill to honor him, but we will long remember his distinguished service and long continue to pray that he will have the healing hand of God placed on his shoulder.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1591. 
   The bill is a bonanza for numerous factions of the majority party and many special interest groups. You want an increase in the minimum wage? If you pass this bill, it is done. You want agricultural disaster relief that occurred more than 2 years ago? You pass this bill, it gets done. You want billions of dollars for homeland security initiatives without going through the regular process? Pass this bill, and it is done. 
   Let me be clear, I supported an increase in the minimum wage, and I  supported it in the appropriations committee last year. I have voted to support relief for our farmers, and I do believe we have to increase our ability to secure airports and our ports, but not through this bill. 
   I do want to say a word of support and thanks to Chairman Murtha and Chairman Obey for highlighting Walter Reed and sending a message that we are not going to close the hospital. We are going to keep it open. We are going to fix it up. We are going to provide the money. That was an important provision in this bill. 
   I have constituents who are leaving Illinois shortly and will soon be back in harm's way. I have never voted against legislation that provided funding for them to safely execute their missions. I trust they recognize what is happening here tonight. They know that we will always work to give them the resources they need, but we will not undercut their efforts by telling our enemies that the United States does not have the fortitude nor the political will to continue our support for the Iraqi people and their government. 
   What is the benefit to giving our enemies a troop withdrawal date that they can circle on their calendar? Why would we give them the aid and comfort of knowing that if they continue their attacks for just 11 more months, the U.S. military will leave Iraq, and it will be under their control? 
   We must pass a clean supplemental that is focused on meeting military needs. We must quit. We must quit being 435 Commanders in Chief and allowing our military leaders on the ground in Iraq to continue to use their skills and expertise to prosecute the war free of political interference. We must acknowledge that the needs of our men and women in uniform are more important than deals made here, campaign sound bites and political grandstanding. We must remember those who sacrificed so much for this war effort and allow their fellow soldiers to continue the mission. 
   We have a job to do here. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bloated, misguided bill and return our focus to where it should have been all along, the needs of our troops.  
   Even with $25 billion in extraneous, non-emergency spending added to sweeten the pot, a big problem remains. You can dress it up all you want, but Members, regardless of party affiliation, know a bad bill when they see it. Leadership may be able to lard up this bill to gain votes, but apparently it hasn't been enough because they still don't have the votes. 
   I am very disappointed, but not surprised, that really surprised, that we are operating here today under a closed rule. I know Members of both parties would like to be able to offer amendments to try to salvage this legislation, but too many arms have been twisted and too many promises have been made to allow any changes now. One amendment passes, and the whole bill unravels. Apparently, one vote, up or down, is all you get when you consider a $125 billion package. 
   Let me be clear. I support an increase in the minimum wage. I support providing relief to farmers when disaster strikes. I support increased funding to improve the airport security process. However, none of these things is worth my supporting a bill that I truly believe will put the lives of our troops in danger. 
   During the Appropriations Committee markup of this bill last week, Chairman Murtha included in his Manager's amendment the text of my amendment that prohibits the use of funds to close the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I am grateful for his assistance about this issue that I consider to be vital to the care of our returning wounded military personnel. But even the inclusion of my own amendment in this bill is not enough to make me hold our troops in combat hostage to political grandstanding. 
   It is unconscionable to me that this House assumes that we can manage the war better than our military leaders. We cannot stand here in the protected environment of the House Chamber and tie the hands of our President and our combatant commanders on the ground in Iraq. We cannot promise our troops the operational money they need to safely do their jobs while announcing their withdrawal date to our enemies. Congress cannot and must not micromanage the war effort. 
   I have constituents who are leaving Illinois shortly and will soon be back in harm's way. I have never voted against any legislation that provided funding for them to safely execute their missions. I trust that they recognize what is happening here today. They know that I will always work to give them the resources they need, but I will not undercut their efforts by telling our enemies that the United States does not have the fortitude or political will to continue our support for the Iraqi people and their new government. 
   What is the benefit to giving our enemies a troop withdrawal date that they can circle on a calendar? Why would we give them the aid and comfort of knowing that if they continue their attacks for just 11 more months, the U.S. military will leave and Iraq will be theirs to control? 
   If enough votes are gained and enough arms are twisted and this legislation reaches the President's desk, he will veto it, with my strong support. Our troops will suffer while the majority continues to try to unite their deeply divided caucus. Our troops will continue their missions as best they can, but how long do you plan on making them wait for the funding they need? 
   We must pass a clean supplemental that focuses on meeting military needs. We must quit trying to be 435 Commanders-in-Chief and allow our military leaders on the ground in Iraq to continue to use their skill and expertise to prosecute the war, free of political interference. We must acknowledge that the needs of our men and women in uniform are more important than backroom deals, campaign sound bites, and political grandstanding. We must remember those who sacrificed so much for this war effort and allow their fellow soldiers to continue their mission. 
   We have a job to do here. I urge my colleagues to vote against this bloated, misguided bill and return our focus to where it should have been all along: the needs of our troops.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (QUESTION OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. I thank my friend for yielding. 
   Congressman DOC HASTINGS is one of the most respected Members of the House of Representatives. And RAY LAHOOD doesn't have to say that. I am saying it. But the people of his district have said it on seven different occasions. It is called an election. An election is a referendum on one's service. And no one has served for the last 14 years in his district better than he has. And the people have said that. 
   When a letter like this from the chairman of the Ethics Committee is disclosed publicly, it gets on the front page of DOC HASTINGS' hometown newspaper. And it plants a seed in the minds of the people who have sent him here on seven different occasions that he may have done something wrong, that he may have violated the rules. 
   And the truth is DOC HASTINGS has violated no rules. He has done nothing wrong. He hasn't violated any rules of the House. He has been on the Ethics Committee, when I asked him how long he has been on, he said too long, but I believe he has been on 6 years. It's the hardest committee to serve on. It's the hardest committee to find Members to serve on, because of decisions you have to make against your colleagues. 
   And for one member, particularly the Chair of the committee, to try and impugn his motives or to suggest that he violated the rules is simply wrong. And hopefully that wrong can be righted today during this 1 hour of his opportunity to try and regain his reputation in the House of Representatives. 
   There's a saying where I come from, once you tar and feather someone, you can never get the tar off. What happened here with the disclosure of this letter, made public in DOC's district, is that he will always have a little bit of this tar on him, that somehow he might have violated the rules. That's wrong, folks. What good is it for us to trash one another? What good is it for the institution to try and criticize someone for no other good than to try and make a point on a piece of legislation that your side of the aisle wanted to pass. 
   I believe that the chairwoman of the Ethics Committee owes DOC HASTINGS an apology for trying to besmirch and impugn his integrity and his honesty and his service on the Ethics Committee and in the House of Representatives. If the chairwoman, Mr. Speaker, would be willing to do that, it might get on page 40 of his local newspaper. It won't be on page 1 the way the headlines read today. We owe it to DOC HASTINGS, to the people that sent him here, to do this for him. 
   And if I can be so bold, Mr. Speaker, I would also suggest that because of the threat that was made in the last paragraph of the letter, that perhaps the chairwoman, in the event that Representative Hastings would do this again that she might file charges against him, that we need a new chairperson of the Ethics Committee. Because I think when you use your position as the Chair of the Ethics Committee to threaten a member of the committee, you not only owe that member an apology, you need to take a different place on that committee. You can't use that kind of power against a member of the committee. That is wrong, Mr. Speaker. That hurts the whole House. It hurts Congressman Hastings. It hurts the people that sent him here. We need to do better in this House. We do no good by trashing one another, by besmirching and trying to discredit people who come here to serve honestly, with integrity, by the rules. The rules have not been broken. There is nothing in the memo that was disclosed that has anything to do with another Member, anything to do with any investigation. It was information to be shared with Members about a piece of legislation that some of us thought was pretty bad. And apparently people on that side of the aisle didn't want your Members to have it. So you put out a letter discrediting the ranking member of the committee. That is wrong. 
   And so I encourage, Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House to find a different place for the Chair of the Committee on Ethics and to ask the Chair of the Committee on Ethics to apologize to Mr. Hastings so he can have some semblance of his reputation, one of honesty and integrity and hard work for 14 years on behalf of the people of the State of Washington.

<DOCNO>Mr. LAHOOD. (FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS, FISCAL YEAR 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that it is in the best interest of the country to play the blame game on how we reached the current appropriations situation. The fact of the matter is that the 109th Congress did not get its work done on time, and we are here today to correct that problem. Before we vote on this bill, I feel compelled to make a couple of observations. First and foremost, I want to thank Mr. Obey and his staff for the hard work that they have put into this bill. Mr. Obey faced an enormous task, and I believe that no matter how hard he tried, it would be impossible to address all of the funding needs. 
   However, I am concerned that despite all the rhetoric that the majority would work with the minority in crafting legislation, this bill was put together in the back room by the House and Senate majority, with little to no input from the minority. In addition, when discussing the nature of the CR, the majority stressed that this bill would not contain any earmarks. Yet, after negotiations were completed between the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, it appears that this bill will continue to fund a limited number of earmarks championed by the Senate. While these earmarks are technical in nature, and the case can be made that they should not be considered earmarks, the fact of the matter is that they are earmarks, and I believe that it is wrong for us to stand up and claim that this bill does not contain earmarks when it does. 
   Given that we are operating under a closed rule, and that it us unlikely that the Senate will remove their earmarks, I am resigned to the fact that it is unlikely that we will have an opportunity to change this legislation. Had we operated under regular order, I believe that a bipartisan Appropriations committee could have crafted a more balanced bill, which I would have been willing to support.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 14, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution. More importantly, I rise today to express my support for our Commander in Chief and the men and women serving in the Armed Forces. It is simply not possible to claim that you support the troops while completely disavowing their mission. 
   Our troops in Iraq put their mission first, above all else, even their own safety. How can we even consider passing a resolution stating that we do not support providing them the manpower that they need to accomplish their mission? How does this support the morale? How does this show them that we have confidence in their abilities? 
   As we all know, this resolution has no real legal authority, it is preemptive, purely political, without taking the difficult step of offering an alternative proposal. At first I thought this debate was simply political theater, 3 days of speeches and sound bites. 
   But now we are learning this resolution is simply the first step. The gentleman from Virginia quoted in The Washington Post yesterday, saying: This is just the bark, this resolution is the bark, the real bite will be in 2 weeks when they trot out a continuing resolution or appropriation bill that will cut off the funds to the troops. 
   I hope you are all relishing the opportunity to support that appropriation to cut off the troops. This is the bark. The next the step is to cut off the funds. 
   I supported the original resolution authorizing force. I have served on the Intelligence Committee for 8 years, and I believe we have done the right thing. I believe our troops have done the right thing. 
   Saddam is gone. He has been tried and executed; 12 million Iraqis, over 70 percent of the people, have voted for their own leadership. The army and the police are being trained. Schools and hospitals are being built and opened. Coalition forces have done the best they can under extraordinary circumstances. 
   Iraqis need to continue to take control of the security. And in every discussion we have had with the Commander in Chief, he has been on the phone talking to the Prime Minister, persuading him that the American people are becoming impatient, that he has to take control of his government, he has to stand up an army, he has to stand up a police force. 
   I believe the Commander in Chief, the President, will hold the Prime Minister's feet to the fire and hold the Iraqi Government accountable so that they can begin to take full control of the responsibilities. 
   I think when that happens we will have achieved a great deal. I will not vote for this resolution that does nothing but show our enemies that the House of Representatives does not support our military. This ignores the more than 3,100 men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. We turn our backs on the 3,100 when we pass a resolution like this.     
   And we also turn our backs on those that are doing the hard work in Iraq today. When I have had opportunities to visit those who have served from my district, who have come back, I have not heard one word of complaining, not one word of whining, no wringing of hands, only an opportunity to serve. 
   And so I urge my colleagues to stand up for the troops, stand up for the military, stand up for those who have done the hard work. Stand up for those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Vote down this resolution and send the message that we stand with those who stand for freedom and hope and opportunity.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (THANKING MR. BEN SOLOMON FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE -- (House of Representatives - December 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of a grateful House to say farewell to Ben Solomon. Ben is the manager of the Longworth convenience store, and we want to thank him for his 4 years of outstanding service to the United States House of Representatives. 
   Employed for over 19 years by Guest Services, Incorporated, Ben's assignment to run the Longworth convenience store began on December 15, 2003. Since that time, he has endeared himself to Members, House staff, and visitors. 
   Ben has been nicknamed Mr. Mayor of Longworth Main Street because of his unwavering commitment to serve the needs of every customer to the fullest extent possible no matter who they are or their political affiliation. To Ben, all politics was local. He always greeted every customer warmly with his ever present smile and a kind word. Most of the 1,000 or so customers who pass through the store daily are greeted by name. His positive outlook never fails to make even strangers feel welcome. 
   Ben can be proud of the level of service he provided to his customers each and every day. He viewed his work as a sacred duty, and felt no job was too small for him to do. He could be seen in the hallway working alongside his employees unpacking boxes of merchandise. At the same time, Ben would take the time to pause and say hello to any number of many familiar customers as they passed by the store. Ben brought a unique brand of sincerity and dedication to his job every single day. It is marvelous to look at each nook and cranny of the store shelves at the many unique and interesting things Ben would stock because one of his customers asked for it at an earlier visit. 
   On behalf of the entire House community, we bid a fond farewell to our friend, Ben Solomon, and extend our deepest appreciation for his dedication and outstanding contributions to the House of Representatives. We wish him well. We wish him success in his future endeavors. He will sincerely be missed by all. 
   We are also grateful to all those who serve in this great House, service to many of us in so many different ways, and especially honor Ben this evening.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING SYRIA'S CONTINUED INTERFERENCE IN THE AFFAIRS OF LEBANON -- (House of Representatives - October 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for his kind remarks. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 738, a resolution that strongly condemns the ongoing campaign of violence and assassination directed towards the people of Lebanon and their democratically elected government. 
   We have all seen the horrific news reports of the assassinations and attempted assassinations of anti-Syrian lawmakers in Lebanon. The brave men and women who are struggling to move Lebanon forward have become targets in their own country. Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian factions in Lebanon know they are in the minority, and have begun a desperation campaign to kill as many of their opponents as possible. Members of the parliament have had to go into hiding outside of Lebanon, and lay their lives on the line when they return to conduct government business. 
   Others in Lebanon have embarked on a campaign to delay and obstruct the presidential election process, now delayed since September, late September into October. Rather than face the fact that those who wish for Lebanon to be independent and free will be successful, they choose instead to upend the entire political process rather than see democracy succeed. This was clearly evident in 2004 when the current president of Lebanon had his term extended with the help of Syria and other outside forces, an act that was quickly condemned by the United States and the United Nations. Unfortunately, these forces continue to try to impose their will on Lebanon today. 
   The Cedar Revolution in 2005 led to the withdrawal of Syrian forces that had occupied Lebanon for more than three decades. After the withdrawal, the government of Prime Minister Siniora committed to creating a strong, democratic Lebanon, free of occupation or outside influence. Lebanon is fighting many enemies of freedom, both within and outside the country. 
   As Lebanon prepares for presidential elections, hopefully in a few weeks, I believe it is vital that we reiterate our support for Lebanon and the people of Lebanon. This resolution reaffirms our support of the many United Nations resolutions that condemn Syria and Iran for their continued roles in arming the enemies of a free Lebanon, and expresses our appreciation to the many countries who have contributed funding and personnel to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. 
   Our Lebanese friends must know that we stand beside them as they continue to strengthen their government. I want to particularly compliment President Bush, Secretary Rice, and the whole Bush team for the interest they have expressed in Lebanon, for the interest they have shown in this country and their ability to have a democracy and to hold elections. 
   Last week, the son of Rafiq Hariri was in Washington and had an opportunity to meet with many officials of the Congress and of the Bush administration. I know he was gratified by the support he has received from Congress and from the Bush administration. As he returned to Lebanon, I know he went reassured that our country is with Lebanon, that our country is for free elections as soon as possible. 
   I also want to compliment Speaker Pelosi who has personally discussed this issue with me and has a great deal of interest in Lebanon, and recently took the time to travel to Lebanon on a recent trip to the Middle East. Her interest in this country is something that we should all commend. And so I urge the adoption of this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (SELECT INTELLIGENCE OVERSIGHT PANEL -- (House of Representatives - January 09, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Dreier for yielding to me. 
   I find it a little puzzling that the author of this legislation has continued to refer to it during his remarks as a ``task force.'' I see no language in the legislation that was authored by the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee that calls for a task force. 
   I think it is also puzzling, too, that that term has been entered into the RECORD, which can be found nowhere in the legislation. I also think it is peculiar that the gentleman from Florida, who has served with me now for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee, would be willing to create more bureaucracy. 
   The gentleman knows full well we need no more bureaucracy to bog down the intelligence community. We have sat there time after time and listened to people from the intelligence community come to our committee. We need no more bureaucracy. 
   And you know as well as I do, it takes 4 to 5 years for people on the committee to understand the terms and the agencies. And now you are going to create another level that has to educate all of these people to get up to speed? Come on, Mr. Hastings. You know better. And to have this committee or task force, I don't know which, appointed by only the Speaker of the House is unprecedented. It means that our leader has no say in who is appointed to this task force or committee. Unprecedented. You would never stand for that. Mr. Obey and Mr. Hastings, you would be up here screaming bloody murder if we tried to pull that stunt on you. 
   This is not fair. It is not right. Our side should have our say. This is an insult to the gentleman sitting on that side of the Chamber, Mr. Murtha, and the gentleman sitting on that side of the Chamber, Mr. Young, who have overseen as representatives as the once chairman and now chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. You don't have faith in them? You don't think they can look over the intelligence budget? I do not know about you, Mr. Murtha, but I suspect you have some doubts. I know Mr. Young does. This is an insult to both of you and to the Appropriations Committee and to the Defense Subcommittee. Do these gentlemen need oversight? No, they don't. 
   Vote against this lousy bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, the gentleman from California, TOM LANTOS.  
   Our Nation has lost a true leader, and the world has lost its foremost champion of human rights. While involved in many different issues throughout his illustrious career, it is TOM LANTOS' work on behalf of suffering people throughout the world that best exemplifies the type of man he was. 
   Born on February 1, 1928 in Budapest to Jewish parents, TOM LANTOS faced unspeakable horror early in his life. He escaped a Nazi forced labor camp twice, the second time thankfully finding himself under the protection of Raoul Wallenberg, likely saving his life. He later learned that his parents and much of his family perished at the hands of the Nazis. 
   As the only survivor of the Holocaust serving in the House, he understood, in a way no one else could, the type of suffering man can inflict upon others. He was the founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, and truly was a leader in standing up for the smallest and weakest in our global community. No injustice escaped his attention, no matter what corner of the world was involved, and he would fight doggedly to right any wrongs. 
   He earned an academic scholarship that brought him to the United States, where he earned his bachelor's, master's and eventually doctorate degrees and entered the world of academia, before he decided to enter the political arena, serving 14 terms here in the House. He rose through the ranks to become the distinguished chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a position that allowed him to continue his battle for the common man who might otherwise not have a voice. 
   I was fortunate to have the opportunity to travel with him and his wife Annette on a trip to South Korea, Cambodia, and Vietnam in January, 2001, hosted by then-Minority Leader Gephardt. I am proud to call him not only my colleague, but also my friend. 
   I join with all of my colleagues in extending our thoughts and prayers to TOM's bride of almost 58 years, Annette, his two daughters, his 17 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. He will truly be missed.

<DOCNO>Mr. LaHOOD. (SOLEMNLY COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE TRAGIC OCTOBER 1983 TERRORIST BOMBING OF THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BARRACKS IN BEIRUT, LEBANON -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution, a similar resolution of which I introduced at the suggestion of the ranking member of the Rules Committee, DAVID DREIER. He spoke to me about this and suggested that this type of resolution be considered by the House. I want to thank the majority leader for scheduling this resolution to commemorate and honor those who lost their lives in Beirut, Lebanon, during the bombing that took place. 
   I also want to thank my classmate and friend, WALTER JONES, for his leadership in introducing this resolution. I rise today to honor the United States Marines and other servicemembers who were killed in the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 23, 1983. 
   On this day at approximately 6:20 a.m., a delivery truck carrying explosives drove through the gates into one of the barracks buildings and the explosives were detonated. This day was the deadliest for the United States Marine Corps since the battle of Iwo Jima during World War II; 241 servicemen and women were killed and many others were wounded. 
   The servicemen and women serving in Beirut who were killed had been sent to serve as peacekeepers during the 15-year civil war in Lebanon. Throughout the time U.S. forces were in Lebanon, there were many instances in which American lives were lost. In April of 1983, a similar suicide bombing occurred at the United States Embassy killing 60 people, predominantly embassy staff and U.S. Marines. President Reagan called this act ``a vicious terrorist bombing'' and reiterated the United States' commitment to peace in the region. As a Nation, we would not let such actions deter us from our goal. 
   The fight against terrorism still continues today. Brave members of the Armed Forces risk their lives every day in an effort to bring an end to such attacks. While we take this time to honor those who were killed in Beirut, we also rededicate our country to the fight against terrorism. It is our hope that such despicable acts can be prevented, not only just in Lebanon but also in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and throughout the rest of the world. Progress has been made in Lebanon and progress towards peace will continue throughout the region. 
   Today the Members of the House of Representatives and the rest of the Nation join the families of these 241 fallen servicemembers to mourn their loss. We remember the courage of these Marines and other servicemembers who willingly put their lives on the line in order to serve their country and promote peace and security throughout the world. Our heartfelt prayers and sympathies go out to these families. Nearly 25 years after this terrible tragedy, we remember these brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice. 
   During the 14 years that I have had the privilege of serving in the House of Representatives, I have made 13 trips to Lebanon. During the first time that I went there, there was a travel ban: the airport was closed, people were restricted from traveling. We've made great progress in the last 14 years. Great progress. 
   A great deal of the credit really goes to the people and the leadership of the country but also to President Bush and Secretary Rice for taking a great deal of interest in this country and not being dissuaded by terrorist attacks and not being dissuaded by those who would have our men and women in harm's way. They have helped rebuild the country both politically and economically. 
   One of the saddest events that took place in the country 2 years ago was the assassination of the then Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri. There is an investigation going on in that. He was a true leader in the country. Since that time, there has continued to be progress being made in the country. 
   As a matter of fact, President Bush will welcome the President of Lebanon tomorrow at the White House, the first time in the memory of many that the President of Lebanon will be coming to the United States and actually having a visit with President Bush and the Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. This is an extraordinary event for the country of Lebanon, for the people of Lebanon, for those of us in this country who have worked very hard to develop the kind of relationship with their government and our government. We're delighted that the new President of Lebanon will be visiting Washington and visiting President Bush. 
   We've made progress, and we've made that progress through the great sacrifice of our men and women who serve in the Embassy in Lebanon and the men and women who sacrificed their lives during the time of the attack 25 years ago. So it's very fitting today that we not only recognize their families and those but we recognize the fact that our government leaders have reached out to this small country in a way that has enabled us to make great progress.
