<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (GIVE ARKANSAS WHAT THEY DESERVE: A VOTE ON ENERGY -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, frustration is mounting in the Third District of Arkansas because of the high cost of gasoline. This stack of e-mails which I have with me is just a small portion of the comments my constituents have sent me. And several of them have offered their own ideas of what needs to be done to resolve this energy dilemma and help increase the American energy supply and provide relief at the pump. 
   The ideas they've proposed are ones we've heard before: We need to increase our production of American energy in a clean, efficient way through wind, solar and hydrogen, as well as tapping into the vast majority of natural resources we have available. 
   I agree with my constituents that we need to use an ``all of the above'' energy strategy. That's why I cosponsored the American Energy Act. This encompasses the ideas many of my constituents have been writing me about, increasing our American-made energy supply in an environmentally friendly way, encouraging energy conservation, and promoting renewable and alternative energy technology. We need to act.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF AUGUST 2008 AS ``NATIONAL HEAT STROKE AWARENESS MONTH'' -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 296, which expresses the sense of Congress that August should be designated as Heat Stroke Awareness Month, which will provide opportunities to educate parents, educators, and athletes about heat stroke, and prevent future deaths. 
   On August 7, 1995, 13-year-old Kendrick Fincher of Rogers, Arkansas was at football practice for the Elmwood Riders when he experienced heat stroke. After 18 days in intensive care at Children's Hospital in Little Rock, Arkansas, Kendrick died from complications of heat stroke. I was on the school board in Rogers during this time, and this truly was a terrible tragedy for our community. 
   Since then, Kendrick's parents, Mike and Rhonda Fincher, have committed themselves to ensuring that no other  parent has to experience the heartache of a very preventable death. They established the Kendrick Fincher Memorial Foundation to make certain children have proper hydration during athletic activities and that they have squeeze bottles with them at all events. Because of their dedicated work, procedures have been changed in sports programs at the local schools to help prevent a similar accident. 
   In addition, Gatorade and the National Football League have worked with the foundation to lead a nationwide Beat the Heat campaign aimed at educating parents and football coaches about the importance of hydration in order to keep athletes safe in the hot summer months. 
   This resolution also recognizes the Kendrick Fincher Memorial Foundation for all of its efforts in promoting awareness about heat stroke, and it encourages other national and community organizations to get involved in this important fight. 
   I would also like to thank Chairman Dingell, Ranking Member Barton, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Terry for their help in bringing this forward now as we go into August during the season when, as we are experiencing today, these things are very, very possible. I appreciate them bringing it in a timely fashion, and I encourage my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 296.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of J. Fred Patton, a gracious contributor to the Third District of Arkansas, who passed away earlier this week. 
   For more than 101 years, Mr. Patton showed passion for Arkansas through his compassion for neighbors, community service and education that he provided for future Arkansans. He authored ``The History of Fort Smith,'' now in its seventh edition, and taught Sunday school for more than six decades. 
   Throughout his life, Mr. Patton received numerous professional, civic and humanitarian awards, including the honor of being selected as one of 10 outstanding citizens in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma in 1989. I had the privilege to meet and get to know Fred over the years, and he truly was an amazing person who wanted the best for his community. 
   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Patton certainly will be missed. However, his legacy will live on for generations to come. I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to celebrate and honor the life of this wonderful man.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (PASSING ALONG CONCERNS OF HIGH FUEL PRICES FROM ARKANSAS' THIRD DISTRICT RESIDENTS -- (House of Representatives - July 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, I spent an afternoon at JV Manufacturing in Springdale, Arkansas, listening to hardworking Arkansans talk about how the high price of gas is affecting their families. I promised them that I would bring their stories back to Washington and that I would put pressure on Congress to enact a commonsense energy policy that would help lower what they're forced to pay at the pump. 
   Arkansans are paying an average of $4 per gallon, and many families in my district are having a hard time just making ends meet at all as all of their disposable income is going straight into the gas tank. Now is the time for this Congress to act. Let me mention a couple of stories that I heard, and then let me urge a few actions that we could take that would have immediate relief. 
   I met a single mom who is working full time at a good-paying job, but she is still having trouble meeting the needs of her kids and filling up the gas tank. 
   I met a family who bought a Jeep, who planned to use it for recreation, but now they can barely afford the expense of driving back and forth from work. 
   One woman told me about her husband, who is an independent owner and operator of a diesel truck, who has already spent as much on diesel in the first half of 2008 as he had spent all last year. 
   So what should Congress do? First, we need to increase the production of American energy through more energy exploration and production here at home. Congress needs to open up a small sliver of ANWR in Alaska and in the Outer Continental Shelf for energy exploration. Congress needs to encourage the construction of new refineries and of more nuclear power plants. They need to promote efficiency and new sources of American renewable energy. 
   Each of these would reduce pain at the pump. It's very important to understand that gas prices and other types of energy prices are related to each other. For example, if we want to start using more plug-in hybrids, we're going to have to increase our electricity production to charge up these electric cars. That's why it's so important to support nuclear, clean coal and alternative energy sources. 
   Also, if this Congress will take these steps, it will send an immediate signal to speculators and to other investors that we are serious about increasing production, and costs will come down in the short term as well as in the long term. We saw this when the President lifted the executive order banning offshore drilling. 
   Congress has waited too long to help provide relief to Arkansans and to the rest of the American people. We must act now and pass sensible legislation so that residents of the Third District of Arkansas don't have to choose between keeping gas in their cars and meeting the needs of their families.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (PROHIBITION ON SALE BY DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OF PARTS FOR F-14 FIGHTER AIRCRAFT -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I would like to thank Representative Giffords for her leadership on this issue, as well as Chairman Lantos for sponsoring the committee amendment clarifying the intent and impact of this legislation. 
   Earlier this year as a result of the Federal sting operation, Congress learned that Iran had illegally purchased parts for F-14 fighter planes from a U.S. military surplus store. According to investigators, the incident was just one piece of a larger ring of illegally sold military surplus parts that found their way to China and Iran. 
   The report prompted the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency to suspend sales of the F-14 components.     
   Military surplus offices are supposed to demilitarize parts, which would render them useless for military purposes. 
   They are also allowed to auction the parts but only to buyers who promise to obey U.S. arms embargoes, export controls, and other laws. That was not the case, however, with these particular F-14 parts. 
   As Members are aware, Tehran is in search of several key components for its aging fleet of F-14 Tomcat jets, which the United States sold to Iran prior to its 1979 Islamic revolution. This bill will add another layer of protection to the extensive array of export sanctions already imposed on Iran under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act and related executive orders. 
   The committee amendment recognizes these facts and adjusts the title of the bill to more accurately reflect the purpose of the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, given the clear and present danger Iran poses to the national security interests of the United States and to the broader peace and stability of the Middle East, this is an appropriate and timely measure for our consideration today. 
   I want to thank again Ms. Giffords and Mr. Pearce, and I support the adoption of the resolution.

   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.

   These unprecedented meetings are part of the CARICOM Conference on the Caribbean that will take place from June 19-21. 
   The Caribbean Community, or CARICOM, was established in 1973 to unify member countries on foreign policies and trade relations with outside states, and to improve the economic conditions of the region. 
   Fourteen member states will be represented at the meeting, which will focus on trade relations with the United States, energy cooperation, and security concerns, including small arms trafficking and counternarcotics efforts, immigration and the reintegration of the Portuguese in the region, and the prevention of HIV/AIDS. 
   There is always room to improve U.S. relations with our southern neighbors. Other such areas to be addressed during the discussions include encouraging tourism, protecting the environment, addressing energy security and renewable resources, combating the spread of infectious disease, and promoting democracy and good governance. This bill  recognizes the deep and historic ties between the people of the United States and the Caribbean, and it commends the Caribbean Community for the establishment of the first-ever conference of this kind. 
   I applaud this important step, and look forward to working with CARICOM to improve the overall relations between the U.S. Congress and our Caribbean allies.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (RECOGNIZING THE STRONG ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND THE UNITED STATES -- (House of Representatives - June 11, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this resolution, which recognizes the enduring ties of an alliance first forged over half a century ago in the crucible of the Korean War. It was heartening to see the photographs from Seoul of the thousands of South Korean citizens who gathered in a downtown plaza on June 6, Korea's memorial day, to express their support of the alliance. They waved South Korean flags and the Stars and Stripes together to show enthusiasm for the strong bonds that link our two countries. 
   Later this month, June 25, marks the 57th anniversary of the North Korean invasion across the Demilitarized Zone. This surprise attack in the early hours of a Sunday morning sought to snuff the life out of an embryonic South Korean democracy. President Harry Truman's immediate unflinching decision to come to the aid of an embattled South Korea proved that the United States would not retreat from its rendezvous with destiny. 
   Together with our South Korean and other allies, we turned the tide of war at Inchon and preserved the South Korean state, which we honor as an ally today. 
   South Korea's commitment to the alliance is seen in many ways, as in the 1,200 South Korean military personnel deployed to Iraq, which makes South Korea's contribution the third largest in the coalition contingent. There is also the $460 million which the Republic of Korea has pledged toward postwar Iraq reconstruction, and there are the close consultations we hold together in the six-party process to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. These are the actions of a true and loyal friend, for which we express our gratitude in this resolution. 
   Let me also take this opportunity to second the words of the United States forces Korea commander, General Bell, that South Korea Sergeant Yoon Jang-ho, who was South Korea's first uniformed casualty in the war on terror, was a hero. Sergeant Yoon was killed February 27 by a suicide bomber in Bagram, Afghanistan. 
   This young soldier, although born in Korea, had spent his high school and college years in Indiana, graduating from Indiana University. He returned to South Korea to complete his military service and volunteered for service in Afghanistan. His loss was deeply felt, both in his home nation of Korea and his adopted hometown of Bloomington, Indiana. 
   The shared mourning of the peoples of two nations for this valiant soldier is one more concrete indication of the ties that bind our two nations. Another, of course, is the talent and dynamism of the 2-million-strong ethnic Korean community in the United States. Los Angeles represents the largest concentrated urban center of Korean culture outside of the Korean Peninsula. For this enriching contribution to America's melting pot, we are extremely grateful. 
   I therefore urge immediate passage of this resolution which recognizes this strong and enduring alliance. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 226 recognizes American government officials who played a critical role in the creation of the War Refugee Board in an effort to help rescue Jews and other persecuted minorities during the Holocaust. 
   In the early stage of World War II, there was an extensive flow of information about the extent of Jews and other minorities being systematically murdered by the Nazi regime. 
   A heroic group of U.S. Government officials from the Treasury Department, including Secretary of the Treasurer, Henry Morganthau, as well as Joseph DuBois and John Pehle, urged President Franklin Roosevelt to take more direct and forceful action to help the victims of the Nazi atrocities. 
   President Roosevelt later signed an executive order creating the War Refugee Board. Mr. John Pehle became the executive director of the board which helped to rescue Jews and other victims of Nazi persecution and prevented thousands of people from dying in extermination camps. 
   Furthermore, the board assisted the International Red Cross to provide food and shelter to over 3 million prisoners of war. Efforts by those who worked to establish the War Refugee Board, particularly of Secretary of Treasury Henry Morganthau, Joseph DuBois, and John Pehle, were instrumental in saving thousands of lives during the Nazi extermination policy. 
   H. Res. 226 recognizes and honors these government officials for their efforts, and I urge support for this legislation.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 327, the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act as amended by the Senate. I also want to thank Mr. Boswell for his hard work in bringing this forward. 
   H.R. 327 was originally passed by the House unanimously in March. The legislation was slightly modified by the Senate to ensure that referrals for mental health counseling and treatment considered the request of the veteran concerned. 
   Preventing suicide among our veterans is a top priority of this Congress and the Nation. The Veterans Health Administration estimates there are 1,000 suicides per year among veterans receiving VA health care, and as many as 5,000 per year among all living veterans. These are alarming statistics. 
   H.R. 327, as amended, establishes requirements for a multifaceted VA suicide prevention plan that strengthens early detection measures, staff education initiatives, and counseling and treatment assistance to reach out and help at-risk veterans to prevent suicides among those who have so bravely served our Nation. 
   VA has already begun to implement a national suicide prevention lifeline as required by this legislation. The hotline became operational in July of this year. Veterans experiencing thoughts of suicide can call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) for help. The first call, according to the VA, was received on July 25. Since that time and through September 1, as a result of calls to the suicide prevention hotline, 346 callers were referred to a VA suicide prevention coordinator, and there were 56 rescues. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 327, as amended, is important legislation that responds to the need to strengthen suicide prevention, education and awareness programs within the VA. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 327, as amended. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1808, a bill to designate the VA Medical Center in Augusta, Georgia, as the ``Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center,'' would honor one of our colleagues who was taken from us all too soon. 
   Charles ``Charlie'' Whitlow Norwood, Jr., was born on July 27, 1941. A Georgia native, Charlie Norwood attended Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia, and Georgetown University in Washington, and was a dentist prior to serving in the House of Representatives. 
   Charlie Norwood served as a captain in the United States Army from 1967 to  1969, beginning with an assignment in the U.S. Army Dental Corps at Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
   In 1968, he was transferred to the medical battalion of the 173rd Airborne Brigade in Vietnam, and served a combat tour at Quin Yon, An Khe, and LZ English at Bon Son. During his tour, he participated in experimental military dental practices that are now standard procedure for the Armed Forces. In recognition of his service under combat conditions, Norwood was awarded the Combat Medical Badge and two Bronze Stars. 
   After his discharge in 1969, he remained a member of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Military Order of the World Wars until his death. 
   Mr. Speaker, Charlie Norwood served with us as a Member of Congress from January 4, 1995, until his untimely death on February 13, 2007. During his congressional career, Norwood worked to pass a patients' bill of rights aimed at giving people better access to health care and greater ability to sue insurers, and spent his life supporting the overall well-being of veterans. 
   He was quick to protect TRICARE benefits, and he cosponsored legislation to address military survivor benefit plan inequities and to improve military pay raises. He was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and for our Nation's veterans. 
   This legislation has the support of the State veteran service organizations, as well as the entire Georgia delegation. In the Senate, a companion bill has been introduced, S. 1026, which has the cosponsorship of both of the Georgia U.S. Senators. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support honoring this distinguished American by naming the VA facility in Augusta, Georgia, the Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. To honor our deceased friend and colleague in this manner is a tribute to his love of Nation and his contributions to our military and veteran community and as a Member of Congress.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2408, a bill to designate the VA outpatient clinic in Green Bay, Wisconsin as the Milo Huempfner Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic would honor an individual whose demeanor during combat in World War II exemplifies the concept of the army of one. 
   In 1944, Private First Class Huempfner was stranded in the small Belgian village of Leignon after his truck was separated from its convoy and slid off the road. While in hiding in Leignon, Private First Class Huempfner found that the village had been overrun by German troops. He proceeded, over the next 4 days and nights, to singlehandedly wage war against an entire German armored column consisting of tanks, numerous heavy gun emplacements, and hundreds of soldiers. During this period of time, Private First Class Huempfner warned off numerous American and British troops from Leignon, who otherwise would have been slaughtered by the Germans occupying the town. He repeatedly refused to be evacuated on these occasions, staying to destroy additional German equipment, killing German soldiers in direct combat, and protecting the citizens of the occupied town. 
   Mr. Speaker, on Christmas Eve, British forces dislodged German forces using information collected by Private First Class Huempfner. After over 72 hours on his feet, under constant threat and harassment from enemy forces, Private First Class Huempfner retired to a household he had earlier defended. 
   For all of these accomplishments he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1973. After the war, Private First Class Huempfner attended the funerals of as many veteran comrades as possible. Reports indicate that he participated in the burial of some 900 fellow comrades in arms over the years since World War II, attending in full dress uniform, honoring their service and repeatedly demonstrating his love for our Nation by showing the brave veterans of Brown County the dignity and respect that they had earned. He continued attending these funerals until a week before his death in October 1985. 
   Mr. Speaker, I support honoring this brave American veteran by naming this facility the Milo C. Huempfner Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic. It is a fine tribute to a true patriot and true hero.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I take great pleasure in urging my colleagues to support House Resolution 237, urging all of America to make a special effort to honor America's veterans on November 11, introduced by a veteran of the Vietnam War, the Honorable Joe Baca. 
   This resolution reminds each of us of the debt we owe to those whose sacrifices have made America the beacon of freedom throughout the world. America's holidays remind us of important events and persons in our Nation's history. It is significant that veterans are honored with two holidays that recognize the important role of those who wear the uniform.     
   Veterans have assaulted heavily defended beaches, jumped from aircraft under heavy fire, shivered in frozen foxholes, slogged through malaria-ridden jungles, and endured horrible abuses as prisoners of war. Veterans have survived incredible hardships, they have suffered wounds, and far too many have paid the ultimate price of freedom. They have often experienced long separations from families, and they serve in the outposts of freedom while their fellow citizens enjoy the fruits of everyday life in America. Each of them, from the Army or Marine infantrymen on patrol, to the sailor deep in the bowels of an aircraft carrier, to the airmen miles above the ground sets an example for the rest of us. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to recall how Veterans Day came to be. In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington  National Cemetery. This site on a hillside overlooking the Potomac River and the City of Washington became the focal point of reverence for America's veterans. Similar ceremonies occurred earlier in England and France where an unknown soldier was buried in each of the nation's highest place of honor, in England West Minster Abby, in France the Arc de Triomphe. 
   These memorial gestures all took place on November 11, giving universal recognition to the celebrated ending of World War I fighting at 11 a.m., November 11, 1918, the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. The day became known as Armistice Day. The first celebration using the term ``Veterans Day'' occurred in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1947. 
   Raymond Weeks, a World War II veteran, organized National Veterans Day, which included a parade and other festivities to honor all veterans. The event was held on November 11, then designated Armistice Day. Later, U.S. Representative Edward Rees of Kansas proposed a bill that would change Armistice Day to Veterans Day. In 1954, Congress passed the bill that President Eisenhower signed proclaiming November 11 as Veterans Day. Raymond Weeks received the Presidential Citizens Medal from President Reagan in November 1982. Weeks' local parade and ceremonies are now an annual event celebrated nationwide. 
   Mr. Speaker, I again suggest this most fitting of resolutions is worthy of unanimous support for my colleagues. As Mr. Filner said in the previous bill, we need to go further. 
   Mr. Speaker, there is no better way to honor our veterans on Veterans Day than to ensure funding for their medical care and other benefits. That is why I call on my friends on the other side of the aisle to appoint conferees for the Military Construction and VA appropriations bill. 
   We are almost a month into the new fiscal year and there is no practical reason that this bill cannot pass and become law. It won't be long before this apparent political ploy will begin to affect the care our Nation's warriors receive. Let's appoint conferees and ensure that the VA can continue to give our veterans the excellent care that they deserve. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Johnson of Van Buren, Arkansas. He has been pastor of First Assembly of God in Van Buren since June of 1980. Since then, the church has grown from over 200 at Sunday School to over 2,000, placing it among the fastest growing Sunday Schools in Arkansas and the Nation.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (CONDEMNING THE ACTIONS OF SEPTEMBER 7, 2007, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO THE VIETNAM VETERANS WAR MEMORIAL -- (House of Representatives - October 23, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 680, which condemns the actions of September 7, 2007, resulting in damage to the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial. 
   Mr. Speaker, the Vietnam Veterans War Memorial, commonly referred to as ``The Wall,'' serves as a memorial to the 2.7 million men and women in the United States Armed Forces who served in Vietnam. It is a memorial that has many different meanings to those who lived through that era and serves as an especially poignant reminder of the cost of that war and the ultimate sacrifice made in any conflict. 
   Americans come from all across the country each year to reflect on the sacrifices of the 58,256 names inscribed on the 140 panels of black granite. Whether it is a family member looking for the name of a loved one or a comrade in arms honoring a foxhole buddy or a young child searching for the name of a relative they never knew, every American who visits the wall leaves a changed person. It is fitting that the Memorial for our most divisive war has become a place of solace and coming together. 
   Mr. Speaker, regardless of who is responsible for the recent attack on the Vietnam Wall, that cowardly act was an affront to every American. In an apparent act of vandalism, 14 panels were defaced with a light, oily substance that damaged names, panels, and paving stones of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
   While I am thankful that it appears that the substance was removed and the Memorial has been restored to its pristine condition, I believe it is important for us in Congress to show Congress's support for one of our Nation's most sacred sites. 
   Mr. Speaker, I also urge my colleagues to join me between November 7 through November 10 to read some of the 58,256 names on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. This will only be the fourth time that this reading has occurred here in Washington, and it coincides with the 25th anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. 
   I thank my colleague Representative Carter for introducing this resolution and Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer for bringing it to the floor today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 797 is a very, very good bill, and I appreciate Ms. Baldwin working so hard. I think we could actually use the adjective tirelessly on this one, in order to bring it forward. 
   It really has two provisions that I'm especially pleased to support. First, I'm pleased that this bill will help veterans with visual disabilities. To put this in perspective, VA compensates about 13,000 veterans for blindness in one eye.     
   DOD statistics show that about 1,169 servicemembers have experienced eye injuries in Iraq, and VA states about 111 of those are now receiving compensation. And let us not forget that with the number of traumatic brain injury casualties, and those that have gone undiagnosed, many of them will experience visual impairment as a result of those injuries. Thanks to Ms. Baldwin's work in bringing this forward, the change in this law will make sure that all of these individuals will be treated fairly. 
   I am also greatly pleased that we have been able to fund reinstatement of the GI Bill work-study provisions that expired last June. These additional work-study jobs will benefit both the veteran student and veterans at large by increasing the resources available to assist VA employees in accomplishing their mission. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a very good bill and I urge my colleagues to support it. I also want to thank Mr. Filner and his staff for, again, bringing this forward, along with Mr. Buyer, the ranking member; and the staff over here. Again, this is a very good bill, and I urge support of its passage with my colleagues.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (HIRE A VETERAN WEEK -- (House of Representatives - January 30, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The resolution before us today is identical to H. Con. Res. 125, passed by the House in the 109th Congress on July 24, 2006. I want to thank Congressman Holt and Congressman Brown for bringing forward this very, very important resolution. 
   Vince Lombardi said: ``The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender.'' Maybe that is why the men and women on the front lines today, who have sacrificed the most to achieve a success, remain dedicated to achieving victory in the face of adversity. And it is this determination and dedication that make our veterans such outstanding employees when they return to civilian life. 
   American veterans, especially those who serve the Nation during challenging times, understand the value of work. When these men and women return to civilian life, they only ask that the Nation, through her employers, recognize the value of their experience as members of our Armed Forces. 
   Today, our Nation is honored by the service of millions of volunteer service men and women, including hundreds of thousands who have served in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom. By putting these veterans to work in our factories, our offices, construction sites, and all types of industries, we give them the opportunity to continue contributing to the Nation they have so honorably defended in uniform. 
   Today, diversity is a common goal of employers. I would offer that one facet of diversity can only be provided by a veteran, that 1 percent of society that protects and defends the other 99 percent. 
   I also want to thank those businesses who are proactively working to hire veterans today. I am working with many Arkansas-based businesses. In fact, in my situation and Congresswoman Herseth's situation, we are working with businesses all over the country, both large and small, to encourage additional veterans outreach. I  urge my colleagues to take the initiative in reaching out to businesses in your communities as well. 
   To the Nation's employers, large and small, I say hire a veteran. You will get an employee who understands honor and commitment, who is skilled and drug free and loyal. You can't do any better than that. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of House Resolution 24 to reauthorize the House Democracy Assistance Commission. This type of parliamentary development program was initially seen as a tool to help 12 emerging democracies rise from the grasp of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in the mid-1990s. 
   The Solomon-Frost Task Force assumed that successful democratic transitions in former Communist countries depended on direct involvement and at a modest cost were able to help these parliaments become effective legislatures and play a crucial part in a democratic system. 
   One of the most evident impacts of the program was the goodwill it generated towards the U.S. Congress and the American people among these East European countries under the Iron Curtain. 
   As the need has continued to grow and our world continues to evolve, former Speaker HASTERT recognized the necessity of having this program once again. The House Democracy Assistance Commission has given the U.S. Congress the ability to guide fledgling democracies into strong, stable institutions of government by creating relationships between members of both bodies. 
   Madam Speaker, I had the opportunity to travel to Lebanon, Kenya and Liberia on a trip not too long ago. And we were greeted in Kenya by a big guy. I am a pretty big guy myself; I am not used to looking up to people. But this individual was probably 6-5, 6-6. He was the staffer that was in charge of taking us around the capital making sure that we got where we were supposed to be. 
   And then we had the opportunity to journey outside of the capital out into the countryside. We flew out, and this same individual greeted us in his Masai warrior outfit. And we had the opportunity to visit with the Masai, see how they ran things. But, Madam Speaker, that is how you change the world, with the relationships, helping others build the institutions that underpin democracy. That is how you change the world. 
   Again, I want to thank Congressmen PRICE and DREIER for their leadership, for the tremendous job that they have done, to Speaker Pelosi for going forward and agreeing to getting things along as far as they have on this, former Speaker HASTERT for his vision, and then most importantly, to the staff that does such a tremendous job of helping out and making all of those things possible.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (IMPROVING COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR VETERANS IN CERTAIN CASES OF IMPAIRMENT OF VISION INVOLVING BOTH EYES -- (House of Representatives - March 21, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. First of all, I would like to associate myself with the remarks that were said in the previous bill regarding the Suicide Prevention Act. Again, I just appreciate, being a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I appreciate the hard work on that. It really does make us all proud. 
   Mr. Speaker, for years the VA has awarded service-connected disability ratings, including increased ratings for the loss of use for paired organs, such as hearing, when only one organ was affected by military service. The exception is the body's visual sensory organs and it is time to remove that inequity. This brings the VA in line with eye disability as done by everyone else in figuring eye disability. 
   As an optometrist and as an eye doctor I am very, very familiar with this and used to help figure these things all of the time, the loss of visual acuity in one eye on the other eye and the long-term effects of that stress. To me, ignoring any loss of visual acuity due to nonservice-connected causes just isn't rational. 
   I would like to thank Congresswoman Baldwin for her excellent work in bringing this forward to the full House, and for her advocacy. She has been a real bulldog, and I mean that in a very nice way, in just really staying after this. And due to her efforts, she has been instrumental in highlighting this problem. I have very much enjoyed working with her to improve the law to better serve veterans with visual impairments. 
   I am also pleased that the bill contains an amendment which was offered during the full committee markup to extend the VA work/study allowance benefits for 5 years. This is a follow-on to a short-term, 6-month extension we passed late last year, and will enable student veterans the ability to continue in a wide variety of work/study positions that directly benefit veterans while easing the workload on the Federal staff at VA and DOD. 
   Current law allows work/study participants to work up to 20 hours per week. Participants perform a variety of duties such as veteran-related paperwork at schools or VA offices. Some participants perform outreach services under the supervision of a VA employee. Others perform services at VA medical facilities or the offices of the National Cemetery Administration. 
   The VA work/study allowance is available to Americans training under many programs, such as the Montgomery GI bill, as well as the program for Vocational Training and Rehabilitation for Veterans with Service Connected Disabilities, and several other programs. 
   The work/study portion of H.R. 797 allows us to extend the work/study program without violating the PAYGO rules by using the offsets found elsewhere in the bill. 
   I really want to thank Chairman Filner and Chairman Buyer for working together. This was a difficult thing to get all of the needs crafted together so we could kill two birds with one stone and rectify the visual impairment part. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 797.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to support American Religious History Week. This great country was founded on religious principles, and the ideal of our founders can be seen in the halls of this very building, the symbol of American democracy, the Capitol. 
   Statuary Hall, the former meeting place of the House of Representatives, now home to statues donated by individual States, was the site of church services for over 50 years, and the Speaker's podium was used as the preacher's pulpit during that time. 
   Several of the statues in that great hall are of religious figures important to the growth of this great nation. 
   John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania was persuaded by his father to study the ministry. He was ordained in the Church of England. From there God called him into the life of politics; serving in the House of Burgesses and becoming a commander in the Continental Army during the revolution. Then he was elected to the first Congress and also served as a senator. 
   Like so many of the other religious figures in these halls, these men have made significant contributions. Men like Roger Williams, a priest in the Church of England, founded the colony of Rhode Island and wrote the declaration of the principle of religious liberty. 
   Thomas Starr King, a Unitarian minister, was a fiery orator who spoke favorably of the Union in California in the 1860s, and is credited with saving California from becoming a separate republic. 
   Father Damien's statue is one of the most recognizable. He was an ordained priest in the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu, Hawaii in the mid 1860s. He risked his health ministering to lepers, building chapels and comforting the sick before leprosy took his own life. 
   The accomplishments of these religious men honored in Statuary Hall are felt coast to coast. Now, hundreds of years later, religion is still important, and I'm committed to continuing the efforts started by these great men.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Congressman Miller. Thank you, Congressman Walz. I always feel like he speaks with such authority when I am around him; I am always concerned he is going to ask me to do 10 pushups or something. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 3681, the Veterans Benefits Awareness Act. This simple, straightforward legislation authorizes VA to purchase advertising in national media outlets for the purpose of promoting awareness of veterans benefits. 
   When was the last time you saw the Super Bowl or other prime time recruiting advertisement for one of the military services? Now, when was the last time that you saw the Super Bowl or other prime time ad for veterans health care and benefits sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Probably never. It's one reason that many veterans and their dependents are not aware of the benefits due to them. 
   Over the years, Congress has authorized millions to improve outreach, and the results are disappointing. In spite of the additional funding, VA still relies on the public service announcements, pamphlets, meetings with small groups of veterans, and the one-on-one outreach to deliver its message to veterans. Unfortunately, PSAs are often most broadcast at times when few people are watching, and small groups and individual meetings are often difficult to arrange and are not very efficient. 
   Our veterans continue to tell us that they were not aware of the VA programs that would improve their lives. That is why I introduced H.R. 3681, the Veterans Benefits Awareness Act of 2008, which authorizes VA to purchase advertising in national media outlets for the purpose of promoting awareness of veterans benefits. 
   H.R. 3681 will provide VA with the authority to buy radio and TV time to ensure that veterans and their dependents are aware of health care options and benefits for education, disability compensation, nondisability pensions, training, loan guarantees, and survivors' programs. 
   I want to thank Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin for moving this bill, for her cooperation in working with the subcommittee; Chairman Filner, and Ranking Member Buyer for their support; and also to our staffs that worked so hard in preparing these bills. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3681.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. Buyer. 
   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3889 to determine whether the VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Program was meeting its goals of employment and independent living for disabled veterans. 
   To do that, my bill would require that the Department of Veterans Affairs conduct a 20-year longitudinal study of three cohorts of disabled veterans who participate in the VR&E Program during years 2009, 2011 and 2013. The data VA collects and reports to Congress will enable us to fine-tune the program to achieve higher rehabilitation rates and to provide the most appropriate education and training leading to full employment. 
   Mr. Speaker, the bill specifies 15 different data points that must be collected and authorizes VA to add any other data points they deem appropriate. With this information, I believe veterans who participate in voc rehab will be more successful in finding gainful employment over their working career. 
   This is a good bill that does not require offsets and will improve the lives of veterans, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3889, as amended. 
   I want to thank the Chair of my subcommittee, Ms. Herseth Sandlin, for her support and hard work. I also want to thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer as always for bringing the bill forward. Again, I want to thank the staff on both sides for helping to prepare this.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 2239, the Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act, implements a commonsense involvement in the speed with which we provide vocational rehabilitation to injured servicemembers. This bill makes it clear that active duty servicemembers are entitled to begin using vocational rehabilitation benefits prior to discharge. 
   The bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to coordinate with the military services to determine the likelihood that a servicemember undergoing hospitalization or outpatient treatment will be discharged or returned to active duty. If the member is likely to be discharged and will likely have a disability rating of at least 10 percent, VA is authorized to evaluate and award the full range of vocational rehabilitation benefits prior to the servicemember's discharge. Such a decision would be made using the current statutory and regulatory processes to determine eligibility. 
   Mr. Speaker, it makes no sense to delay access to benefits that will speed an injured servicemember's return to productive civilian life. For severely injured servicemembers, these benefits often make the difference between whether or not they are able to live independently. Many of those wounded in the global war on terror spend 2 or 3 years recovering from their injuries and often find themselves with significant free time outside of their therapy sessions. That free time offers an ideal opportunity to make use of their vocational rehabilitation and employment benefits to prepare them for the civilian job market. I am happy to let my colleagues know that CBO has said that this bill ``would have no direct impact on direct spending.'' The bill simply affects the timing of when our servicemembers receive the benefits. 
   All of us have gone over to Bethesda and Walter Reed to visit injured troops. And, again, this is an effort to give them the best of both worlds, the best that we can offer them being on active duty, but to go ahead and start those vocational rehab services so that we can get vocational counselors in there and then, again, as they pursue their getting stronger and heal physically, to go ahead and direct them in such a way that we can provide a new occupation for them in the future. 
   So I appreciate Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin, and especially the chairwoman in the sense that she was instrumental in helping us amend the bill to improve it. 
   So, again, I would urge that my colleagues support this legislation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   We have witnessed a disservice to the men and women in uniform to whom we owe such a deep debt of gratitude. It is simply inexcusable. We can and must do a better job by our injured troops, especially after asking them to do so much for us. 
   I was glad to see actions to hold the Army and hospital leadership accountable, and the President's choice to create the Dole-Shalala Commission. Both Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala have the experience to craft solutions to improve the situation. I know they will be independent and offer a sound assessment of the problem with good solutions. 
   Ultimately, our troops deserve the best. This is a bipartisan issue, and I look forward to working diligently on it. 
   We must not rest until our troops are assured of the medical treatment that they so rightfully deserve.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for leading the charge on this important technical corrections bill. I want to voice my support for H.R. 1195, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   In the time that has passed since SAFETEA-LU was signed into law, we have heard from the Department of Transportation and several States regarding fixes to different programs and high-priority projects. H.R. 1195 addresses most of the areas that need correction. 
   It is important to note that this bill does not make substantial policy changes to SAFETEA-LU. Rather, this bill corrects provisions that were not workable in SAFETEA-LU. After we pass this bill, SAFETEA-LU will finally be able to accomplish what Congress voted to do 2 years ago. 
   The bulk of this bill is section 105, which makes changes to over 200 of the high-priority projects in section 1702 of SAFETEA-LU. These changes address surface transportation projects in the bill that were unable to be executed, clarifying recipients, and increasing certain project funding levels, and decreasing others to achieve budget neutrality. 
   The bill also makes a critical correction in the Transportation Research Program authorized in SAFETEA-LU. Errors were made in the research section of SAFETEA-LU that weakened the legacy research programs carried out by the Department of Transportation. This bill addresses that problem. 
   The bill also extends the reporting deadline for the National Surface Transportation Policy and Review Study Commission established in SAFETEA-LU. This important commission is tasked with recommending a new direction in funding and policy for our surface transportation programs, and we look forward to seeing their final report. 
   Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for revitalizing this technical corrections bill. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend my thanks to the honorable Lane Evans and urge passage of this bill to name a U.S. post office in his hometown of Rock Island, Illinois, in his honor. 
   Lane's service to America and its veterans began with his enlistment in the Marine Corps in the Vietnam War. Lane began his congressional career by winning election for the 17th District in Illinois in 1982 and promptly became a staunch advocate for veterans. He kept this commitment through the 109th Congress. 
   This bill will provide a small but important recognition of Lane's service and commitment. He championed issues such as agent orange, women's health care, spina bifida benefits and many others. 
   We hear a lot about bipartisanship in this body, and truly I had the opportunity to win a special election, came up, and one of the first people that I met as a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee was Lane Evans. 
   As soon as he realized that I was certainly willing and wanted to help veterans, then nobody could have been any nicer. Nobody could have extended any more help than Lane Evans. 
   It is sad, sad and not sad, I have mixed emotions, certainly, about Democrats taking control of the House, but it is sad that with his retirement his picture will not be on the wall. Because of his hard work, he certainly very much deserves that sort of honor. 
   On the other hand, like I say, nobody, nobody has worked any harder and done a better job for our Nation's veterans. I certainly urge passage of this bill.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my congratulations to one of my constituents who's dedicated his adult life toward protecting the men and women of Arkansas. 
   I rise to congratulate Les Braunns of Springdale on his promotion to the rank of major in the Arkansas State Police. A 28-year veteran trooper, Major Braunns was most recently the commanding officer of Troop L, where he earned the respect and friendship of the men he commanded. 
   According to the men of Troop L, Major Braunns always led his men by example, and led his men from the front, never asking a trooper to perform a task he was unwilling to perform himself. 
   His men pointed to the most recent example of his leadership from an incident in July when the Hell's Angels descended on my district for their annual get-together. Then Captain Braunns marched into a group of 300 and told them, ``You can police yourselves, or we can do it for you.'' The State police kept their word and so did the Hell's Angels. 
   I congratulate Major Braunns on his promotion, and I thank him and appreciate all that he's done for the State of Arkansas.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the Ozark National Forest and offer my congratulations for a century of enriching the lives of all Americans. 
   A proclamation from President Theodore Roosevelt on March 6, 1908, dedicated the Ozark National Forest as the first federally protected stand of hardwoods in the U.S. 917,944 acres of land was set aside by President Roosevelt for the forest that currently covers more than one million acres, most of which is in Northwest Arkansas. 
   This great landscape is one prime example of why Arkansas is called the Natural State. The Ozark National Forest covers some of the region's most magnificent scenery. The Ozark National Forest is home to Mount Magazine, the tallest mountain in the state, as well as Blanchard Springs Caverns, a magnificent limestone cave system, and the only cave system featuring guided tours administered by the Forest Service. 
   I'm grateful for the efforts of all Forest Service employees, volunteers and sportsmen who serve as stewards in the preservation and management of this great land. 
   I thank my colleagues for passing this resolution to honor the 100th Anniversary of this great Arkansas treasure.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I support the bill's purpose to transfer administrative jurisdiction over a light station and approximately 24 acres of public land in the State of Oregon from the Coast Guard to the Secretary of the Interior. The land and structures will be held in trust for a federally recognized tribe and would be available for tribal and public interests that were approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Lastly, the bill would prohibit the use of the land for any commercial activity that is not expressly approved by the Secretary. 
   However, I am disappointed that the bill is being brought to the floor without a map specifically detailing the location and amount of land which is to be transferred under the bill. 
   The land has not been surveyed, and there is a question between the Department of the Interior and Coast Guard on the boundaries of this land that is proposed for transfer. 
   I support the bill, but I do have reservations about the lack of a precise description of the land to be transferred. I hope that the majority, under Mr. DeFazio's leadership, will work with our side to ensure that the land is surveyed promptly and that the final transfer should be delayed until such maps are available.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of House Resolution 1466, which honors the life and accomplishments of an amazing man, astronaut Dr. Guy Bluford, Jr. 
   Guy Bluford was born in West Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on November 22, 1942, and he is perhaps best known as the first African American in space. He was selected for NASA's astronaut program in August 1979, and he became a mission specialist on the eighth space shuttle mission, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida on August 30, 1983. This was the third flight of the space shuttle Challenger and the first mission with a night launch and with a night landing. 
   Dr. Bluford is a veteran of four space flights. After STS-8, Dr. Bluford went on to serve as mission specialist on STS-61-A, on STS-39 and on STS-53, and he logged over 688 hours in space. 
   These early missions paved the way for the scientific research and international cooperation that today are vital aspects of the International Space Station. 
   Prior to his service with NASA, Guy Bluford received a bachelor of science degree in aerospace engineering from Pennsylvania State University in 1964, a master's of science degree with distinction in aerospace engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1974, a doctor of philosophy in aerospace engineering with a minor in laser physics from the Air Force Institute of Technology in 1978, and a master's of business administration from the University of Houston, Clear Lake, in 1987. 
   What is, perhaps, less well-known about Guy Bluford is the service he has given to the Nation since leaving the astronaut corps. After leaving NASA in July 1993, he retired from the Air Force and held several executive-level positions in America's aerospace industry. Dr. Bluford also served the Nation in other capacities, including as a member of the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. He has been a member of the National Research Council Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board. He has served on the board of trustees of the Aerospace Corporation and on the board of advisors for the Coalition for Space Exploration. 
   I am proud to support this resolution honoring such a prominent American citizen, executive and astronaut. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 1466.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6524. This legislation will allow the General Services Administration to remove the public use deed restriction on a former National Park property in the community of Eastlake, Ohio, and dispose of a surplus property in Koochiching County, Minnesota. 
   Since its transfer to Eastlake, Ohio, in 1964, the former National Park Service property has met its public use requirements by serving as a senior center. Because the community has built a new center to replace the aging John F. Kennedy Senior Citizen, Eastlake desires to make use of the property for other purposes. The city of Eastlake would pay the General Services Administration $30,000 for removal of the restrictions on the use of the property. 
   For more than 40 years, the real estate has served the purpose intended in the initial agreement. And this bill will allow the property to be repurposed to continue to serve the community. 
   The community of Koochiching County, Minnesota, has similar plans for a parcel of property that has for years served as a military training facility. The changing needs of the U.S. Army Reserve and the community now mean that the property can serve the public interests better by housing several local government agencies. 
   The conveyance of property in Koochiching has restrictions that will ensure that the property continue to serve the community. GSA does not oppose either of those provisions. In fact, in conversations with staff, GSA indicated that if GSA had the authority, it would remove the deed restriction on the property and convey the Minnesota property at no cost because GSA believes the public interest has been and  is being served by the provisions in the bill. 
   Each of these properties has served the General Services Administration purposes well, but the changing needs of the communities of Eastlake and Koochiching County now require that the properties be repurposed. In both cases, the needs of the community can be better served through adaptive reuse of these properties. 
   I support the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (GREAT LAKES LEGACY REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I want to first commend our colleague from Michigan, Dr. Vern Ehlers, for his years of work with stakeholders from the Great Lakes to advance the Great Lakes Legacy Act. 
   The Great Lakes are a vital source for both the United States and Canada. The Great Lakes system provides a waterway to move goods; water supply for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes; a source of hydroelectric power; and swimming and other recreational activities. 
   But the industrialization and development of the Great Lakes Basin over the past 200 years has had an adverse impact on the Great Lakes. Although safe for drinking and swimming, in many places fish caught from the Great Lakes are not safe to eat. 
   Lake sediments, contaminated from the history of industrialization and development in the region, are one of the primary causes of this problem. By treaty, the United States and Canada are developing clean-up plans for the Great Lakes and for specific areas of concern. The Great Lakes Legacy Act, passed in 2002, has helped citizens restore the water quality of the Great Lakes by taking action to manage contaminated sediments and to prevent further contamination. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act authorized the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out qualified sediment remediation projects and conduct research and development of innovative approaches, technologies and techniques for the remediation of contaminated sediment in the Great Lakes. 
   Legacy Act funding must be matched with at least a 35 percent non-Federal share, encouraging local investment. By encouraging cooperative efforts through public-private partnerships, the Great Lakes Legacy Act provided a better way to address the problem of contaminated sediments. At some sites, removing sediments will be the best way to address short and long-term risks. At other sites, the last  thing we want to do is go in and stir up contaminated sediments by dredging, causing more harm to the environment. 
   Obviously, how to address contaminated sediments at each Great Lakes area of concern will be very much a site-specific decision. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act does not try to presume any particular clean-up option. It simply encourages stakeholders to take action and to make sure that the action they take will make a real improvement to human health and the environment. 
   This legislation is strongly supported by both environmental groups and business groups in the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes Legacy Act reflects a consensus approach to addressing sediment contamination in the Great Lakes. 
   While the authorization for the Great Lakes Legacy Act expires this year, I remain concerned over tripling the authorized level of spending. The Act has been funded at a level between $22 million and $35 million per year, far short of the current $50 million annual authorization. In addition, the bill authorizes that habitat restoration be included as one of the authorized purposes. Unfortunately, this may mean less clean-up of contaminated sediments in the Great Lakes. 
   By expanding this program to cover other purposes, there will be less money for the primary purpose of getting pollution out of the water. Again, by all measures, the Great Lakes Legacy Act has been a successful program. There is some concern that we might delay ultimate clean-up by spending some of the Federal funds on activities other than sediment remediation. 
   Again, I want to congratulate Dr. Ehlers so much for his hard work in this area. He has been a true champion in this and for his persistence in bringing it to the floor today. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 3315 provides that the great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center be known as Emancipation Hall. The bill was introduced by Representative Zach Wamp of Tennessee on August 2, 2007. 
   At nearly 580,000 square feet, the Capitol Visitor Center is the largest project undertaken by the Office of the Architect of the Capitol in the Capitol's 212-year-old history. It is one of the most important projects since the extensions to the Capitol and the Dome were built more than 140 years ago. As an extension of the Capitol, the Capitol Visitor Center will welcome visitors to the seat of the American Government. 
   Within the Capitol Visitor Center, the great hall is a large 20,000-square-foot room where visitors will gather as they enter the Capitol. This promising gathering space will serve as the gateway for the public's experience of the Capitol and American democracy. 
   The Capitol Visitor Center will provide visitors to the Capitol the opportunity to learn about and more fully understand the Constitution, the Congress, and the history of the Capitol, including the contribution of slaves who helped build the Capitol and the country. It will help deepen the understanding of all who visit about our Nation's long struggle with slavery and its ultimate abolition. 
   It is fitting and appropriate to recognize the seminal moment of the Emancipation Proclamation in American history. We should recognize the sacrifice and contribution of the many slaves who helped build the Capitol.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I desire. 
   Obviously, there's nothing in the bill pertaining to any sort of aggressive action against Iran as far as military action. This, or a similar bill, has been introduced several times since the AMIA bombing, and so there's no way that this is being ginned up by the administration. 
   Last October, Argentina's state prosecutor concluded that the AMIA bombing was decided and organized, I quote, ``decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former Government of Iran, whom at the same time entrusted its execution to the Lebanese group of Hezbollah.'' 
   Last March, acting on the state prosecutor's conclusions, INTERPOL's Executive Committee recommended the issuance of red notices for five Iranian officials and one Hezbollah operative in connection with the bombing. 
   This is about an effort to get justice. Delayed justice, as Mr. Kucinich said, is justice that we certainly need to get done. 
   And, again, this is not about ginning up in an effort to support the President with some sort of military operation. This is about taking the actions that INTERPOL, taking the actions that the Argentineans want to take, and encouraging them with a sense of Congress.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mr. Filner for his leadership in bringing this bill forward and that of the staff on both sides. The legislation before us, H.R. 23, as amended, would provide $1,000 monthly payment to World War II mariners. 
   The merchant mariners braved great danger and suffered great loss in their service for the allies. This service has been recognized. Since 1988, these wartime merchant mariners have full VA benefits, including health care. This bill goes further than that. It recognizes that these veterans did not have access to the GI Bill when they were young. In providing a monthly payment, H.R. 23 attempts to compensate for the loss of the potential offered by the GI Bill's educational benefits which were used by about half of the 16 million veterans of the Second World War. 
   Thirty other groups also provided military service to the U.S. in World War II and have received veteran status in the same manner as the merchant mariners. 
   We are a little bit concerned that we were not able in this bill to also help these deserving veterans. These groups include the Women's Air Force Service Pilots, the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps and the famed Flying Tigers. They served loyally, selflessly and courageously. Their service also contributed directly to victory in 1945, and yet we haven't been able to accommodate them in this bill. In fairness, their duty must be taken into account. I hope that we can act in the near future and take care of them. 
   I am also concerned that apparently because of the rules of the House, and I voted for PAYGO, that we couldn't find the offsets to fund this benefit. So the issue of funding is being passed to the appropriators. It is unclear where we are going to be able to find the approximately $485 million over the next 5 years to fund the bill. 
   As a believer in the GI Bill, I certainly cannot dispute the fact that the lack of advantage conferred by GI Bill education benefits disadvantaged merchant mariners and their families in the years following their service. 
   Mr. Speaker, our merchant mariners provided intrepid and faithful service. Sixty years ago, they paid the heavy price for the freedoms we enjoy today. For that, they certainly deserve our appreciation. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Under the direction of Terry Hicks, the choir has participated in many regional and national competitions, representing Arkansas and the Third District with class. We are privileged to have students such as the Bentonville Chamber Choir living in and representing the State of Arkansas, and I commend their success. 
   I wish them the best of luck on their performance at the world-famous Carnegie hall.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. I rise in recognition of the success and achievements in the career of Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Mike Blevins. Mike has served the U.S. Marshal Service since 1979. His duties have taken him all across the country, with long terms in Arkansas and Texas. Since 1989, he has been the Chief Deputy of the Western District of Arkansas. During that time, he also served as the Acting Marshal for more than 2 years. 
   Since he has been in Arkansas, he has helped supervise numerous programs that have resulted in a record number of fugitive arrests. His hard work has earned him several awards, including the United States Marshal Service Distinguished Service Award in 2006. 
   I have had the privilege to work with Mike on many different projects; most recently, a successful effort to make Fort Smith, Arkansas, the home of the National U.S. Marshals Museum. 
   His dedication, persistence, and leadership are all admirable qualities. I appreciate his friendship and example. I am honored to have had the opportunity to have worked with such a great man, and thank him for his service to our country.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of a fallen Arkansas hero, in fact, a true American hero, SGT William W. Bushnell of Jasper, Arkansas. 
   Sergeant Bushnell was a member of the 1st Cavalry at Fort Bliss. Sadly, he died from his wounds this past Saturday after his vehicle was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. 
   Sergeant Bushnell's father, Wesley, told the Associated Press, ``Billy served proudly in the airborne infantry. That's what he wanted to do when he joined and proud to do it. His shoulder was hurt a while back, and he went to a hospital in Kuwait. All he could think about was getting back in with his comrades in Baghdad.'' 
   This is the type of commitment towards others we can be so very proud of, to his fellow soldiers and commitment to his country. 
   My prayers, the prayers of my family, and the prayers of Arkansas are with the Bushnell family. I humbly offer my thanks to Sergeant Bushnell for his selfless service to the security and well-being of all Americans.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   During last summer's war between Israel and Lebanon, which was initiated by Hezbollah jihadist militants breaching Israel's border and killing and kidnapping Israeli soldiers, Hezbollah extremists used Lebanese civilians as human shields to protect themselves from counterattacks by Israeli forces. 
   Hezbollah jihadists embedded their forces among innocent civilians in violation of international law. 
   According to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, ``Hezbollah and its sponsors have brought devastation upon the people of Lebanon, dragging them into a war that they did not choose, and exploiting them as human shields.'' 
   To express deep concern over the use of civilians by Hezbollah and to condemn these actions, my distinguished colleagues, Congressman RON KLEIN and Congresswoman ILEANA ROS-LEHTINEN, introduced this bill.  
   Among other things in the bill, it strongly condemns the use of innocent civilians as human shields, including Hezbollah's use of this savage and illegal tactic during last summer's war between Israel and Lebanon; calls on the international community to recognize and condemn these violations of international law; and calls on responsible nations and experts in the area of international humanitarian law to pay special attention on the use of human shields in violation of international humanitarian law and make further recommendations on the prevention of such violation in the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (URGING ALL MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL TRACING SERVICE TO EXPEDITE RATIFICATION PROCESS -- (House of Representatives - April 25, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H. Res. 240 dealing with the Holocaust archives. I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Hastings of Florida, for introducing this bill which urges member countries of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service to ratify, if they haven't yet done so already, the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords Treaty to expedite the ratification process to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives located at Bad Arolsen, Germany. 
   The Holocaust stands as one of history's darkest moments. It is critical that we understand and educate future generations about what happened under the Nazi oppression and ensure that these atrocities are never repeated. 
   The ITS archives at Bad Arolsen are the largest closed Holocaust-era archives in the world, containing millions of records about the fate of over 17 million victims of Nazi Germany. Allowing open access to these records will provide researchers and scholars with materials necessary to enhance the public knowledge about the Holocaust as well as provide Holocaust survivors and their families with the information about their loved ones and help bring them closure. 
   Furthermore, creating open access to these documents will provide the information necessary to address issues of Holocaust compensation. In particular, many insurance companies have refused to honor Holocaust-era insurance policies brought about by Holocaust victims and survivors prior to and during World War II. These insurance companies have for over 60 years now refused to provide compensation under the insurance policies to Holocaust survivors or families of the Holocaust victims, arguing that Holocaust survivors and their families don't have the documentation, such as death certificates and insurance records. The concentration camps in which many of the Holocaust victims perished didn't issue death certificates and all assets and documents were confiscated from the Jews during that time by the Nazis. Many of these documents now remain closed in archives like Bad Arolsen.     
   Unfortunately, today, we cannot bring back those who have perished in  the Holocaust at the hands of Nazi Germany, nor can we erase the pain and suffering from the memories of those who survived these atrocities. 
   However, what we can do, and what H. Res. 240 aims to accomplish, is to make sure that the Holocaust-era archives are opened in an effort to bring long awaited justice and closure to Holocaust survivors and their families, as well as help ensure, through education, that atrocities committed during the Holocaust are never repeated.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (EXPRESSING SENSE OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THAT BANGLADESH SHOULD DROP CHARGES AGAINST SALAH UDDIN SHOAIB CHOUDHURY -- (House of Representatives - March 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation for the outstanding leadership of Congressman Kirk in introducing this timely resolution. It has my wholehearted support. 
   Mr. Choudhury is a Bangladeshi journalist and the editor of the Weekly Blitz, the largest tabloid English-language weekly in Bangladesh. He is currently facing a sedition trial for daring to reach out to Jewish and Israeli writers, as well as for speaking openly about the threat radical Islam poses in Bangladesh. 
   Mr. Choudhury was arrested in November 2003 when he tried to attend a conference in Israel and then was subjected to brutal treatment while in prison. Although he was released last year, in large part due to the efforts of Congressman Kirk and others, the Bangladesh government refuses to drop the charges against Mr. Choudhury, apparently trying to intimidate him into silence. 
   Last May, the American Jewish Committee presented Mr. Choudhury with the Moral Courage Award recognizing his efforts to promote dialogue between Muslims and Jews and his courage in speaking out against Islamic extremism. 
   Unfortunately, however, the authorities in Dhaka refused to permit him to visit the U.S. to receive the honor. 
   Mr. Speaker, Bangladesh and the U.S. have been good friends for over 35 years. Despite many handicaps, Bangladesh has made good progress in some key areas of development, including agricultural production, improved literacy rates, basic social services, and empowering women through employment and education. 
   As the fourth most populous Muslim country in the world, a moderate and stable Bangladesh can play an important role in regional and world affairs. 
   Today, however, Bangladesh is at a crossroads. National elections are being postponed amidst electoral chaos; meanwhile, the military appears  to be playing an increasingly large role within the Bangladeshi interim government. 
   The prospect of holding free and fair elections during the first half of 2007 appears to be much in doubt. More broadly, endemic political polarization, corruption and related governance concerns, as well as the rise of violent extremists remains substantial challenges for the Bangladeshi society. 
   Mr. Speaker, in this context I urge the authorities in Dhaka to send a strong signal about the importance Bangladesh attaches to tolerance and the rule of law by dropping these politically motivated charges against Mr. Choudhury. I support the resolution and urge its adoption. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, we appreciate the gentlelady's work on this bill. The legislation before us today reauthorizes the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy through fiscal year 2009. Unique among nations, the United States maintains a vast network of formal and informal contacts with the people of the world and conducts the world's only global foreign policy. 
   The purpose of public diplomacy is to provide this worldwide audience with information about the United States and to convey an accurate and positive image of our beloved country and our foreign policy objectives. To accomplish this mission, the United States Government has at its disposal a number of important tools, including education and cultural exchange programs, extensive and proactive public affairs programs centered in our embassies, and a network of radio and television services broadcasting accurate and objective programming to a world community. 
   With H.R. 1003, Congress is reauthorizing the advisory commission for another 2 years to continue its important work to study our public diplomacy programs and reach some useful conclusions about how our government can do a better job of creating a dialogue with foreign audiences. 
   I urge the commission during the next 2 years to step up its efforts to study in more detail our public diplomacy and broadcasting efforts and advise policymakers in the administration and in Congress on appropriate changes and reforms that will improve our outreach efforts to the people of the world. 
   Mr. Speaker, I would again emphasize the importance of my bill and urge all of my colleagues to vote in the affirmative.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, last July Israel's sovereign border was violated by terrorists linked to Hamas who shot and killed two Israeli soldiers and kidnapped Corporal Gilad Shalit. 
   Days later, terrorists linked to Hezbollah crossed into Israel and killed three and wounded two, and kidnapped soldiers Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. All three have been held captive since without medical attention from humanitarian groups like the Red Cross. No information is known on the fate of these soldiers. 
   As proxies of the Iranian and Syrian regimes, Hezbollah and Hamas have continued to attack Israel despite Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000 and Gaza in 2005. 
   Rather than view Israel's withdrawal as an act of good faith to further the cause of peace, Hezbollah and Hamas viewed these measures as signs of weaknesses to exploit. Hamas and Hezbollah, which have representatives in the Palestinian and Lebanese cabinets, believe that terrorism, murder and kidnapping are appropriate means of achieving political objectives, and have proposed negotiations to exchange these hostages for convicted terrorists now serving time in Israeli jails. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution which declares that the House of Representatives stands with the State of Israel and its right to self-defense and against the barbarity perpetrated by Hezbollah, Hamas and other terrorist groups, and the rogue regimes that sponsor them. 
   This resolution demands that Hamas and Hezbollah immediately and unconditionally release Mr. Shalit, Mr. Goldwasser and Mr. Regev, and that they provide all three with access to medical attention. 
   The resolution also holds Iran and Syria accountable for making terrorist acts like these possible. We cannot afford to be complacent about those Islamist extremists who would seek to kill three people, violate borders with impunity and threaten the security of the Middle East and the world. 
   As Dr. Martin Luther King noted, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.'' 
   I thank Chairman Ackerman for introducing this resolution, his leadership in this area, and doing so much to advance the cause of the kidnapped Israeli soldiers. This resolution is about seeking what is needed most: Justice for the innocent and accountability for the guilty. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   I enthusiastically support this resolution recognizing National Train Day. The ceremonial golden spike hammered on May 10, 1869, marked the completion of one of this Nation's greatest engineering masterpieces, and marked the birth of what would become the greatest rail network in the world. 
   The United States now has 140,000 miles of railroads, making up the transportation backbone of this Nation. These railroads are environmentally friendly, producing significantly less pollution than competing modes of transit. In fact, a train can haul one ton of freight 436 miles on one gallon of diesel fuel, and is three times cleaner than a truck. Furthermore, trains help alleviate congestion on our crowded highways. One train can take 280 trucks off the road. 
   The recently introduced Amtrak reauthorization, H.R. 6003, will make significant enhancements to Amtrak's growing business. The legislation will give Amtrak the funding it needs to continue improving its service while also creating innovative programs to enhance passenger rail service. 
   The State grants provision in the bill will give a greater say in how Federal funding is utilized for capital projects, and a private operator pilot program will increase innovation and competition in passenger rail service. 
   Additionally, H.R. 6003 includes a plan to create public-private partnerships to construct true high speed rail corridors all over the Nation. High-speed rail promises safe, fast and convenient service, all the while helping to alleviate aviation and highway congestion. I urge passage of H. Res. 1176.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank Chairman Oberstar for bringing this legislation through committee and to the floor in a very expeditious way. 
   I rise today in support of the commonsense piece of legislation which I hope will serve as an example of working hard and smart toward energy independence in America. 
   I have long been a proponent of this kind of affordable alternative lighting method, and energy production method, and have voted before for increases in using solar panels which produce no air pollution or a single ounce of hazardous waste. 
   As the leader in securing our energy independence and promoting safe and effective energy alternatives, I fully support the Department of Energy's retrofitting of solar panels to reduce energy consumption and, in fact, retrofitting in other areas, Federal buildings with more such that we can get more efficient energy technology in place. I am confident that through the Department of Energy's leadership in utilizing this lighting technology, the United States, as a whole, can make significant progress towards greater energy efficiency and independence. 
   All of us in this room have said our Nation needs to be more energy independent.     
   There is no magic wand which will make it so. It takes many steps to get to the end of the path we are traveling, and it will take many people to make this goal a reality. 
   Today we have the opportunity to take another step down that path. I urge my colleagues to give us the means to take this step by passing H.R. 798. 
   I also want to commend Chairman Oberstar. Many years ago there was a country western song by Barbara Mandrell that said she was country before country was cool, through her song, and I would say that you are very much a proponent of this legislation, a proponent of these things when it wasn't cool. And as Mr. LaTourette said, perhaps if we had done some of those things many years ago, as you were insisting then, we would be in much better shape from an energy standpoint in our Nation today.

   Kyle Reece was born in Harrison and went to school in Jasper and Alpena. He fished, played ball and prayed while growing up in Newton County. His name can be seen in the Alpena gym, marking two championship teams, and his name will long be remembered for the duty he performed on behalf of his country, his friends and his family. 
   Kyle was a grenadier in the 82nd Airborne who deeply cared for the men in his charge. He accepted his duty proudly, telling his 3-year-old daughter before he left that he had to go to Iraq so she and everyone else in the U.S. could remain free. 
   There's no way we can adequately thank Kyle, or his family, for his service. However, I will take to heart the words of his wife, Chauntelle, who urges that we not wait until a soldier dies before we honor him. Rather, we should shake their hands and thank them for all that they do for America.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
   My amendment would encourage the Office of National Drug Control Policy to give careful consideration to States that do not currently benefit from the HIDTA program when considering the request of law enforcement agencies for a new HIDTA designation. 
   The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 was enacted on December 27, 2006. This law requires the Director of ONDCP to establish regulations under which a coalition of interested law enforcement agencies from an area may petition for designation as a high intensity drug trafficking area. 
   My amendment would require that of the $226 million in HIDTA funding in the underlying bill, $6 million will not be made available until the Director of the ONDCP certifies in writing that specific regulations have been established for the consideration of HIDTA application. Specifically, the Director must take into consideration whether an area that may be designated as a HIDTA lies within a State that already receives assistance from the HIDTA program. 
   I do not believe we should mandate a preference for States like Arkansas that have been overlooked in the designation process, but I do believe we should encourage ONDCP to take this fact into consideration when reviewing HIDTA applications. 
   I have seen the tragic effects of increased drug manufacturing and trafficking in Arkansas, especially the trafficking of meth. Arkansas is one of several States, including Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Delaware and several others, that have been excluded from the HIDTA program, despite many characteristics that make it both an ideal setting for illegal drug manufacturing and perfectly situated for trafficking. 
   In recent years Arkansas has made great progress and has much to be proud of, but we still face serious challenges when it comes to drug trafficking. Our State has one of the most serious meth problems per capita of any State in the country. Our State has become home to branches of some of the Nation's major gangs and has a transportation network that makes it ideal for drug traffickers targeting metropolitan areas, including St. Louis, Little Rock, Chicago, Memphis, Kansas City and so on. My congressional district has one of the top 10 fastest-growing metropolitan statistical areas in the Nation, and recently our State's largest city found itself high on a list of cities in the Nation suffering from violent crime. 
   Again, I am really discouraged in the sense that despite all of these facts, Arkansas and several States in similar situations have been overlooked in the HIDTA designation process. I don't ask for special preference for my State, but I do request that ONDCP give fair consideration to States in my situation. 
   I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their hard work on the underlying bill. But again, this is just an effort to try and help the States that are in the same situation as Arkansas.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   The Tennessee Valley Authority, an independent government corporation, was established in 1933 to aid in the development of the Tennessee River Valley watershed through the proper use, conservation and development of the region's natural resources. TVA is the Nation's largest wholesale power producer and the fifth largest electric utility. TVA supplies power to nearly 8 million people over an 80,000-square-mile service area covering Tennessee and parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky. 
   In addition, TVA's nonpower program responsibilities include the multipurpose management of land and water resources throughout the Tennessee Valley and fostering economic development. Prior to 1959, construction of the power projects was financed mainly by congressional appropriations. The power program is now completely self-financed through power revenues. 
   During the TVA's first 20 years, most of the power generated was hydroelectric. By 1950, with increased power needs, TVA began building coal-fired electric plants, and those plants now account for about 75 percent of TVA's power generation. TVA provides more electricity than any other public utility in the Nation and has an unparalleled record of reliability. 
   In addition, TVA is broadening its environmental stewardship responsibilities by increasing its use of renewable resources, improving energy efficiency, and working to improve air quality for the millions who live in the Tennessee Valley watershed. TVA constructed nuclear plants to supply additional power needs and just recently returned an additional nuclear power unit in Alabama, Browns Ferry Unit 1, to service to meet expected future demand in energy. 
   The agency spent approximately $2 billion to recover the facility, which became fully operational by May 2007. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved a 20-year license renewal for all three units at the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant.  
   For 75 years, the TVA programs of navigation, flood damage reduction and power reduction have fostered economic development in an important region in the Nation. 
   I urge all of my Members to support the resolution celebrating the Tennessee Valley Authority's 75th anniversary.

   H.R. 3068 was introduced by Subcommittee Chairwoman Norton last year, and prohibits the Federal Protective Service from awarding contracts to businesses owned, controlled or operated by convicted felons. Specifically, the bill would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to promulgate regulations to implement this prohibition. 
   The Federal Protective Service, FPS, has a critical mission. FPS serves as one of the first lines of defense for our Federal buildings. It employs more than 1,000 trained personnel, and 15,000 contract security guards. It is charged with securing nearly 9,000 federally owned and leased buildings. 
   This legislation will help improve security at those buildings and facilities and increase the standards of safety for Federal properties across the country. H.R. 3068 passed the House last year and was amended in the Senate. The Senate amendment provides additional direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security on key issues that the regulations should include. The Senate amendment also directs the administrator for Federal procurement policy to issue a report to Congress on establishing similar guidelines government-wide. 
   This legislation is important to ensure the integrity of the forces protecting our Federal buildings and the employees and visitors that work in and visit those buildings every day. I support this legislation. I urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. Speaker, I want to first commend our colleague from Michigan, Dr. EHLERS, for his years of work with stakeholders from the Great Lakes to advance the Great Lakes Legacy Act. The Great Lakes are a vital resource for both the United States and Canada. The Great Lakes system provides a waterway to move goods, a water supply for drinking, industrial and agricultural purposes, a source of hydroelectric power, and swimming and other recreational activities. 
   But the industrialization and development of the Great Lakes Basin over the past 200 years has had an adverse impact on the Great Lakes. Although safe for drinking and swimming, in many places fish caught from the Great Lakes are not safe to eat. Lake sediments contaminated from the history of industrialization and development in the region are one of the primary causes of the problem. 
   By treaty, the United States and Canada are developing cleanup plans for the Great Lakes and for specific areas of concern. The Great Lakes Legacy, Act passed in 2002, has helped citizens restore the water quality of the Great Lakes by taking action to manage and clean up contaminated sediments and to prevent further contamination. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act authorized the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, to carry out qualified sediment remediation projects and conduct research and development of innovative approaches and techniques for the remediation of contaminated sediment in the Great Lakes. Legacy Act funding must be matched with at least a 35 percent non-Federal share, encouraging local investment. By encouraging cooperative efforts with State and local governments and through public-private partnerships, the Great Lakes Legacy Act has provided a better way to address the problem of contaminated sediments. 
   The Great Lakes Legacy Act does not try to presume any particular type of cleanup option. Rather, it simply encourages stakeholders to take action and make sure that the action they take will make a real improvement to human health and the environment. The Great Lakes Legacy Act reflects a consensus approach to addressing sediment contamination, and it is strongly supported by both environmental groups and business groups in the Great Lakes region. 
   The House passed H.R. 6460 earlier this month, and now the Senate has returned it to us in modified form. As the authorization for the Great Lakes Legacy Act expires this year, it is important that we move this legislation today. It is a compromise bill that keeps this important program working. 
   The earlier House-passed version would triple the authorization level by raising it to $150 million per year. I am pleased to see a more realistic spending level associated with the bill before us today. This current bill maintains the authorization level in existing law. The act is being funded at a level between $22 million and $35 million per year, still far short of the existing $50 million annual authorization level. 
   While we might like to see more money invested in cleaning up the Great Lakes, it is hard to justify tripling the authorization when Congress has not been willing to appropriate anything close to its current authorization levels. Again, I think that this is something that we need to work on to get the authorization level met by our appropriators. 
   I remain skeptical of including habitat restoration as one of the authorized purposes for the funds. By expanding this program to cover other purposes, there will be less money for the act's primary purpose of getting pollution out of the water. Nevertheless, by all means, the Great Lakes Legacy Act has been a successful program, and I support its reauthorization. 
   I want to congratulate Dr. Ehlers for his hard work in bringing the legislation to the floor. He has been a tireless champion for the Great Lakes. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INDEPENDENCE OF BULGARIA -- (House of Representatives - September 09, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 1383, and I commend our colleague, Mr. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, for introducing it. I appreciate Mr. WILSON's formation of the Bulgaria Cancus to promote the partnership of Bulgaria and America. Bulgaria declared its independence 100 years ago, on September 22nd, 1908. 
   Like so much of the rest of Europe, however, Bulgaria then suffered through a very difficult and tumultuous 20th Century. 
   After suffering through two world wars, Bulgaria was then trapped for over four decades behind the ``Iron Curtain'' that fell across Eastern Europe, and its people suffered from the repression and stagnation that accompanied the imposition of the Bulgarian communist regime by the former Soviet Union. 
   After the communist bloc in Eastern Europe fell apart, Bulgaria was at last able to hold a truly free election in June 1990. 
   It then faced fresh difficulties, however, as it went through a period of social and economic turmoil that culminated in a severe economic an financial crisis in 1996 and 1997. 
   With the help of the international community, the Bulgarian government initiated a series of difficult but necessary economic reforms. 
   Those reforms continue even today, but their results so far have helped Bulgaria noticeably improve its economic situation. 
   In fact, according to the World Bank, in 2006 Bulgaria attracted the highest levels of foreign direct investment--as a share of GDP--of all of the countries of Eastern Europe. 
   Challenges remain, but the market reforms undertaken so far have pointed Bulgaria in the right direction. 
   Bulgaria must also be commended for the political reforms it has implemented since 1990. 
   Right at the start, in 1991, the country adopted a new constitution, which created a parliamentary democracy that limited the powers of the President and also balanced those powers against the position of the Prime Minister--with the Prime Minister ultimately held accountable to the legislature. 
   So, Bulgaria has made progress toward a future of democracy and economic prosperity, but it nevertheless faces continuing challenges, including a rather serious problem in the form of corruption and organized crime. 
   We remain supportive of Bulgaria's efforts to address those twin scourges, and I note that, in the wake of very strong concerns expressed by the European Union, the Bulgarian government has indeed begun to reform its Interior Ministry and has created a State Agency for National Security to fight such corruption and organized crime. 
   We certainly wish it great success in that specific effort. 
   Finally, I note that, while continuing with its reform efforts at home, Bulgaria has also become an active member of the international community, contributing military personnel to participate in international missions in the countries of Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. 
   Furthermore, in a very important step in March 2004, Bulgaria became a formal ally of the United States by becoming a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO. 
   In its new role--as a member of the NATO Alliance--Bulgaria has proven 
   itself to be a constructive and positive force in working for stability in the Black Sea region, and we are grateful for that. 
   This year, on the occasion of its 100th anniversary as an independent state, we commend Bulgaria on the great progress it hade in just the past eighteen years. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution honoring the independence of our friend and ally, Bulgaria.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (HONORING THE SACRIFICES AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DISABLED AMERICAN VETERANS -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, as a Nation we are blessed with many things. We have a Constitution that sets the standard for freedom around the world.  We have a land that provides us with bountiful food and superb scenery. But most importantly, America is blessed to have sons and daughters willing to put themselves in harm's way to protect the 99 percent of Americans who do not serve. 
   Unfortunately, that feeling of patriotism and sacrifice way too often results in disability that affects the veteran for the rest of their life. Often, the disability is small. But sometimes the injury, whether physical or mental, has a significant impact on the veteran's quality of life and their ability to support their families. In such situations, the disability has affected more than just the veteran. As a part of our debt to these men and women, taxpayers compensate them for their injuries and provide a range of benefits unmatched in any other country. But we can and should do something more symbolic of disabled veterans' service to the Nation, and that is to designate a week that will remind Americans that disabled veterans are with them every day. 
   By giving disabled American veterans the recognition of a week named in their honor, we demonstrate to the American people the importance of the sacrifices made by disabled veterans and their families. This is a way to honor our disabled veterans, and I certainly urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (NATIONAL D-DAY REMEMBRANCE DAY -- (House of Representatives - June 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Scalise for bringing this forward. It's important for us periodically to pause and think about the tremendous sacrifice, especially while the men and women that made all of this possible are still with us, that we can pause and just think of the sacrifice that they did on this day. 
   I also want to welcome Mr. Scalise to the Veterans' Affairs Committee again, that he has volunteered to become a part of that committee and to work in a very bipartisan way so that we can do our best for veterans. 
   On June 6, 1944, the United States participated in the largest seaboard invasion in history. Countless men and  women served their country that day, and I stand before you to ask for your support for the designation of National D-Day Remembrance Day. 
   Preparations for D-day began long before June 6, 1944. In fact, discussions about an allied invasion began in 1942. The Germans expected an invasion along the north coast of France and built up forces along the narrowest portion of the channel. However, the Allies planned to land just south of the German build-up. In order to execute a successful campaign, our men and women, along with Allied forces in other countries, not only had to plan an attack, but also to contend with many of the same issues we ourselves are faced with today. 
   War planners projected 5,000 tons of gasoline would be needed daily for the first 20 days after the initial invasion. 3,489 tons of soap would be needed in the first four months after the invasion. Approximately 300 planes would drop bombs along the coast of Normandy. Six parachute regiments, including 13,000 men, needed to be transported. 5,000 vessels would transport men and 30,000 vehicles across the English channel. 
   It's clear that the efforts that led to D-day and the many days afterward were that of dedicated men and women who sacrificed their jobs, their families and in many cases their own lives to ensure that the United States of America and the Allied forces would be successful. 
   Words cannot express our gratitude for their courage and spirit. However, by designating a National D-Day Remembrance Day, we can continue to remember the sacrifice unwavering commitment to our country, and determination of the men and women who fought and won World War II. I urge my colleagues to remember and honor these men and women by supporting this resolution. 
   I also want to comment on Mr. Obey, what he said in regard to the actual monument. And I've had the opportunity to be there. My daughter, while she was vacationing in Europe, in her early twenties, she and her friends enjoyed it so much that they actually were just going and planning on spending an afternoon, wound up spending the night, and were so impressed with the way that everything's portrayed that, again they did a good job.

   Mr. Speaker, let's take a moment to recognize an ally whose relationship with the United States certainly exceeds its size. Completely surrounded by Italy, the European microstate of San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe. Yet, San Marino has made a strong ally of the United States, most notably within a number of international institutions, including the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund. In fact, the U.S. and San Marino have collaborated closely on several key issues such as combating international terrorist financing and protecting intellectual property rights. 
   Moreover, San Marino has been a leader in promoting interreligious and intercultural dialogue within the European Union. The value of our relationship was marked earlier this year by the first exchange of ambassadors between the U.S. and San Marino. 
   I, therefore, ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Ranking Member Dreier's H. Con. Res. 236, recognizing our close relationship with the Republic of San Marino.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The bill before us, H.R. 1567, the Stop Tuberculosis Act of 2007, has been put forward by its supporters to provide a very significant increase in our foreign aid spending on anti-TB programs abroad. 
   If we rely on figures gathered with the assistance of the Congressional Research Service, the bill would raise our spending on such programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development by about six times in the next 2 years. 
   According to a brief letter received late last week from the Congressional Budget Office, the bill would increase such spending somewhat less, by somewhere between two and three times in the next 2-year period. 
   Although it is possible that the latter estimate by CBO may inadvertently have included in its baseline comparison current funding levels for some anti-TB programs outside of the scope of this bill, it is clear that this measure seeks a major increase in the AID programs it covers. 
   Along those lines, the bill strongly encourages, if not directs, the President to ensure that the funds that would be provided under this bill will be transferred to the World Health Organization's ``Stop TB Partnership'' plan. 
   Finally, the funding amounts in the bill have apparently been formulated using a calculation meant to reflect what the United States' fair share might be in funding that international plan. 
   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the determination of the supporters of this measure to do more to combat TB overseas. 
   On a personal note, my mother was afflicted with tuberculosis when she was in her mid to late teens and was on her back for a year, just didn't get out of bed. So we understand the importance of eradicating TB, not only worldwide but in the United States. She's done well, though. By coincidence, this is her 86th birthday, and so she recovered fully. 
   I also want to thank Congressman Engel for his work on this. I know that he's worked very, very hard, and also Congresswoman HEATHER WILSON of New Mexico. 
   With that, we don't have any more speakers, and if you all don't, I will yield back.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I am pleased to rise in support of H. Res. 550, which congratulates the people of Ethiopia as they celebrate their second millennium. This commends Ethiopia's contribution to peace and stability on the African continent and recognizes the longstanding relationship between Ethiopia and the United States. 
   While much of the world celebrated the dawn of the second millennium in January of 2000, Ethiopia recognizes the Coptic calendar, which falls 7 years behind our own. This practice is in keeping with Ethiopia's long and rich cultural heritage. 
   Ethiopia is the only country on the African continent never to have been colonized and, in fact, played an important role in the liberation struggles of numerous other African countries during the colonial period. It continues to play an important role in promoting peace across the continent, both as a major supporter of peacekeeping efforts and the home of the African Union. 
   Ethiopia has served as a model of religious toleration in the region, a place where Christianity, Judaism, and Islam have co-existed peacefully for centuries. Ethiopia also is home to countless historical artifacts and world heritage sites, including the earliest known hominid, Lucy; and the medieval rock churches of Lalibela, which have been recognized as a wonder of the world. All of these facts have contributed to the strong sense of pride and nationalism that Ethiopians enjoy today. 
   And while Ethiopia continues to face significant challenges in terms of security and democratic and economic development, this is a country that has served as one of the strongest allies of the United States in the region. The value of our relationship should not be taken lightly. 
   I was particularly pleased to learn that Prime Minister Meles, Ethiopia's Prime Minister, kicked off the celebrations in September by granting amnesty to thousands of political prisoners, including a number of opposition leaders. 
   It is my hope that the spirit of rebirth and reconciliation engendered in the celebration will continue to take root as Ethiopia embarks on a second millennium. 
   So I rise to congratulate our friends in Ethiopia on this joyous occasion, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure. 
   With that, Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (EURASIA FOUNDATION ACT -- (House of Representatives - November 05, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Eurasia Foundation has reportedly done some good work over the past few years of the region of the former Soviet Union. Because the aid programs for the countries of that region from which the foundation has received its funding are now closing down, the issue before us is whether that foundation should be authorized to continue to receive funds directly from the U.S. in order to continue its democracy promotion work independently. I suspect that for many of us in this House the answer would be yes. 
   Just as we have had an Asia foundation, it is possible to see the work of funding this kind of foundation to do democracy promotion in Eurasia.     
   The passage of this bill, H.R. 2949, would help ensure that funding. 
   At the request of Members from our side of the aisle and the Foreign Affairs Committee, this bill has been amended in committee to try to address a significant problem that is not directly related to the Eurasia Foundation but that is an issue of importance to the wise use of our United States Government funds if they are appropriated to the foundation under this bill in the future. 
   Independent of the Eurasia Foundation, our United States Government-funded Enterprise Fund in Russia, the major state of that region, is closing down and is seeking to use the hundreds of millions of dollars from the  sale of its assets to fund democracy promotion, civil society and rule-of-law programs in Russia, as well as economic reform efforts. 
   At the same time, we have democracy promotion programs under way across Russia and the rest of the region, through the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Democratic Institute, and the International Republican Institute. 
   So there is obviously a possibility that duplications of efforts will take place unless this Congress finds ways to ensure that it doesn't. We don't want to see U.S. Government-funded organizations compete to do the same kinds of activities if that leads to duplication and waste, and the democracy promotion in that region is too important to see money wasted at a time when Russian President Putin and others are forcing their own brand of authoritarian government on their nations. 
   This measure has been amended in a way that seeks to mandate that any successor to the U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Fund in Russia has to reach an agreement with the Eurasia Foundation before it engages in any democracy promotion efforts in that country. Hopefully, that will eliminate duplication to some degree. 
   The bill, as amended, does not go as far as some of us would like, I must note. It does not address the similar situation that will arise in the Ukraine in the next few years when our U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Fund there closes down and seeks to set up its own successor foundation that may, once again, end up duplicating the work done by the Eurasia Foundation in the Ukraine. 
   It also does not address a completely separate question about how the assets of such U.S. Government-funded Enterprise Funds in Russia and Ukraine will be disposed of, an issue that involves hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds. It has been the practice to ensure that the taxpayers get back at least 50 percent of the funds held by such funds when they close down their operations. 
   There is an effort in the House-passed fiscal year 2008 foreign aid appropriations bill, however, to allow our fund in Russia not to turn back to our Treasury half of its assets. That would mean that the taxpayers would lose $160 million, or perhaps even more than that, depending on the value of the assets sold in the case of the Russia fund alone. Those are monies that might otherwise go to help fund other worthwhile programs. 
   Perhaps this is not the bill in which to debate that issue, and our efforts in committee to address it in this measure were unsuccessful. But I take this opportunity to point out that issue in the hopes that the administration will be supported by Congress in its efforts to follow current practice and ensure that our Treasury gets back that very significant sum of money.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The great nation of France and the United States of America have a shared heritage of commitment to freedom and independence. From time to time, of course, we have made different choices or followed different paths in our commitment to the rule of law, human rights and democracy, but we in the United States are always grateful to have France's collaboration in advancing important foreign policy and security objectives. The newly elected President of France, Mr. Nicholas Sarkozy, is this week paying an official visit to Washington and will address a joint meeting of this Congress during his visit. 
   His visit prompts us to recall some of the expressions of support Mr. Sarkozy has offered to our country and some of the concrete steps he has, indeed, taken to join with the United States in addressing key issues of our day. 
   On the eve of the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, then-French Interior Minister Nicholas Sarkozy traveled to New York City to demonstrate solidarity with the American people on that occasion. During his visit, Mr. Sarkozy paid tribute to New York City's Police and Fire Departments as part of the commemoration of the anniversary and noted as part of his remarks the following: ``One thing is sure in the history of our two peoples, each time we faced a challenge, France was able to count on the United States of America.'' 
   He then presented to the New York Fire Department the French Medal of Honor, the very first time that the medal, the highest award for French firefighters, has been awarded to foreigners. By taking such actions, as both Minister of the Interior and now as the President of France, Mr. Sarkozy has won the appreciation of the American people. 
   I note that his attitude regarding the necessity of preventing Iran from achieving its nuclear ambitions, his expressed support for the nation of Israel and his praise for the United States as a land of opportunity are very much appreciated as well. 
   Mr. Speaker, we are glad to have France as an ally, and we hope to deepen the friendship and partnership that the United States and France have enjoyed so many times in the history of our two countries. As the cochair of the Congressional French Caucus, I believe that the resolution before us today helps send a message of continued friendship with the people of France while congratulating President Sarkozy on his election and welcoming him to the United States. 
   I ask all of my colleagues to join in supporting this very timely resolution. 
   I have one additional speaker.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I welcome the focus this bill places on the growing influence of Iran in Latin America. Because Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism, we dare not lose sight of its increasing presence and activities in the region, nor can we forget its past transgressions. 
   One year ago, Argentina's State Prosecutor concluded that the horrific 1994 AMIA bombing was ``decided and organized by the highest leaders of the former government of Iran.'' 
   Yet, somehow the leader of Iran continues to be warmly received by many in the hemisphere. In fact, he has found much strength in his friendship formed with Hugo Chavez, Ahmadinejad's key ally in the region. 
   The implications of Iran's presence in Latin America are disconcerting in themselves. When partnered with the power of Venezuela's petroleum, it is truly a cause for alarm and concern. 
   Ahmadinejad has capitalized on his relationship with Chavez to inject his influence throughout the hemisphere, recently signing a cooperation agreement worth $1 billion with Bolivia, and is reportedly making plans to establish an embassy for the first time in Quito, Ecuador. 
   Furthermore, the disturbing alliance between Venezuela, Iran and Cuba cannot be ignored. The radical efforts of Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Castro to stir anti-U.S. resentment in the region and support for anti-American regimes across the hemisphere are an increasing and undeniable threat to our security. For this reason, we must remain vigilant in our attention to the hemisphere and be sincere in our efforts to strengthen our relationships with the nations of Latin America. 
   I commend the efforts being taken by the U.S. and our partners in Latin America to combat terrorist activities. However, we must recognize that if the U.S. is to support the efforts of our friends in the region, we must support them wholeheartedly. We cannot continue to send mixed signals. Denying free trade agreements with Colombia, while calling for increased cooperation on any front is not good, fair or effective policy. 
   I thank my colleague for introducing this measure and look forward to additional efforts by Congress to comprehensively support our security in the Western Hemisphere. 
   Again, I have one more speaker, Mr. Engel.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 6340 designates the Federal building and United States Courthouse located in White Plains, New York, as the ``Charles L. Brieant, Jr. Federal Building and United States Courthouse.'' 
   Charles Brieant served as the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York from 1986 until 1993. His original appointment to the bench by President Nixon in 1971 began a 36-year career with the Southern District Court. 
   Prior to his service on the Federal bench, Judge Brieant served honorably in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. After his service in the Armed Forces, Judge Brieant returned to Columbia University, where he had begun his college education before being called into the service, and graduated in 1947. He received his law degree in 1949 and began a life of public service, working as a town justice, assistant district attorney, town supervisor, and a county legislator. 
   It is fitting that we give Judge Brieant's name to the courthouse where he served for so many years. Judge Brieant worked for many years to help build the courthouse in White Plains and another in Manhattan. He was particularly proud of the White Plains courthouse which opened in 1995. His work helped ensure that new courthouses would meet the needs of the court for many years. 
   As we honor him today by naming this Federal building and courthouse, we ensure that Judge Brieant, who passed away just last week, will not be forgotten. Judge Brieant leaves behind his wife of 60 years, Virginia Brieant, three daughters and a son, nine grand-children and two great-grandchildren. 
   We hope that the naming of this courthouse will bring comfort to his family in their time of loss, and honor his legacy of service to the court.

   I rise in support of H.R. 6221, as amended, the Veteran-Owned Small Business Protection and Clarification Act of 2008. 
   H.R. 6225, as amended, makes three important improvements for our veterans. First, it closes a loophole in title 38, United States Code, to require that contracts awarded on behalf of Department of Veterans Affairs by agents of the Department include provision to comply with the disabled veteran-owned small business provisions in public law 109-461. 
   Second, the bill would expand the types of VA work-study jobs on college campuses to provide more jobs for student veterans and widen interaction between veterans, the faculty, staff and, most importantly, other students.     
   Finally, H.R. 6221, as amended, would take provisions from H.R. 6272 introduced by Congressman Welch to create the Military Occupational Specialty Transition (MOST) program, a modernized version of the old Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training Act, or SMOCTA. 
   Focusing on veterans whose military specialty does not translate well into civilian life and who do not have other training opportunities available under title XXXVIII, this bill will benefit veterans whose job skills no longer match what is needed by today's economy. 
   For example, today's army or marine infantryman is experienced with some types of technology related to their specialty, but most of their training is in small unit tactics and weapons. They are not like the technicians who service and operate sophisticated systems on a daily basis. While an infantryman has developed soft skills such as leadership and initiative that are valuable in many work places, many hands-on skills are usually not part of the resume. 
   Or take a sailor whose main job is to move aircraft around on the flight deck of a carrier. He works in a very dangerous environment but other than working the light line at an airport, his skill is not very transferable. 
   Or take the airman who is a load master who is responsible for the safe loading of cargo on aircraft. Outside of working for an airline in the same capacity, the load master has few directly transferable military skills. 
   I appreciate our colleague from Vermont (Mr. Welch) for his initiative to renew funding for the old Service Members Occupational Conversion and Training Act, or SMOCTA. Again, in a bipartisan manner, the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee has brought us a bill that meets Mr. Welch's goal of providing a training program for veterans who finish military service with few or no skills that are transferable to regular life. 
   Mr. Speaker, I extend my gratitude to Chairman Filner, Ranking Member Buyer, and subcommittee Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin for working together to bring this bill to us as a bipartisan effort to make veterans more competitive in the job market. I also want to thank our staffs for their hard work. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to support H.R. 6221, and I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4255 as amended, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide assistance to the Paralympic Program of the United States Olympic Committee, and for other purposes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the bipartisan manner in which this bill moved through the committee. I want to especially acknowledge Chairman Filner for introducing H.R. 4255, the United States Olympic Committee Paralympic Act of 2008, and working with Subcommittee Chairwoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin and myself to incorporate several provisions from Ranking Member Steve Buyer's bill, H.R. 1370, Disabled Veterans Sports and Special Events Promotion Act of 2007, into the amended version of the bill. 
   In 2005, the VA and USOC concluded an agreement to increase efforts to increase participation by disabled veterans in sports at all levels as part of their rehabilitation from their injuries. Ranking Member Buyer was proud to play a role in encouraging the USOC and VA to reach that agreement. By combining those two bills, we will give VA and USOC Paralympics some of the resources they will need to meet that goal. 
   Through the grant program, this bill uses the USOC and its partners to equip, train, and support disabled veterans' sports, and I look forward to seeing the VA, USOC Paralympics, and their partners to ramp up their efforts. 
   Most importantly, I am excited that we will have at least 11 disabled veterans participating as members of the U.S. Paralympic team in Beijing. Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize these dedicated Americans who are the beginning of a larger disabled veteran participation in future games. 
   Disabled veterans on this year's Paralympic Team are: 
   Chuck Lear from Jacksonville, Illinois, archery; 
   Carlos Leon from North Lauderdale, Florida, track and field; 
   Kari Miller from Washington, D.C., sitting volleyball; 
   T.J. Pemberton from Guthrie, Oklahoma, archery; 
   Oscar Sanchez from Los Angeles, California, cycling; 
   Jennifer Schuble from Houston, Texas, cycling; 
   Melissa Stockwell from Minneapolis, Minnesota, swimming; 
   Kevin Stone from Kodak, Tennessee, archery; 
   Casey Tibbs from San Diego, California, track and field; 
   Scott Winkler from Grovetown, Georgia, track and field; and, 
   Russell Wolfe from Williamsburg, Virginia, archery. 
   I am also pleased to see a renewed commitment to providing training opportunities for disabled veterans at all levels of participation.  
   Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I believe Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer have created a bill that will encourage more disabled veterans to participate in sports from the local level up through elite competition such as the Paralympic Games beginning with games in Beijing. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4255, as amended. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6225, as amended, the Injunctive Relief for Veterans Act of 2008. This bill as amended would amend title 38, United States Code, relating to equitable relief with respect to a State of private employer. 
   Mr. Speaker, once again, working in a bipartisan manner Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity worked with me to pull together several fine bills into one cohesive package to provide new USERRA and SCRA protections to our military servicemembers and their spouses. 
   H.R. 6225 as amended incorporates provisions of H.R. 2910 introduced by Representative Susan Davis of California, H.R. 3298 introduced by Representative Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania, and H.R. 6070 introduced by Representative John Carter of Texas. And I appreciate their hard work in bringing to the committee such excellent bills. 
   This legislation would encourage the courts to utilize their equity powers when deemed appropriate in USERRA cases. During the full committee markup of this section of the legislation, Subcommittee Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin and Ranking Member Buyer had a very good colloquy on the intent of this section of the bill, to clarify that injunctive relief is available under the discretion of the judge hearing the facts, and that this section is not intended to create a new avenue of appeal in USERRA cases.     
   The bill, as amended, would also require colleges and universities to refund a student's tuition and fees for  unearned credit for the semester or quarter when they are called up for active duty, and allow these same students to re-enter the institution with identical and academic status that they had when they were activated to duty. 
   Finally, this bill would also extend Servicemembers Civil Relief Act protections to enable servicemembers with deployment orders to more easily terminate or suspend service contracts without fee or penalty for such services to include cellular phones, utilities, cable television or Internet access. It would also add penalties to those creditors under the SCRA who refuse to reduce interest rates, as currently required. 
   Additionally, H.R. 6225, as amended, would extend the same residency protections to military spouses as those granted to the military members for purposes of voting and paying taxes. 
   Mr. Speaker, I am re-emphasizing the Court's injunctive relief in USERRA cases requiring schools to refund tuition to those ordered to active duty, giving servicemembers the option of terminating certain service contracts, and making sure that military spouses are treated equitably for residency. 
   H.R. 6225, as amended, provides our men and women in our Armed Forces the protections they need to transition back to civilian life when their tour of duty is completed. 
   I congratulate Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin for once again doing yeoman work in crafting some very good bipartisan legislation. I support H.R. 6225, as amended, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3998, in particular title X of the bill, the Butterfield Overland Trail Study Act. This title directs the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the Butterfield Overland Trail, which stretches from Missouri to California. Before the railroad and even the famed Pony Express, the Butterfield Trail was the only connection between the eastern United States and the rapidly expanding west coast.     
   Commissioned by Congress in 1857, John Butterfield established a trail that could be traveled by stagecoach from the Mississippi River to San Francisco in a remarkable 25 days. 
   While the original purpose of the trail has long been surpassed by modern technology, the trail survives with the potential to be a great link to our Nation's past, attracting tourists with its educational and historic appeal, as well as a tool to educate our children about our country's storied history. 
   I have worked with the National Resources Committee to ensure that extreme caution is given to protecting private property rights, and clear language is contained in the bill so that any future action will not compromise private land. 
   Mr. Speaker, as our country continues to rapidly grow and develop in the spirit of the old American West, it is so important that we remember what brought us to this point. It is our duty to our children and grandchildren that we take the time to mark the paths our ancestors took across our country. 
   I respectfully ask my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3998. And I want to thank the committee so much, and the committee staff. It has really been a pleasure to work with you guys to help us as we worked forward in ironing out the kinks.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of House Resolution 909, and I join my colleagues in recognizes the valuable contribution and significant sacrifice that Haitians made as they joined the fight for American independence over two centuries ago. 
   In the fall of 1779, over 500 courageous men volunteered to cross the treacherous waters from Haiti to the U.S., to join our soldiers in the Siege of Savannah. This was no easy feat; yet these men were committed to fighting for America's liberty and independence. 
   Representing the largest contingent of soldiers of African descent to fight in the American Revolution, these Haitian troops bravely joined in our efforts, forging the friendship between the U.S. and Haiti that has only strengthened in the centuries that followed. 
   Sadly, such courage had a high price. More than 300 Haitians lost their lives in this battle. Last year, a monument to this glorious sacrifice was erected in Savannah, Georgia. The collaborative efforts of local officials in Georgia and the Haitian American Historical Society of Miami guided this project to completion. 
   Today, the Savannah monument stands as a tribute to those individual foreign volunteers who joined in the American Revolution and commemorates the historic bond between the U.S. and Haiti. 
   H. Res. 909 further commemorates Haiti's own struggle for independence and renunciation of slavery. What began as a slave revolt in 1791 ended with Haiti's own independence in 1804. And Haiti was the first nation in the Western Hemisphere to form a government led by the people of African descent and, remarkably, it was also the first nation in the Western Hemisphere to renounce slavery. 
   For this reason, I am proud to stand with my congressional colleagues in calling for the passage of this important resolution. Yet we must also recognize that there is more to be done. 
   Despite Haiti's early and historic commitment to democracy, the country continues to languish under the oppression of extreme poverty, disease, and violence. As a significant partner in the region, the U.S. must remain not only cognizant of Haiti's progress but also engaged in its development. We cannot be fully successful as a hemisphere without Haiti fulfilling its potential as a strong and vibrant nation. 
   I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Meek) for introducing H. Res. 909 and am proud to join in the commemoration of such courageous individuals. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to ask my colleagues to vote against House Concurrent Resolution 63. I ask this despite the fact that I am very much in favor of the first part of the resolution before us. The first part says: Congress will and should continue to support and protect the members of the United States Armed Forces who are serving or who have served bravely and honorably in Iraq. If the resolution stopped there, it would be great. 
   We would be sending a message that we unequivocally support our troops in Iraq, our troops who are preparing to go there, and General Petraeus is being confirmed to lead those troops. 
   But the resolution does not stop there. It goes on and by its words takes that support away. How do you support the troops without supporting the plans of those troops? General David Petraeus was confirmed just a scant 20 days ago with much praise and fanfare. He is probably one of the most respected men to ever wear the uniform. 
   Congress said to him, you are great, go get the job done. Now, less than a week after he took over in Baghdad, we are in the throes of the process which will essentially tell the general, sorry, we don't approve of the plan you created or are currently undertaking.  
   Most of those criticizing this plan offer no alternative, and I say most. Some have offered an alternative, but most of those criticizing this plan have offered no alternative. 
   Even the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan commission of statesmen who have been heralded and quoted by the many who support this resolution, have indeed said that they support the short-term surge. This was later confirmed by Mr. Hamilton, the Democratic co-chair of the group when he appeared in front of the Foreign Affairs Committee of which I am a member. 
   I visited Iraq five times, the last with my friend from Indiana (Mr. Buyer). I met with the troops from my State and from others across America, thanking them for their service in combating radical Islam and the insurgency and liberating a people from tyranny. 
   I have sat down with the President and the Prime Minister of Iraq. I have told them that the Americans and the coalition forces would soon be leaving Iraq in the not-too-distant future. Their response has always been, we want you to leave but we need your help now until we can train our forces to provide our own security. 
   America will one day hand over responsibilities to the Iraqis, but it must be on terms which are beneficial to the interests of America, Iraq and the region, while not sacrificing the progress we have made or the security that we have earned. We must do right by the Iraqi people. We must do right by our troops in Iraq tonight, and we must do right by the men and women in uniform and their families who have served and sacrificed so much. 
   Our allies, countries in the region, in fact most of the world, agrees that if we pull out before the Iraqis are ready, it will create tremendous instability in the region, leading to the possibility of war and nuclear proliferation in the Arab states. 
   I had the opportunity to successfully play sports at a fairly high level. Whether it was on a Boys Club team, a high school team or a major college football team, nothing emboldened our team more or made us work harder to defeat the other team than when we saw dissension on the other team. We have an opportunity this week to send a strong message to our allies, the insurgents and most importantly the men and women in uniform who ironically are in combat tonight attempting to execute the plan that is being railed against on the House floor as we speak. 
   The message that we should send should be our will to not jeopardize the safety of those in Iraq by emboldening our enemies. We can show this by our will tonight of defeating this resolution. 
   The other thing I would like to say is that reference was made to Washington. And I also am reading a book on John Adams that is related, certainly. And Washington did at times have to pull back. He was facing the greatest army of the time. 
   But he did pull back. And Washington also was under tremendous pressure from Congress, under tremendous criticism. And I am certainly glad that Washington did not listen to that criticism, that he fought on. If he had not, we would probably be under British rule today.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   H.R. 2728, introduced by Representative Darrell Issa of California, designates the station of the United States Border Patrol located at 25762 Madison Avenue in Murrieta, California, as the Theodore L. Newton, Jr., and George F. Azrak Border Patrol Station. 
   Forty years ago, Theodore Newton and George Azrak were tragically killed in the line of duty. The deaths of these two agents shook the foundations of the agency. 
   The two young Border Patrol agents were working the graveyard shift at a remote checkpoint when they were kidnapped from their post by drug smugglers. They were found murdered and handcuffed to a stove in an abandoned mountain shack. 
   These two agents, just like agents on the front line today, put themselves in harm's way to uphold the tradition of honor, integrity, and service in securing our Nation's borders. Over 100 employees of the Border Patrol have died in the line of duty since it was formed in 1924. 
   The Newton-Azrak Award, the Border Patrol's highest award, pays tribute to those who show courage and heroism in the face of grave danger. 
   This bill recognizes the ultimate sacrifice these men made, giving their lives in the service of their country. 
   I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same.

   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2671, introduced by the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), designates the United States courthouse located at 301 North Miami Avenue, Miami, Florida, as the C. Clyde Atkins United States Courthouse. 
   The bill recognizes Judge Atkins's dedication to the law and his fairness on the bench. In 1914, Judge Atkins was born in Washington, D.C. He received his law degree from the University of Florida College of Law in 1936 and began his career in the private practice of law in Stuart, Florida. 
   Judge Atkins's service to his community in the legal profession includes serving as president of the Dade County Bar Association, president of the Florida Bar Association, trustee of the Mercy Hospital, and trustee of Biscayne College. 
   In 1966, President Lyndon Johnson appointed Judge Atkins to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Judge Atkins served as chief justice on the district court from 1977 to 1982 when he assumed senior status. Judge Atkins's tenure on the bench ended with his passing at the age of 84 on March 11, 1999. 
   This legislation is a fitting tribute to Judge Atkins's service to equal justice. I support this legislation and urge my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3224 amends the National Dam Safety Program Act to establish a program to provide grant assistance to States for the rehabilitation and repair of deficient dams. 
   I would like to commend Congressman RANDY KUHL for his steadfast leadership on this issue. He was the original sponsor of similar legislation this year, and he was instrumental in the reauthorization of the National Dam Safety Program last year. I would also like to thank Mr. Salazar, again, for his leadership in this issue also. 
   This bill would authorize a program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide funding for repairs to publicly owned dams that would pose a direct risk to human life if they failed. The number of unsafe dams has risen by 80 percent since 1998 to more than 3,200.     
   This grant program would fund repairs of the most critical dams, which the Association of State Dam Safety officials estimates is a $10 billion need over the next 12 years. Dams require ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and rehabilitation. Many States are unable to fund necessary repairs to publicly owned dams without assistance from the Federal Government. This new program will provide assistance up to 65 percent of the cost of the repairs. H.R. 3224 authorizes the program for 5 years at $200 million. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is an important issue throughout the country in areas with numerous old and abandoned dams. Too often, the 19th century companies that built the dams no longer exist and local governments are left with orphaned dams in their jurisdiction. These downstream communities have a responsibility to protect their population, but they rarely have the tax base or revenue to repair the failing dams. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Madam Chairman, I am very excited the House is moving H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007. This is an example of the good we can accomplish when we are able to work in a bipartisan manner to address the Nation's water resources needs. 
   Beaches are an important part of American life. Our Nation has nearly 23,000 miles of ocean and Gulf shoreline along the continental United States, 5,500 miles of Great Lakes shorelines and 3.6 million miles of rivers and streams. Beaches are an important part of the coastal watershed, providing numerous recreational opportunities for millions of people, including fishing, boating, beachcombing, swimming, surfing, sunbathing and bird watching. 
   Each year, over 180 million people visit coastal waters for recreational purposes. This activity supports over 28 million jobs and leads to the investment of over $50 billion each year in goods and services. Public confidence in the quality of our Nation's water is important, not only to each citizen who swims, but also to the tourism and recreation industries that rely on safe and swimmable coastal waters. 
   To improve the public's confidence in the quality of our Nation's coastal waters and protect public health and safety, Congress passed the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000, commonly called the BEACH Act in the 106th Congress. 
   The BEACH Act aimed to limit and prevent human exposure to polluted coastal recreational waters by assisting States and local communities to implement beach monitoring, assessment and public notification programs. The act also called on States with coastal recreational waters to adopt pathogen-related water quality standards and directed EPA to conduct research and develop updated water quality criteria to protect human health. Under the BEACH Act, EPA has been making grants to States to help them implement programs to monitor beach water quality and notify the public if water quality standards for pathogens are not being met. 
   An important indicator of progress to date is the fact that all eligible States are now implementing the beach monitoring assessment and public notification provisions of the BEACH Act. The number of monitored beaches has increased from approximately 1,000 in 1997 to more than 3,500 in 2006. 
   In addition, EPA has strengthened water quality standards throughout all the coastal recreation waters in the United States. All 35 States and territories with coastal recreation waters now have water quality standards as protective of human health as EPA's water quality criteria. This is an increase from 11 States and territories in 2000. 
   Further, EPA has improved public access to data on beach advisories and closings by improving the agency's electronic beach data collection and delivery systems. Moreover, EPA has been conducting cutting edge research to support the development of new water quality criteria to protect human health from pathogens and new monitoring methods to more accurately and rapidly detect pathogen contamination in recreational waters. 
   Faster and better decisions are good for public health and good for the economy and beach communities. We are optimistic that this work will help State beach managers make the best decisions possible about keeping beaches open or placing them under advisory.     
   Although EPA and the States have made substantial progress in implementing the BEACH Act, there is important work left to do in the areas of monitoring, research and updating the existing water quality criteria. 
   Reauthorizing the BEACH Act will enable EPA and the States to complete the important work they have begun so they can better protect public health and safety and continue to improve the quality of our Nation's recreational coastal waters so important to the economies of our coastal communities. 
   H.R. 2537 passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee by a unanimous vote. I would like to thank the chairman of the committee, Mr. Oberstar, and the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, and especially a thank you to the ranking member, Mr. Mica, for all the hard work they have done put in to allow us to bring to you a consensus bill that enjoys strong bipartisan support. 
   I would also very much like to thank the staff. We have a bipartisan amendment that will be offered by Ms. Johnson at the appropriate time. It addresses technical and clarifying matters and other matters brought to the committee's attention since the committee filed its report. 
   I urge all Members to support the legislation.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. I agree with Mr. Flake and Mr. Pence about the situation of needing to earmark responsibly. And certainly earmarking to protect vulnerable Members, in fact, anything of that certainly is not for the good of the country and the good of Congress or whatever. 
   I guess what I question is that in this particular amendment, in this particular bill, I think it is inappropriate. This program is a formula-based grants program that has not been earmarked in the past and there's no plans to earmark it in the future. 
   We are not talking about beach restoration. We are not talking about beach reclamation. We are talking about a bill that allows States, allows beaches, to monitor pathogens so that when a family from Arkansas goes to Florida or goes to South Carolina, wherever they go, and they pull up, that they can, with safety, get out and swim in the waters without it being a cesspool. I wish that more people would sneak an earmark in the night to protect their beach. Again, that is not going to happen with this bill. It is not the purpose of the bill. 
   So I would ask that we vote against this, and yet again I feel very strongly that what Mr. Pence is saying, what Mr. Flake is trying to do with his amendment is appropriate, but not in this particular vehicle. I don't think that it pertains at all.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (COMMEMORATING THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE OKEECHOBEE HURRICANE OF SEPTEMBER 1928 -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I want to thank Mr. Hastings, the gentleman from Florida, and his Florida colleagues for bringing this resolution forward. 
   On September 16, 1928, one of the worst storms in Florida's history made landfall. While no reliable wind readings are available and the Saffire-Simpson hurricane scale had not been developed, there were reports of minimum pressures of 27.43 inches, making this the fourth strongest hurricane of record to hit the United States. 
   With wind speeds being recorded of up to 160 miles per hour, significant damages affected Caribbean nations, the United States, and its territories. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this hurricane would have been a strong category four storm when it struck the United States coast. 
   The damage to property was immense, estimated at $50 million in Puerto Rico and $25 million in Florida, equating to almost $35 billion when adjusted to today's dollars, making it the eighth most damaging hurricane in the Nation's history. 
   More importantly, this hurricane caused heavy casualties and catastrophic destruction along its path from the Leeward Islands to Florida. The worst tragedy occurred at inland Lake Okeechobee in Florida, where the hurricane caused a lake surge of six to nine feet that inundated the surrounding area. In some cases, the flood waters exceeded 12 feet, trees were uprooted, crops destroyed, homes torn from their foundations, and entire families drowned. 
   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center, up to 3,000 died in the United States and its territories. Small towns south of the lake were wiped from the Earth in this hurricane. Only the storm at Galveston, Texas, in 1900 caused greater loss of life. 
   While hurricanes still assault America's coastline, the Nation is better  prepared today to respond to these types of events. Storm damage reduction projects, warning systems, and mitigation efforts have helped to reduce the catastrophic loss of life as was witnessed in 1928. 
   As we commemorate this tragic event of 80 years ago, let us also recognize that today's investments in hurricane and flood risk reduction projects save both lives and property. 
   There are many ways to reduce the risk of storm damage in low-lying coastal areas, some are structural, such as levees and flood gates; some are nonstructural, such as zoning, response planning, and insurance. All levels of government must use their abilities and their budgets to reduce hurricane and flood damage in the Nation. 
   I urge all Members to support the resolution. And again, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for bringing this forward. Certainly, we need to remember events like this and prevent their occurrence in the future.

   Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam Speaker, as ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity, I am delighted with the product of our negotiations with the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. This is an excellent bill, and I think we can declare a victory for America's veterans. 
   I want to especially thank Chairman Filner and Ranking Member Buyer. This truly is an excellent product, and I appreciate your leadership in bringing it all together. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the excellent bipartisan manner in which Chairwoman Herseth Sandlin has led the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. She has done a tremendous job, and I congratulate her for a successful 110th Congress, and look forward to reversing roles with her again next year.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (J. JAMES EXON FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BUILDING -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   This legislation would name the Federal Bureau of Investigation Building in Omaha, Nebraska, the ``J. James Exon Federal Bureau of Investigation Building.'' 
   J. James Exon had a long and distinguished career in public service. He was born in Geddes, South Dakota, in 1921 and attended the University of Omaha. During World War II, Senator Exon served in the United States Army Signal Corps, and he continued to serve in the Army Reserve after he was honorably discharged in 1945. 
   Following the war, Senator Exon moved to the private sector, eventually starting his own business in 1953. He also became active in the political process leading to his election as Governor of Nebraska in 1971. 
   Senator Exon represented the citizens of the State of Nebraska as Governor for 8 years. As Governor of Nebraska, he developed a reputation of holding the line on taxes and spending. His commitment to service and his popularity led to his election as a U.S.  Senator in 1979, and he served in that capacity for 18 years. 
   With the exception of the late Senator George Norris, Senator Exon was the only Nebraskan to win five consecutive statewide elections. 
   Even after retiring from the U.S. Senate in 1997, Senator Exon continued to serve his country. He was appointed to a congressionally created committee led by the former Director of Central Intelligence, John M. Deutch, to examine the threat of weapons of mass destruction. Even then, he warned of the very real threat of terrorism. 
   Senator Exon had a long and distinguished career in serving the State of Nebraska and the Nation. It is a fitting tribute to Senator Exon's service that this building be named after him. 
   I support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SEPTEMBER 25, 1957, DESEGREGATION OF LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL BY THE LITTLE ROCK NINE -- (House of Representatives - September 24, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Speaker, on September 25th, our State--and our Nation--will recognize nine brave men and women who, when they were teenagers, came forward to claim their Constitutional right to an equal education despite protests, threats of violence and even the Arkansas National Guard. 
   I strongly Support this legislation which honors not only a red-letter date in our State's history, but a seminal event in the movement to unite our country as truly one people, indivisible. 
   Fifty years ago, Minnijean Brown, Elizabeth Eckford, Ernest Green, Thelma Mothershed, Melba Pattillo, Gloria Ray, Terrence Roberts, Jefferson Thomas, and Carlotta Walls, climbed the steps of Central High School. Few other moments in our history can compare to the ascent made by the Little Rock Nine. It was an ascent to a new plateau in the relations of Americans to their fellow citizens and a new plateau on the path to the American we now know. 
   On September 25, 1957, when the Nine made it to the top of those Central High School steps, they stood in a place where, up till that point, others said they could not go. Then, they did what was, in fact, the most important thing that day: They went inside to learn. 
   While Central High School will always be the event at the forefront of our memories when it comes to the history of desegregation, it is my hope that, as we remember the Nine, we can also remember the other schools in our State which preceded them, including Fayetteville, Hoxie, and the community of Charleston--who first broke down the barrier in Arkansas on August 23, 1954. 
   I would also like to remember the names of Joe Ferguson, Jessie Ferguson, Mary Ferguson, Barbara Williams, Robert Williams, Etholia Williams, Time Freeman, Betty Freeman, Myrdle Freeman, Leroy Jones, Raymond Webb, Duty Webb, and Henry Web, who joined their fellow residents of Charleston to bring about peaceful change. 
   As we spend this day reflecting on our past, we should remember all the brave children, families, and educators across the state who--by their courage--set in motion a chain of events which created the Arkansas of the present and will resonate in the Arkansas of the future.

<DOCNO>Mr. BOOZMAN. (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES WATER SUPPLY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - March 08, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise in support of H.R. 700, the Healthy Communities Water Supply Act of 2007. I want to thank the chairwoman and the ranking member, Mr. Baker, for their hard work on this particular bill. 
   H.R. 700 extends the pilot program under the Clean Water Act for alternative water source projects. 
   Growth in population, increasing demands for water, and drought are resulting in water shortages in many areas around our Nation, both in the west and the east. 
   Many communities are finding that their water supply needs cannot be met by existing water supplies. As a result, many communities and their water resource development agencies are looking at alternative ways to alleviate their water shortages and enhance water supplies to meet their future water needs. 
   This is an important issue not only for my home State of Arkansas but for the many other parts of the country facing increasing demands for water. 
   Adequate water is needed to sustain our country's economic growth and viability. Some of the approaches they are looking at involve reclaiming, reusing or conserving water that has already been used. 
   H.R. 700 provides an authority to help communities meet some of their critical water supply needs through water reclamation, reuse, conservation and management. 
   H.R. 700 authorizes $125 billion for the EPA to make grants to water resource development agencies for these sorts of alternative water source projects. The program leverages non-Federal resources by requiring a non-Federal cash of 50 percent. 
   I urge all Members to support this important bill. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
