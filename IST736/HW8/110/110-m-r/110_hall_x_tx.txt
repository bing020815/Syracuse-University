<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (PRODUCED WATER UTILIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - July 30, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I thank Mr. Matheson and his fine staff, the staffs on both sides of the aisle, for doing a very good job on this bill. 
   Madam Speaker, I rise today, of course, in support of H.R. 2339, the Produced Water Utilization Act of 2008. I introduced H.R. 2339 in May of last year, and it was recently reported out of the Committee of Science and Technology by a voice vote. It comes to the floor today with unanimous, bipartisan support. 
   For those who are not familiar with the term, the Department of the Interior defines produced water as mainly salty water trapped in reservoir rock and brought up along with oil or gas during production. Produced water cannot, in its current form, be used for any purposes, and it is most commonly reinjected into the ground at great expense to small producers across the country. Each barrel of oil produced generates approximately 10 barrels of produced water, and we currently produce over 5 billion gallons of produced water a day in the United States. That is enough water to accommodate 14.3 million homes a day. 
   As we are facing shortages in energy and water, my bill could not be more timely, in my opinion. H.R. 2339 is legislation that has two main purposes: one, increasing domestic energy production by lowering production costs for small producers; two, increasing the amount of water available for agricultural, irrigational, municipal, and industrial uses by making produced water usable. The Produced Water Utilization Act will provide important funding for research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of technologies to purify and use produced water. 
   There is a critical interdependency between energy and water. Water is needed to produce energy, and the treatment and distribution of water requires energy, and as our population grows, so will the demands grow on both. According to a report by the Department of Energy on the Interdependency of Energy and Water, ``The lack of integrated energy and water planning and management has already impacted energy production in many basins and regions across the country. For example, in three of the fastest growing regions in the country, the Southeast, Southwest, and the Northwest, new power plants have been opposed because of potential negative impacts on water supplies. Also, recent droughts and emerging limitations of water resources have many States, including Texas, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Tennessee, scrambling to develop water use priorities for different water use sectors.'' We obviously need to take a serious look at how we can avoid a water/energy crisis, and my bill certainly helps. 
   Madam Speaker, produced water is currently considered an expensive nuisance by oil and gas producers, but it could be--no, it needs to be--considered  a valuable, usable commodity. With the research and development set forth in the Produced Water Utilization Act, we can make it happen. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.  
   Mr. GINGREY, Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2339--the Produced Water Utilization Act of 2008--introduced by the Ranking Member of the Science Committee, Mr. Hall of Texas. I want to thank Mr. Hall for constructing this important legislation and for the leadership he has provided to the Committee throughout the 110th Congress. 
   Produced water is comprised of mainly salty water that is trapped in reservoir rock below ground. It comes to the surface when drilling for oil or natural gas and usually contains oil and metals from production. Approximately 10 barrels of produced water are captured for every barrel of oil derived, and that results in a total of 15-20 billion barrels of produced water generated here in the United States on an annual basis. 
   H.R. 2339 directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a program for research and development to harvest produced water in an environmentally safe way for irrigation, municipal, and industrial purposes. Once this program is established, we can help address the droughts that are occurring across the country--including in my Northwest Georgia district--simply by providing the public with additional water resources. 
   Madam Speaker, the United States could be generating even more produced water if the Democratic Majority would allow for the environmentally safe drilling of oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Polls show that a majority of Americans would support energy exploration in a small portion of ANWR, which could yield an additional 1.5 million barrels of oil a day. These efforts have unfortunately been foiled by radical environmentalists, content with skyrocketing gas prices. 
   So, Madam Speaker, to be clear: if we open up ANWR for drilling and enact this legislation, not only will we help reduce the price that the American people are paying at the pump, but we will also be better prepared to stave off anticipated drought conditions across the country. 
   H.R. 2339 only reinforces the need for us to drill here and drill now: to save money at the pump and increase the amount of water we have available in the United States. I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency, better known as the EPA, is the Nation's lead agency charged with protecting the environment and supporting the goals of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act by providing methods, approaches and tools needed to protect water sources. As such, relevant and high-quality research and development is very vital to EPA's ability to carry out its many missions. 
   However, EPA's research and development program is far from comprehensive or rationally organized. As of today, EPA only conducts coordinated research and development activities in three areas; water quality protection, watershed management, and source control management. And while these are essential research areas, I believe EPA is missing a critical component to their research agenda, and that is the research and development of technologies that increase efficiency and conservation. 
   According to the American Water Works Association, an international nonprofit scientific and educational organization, daily indoor per capita water consumption in a typical single family home is about 70 gallons. By installing more efficient water fixtures and checking for leaks, single family homes may reduce their daily per capita water consumption by about 35 percent. 
   While some of these technologies are on the market and utilized, many water-saving ideas linger in the research phase for lack of a coordinated Federal research program. 
   H.R. 3957 establishes a research and development program for water efficiency technologies and conservation at the EPA. It instructs the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Research and Development to develop a strategic research plan, coordinated with other relevant EPA strategic plans, to compel synchronization of different research agendas. 
   EPA is to use recommendations in existing reports from the National Academies and the National Science and Technology Council in the development of the plan. However, their effort should not be just a regurgitation of previous work. 
   Other countries, such as Israel, have invested significant resources in water efficiency and conservation research areas. We, too, have to invest resources if we are to weather water shortages in the future. 
   Madam Speaker, at a time when our Nation is really facing greater numbers of water events, we just can't afford to fall behind on technology research and development. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3957. 
   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND SECURITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 06, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have just heard Mr. Dingell mention World War II and Pearl Harbor and I heard Mr. Pearce answer him; and they are both correct in what they said, that that was an energy war. 
   I remember like yesterday, I was 17 years old standing on the banks of the Tombigbee River in Alabama, and a guy ran down and said the Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor. I didn't know where Pearl Harbor was. I said, we had better hitchhike back to Dallas; those Japanese will go straight to Washington. I thought Pearl Harbor was down around Mobile somewhere. That is how ignorant I was about the Nation at that time, but I am a little smarter now. And I remember well that Cordell Hull and Henry Stimson cut the energy off from Japan. They had 13 months' national existence. They had to break out and go somewhere, and we had to know they were going to. That was an energy war. So I am a little disappointed in the majority. 
   During the campaign, they blamed the Republicans for high energy prices. Here, before us today, is a bill that the Democrats are touting as the end to high energy prices. There is one big obvious problem with the bill: there is nothing in this bill that will bring any relief to the citizens of our great country or that will lower the cost of a tank of gasoline or the monthly electricity bills. It will likely in fact have the opposite effect. 
   The bill authorizes billions and billions of dollars in new government spending programs, and mandates electric companies to use more expensive ways for electricity generation, whether they are able to or whether they are not able to. If you don't think that is going to make your electricity bill go up even more, then you are not really being realistic. Electric companies are a business just like any other business; and if their costs go up, they are going to pass them along. 
   We don't need to mandate Federal renewable electricity standards. Twenty-eight States and the District of Columbia already have a renewable portfolio standard in place. These standards were made on the State level based on what renewable sources are available in each State, and it is wrong for the Federal Government to enforce a one-size-fits-all standard. My home State of Texas has a very successful RPS. Since its inception in 1999, Texas has become the Nation's leader in wind energy. In June of this year, a Texan put forward plans to build the Nation's largest wind farm in the panhandle of the State. This would be four times larger than the current wind farm. 
   Anyone, anyone who is serious about lowering the cost of gasoline, then, along with research and development and renewable sources of energy, they would be providing incentives to the oil and gas industry to explore more areas of our country for oil and gas. They would be providing incentives to develop our domestic sources of oil and gas. They would be providing incentives to build more refineries. These  things are not only important to address today's high cost, but also for our national security. 
   We cannot forget that we import a huge amount of oil from OPEC countries that are willing to take our American dollars, but many are not really our friends. We are shamefully dependent on foreign sources of oil. We can't continue to compromise our national security. 
   Another opportunity the Democrats completely ignore in this bill is a chance to promote the use of clean coal for much-needed new power plants and as a source of transportation fuel. It has been said before that the United States is the Saudi Arabia of coal. So why are we not encouraging the environmentally friendly use of this abundant and inexpensive domestic resource? These facilities would have the best technologies to capture emissions in order to produce clean electricity and the clean fuel that can be used immediately in our Nation's pipelines, filling stations, and in our automobiles. 
   My constituents are doing their part to help the environment, but they need to be able to afford to put gas in their cars so they can get to work to provide food for their families and clothes for their children. A lot of my constituents don't have transportation options. There is no bus system or rail system. They live 45 miles from work, so they certainly can't take a bike. They need their cars. They need the fuel that they put into them to be affordable. I don't see a glimmer of hope for them in this bill. 
   Mr. Speaker, I do feel very strongly that we should be looking to efficiency, conservation, and renewable alternatives of energy to become part of our portfolio. And I support the provisions in this bill that do that; however, there are so many harmful things in this bill that I think the bad, ugly highly outweighs the good. 
   I supported and voted for the bipartisan R&D provisions as they existed coming out of the Science and Technology Committee and generally remain supportive. However, I am concerned with some changes and additions made in this amendment, changes that came about without the opportunity for vetting or Member involvement. Participation by all Members leads to a better product, and we know that. 
   For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 garnered the support of 38 Democrats who are still in the House when initially passed by the House. When brought to the floor later that year for final passage, it garnered the support of almost 70 Democrats who are still in this House. 
   Mr. Speaker, I can't stress how important energy is to our country. We have urged drilling in the Outer Shelf. Yes, China drills just off the coast of Key West today. And we have urged drilling in ANWR. I urge our colleagues not to play politics with our energy future.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume and make sure that I can reserve enough for those that will follow me. 
   Madam Chairman, H.R. 6063, sponsored by my good friend Mark Udall, authorizes the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for fiscal year 2009. As our chairman has very adequately stated, it's a product of very close bipartisan consultation and cooperation led by Chairman Udall and by Chairman Gordon. 
   Representative Tom Feeney, ranking member of the Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, and I are original cosponsors of this bill, and it builds a 1-year authorization. The intent of the bill is to keep NASA on its current path towards completing the International Space Station, retiring the Space Shuttle, maintaining a balanced set of science and aeronautics research programs, and developing a new launch system capable of taking humans beyond the low earth orbit, a feat the Shuttle cannot do. 
   The bill is also meant to reaffirm Congress's unwavering support for NASA so as to remove any doubt the next administration might have about Congress's commitment to NASA's program and to NASA's policies. 
   By being a 1-year bill, it also is designed, I think, to not tie the hands of the next administration to a long-term strategy. To the contrary, H.R. 6063 is designed to give the next President an opportunity to work with the next Congress to fashion a long-term strategy that is consistent with the administration's desires as well as the wishes of Congress. 
   H.R. 6063 contains a number of important provisions. It authorizes $19.2 billion for NASA for fiscal year 2009 and provides an additional $1 billion to accelerate development of the new Constellation crew vehicle launch system. It emphasizes that NASA should maintain a strong and balanced array of science, aeronautics, and human spaceflight programs and also directs NASA to fly out its full manifest of Shuttle missions, including those dedicated to flying spare parts to the International Space Station, as well as adding a flight to take the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer to the ISS as we originally committed to do so some years ago. This experiment was stricken from the Shuttle manifest following the Columbia tragedy, but I think given the huge sunk investment in AMS, we ought to make good on our original commitments to fly this expensive instrument to the ISS. 
   H.R. 6063 directs NASA to continue the important task of developing the Constellation system which will provide our country with a modern, more robust and safer manned spaceflight capability that will enable our astronauts to fly out of low earth orbit, an ability we haven't had since the retirement of Apollo over 30 years ago. 
   As most of you are aware, once the Shuttle is retired at the end of this decade, our country will have to buy seats from the Russians for as long as maybe 5 years even to assure U.S. presence on the International Space Station. Our payments for rides on Soyuz spacecraft have not yet been negotiated, but it's going to be expensive. NASA estimates it will cost more than $2 billion, and sadly, we're making these purchases at a time when NASA will be laying off thousands of engineers and technicians from the Shuttle program in an effort to minimize our reliance on the Russians. 
   As I mentioned a moment ago, this bill authorizes an additional $1 billion to speed up the development of the new Constellation system. This initial investment is more than justified. 
   This bill also includes a number of provisions to encourage NASA working with the private sector to foster development of a domestic cargo launch capability primarily designed to take supplies to the space station. In addition, 6063 includes language directing NASA to solicit for commercial crew launch capability. 
   Turning to other parts of NASA, let me quickly say H.R. 6063 embraces a number of recommendations that were put forth by the witnesses from government, from industry, from academia, and testified, all of them testified in hearings before our committee over the previous 18 months. These are sensible provisions designed to strengthen aeronautic space science and earth science research programs, encourage technology, risk reduction policies and activities, foster efficient technology, transfer from NASA to other Federal agencies under the private sector, detect and mitigate the threat of near-earth objects, and research and monitor the effects of space weather on satellites.     
   This list is not exhaustive, but I wanted to mention these few examples to emphasize to all Members the breadth of this bill and how it improves upon many of NASA's activities and programs. 
   So as we stand here today, the space shuttle is in orbit, wrapping up another assembly mission to the International Space Station. May I add that the spouse of one of our Members, Representative Giffords of Arizona, is currently commanding this mission. 
   NASA has had two other recent success activities. Just 15 days ago, the Phoenix Mars Lander successfully completed a soft landing on the red planet's surface and is in the early stages of searching for evidence of ice and organic compounds. And yesterday, NASA successfully launched a gamma-ray large area space telescope onboard a Delta II rocket. 
   These are but three of the most current NASA accomplishments. There are many, many other great achievements in aeronautics, space science, and Earth science research that I could talk about, but time doesn't permit. Suffice it to say that NASA is one of the most exciting and innovative Federal agencies, and it serves as a huge inspiration to our young people to take a serious interest in math and science education. 
   Before closing, I want to point out that during development of this bill, the subcommittee Democratic staff have been very open and forthright, sharing early ideas and drafts of the bill with our Republican staff. It has been a close and productive partnership, and I want to especially praise the work and hard work of my good, personal friend Dick Obermann. And I certainly want to thank our chairman, Chairman BART GORDON. 
   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 1467, the 10,000 Trained by 2010 Act, and the primary goal it seeks to achieve. If implemented correctly and efficiently, health information technology, which we call IT, can revolutionize our health care system. 
   However, we have to have an educated workforce properly trained in health IT in order for it to be successful. This is what H.R. 1467 is all about. NSF is already doing incredible work in the IT area, but this measure focuses specifically on health IT by providing grants on new innovative approaches for health care hardware and software solutions. 
   Creating health medical informatics research centers and making improvements to undergraduate and master's degree programs for health care informatics, it also expands the Advanced Technology Education Program to include health IT. 
   The activities supported by H.R. 1467 are important if we are to have a sufficiently trained health IT workforce, and I encourage my colleagues to adopt this bill.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague for those comments, and I would also point out this program will provide new technologies that will allow us to tap nearly 50 billion barrels of technically recoverable oil remaining in this country. 
   The United States has 55 years of natural gas resources in the lower 48, but much of it requires new technologies in order to produce it. Some 80 percent of these resources are on lands that are not subject to any access restrictions. New technologies will increase domestic energy supplies and increasing supplies will lower energy costs to consumers.     
   These technologies will enable less expensive, more efficient and more environmentally friendly domestic natural gas production. The universities and research institutions participating in this program are as follows: Colorado School of Mines; Florida International University; Jackson State University; Louisiana State University; MIT; Mississippi State University; New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology; Penn State University; Rice University; Stanford; Texas A&M; University of Alabama; University of Alaska-Fairbanks; University of Houston; University of Kansas; University of Michigan; University of Oklahoma; University of South Carolina; University of Southern California; University of Texas; University of Tulsa; University of Utah and West Virginia University. 
   In addition, the following national labs are funded through this program: Idaho National Laboratory; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. The House favorably voted on this provision in 2001, 2003, and 2005 and again on the conference report in 2005. Additionally, the House overwhelmingly voted last year to uphold the program by voting against an amendment to strike it by a vote of 161-255. These votes send a clear message that Congress supports this research and development program and all the benefits it will bring to the American public.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. 
   I speak as the ranking member of the Science and Technology Committee, and I support Dr. Gingrey of Georgia. And the problem is the process. 
   Actually, this committee oversees on some of the most exciting parts of the Federal Government. We hear from astronauts at NASA about new discoveries in space. We work with scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology to ensure that the best technology informs decisions, such as new materials, even for bulletproof vests, standards for the nanotechnology industry. 
   At the Department of Energy, we support research and the technologies to make America energy independent. And I guess through the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies, we oversee the $2 billion interagency climate change science program. In fact, on Wednesday, the Science and Technology Committee will consider a bill, H.R. 906, to reauthorize this very important research program. 
   This is exactly why I was a little disturbed when I read H.R. 2643 and saw the provision establishing a commission on climate change, which is supposed to review the science challenges associated with adapting to climate change. That mission is the same as already existing interagency climate change science program. Also, establishing an interagency commission clearly violates clause 2 of rule XXI which prohibits changing existing law in an appropriations bill. The current interagency climate change science program was established by a Science Committee bill in 1990, the Global Change Research Act. 
   Actually, climate change science falls clearly within the jurisdiction of the Science and Technology Committee, and this provision of H.R. 2643 clearly violates clause 2 of rule XXI. For these reasons, I urge all my colleagues to support the rules of the House and the jurisdiction of the committee and vote ``yes'' for the Gingrey amendment. 
   The Acting CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment en bloc offered by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Gingrey). 
   The amendment was rejected.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today, of course, in opposition to H.R. 6. While I would like to believe that we all have the same goal in creating energy independence for our country, I really regret that this bill before us today would not lead us to that goal. This is really, I am very fearful, just the initial attack or one of the early attacks on an industry that is going to have other attacks this year, that survived the windfall profit tax that passed during the Jimmy Carter years of disaster, as far as energy was concerned. 
   This energy act is more likely to increase the dependence on foreign oil. By decreasing after-tax revenues for oil and gas companies, including the small independent producers that are considered small businessmen, the effect will be an increase in the cost of energy to consumers and a decrease in domestic exploration and production of oil and natural gas, because companies will have less money available to them for their activities. 
   This will, of course, require our country to import more oil and natural gas from countries that are not our natural allies. We will be dependent on these countries and to the OPEC group to supply us with the lifeblood of our economy. I just can't in good conscience vote for anything that would have that type of outcome. 
   I have said all along that this country will fight for energy, and the way to prevent our sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters from having to go overseas to take some oil away from someone or another country is to ensure that we utilize our own natural resources efficiently and effectively. 
   I am well aware that drilling alone on U.S. soil is not going to quickly solve all of our problems. I know that we also need to expand our usage of renewable energy and increase the efficiency of how we use fossil fuels. This is why I am supportive of the legislation that passed last Congress on a voice vote under suspension of the rules by my colleague from Illinois, Congresswoman Biggert. Among other initiatives, her bill supports the development and advancement of renewable energy in areas such as solar, wind, biofuels, coal, and encourages energy efficiency in buildings and technology. 
   I am fully supportive of seeing these initiatives enacted now. We have unanimous bipartisan support. Why do we need to wait for ``subsequent legislation,'' as is stated in the Rahall bill? Let's not wait any longer to ensure energy independence. 
   The United States has substantial amounts of oil and natural gas, but our laws prevent our domestic companies from accessing these resources in both onshore and offshore areas. In fact, we are the only country in the world that has limited ourselves like this. If our goal really is energy independence, then we need to increase access to our domestic resources, not increase taxes on one industry.     
   The point to remember here is that the Tax Code has little to do with the increase in energy prices. So penalizing oil and gas companies by increasing their taxes is not going to solve our energy problem. 
   Make no mistake, this country will fight for energy, and if we have to we  will send our sons and daughters across the ocean to take energy away from someone when we have plenty right here at home. 
   Let us help our constituents, not hurt them. Vote against H.R. 6. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

It also showcases the important contributions that engineers have made to our society. 
   Engineers have a critical role to play to help keep our Nation ahead of the innovation curve. It is essential that we capitalize on opportunities such as National Engineers Week to raise the awareness of the valuable work and contributions of engineers to society and to attract young people of all ages to this very rewarding profession.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today, of course, in opposition to the Senate amendment to H.R. 6. And as I've said before on many occasions, I think our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have really missed an opportunity to pass energy legislation that would actually do something to produce and enhance supplies of domestic sources of energy. 
   The bill before us today does absolutely nothing. It doesn't produce a barrel of oil. And I'm from an energy State. Ten of our States are energy States. I don't see how anybody from energy States can vote for a bill that calls itself an energy bill that doesn't produce any energy. 
   It's really a sad day. But it's not sad for people my age and the people of the average age of this body here. It's sad for those juniors and seniors in high school and those in early college, those that might be called on to go overseas and take energy away from someone when we have plenty right here at home which we could be mining. 
   It's sad that we're not hitting ANWR. It's sad that we're depending on Saudi Arabia for 40 percent of our energy and 20 percent from other Arab nations when they don't like us and we don't like them and we don't trust them. 
   This is a bill that will put our children on troop ships to go somewhere to take oil or gas or energy away from countries when we don't have to. We have plenty right here in this country. But we're turning our backs on the young people of this Nation, and we ought to be ashamed for it. 
   This is a lousy bill. It's a bad energy bill. It should be defeated. It won't be defeated. But I certainly ask everybody to vote against it.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1068. It will strengthen the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991. 
   Tomorrow, the Committee on Science and Technology will hold a hearing on U.S. innovation and competitiveness. High-performance computers have a role to play in our economic competitiveness, as they vastly enhance our ability to perform very complex computations quickly and they do it efficiently. H.R. 1068 will help ensure that American researchers have access to the very best tools available as they tackle cutting-edge problems in key fields such as nanotechnology, homeland security, and biotechnology. In addition, this bill helps reinforce the Federal commitment to ``supercomputing,'' a commitment that becomes increasingly more important as European and Asian countries continue to increase their investment in developing and purchasing the next generation of supercomputers. 
   Nobody knows this measure better than my distinguished colleague from Illinois (Mrs. Biggert). She has worked tirelessly in two previous Congresses to have this important legislation enacted. In fact, she has been successful in the House on both occasions, only to see it stall on the Senate side. 
   In an effort to keep that from happening again, we have made a few modifications to help ensure it gets Senate support. With these slight alterations, I hope we will find that the third time is a charm.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (ENERGY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACT -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in support of H.R. 85, the Energy Technology Transfer Act, that was introduced by Congresswoman Judy Biggert, a most valuable and respected member of the Science Committee and former chairwoman of the Energy Subcommittee. I thank her and Mr. Miller from North Carolina for their work on this bill. 
   There is concern that there is not enough assistance or education available in the area of transferring technologies in energy efficiency and distributed clean energy that has been developed by the Department of Energy and the national laboratories to energy end users. 
   In this time of heightened awareness of how much energy we are using and how much energy costs, how dependent we are on foreign countries for energy feedstocks and how to continue the emissions reductions achieved thus far under various programs, it makes sense to do all we can to make sure that energy end users are as informed as possible about what is available to them to help them become more energy efficient. 
   H.R. 85 would amend section 917 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which requires the Secretary of Energy to distribute grants to establish a network of advanced energy technology transfer centers for the transfer of advanced energy technologies and methods to a wide range of energy end users, including individuals, businesses and building and industrial professionals. 
   The bill does not create a new program. It simply improves upon the current section 917 by specifying types of activities that may be funded, minimum criteria and priorities for qualifying applications, duration of funding, and grantee evaluation requirements. 
   Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (REAUTHORIZING THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM ENERGY CONSERVATION AND TECHNOLOGY COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 1988 -- (House of Representatives - March 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1126, a bill to reauthorize the Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988. This legislation has been passed unanimously by this body for the past two Congresses, and I hope it will do so again today. 
   The Department of Energy's steel-related energy-efficiency research and development program was first established in 1986 and was expanded to a broader ``metals initiative'' in 1988 when the President signed into law the Steel and Aluminum Energy Conservation and Technology Competitiveness Act of 1988. 
   Reauthorization of appropriations for the program occurred in 1992 with the passage of the Energy Policy Act, but expired in 1997. The steel industry and the Department of Energy continued the partnership under the Metals Initiative and its predecessor, the Steel Initiative, after the authorization expired. This bill would reauthorize the important program through 2012 and expand it slightly by adding research on technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
   The metals industry is one of the most energy-intensive industries, with energy accounting for a major portion of the cost of production. Improving energy efficiency for this industry will help to reduce the cost of steel and keep American steelmakers competitive in the world market. Improving efficiency will also help with our country's goal to become energy independent and environmentally responsible. 
   Investment made at the government level in partnership with industry to stimulate achievement of this increased energy efficiency has shown great results. Over the years, 58 steel  companies and 23 research organizations participated in and benefited from this program. According to testimony from the United States Steel Corporation, through this program they saw a ``set of projects that saved nearly a barrel of oil per Federal dollar invested. Or, in terms of the environment, a ton of CO  
   2 for every $2 of Federal money invested, all the while delivering real technology to the plant floor to help maintain a competitive advantage.'' 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 1126. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES ON H.R. 2272, 21ST CENTURY COMPETITIVENESS ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - July 31, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today to offer a straightforward motion to instruct conferees on H.R. 2272, a bill to invest in innovation through research and development, and to improve the competitiveness of the United States. 
   This motion to instruct the conferees simply insists that the House conferees support the House position. It does this in two important ways that I believe will make the conference report better and Members on both sides of the aisle proud to support it. 
   First, the motion to instruct encourages the conferees to insist on the overall House authorization level, which is considerably lower than the Senate authorization level. In fact, estimates put the bill as passed by the Senate at approximately $40 billion higher than the total House authorization level. 
   Second, this motion to instruct insists that House conferees support the previously adopted House position with regard to giving priority to grants to expand domestic energy production through the use of coal-to-liquids. That type technology and advanced nuclear reprocessing should be used. 
   I believe this is an important section of the bill that will help to ensure that we are preparing our scientists and our engineers for the future of energy security. 
   Many Members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats, voted in favor of the authorization level and voted in favor of this program, including my good friend, the chairman of the Science and Technology Committee. I am encouraging Members to stand up for the House position on these two issues. 
   Before I explain the importance of the provision regarding grants to expand energy production, let me take a moment to compare the authorization level in the House bill with the authorization level in the Senate bill. 
   As the ranking member of the Committee on Science and Technology, I strongly support an increase in funding for the agencies that perform scientific research in this country. Without these agencies, we would fall far behind the rest of the world in innovation. 
   Some of the greatest inventions of our time have come from the brilliant scientists of our country. To remain competitive as a Nation, we must encourage new ideas and educate new young minds, but we must also be mindful to exercise fiscal responsibility. The young minds we are educating should not be taught irresponsible spending habits. We have to lead by example. 
   The House bill contains substantial increases for the sciences very close to the President's request, and moves us closer to the goal the President has set out in the State of the Union Message calling for a doubling of the spending on the sciences. 
   The Senate bill includes a vast increase in spending that is approximately $8 billion above the budget request by the administration for this year alone. I encourage my colleagues to work with me to increase spending on science in a responsible fashion. 
   As we move to conference on the competitiveness bill, I also want to encourage my colleagues to support the provision in the House bill urging researchers to invest time and to invest money into advancing coal-to-liquids technology and nuclear reprocessing. 
   There are, as my colleagues stated previously on the floor of this Chamber, several pieces to the energy puzzle. One very important piece continues to be the efficient and affordable research and development of this Nation's domestic energy resources. Twenty-seven percent of the world's recoverable coal reserves are in the United States and spread throughout our country, which would minimize supply disruptions in the event of a natural disaster or in the event of a terrorist attack. 
   We are currently importing around 60 percent of our oil supply, and that number is projected to grow unless we do something about it. As the Saudi Arabia of coal, if our Nation can economically produce liquid transportation fuel from coal, we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil and increase the security of this country. 
   We also need to better manage our nuclear energy resources. In the pursuit of expanding our nuclear fleet, we should encourage scientists and engineers early in their careers to focus on the development of abandoned nuclear reprocessing technologies. We need to invigorate our aging nuclear sector so this energy source continues to serve as a clean, affordable, domestic energy resource for our consumers. 
   The House may soon be taking up an energy package. To my knowledge, this energy package contains no language on coal-to-liquids and very little on nuclear energy. Given the fact that our Nation's continued growth and prosperity depend on affordable and reliable energy resources, I am disappointed that we are not promoting all options for Americans. This opportunity may be one of the few Members get to support our Nation's coal and our Nation's nuclear interests. We should take every opportunity to address citizens' concerns with rising energy prices. And that is why I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of this provision on this date. 
   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, you have indulged me as long as I can ask you to, and so has this gentleman from way out in deep west Texas. I'm honored to be here with him, so I will go ahead and close. 
   As I wrap up here, I want to encourage the House Members to support the authorization level as it remains. It is as appropriate now as it was when the bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House. 
   And I also want to reiterate my frustration of America's continued dependence on foreign sources of energy and encourage my colleagues to explore domestic sources of energy. 
   For some reason, there's a war against energy from fossil fuels going right on down at this very time, this very day, and I'm not sure why. Anyone with just a little common sense is able to understand that in order to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil and to increase our national security, we need everything we can develop. We need conventional, renewable and alternative sources of energy. Our country at this time will not be able to continue to thrive and lead the world on renewable energy alone, so to punish the oil and gas industry and to not encourage alternative uses of coal and continued use of nuclear power is to ensure the United States will lose its place as a world leader. 
   Make no mistake, I support the continued development and increased use of renewable energy, but not at the expense of fossil fuels and clean nuclear energy. 
   Madam Speaker, the House is already on record supporting this language and this authorization level just 3 months ago. I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't be supported again today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote to keep this House-passed language in the bill that will result from the conference committee. And, Madam Speaker, thank you for your indulgence. 
   I yield back the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I won't take all that much time. 
   I've heard it said that water and fire are wonderful friends and fearful enemies, and I'm sure that's been said a lot of times today. And we know the terrible devastation that both of these can bring. 
   Thousands of people die in the United States every year due to fire, and many more are injured. The total would be even higher if it weren't for the dedication and the service of our Nation's fire men and women. 
   I don't know how you can say enough about our Nation's firefighters. I would say this: It's kind of a shame that it took a 9/11 for people to really fully appreciate firefighters and men and women that defend us and defend our property and our lives. I just think they're treasures of the country, and it's good for this Congress to honor them every chance we get. And that's why I'm very pleased that the Committee on Science and Technology has taken the time to deliberate and produce a bill that will greatly contribute to the effectiveness of the United States Fire Administration, and by extension, the local men and women who serve us so very well. 
   I'd like to thank the gentlemen from Arizona and Georgia for their leadership on this bill, as well as the rest of the colleagues on the committee for their work. And I, of course, urge passage of H.R. 4847 and yield back the balance of my time after once again saying that it's unusual that it would take some kind of devastation like we had in our sister State over here to really bring the full appreciation of men and women who, day and night, face the fires and face protection of our property and our goods. I'm honored to be a part of recognizing them and saying to them one more time from the bottom of our hearts, we thank you, we appreciate what you're doing, and we look forward to the fact that you're going to be able to continue to do it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (NEW DIRECTION FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT -- (House of Representatives - August 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I have more problems with the amendment than I do with the author, and maybe the author and I can talk here and then get together and work some things out. 
   Actually, my problems with it is that we are told that it amends the biofuels subtitle and creates a university based research and development competitive grant program in a geographically diverse manner. That's a pretty long sentence there for me to try to figure out exactly what it means. But as I go down through it and see, in awarding the grants, it says that ``priority should be given to institutions of higher education with all of the following.'' I want to point out these ``following,'' and I know that the author is probably going to be able to explain them to me. 
   But I remember one time in the Texas Senate when we had a man stand up and he was trying to pass a bill as to where all the voting machines had to be constructed, and they all had to be constructed in a county in Texas, and he described the county as being in excess of 20,000 but not in excess of 20,003, and his county had 20,002 in it. 
   Now, I don't know if your labeling of these narrows it down to one institution or two institutions. I know there aren't any in Texas, because we don't have any Indians in Texas. But could you give me a little explanation on that?

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Do you mind if I just lay out what is in the bill? It says it has to be an established program of research and renewable energy. That's fine. 
   Locations that are low income or outside of an urbanized area, I guess that's okay. 
   A joint venture with an Indian tribe, that's where you start to lose me. 
   In proximity to trees dying of disease or insect infestation as a source of woody biomass, that one really does get to me. I just don't know how much biomass is adjacent to any of the universities, particularly any of the universities in my area, certainly not in my district. 
   And the amendment authorizes $25 million with no fiscal year designation. And a little bit further, it is unclear from the all-inclusive list of how many colleges and universities would be eligible to receive these grants under this section. 
   If you could just explain a few of those and tell me you would work with me before we get to the front gate, I would be glad to listen.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   As I read this amendment, it creates both a Solar Energy Industries Research and Promotion Board and then also creates a Solar Energy Research and Promotion Operating Committee, which would be established and administered with fees assessed involuntarily against solar manufacturers and importers. I guess one of the things that I'm concerned about is this will eventually be passed on to consumers, to customers, that will wind up paying it. I would like to know more about how voluntary it is. 
   Actually, it creates two additional layers of bureaucracy for the Secretary of Energy to promote solar power. I don't see any reason why we don't just give DOE a grant to promote solar power, if that's the goal for it. There's no really added benefit to creating both a solar board and a solar committee. I don't understand why you'd have to have both of those or why you don't lessen it down just to one solar organization. 
   I note that the solar manufacturers and importers don't have a chance nor a choice as to the creation of the board or the payment of the fees assessed to promote the use of solar power. I see somewhere in the bill here where there's a huge fine there, a civil penalty, if certain things aren't done. I think it's something that really needs to be looked at and really needs some work on it between now and the time the Senate works on it or the time we get to conference. 
   As I read it again, it has the payment of a fee that also might be enforced by a civil action by the Secretary of Energy and the Attorney General, with a civil penalty of up to $25,000. That's a pretty serious fee. And I can see how that might be passed on to any area there of operation. 
   So here you have a fee, you have a board, you have a committee, an inspection of company books and records and the possibility of a civil penalty all being thrust upon solar manufacturers and importers, possibly against their wishes, all intending to help them. 
   But at this point I guess I just have to ask the obvious question of why this program, if it really will help the manufacturers and importers to find customers for their solar products and technology, why it would not be offered the opportunity to participate in some type of a voluntary check-off program or a time when they can opt out? 
   Would the gentlelady yield for a question?

A lot of the companies that would be affected by this may be small businesses, they may not have the ability to opt out, and then have to bring a receipt to show, to maybe claim back some of their outlay. But they might be small businesses and startups, and I'm really concerned that it might have some unintended consequences.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Thank you, sir. 
   Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I have said it here before and I will keep on saying it. For some reason, there is a war going on today against energy from fossil fuels, and I am not really sure why. Anyone ought to be able to understand that, to be less dependent on foreign sources of oil and to increase our national security, we need conventional, renewable, and alternative sources of energy. Our country at this time will not be able to continue to thrive and lead the world on renewable energy alone. Punishing the oil and gas industry, hindering alternative uses of clean coal and stifling nuclear power will ensure that the United States loses its place as a world leader. 
   Make no mistake, I support the continued development and increased use of renewable energy but not at the detriment of fossil fuels and clean nuclear energy that we absolutely have to have today. 
   The bill before us today includes many provisions of research and development into renewable energies that I support, but there is not one thing in this bill that would encourage the development or production of oil and gas in our country or off our country's coast, which is the only way we are going to decrease our imports in the near term. 
   Why? What on earth are my friends on the other side of the aisle afraid of? I can't for the life of me understand the pure venom that is felt for the oil and gas industry. 
   At this time in our country's history, more than any other time, when we are up against terrorists who have no fear of dying and only want to kill as many Americans as they can, we need to develop our domestic sources of energy for ourselves. We need to reduce our imports and our dependence on OPEC. And, yes, we need to continue developing renewable and alternative sources of energy to eventually help displace our use of oil and gas. But it is not going to happen next year or in the next 10 years. We need to be realistic about this and deliberate about this and come together about this because I believe Republicans and Democrats alike care about our youngsters and care about the future of this country. 
   Mr. Chairman, I am disappointed that this bill has energy independence and national security in its title. I think it is misleading. We can't become independent and secure on energy  deficiency and research and development alone. We definitely need them, but they can't carry the weight of our country's energy needs. 
   As the ranking member of the Science Committee, I would like to focus on the science side of the bill. While I feel there is some good research and development in the science title, I am disappointed to see that ARPA-E is in there again. We just passed it as part of the Competitiveness bill on Thursday after 2 months of negotiations. The Senate passed it on Friday, and it is on its way to the President's desk. 
   I am as opposed to it today as part of this bill as I was on Thursday when it was a part of the other bill. I am especially troubled that this version costs billions more than the one we just passed. I still believe it is unnecessary and could divert very valuable resources away from the Office of Science. 
   During committee markups, I, along with several other of my Republican colleagues, offered amendments that would have improved upon the bills, but they were voted down by every Democrat on the committee. These were commonsense provisions I thought and we thought that would have ensured that our most abundant domestic source of energy, coal, would continue to be a part of the energy future as an alternative fuel. 
   One amendment by Mr. McCaul from Texas simply added coal-to-liquids refineries to a list of facilities that could be a source of carbon dioxide for the large-scale sequestration demonstrations in the carbon capture and sequestration bill. 
   I offered an amendment to research ways to blend coal-to-liquids fuels with biofuels in order to prolong the supply of both. This would have helped to mitigate the potential negative effects that increased biofuel development would have on our food supply and on our prices. My friends on the other side of the aisle have decided that coal is a four-letter word when, instead, they ought to be looking at it as a ticket to independence. 
   Our greatest generation is no longer my generation, but it is our children and our grandchildren's generation. Let's not leave them with no choice but to fight wars all over the world for energy because our leadership here continues to put forth legislation that stifles domestic production of oil and gas and shuts out coal and shuts out nuclear energy sources. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. I just want to simply say that at a time when we import 60 percent of our oil from OPEC countries and others, we need to be encouraging domestic production of fossil fuels. We have it. We don't have anywhere else to turn. 
   I just think energy is such a national security issue, not a partisan political issue. We have to move beyond partisan rhetoric and pass a sensible energy legislation that would promote all sources of energy, increases our domestic capacity, reduce the cost of energy, promote technologies to make fossil fuels including coal, clean coal cleaner and more efficient.  
   This week Democratic House leaders have been scrambling to get energy legislation to the floor before Congress recesses for August, yet the bill they are hoping to pass today doesn't create any new energy and doesn't help meet America's energy needs. 
   At a time when we import 60 percent of our oil from OPEC countries, we need to be encouraging domestic production of fossil fuels. The Democrats' energy bill doesn't expand our domestic energy supply one drop of oil. 
   Our economy depends on fossil fuels, yet opponents of oil and gas continue to push legislation to raise taxes on our domestic energy producers and refiners, making American energy more expensive, and making us even more dependent on foreign, unstable regimes. 
   Bio-fuels and other alternative energy sources have great potential, but are not ready to replace fossil fuels on a large scale in our domestic energy portfolio. As ranking member of the Science and Technology Committee, I believe that one day the investments we make in research and development into alternative energy will make a big difference, but right now Americans need clean, affordable, and abundant energy--and I'm afraid the bill before us today does not advance this goal. 
   Comprehensive energy solutions must include all sources of energy. Not only should we invest in research and development for technologies that promote renewable and alternative sources of energy, but we should also invest in technologies that make existing energy sources cleaner, more affordable and more efficient. At the same time, we must continue to support the domestic oil and gas industry in order to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. We cannot turn our backs on the fossil fuels that have made our country what it is today. 
   Energy is a national security issue--not a partisan political issue. We must move beyond partisan rhetoric and pass sensible energy legislation that promotes all sources of energy, increases our domestic capacity, reduces the cost of energy, and promotes technologies to make fossil fuels, including coal, cleaner and more efficient.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the conference report on H.R. 2272, the COMPETES Act. This legislation is based on President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative and is aimed at improving our competitive edge throughout science, technology and engineering, math education, research and innovation. I supported this legislation when passed by a voice vote in the House 3 months ago because we needed to take the steps to ensure our future competitiveness. 
   There are several good things in the conference agreement. I am pleased that H.R. 1868, the Technology Innovation and Manufacturing Stimulation Act of 2007, which I am an original cosponsor of, formed the basis of the NIST provisions in the House bill. In addition, the House bill includes language for manufacturing grant programs that have passed the House three times. Finally, our bill authorized the Technology Innovation Program. 
   I wish to thank Chairman Gordon and thank Dr. EHLERS and Dr. Gingrey, who contributed their expertise to the NIST provisions. 
   I would also like to mention the High Performance Computing Act language of Mrs. Biggert that is included in the House bill. I also thank Mr. Sensenbrenner for his protection of the bill legally throughout the course. These excellent provisions have been retained in this conference report. 
   In regard to NASA, the House bill contains important provisions to address the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, directing NASA to be a full participant in any interagency effort to promote innovation and competitiveness through basic scientific research and development and promotion of science, technology and engineering and mathematics education. 
   While these and other programs move us in the right direction, I have serious concerns about other provisions in the conference report, and tried in committee and in conference to address these concerns. I had the honor of serving as a conferee and met informally with the two Senators and Chairman BART GORDON in an effort to work out our differences. 
   When we met with the entire conference committee on the Senate side, we were given only 1 hour to meet with the entire conference and come with the final agreement. 
   Our concerns, unfortunately, were not addressed, and I, along with most of the House Republican conferees, did not sign the conference agreement. 
   First and foremost was the cost. The House passed a $24 billion bill that roughly mirrored the President's ACI initiative and even increased the budget in many areas. However, the conference report goes way beyond that amount to authorize $43.3 billion in spending. That is close to $20 billion over the House-passed bill. 
   Finally, I think the report includes the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency--Energy, called ARPA-E. I remain opposed to establishing an unnecessary bureaucracy at DOE that the agency itself does not want and does not support. I share concerns with some of the Department of Energy education provisions. I believe new programs in this bill go way beyond where DOE and our national laboratories should be involved. 
   At the end of the day, however, it is difficult for me on final passage to refuse to support a bill that contains many provisions good for my district, good for my State, and I think good for the Nation and that advances some of the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. 
   I will support a motion to recommit, however, that contains the same provisions that I offered in a motion to instruct that passed the House just 2 days ago. I will reluctantly vote ``aye'' to pass this bill on to the President for his signature. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

And as has been pointed out by Dr. Gingrey and by Dr. Ehlers, this is an authorization, and this culminates a work of a program that started 3 years ago, and it's a good program.  
   I thank Representative Hensarling for his warning and his admonition, his pointing out the cost, and of course, the minority leader's position, I respect that. 
   But I would say this, that we fought the soaring cost at every hedgerow. We fought the new agency created within DOD against their wishes as best we could.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise, of course, in support of S. 2606, a bill reauthorizing the United States Fire Administration. It's a companion bill to H.R. 4847, which passed the House in April with unanimous support after moving through the Committee on Science and Technology by regular order. 
   This act authorizes the activities of the United States Fire Administration for fiscal year 2009 through 2012. USFA provides critical support to our Nation's firefighters through training, through research and development and through logistical support. For instance, the USFA provides firefighter training to over 80,000 firefighters per year; it compiles nationwide data on fire control and prevention activities, and it oversees the fire grants programs that have dramatically improved the capabilities and the preparedness of our Nation's fire services. 
   This is an extremely important agency in our committee's jurisdiction. I'd like to thank Mr. Mitchell and Dr. Gingrey, vice chair and ranking member of the Technology and Innovation Subcommittee, for their hard work over the past year on this matter. 
   The United States Fire Administration does a wonderful job of providing support to first responders across the country. The reauthorization of this agency is an important priority for me, and I urge the passage of S. 2606. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (HEAVY DUTY HYBRID VEHICLE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND DEMONSTRATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6323, the Heavy-Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008, sponsored by my good friend, Congressman Sensenbrenner. 
   While most of the attention of hybrid vehicles has been focused on passenger cars, large, heavy-duty hybrid trucks have received limited funds for Federal research and development programs. However, because trucks generally use much more fuel per year than passenger cars, the overall potential savings are very significant. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that a typical delivery truck using a hydraulic hybrid system could save up to 1,000 gallons of fuel per year. In light of the proposed savings in fuel use and resulting emissions reduction, the Heavy-Duty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 2008 aims to encourage the advancement of the needed technology to bring about these savings. 
   The bill directs the Secretary of Energy to establish a grant program for the development of advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicles. The grants are rewarded in two phases. In phase one, grant recipients are required to build or retrofit one or more advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicles and to collect required data. In phase two, grant recipients are required to produce and/or retrofit 50 heavy-duty hybrid vehicles, collect required data and report on the results. 
   In addition, the bill directs the secretary to conduct a study of alternative power train designs for use in advanced heavy-duty hybrid vehicles. Further, it directs the secretary to establish a pilot program through DOE's National Laboratories to research and test the effects on the domestic electric power grid of the widespread use of plug-in hybrid vehicles, including heavy-duty plug-in hybrid trucks. 
   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6323 passed out of the Committee on Science and Technology with bipartisan support and with input from both sides of the aisle. I thank Congressman Sensenbrenner for introducing the bill and Chairman Gordon for helping us to advance it. I think it makes good sense, and it certainly deserves passage.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us today would designate October 8 as 4-H National Youth Science Day. I, as well as 21 other Members of this body, was a proud member of 4-H and know firsthand the good work that this organization performs. ``Head, heart, hands and health,'' that is what the four Hs stand for. 
   With over 6 million youth participating, it is a much larger organization today than it was when I was a boy, but it has the focus of helping young people reach their full potential. That focus remains the same. 
   As we discuss frequently on this floor, and as the newspapers reflect almost daily, our innovative spirit is the stronghold of the Nation's success. But we must do a better job of energizing our children to be interested in science, engineering and technology if we are to remain the world's leader in innovation. 
   The purpose of the 4-H National Youth Science Day is to do just that. The National Science Experiment is the designated activity for the first annual 4-H National Youth Science Day and will focus on water conservation. Through this special day and through its science, engineering and technology programs, 4-H has a goal of preparing 1 million new young people to excel in science, engineering and technology by 2013. I applaud them for these endeavors, and encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION OF THE FIRST INTEGRATED CIRCUIT -- (House of Representatives - September 22, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1471, which honors the 50th anniversary of the invention of the integrated circuit by Jack St. Clair Kilby. On September 12, 1958, in a Dallas lab of Texas Instruments, Jack St. Clair Kilby gathered a small group of coworkers to unveil a stunning achievement. Before them sat a thin piece of metal attached to monitoring equipment. 
   When powered on, it became clear that the single piece of metal was doing the work of several simple electronic components, including transistors, capacitors and resistors. Jack had created the first microchip. 
   I go back a long ways with Texas Instruments. I knew very well Erik Johnson, who started Texas Instruments. I have talked with him personally on several occasions about TI and how he bought it. He said he bought it on a Saturday morning, and the next morning, Sunday morning, he was driving out to look at what he had bought and turned on his radio, because he had promised his wife he would be back in time to go to church with her. He turned on his radio, and the announcement was that the Japanese were bombing Pearl Harbor. 
   I said to Erik Johnson, Mr. Johnson, as an engineer, you are wonderful, but as a matter of timing, you are perfect, because that launched the world into war and TI has been a major player in the victory that they achieved some 4 or 5 years later. This breakthrough is a similar breakthrough that they have had time and time again at TI. 
   For much of the 20th century, the electronics industry had relied on vacuum tubes as the basis for its design. By 1958, these bulky and fragile devices were beginning to be widely replaced by transistors made of semiconducting metals, which were tougher, which were smaller, which produced less heat. These features allowed electrical engineers to design much more complicated systems. 
   However, as the number of components increased, engineers were having a harder time reliably connecting everything. Cutting edge devices might require connecting thousands of components to thousands of tiny wires by hand. 
   Jack Kilby solved that problem. Over the summer of 1958, Jack created a way to build all of the wires, transistors and other electrical components into a single piece of metal. In essence, electronics manufacturers could take a solid piece of metal and etch a complete, electronic device into it, no assembly required. 
   This breakthrough, the integrated circuit, revolutionized the world. Jack Kilby's work, as well as fellow integrated circuit pioneers, Geoffrey Drummer and Robert Noyce, heralded the beginning of an encompassing transformation of modern society. Their work paved the way for the modern electronics industry. Electronic devices that once required a small building and teams of engineers working around the clock now fit neatly into pocket. 
   Integrated circuits continue to be a cornerstone of the American economy and an important priority of our research and development institutions. Fifty years after the first demonstration of an integrated circuit, it's fitting that Congress recognizes achievement and the importance of this sector now and in the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 1471. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today, of course, in support of H.R. 1867, which authorizes funding for the National Science Foundation for the next 3 years. As most of us know, NSF is one of three agencies targeted by the President's American Competitiveness Initiative. The ACI aims to double the Federal investment in physical science research over the next 10 years. Appropriate investment in research development technology and math and science education will ensure that our country remains the world leader in competitiveness and innovation. 
   The National Science Foundation is the primary source of Federal funding for nonmedical basic research conducted at colleges and universities and serves as a catalyst for science, for technology, for engineering, and mathematics education reform at all levels. The return that we receive from our NSF investments far exceeds the cost. In addition, the NSF peer review process for receiving Federal funding is to be an example for all Federal agencies and one in which I hope all of my colleagues more fully recognize as an appropriate means of investment. 
   As reported, this is a good bill. I thank Chairman Gordon and Dr. Baird for working with Dr. Ehlers and with me to make improvements in the measure. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the FY 2007 Continuing Resolution. 
   I am pleased to see that the Appropriations Committee followed the President's recommendations with the American Competitiveness Initiative by increasing funds to physical sciences research. The funding that we put into basic research at the National Science Foundation and the Departments of Energy and Commerce will pave the way for innovative breakthroughs. I am hopeful that the Senate will also prioritize these important science initiatives so that we can ensure that America remains globally competitive well into the future. 
   While many science accounts are adequately supported, the NASA account is not. H.J. Res. 20 reduces NASA's planned FY 2007 funding by $545.3 million. Most of the savings come from the Exploration Systems account, the program that funds development of the next space vehicle. As this Congress understands, we need to retire the Space Shuttle in 2010 and introduce its successor shortly thereafter. The more we cut this budget item, the longer our nation must wait for continued manned access to space. At a time when countries like China and India are challenging America in outer space, we need to remain leaders in this field. We cannot do that if Congress does not adequately fund our ventures into space. 
   I am also disappointed that the Space Shuttle and International Space Station as well as the Space Science and Aeronautics programs are also underfunded. 
   It is for these reasons that I introduced an amendment yesterday to restore funding to NASA. Unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not accept any amendments to this bill, and Congress will not have the opportunity to vote on this important program. In the last Congress, we voted to support the Vision for Space Exploration and return to the Moon. If we are to live up to that promise, then we need to follow through with adequate appropriations. We also need to give our current programs the best chance to succeed. 
   I will work with Chairman BART GORDON and the appropriators to ensure that the Fiscal Year 2008 budget will adequately address our Nation's space and aeronautics needs.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAM RAYBURN LIBRARY AND MUSEUM -- (House of Representatives - November 13, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I, of course, rise in support of H. Res. 709, recognizing and honoring the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum. 
   Samuel ``Sam'' Taliaferro Rayburn was born in Roane County, Tennessee, on January 6, 1882, the eighth of 11 children, and moved west with his family to a 40-acre cotton farm in Fannin County in Texas near the little community of Flag Springs, Texas, in 1887. Many Tennesseeans like Sam Rayburn and Sam Houston were great leaders and builders of the State of Texas. 
   From those humble beginnings, ``Mr. Sam,'' as he became known, rose to become one of Texas' and the United States' greatest statesmen. He held elected office for 55 consecutive years beginning in 1906 with his election to  the Texas House. He was elected 24 times to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Texas's Fourth District, and spent 17 of those years as Speaker of the House, a position that put him third in line for the United States Presidency. At the time of his death in 1961, Rayburn's 48 consecutive years in the U.S. House set a congressional record for continuous service. 
   Sam Rayburn was selected to replace the deceased William Bankhead as Speaker of the House, a position he held for a record number 17 1/2 years. He also served as minority leader during the 80th and 83rd Congresses, the two periods of Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Rayburn served with eight different Presidents and helped to pass several pieces of key legislation throughout his career: 
   One was the Selective Service Act in 1941. He cast the deciding vote to pass that act; the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and 1960; establishment of NASA; the National Defense Education Act of 1958; the Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1958. 
   The Office of Speaker lacked great formal powers when he first took office, but Rayburn quickly expanded the power and influence of the office. Rayburn relied heavily on his personal prestige, persuasive skills, and personal friendships built up over decades in the House. His leadership style usually resulted in congenial relations between not only the northern and southern wings of the Democratic Party but also between Rayburn and the Republican leadership of the House. Rayburn's actions during his long tenure as Speaker increased the power of the House of Representatives in its relations with the Senate and with the executive branch. 
   Following his election as Speaker, Rayburn wanted to build a library to house his books, his personal papers, and memoirs. He also wanted the facility to be a reservoir center of political history available to the people of Fannin County in his congressional district. With the advice of Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder, Rayburn requested that Judge H.A. Cunningham, a good friend of Rayburn's and a great man from Bonham, Texas, arrange to have a charitable trust established for the purposes of receiving and managing funds donated to assist in building the library. The Speaker also contacted Buster Cole, a young lawyer from Bonham, to assist in the process of setting up the trust. An earlier $10,000 award from Collier's magazine served as a financial base for the foundation. 
   Sam Rayburn, representatives of the Sam Rayburn Foundation, and hundreds of admirers gathered to break ground for the library in December 1955. The library construction was completed in July 1957, and the Sam Rayburn Library officially opened to the public October 9, 1957, in a ceremony that garnered national attention and media coverage. Businesses were closed for the day, and downtown Bonham was decorated with banners and bunting.     
   Many distinguished political leaders attended the dedication, including President Harry S. Truman and his wife, Bess Truman; Secretary of Treasury Robert Anderson; Congressman Hale Boggs of Louisiana; Congressman Richard Bolling of Missouri; Governor of Arizona, Ernest McFarland; former Governor and current Congressman Earle C. Clements of Kentucky; and the majority of the congressional delegations from Texas and Oklahoma, among them Lyndon B. Johnson, Jim Wright, Carl Albert and Tom Steed. There were approximately 11 television and radio stations on hand to report all the activities. 
   In honor of the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the library and in recognition of the completion of phase one of the Museum Restoration Program, the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum hosted an open house and reception on Tuesday, October 9. An exhibit featuring historic images of the dedication as well as items pertaining to the recent renovation project were on display. The open house and reception honored Speaker Rayburn and recognized the many supporters and contributors who helped fund the recent renovation project. 
   The renovation included a new look, an improved drainage system for the building, a more efficient heating and cooling system, upgraded accessibility to the museum, and a thorough cleaning and resealing of the building exterior. These improvements will not only preserve the historic structure but also provide added protection for the valuable collections and artifacts housed in the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum. 
   I am pleased to offer this resolution today honoring the Sam Rayburn Library and Museum, and I urge my colleagues' support in recognition of this great facility that chronicles an important era in the history of our Nation. 
   I am also proud to represent Mr. Rayburn's Fourth District of Texas. My mother attended Mayo College at Commerce, Texas, with Mr. Rayburn. He was a great friend, my friend, and my family's friend. He truly was one of a kind. And this resolution will go into the Congressional Record, adding more light to this man's great history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 251, commending the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for its work promoting energy efficiency for 30 years. NREL, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, is the hub of our Nation's work into renewable and alternative energy research and development. 
   Since 1977, when it began as the Solar Energy Research Institute before changing its name in 1991, NREL has received many accolades and many awards. In the past 30 years, NREL has received 39 R&D 100 awards, as well as hundreds of Scientific and Technical Society honors and awards, Technology Transfer awards, and Department of Energy and other agency awards. 
   NREL's success has continued under the leadership of its current director, Dr. Dan Arvizu, who has made the transferring of technologies from the lab to the marketplace a real priority. It's through this ``technical transfer'' that we see inventions and discoveries at work in the real world and not sitting on a proverbial shelf collecting proverbial dust.  
   As we have reached a time in our energy history that we are realizing more and more the importance of and the place that renewable and alternative forms of energy have in our current and future energy mix, NREL's significance and prominence as a world leader in this field is becoming increasingly evident and appreciated. The resolution before us today recognizes NREL for its 30 years of service to our country. I am proud that such a facility exists in this great country of ours. I could only be prouder if it were in my home State of Texas. 
   I thank Dr. Arvizu and all the scientists and employees at NREL. You serve our country and serve our future very well. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Concurrent Resolution 251. 
   With that, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (FAA REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 20, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, research and development is absolutely fundamental to the mission of the Federal Aviation Administration, and the bill before us today includes a number of provisions that will ensure the agency's R&D enterprise continues to be robust and productive. Title I of H.R. 2881 reauthorizes the FAA's Research, Engineering and Development program for 4 years at levels that, for the most part, are consistent with the Administration's request. The bill also contains a number of provisions specific to R&D projects and activities, many of which are consolidated in Title IX, but are also incorporated in other parts of the bill. 
   The Federal Aviation Administration is a unique federal enterprise that is fully reliant on maintaining a highly sophisticated network of communications, navigation, and surveillance facilities located at many sites throughout this country. The FAA also regulates the design and operation of the aircraft that fly within our airspace. Our national airspace system, and the economic benefits that flow from it, would not be possible without a well-funded research and development program and a dedicated staff of scientists and engineers. Research results have led to the development of a huge number of products that continue to improve the safety, efficiency and capacity of our national airways system and the planes that fly in it. 
   The Science and Technology Committee held oversight hearings early this year in preparation for writing and reporting H.R. 2698, The Federal Aviation Research and Development Reauthorization Act of 2007, and just 3 months ago, on June 22, our committee reported the bill on a voice vote. H.R. 2881 incorporates virtually all of the bill's provisions, and for that, I want to extend my thanks to the leadership and staff of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee for their willingness to work together on these important issues. 
   While there are a number of R&D provisions in this bill, in the time remaining I want to highlight three programs. First and foremost, the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO) is working to develop the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that is--and I say this without any exaggeration--absolutely essential if we are to ensure a vibrant and growing air transportation network. The current system is at capacity and will not be able to accommodate future growth. 
   The JPDO is a unique federal collaboration originally authorized in the R&D title of the Vision 100 legislation signed by the President during the 108th Congress. It is led by the FAA and includes a number of other federal agencies, and its role is to coordinate and manage the research, development and implementation of technologies needed to meet future capacity, safety, efficiency, and security requirements for our national airspace system. H.R. 2881 strengthens management oversight and accountability, and directs participating federal agencies to assign a senior agency official to be specifically responsible for that agency's role in the development and implementation of NextGen. It also creates a more 
   transparent budgeting process to help Congress determine if the Administration is providing amounts needed and requested by JPDO participating agencies. With regard to JPDO's budget, the bill before us is silent on authorization amounts, leaving this and future Congresses with the ability to fund the JPDO as needed. The fact is, at this early stage of development, too little is known about NextGen's cost and budget profile over the decade ahead to develop credible cost estimates. 
   At the Administration's request, H.R. 2881 includes a new start called the `CLEEN (Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise engine and airframe technology) research, development and implementation partnership.' The goals of this program are to research and develop technologies capable of significantly reducing emissions and noise produced by turbine-powered aircraft, as well as increasing their fuel efficiency. This legislation directs the FAA to coordinate its efforts with NASA. 
   Finally, this legislation takes important first steps to allow for the safe and routine operation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in our national airspace system. All of us know the important capabilities provided by UAS systems in the Middle East. Here at home, these aircraft will vastly improve our ability to monitor our borders, to help communities recover from natural disasters, and take environmental and land-use measurements. But first we need to develop `sense and avoid' technologies, along with flight control and navigation technologies, so that unmanned aircraft can safely fly in the same airspace used by general aviation and commercial aircraft without threat of collision. H.R. 2881 gives the FAA the authority to begin the necessary research, plus to develop schedules to meet mandated deadlines. 
   Mr. Chairman, FAA's research and development activities are essential to its mission, and the features I've described, plus many others in the legislation before us, will strengthen the agency's capabilities to accommodate and manage our Nation's national airspace system. 
   Having said that, I do want to express reservations about portions of H.R. 2881 unrelated to research and development, and caution Members to carefully weigh the bill in its totality before casting their votes. I clearly understand this bill has some very contentious issues that may, on balance, leave Members no choice but to vote against final passage. 
   I am particularly concerned about provisions in this bill that will impose a variety of new costs on an industry that is still recovering from several years of billion-dollar losses and,  to make matters worse, could delay FAA's ability to replace its aging air traffic control system. To give two examples, H.R. 2881 would permit up to a 55 percent increase in passenger facilities charges assessed by airports, the costs of which appear as an additional fee on airline tickets. The bill also voids the current labor-management contract for air traffic controllers, forcing the agency to reinstitute its older--and more expensive--labor contract, and it requires reopening negotiations on a new contract under a new negotiating regime. This labor provision seriously jeopardizes FAA's ability to finance its new air traffic control system, which, by some estimates, could result in an additional payout to air traffic controllers of up to a half-billion dollars over the next 4 years, plus whatever additional costs are imposed by a new contract. These are just two of a number of provisions that will most certainly push up the price of air travel. The net effect of these changes will be to push the cost of air travel so high as to make it unaffordable for many working Americans to fly, seriously affecting their quality of life. 
   For these and other reasons, I cannot, and will not, support H.R. 2881 in its present form.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support what is essentially the second piece of the Science Committee's innovation and competitiveness agenda package. I am pleased that this Congress continues to advance the innovation agenda that the President laid out 2 years ago. 
   Primarily, this bill enhances the Faculty Early Career Development Program at NSF to help researchers establish a lab and pursue risky research in emerging fields. It establishes a similar program at the Department of Energy. It also ensures that funding increases proportionately to the overall NSF budget for the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship, which supports graduate students in cutting-edge interdisciplinary fields. 
   Again, most of this bill was part of a Republican-led effort in the last Congress to incorporate many of the suggestions and various innovation and competitiveness reports without necessarily reinventing the wheel to do so. While H.R. 363 is similar to what we did last year, it does have some additions that were never vetted at the committee level, and I have some concern with that process. I hope as we continue the reauthorization process for NSF, the chairman will work with me, as he always has and as he does, and we can thoughtfully pass good legislation as we move forward. 
   With specific regard to H.R. 363, I do thank the chairman for working with us to restore a few of the provisions that had been previously accepted by the committee, particularly in NIST report language and a sense of the Congress that NASA also has a role to play in United States innovation and competitiveness. 
   It is important, Mr. Chairman, that our Nation continue to lead the world in technological innovation. To that end, we should support legislation that advances basic science research at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Research conducted by these young scholars will yield countless advantages. Americans understand that if we are to become energy independent, we will need solutions that promote clean, affordable and reliable American energy resources. That is why we introduced the competitiveness agenda last year and that is why I continue to support this initiative. America's solutions for the future begin today. 
   This is a good bill. I thank the chairman for helping make it a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 363. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise to encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. One of the key elements of this bill is a grant program at NSF designed to help scientists and engineers at early stages of their careers at institutions of higher learning. 
   Eligible applicants are tenure-track faculty, and allow the existing faculty early career development program to be designed and designated as the mechanism for awarding such grants that we are talking about here. 
   We also require the director of the NSF to allocate at least 3.5 percent of funds appropriated to the NSF research and related activities account for the purposes in the bill. 
   This amendment would modify the 3.5 percent allocation provision to include the following clause: ``except to the extent that a sufficient number of meritorious grant applications have not been received for a fiscal year.'' 
   I did this out of concern that the bill required the allocation of 3.5 percent of the funds appropriated to the earlier career awards for science and engineering, without taking into account there may be years in which there are not sufficient meritorious grant applications in that area and NSF could use the funds more effectively maybe in another area. 
   I hope my good friend, Chairman Gordon, and my colleagues will join me in support of this amendment.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The amendment would create a new merit scholarship program at NSF for undergraduate scholars pursuing science, technology, engineering, or mathematics degrees, the STEM degrees. To receive a scholarship, a student has to be a junior or a senior at a 4-year public institution, have at least a 3.0 grade point average, come from a family with an income of $75,000 or less, and be a citizen or a permanent resident alien with no felony conviction. 
   Generally, I am supportive of merit scholarships, and while this particular concept sounds good, it is duplicative. An almost identical program already exists at the Department of Education. It is called the Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent Grant and is part of the President's American Competitiveness Initiative.     
   Therefore, our 2008 budget request for this scholarship program is $1.2 billion. We don't need to add another $281 million scholarship program at another agency that achieves essentially the exact same thing. 
   The other main reason I oppose this amendment is its effect on the bill we just debated, H.R. 362. The driving force between H.R. 362 is to expand the Noyce Scholarship Program for undergraduates to entice them to enter the STEM K-12 teaching profession. A requirement for this scholarship is that they give back to society by obligating to teach 2 years for every year of scholarship money they receive. This amendment includes no commitment of any kind from these proposed awardees. 
   What kind of a message are we sending if we require Noyce scholarship recipients to give back to society with a teacher service obligation, when the recipients of scholarships under this amendment have nothing to repay? 
   In addition to the two bills before us today, the Science Committee is also working on NSF's reauthorization, which also includes quite a bit of undergraduate STEM education improvements. I just think the amendment currently before us is not only recreating a scholarship program that is already in existence, but it's entirely inappropriate for this legislation we are considering today. I encourage my colleagues to vote against it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 362. In the last Congress, we will remember that the National Academy of Sciences ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report, as well as other reports, emphasized the importance of strengthening science, of strengthening technology, of strengthening engineering and mathematics, those fields of education in the U.S., to ensure that the Nation's workforce can compete globally in high-tech, high-value industries such as information technology, biotechnology, semiconductor manufacturing and nanotechnology. 
   President Bush followed up on these reports with his American Competitiveness Initiative, and Republicans have led this effort through the 109th Congress, the last Congress, because we understood the importance of promoting innovation to keep our Nation competitive globally. 
   I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, most of which was included in a majority effort in the last Congress to implement many of the report's suggestions by expanding current programs versus creating duplicative new programs. 
   The bill authorizes programs to improve U.S. math, science and engineering education at all levels, K-12, undergraduate and graduate. These programs will develop and provide teacher training, attract math and science majors to teaching to improve undergraduate math, science and engineering courses and expand interdisciplinary graduate work, primarily by strengthening existing programs at the National Science Foundation. 
   I am particularly pleased with the 10,000 Teachers, 10 Million Minds title which is modeled on a program at the University of Texas called UTeach. 
   As reported, this is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, we have no more speakers. To wrap it up, may I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the bill. I also would like to reiterate to Mr. Reyes that I, too, am sensitive to the needs of the high-needs schools. I think we have sufficiently addressed his concern in the underlying measure by providing an added incentive for Noyce scholars who choose to teach in high-needs schools. 
   Furthermore, the clearinghouse provided for under Mr. Gordon's amendment provides yet another layer of commitment to help guarantee that our high-needs schools are not left out of the selection process for the new STEM teachers.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I certainly from a policy standpoint don't have an issue with the amendment; in fact, I think it might go a long way in enticing retired STEM professionals to get their teacher's certification and to put their many years of expertise to work in the K-12 classroom, educating and inspiring our next generation of scientists, engineers, and mathematicians. I support the amendment.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I honor Chairman Gordon for pointing out that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. We refer to it as NASA. It is a good time to reflect on really how far our Nation has come in a half century, but it is also an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to space flight and innovation. 
   H.R. 6063 authorizes NASA for fiscal year 2009. It is the product of close bipartisan and bicameral consultation and cooperation, and I urge its support. 
   H.R. 6063 is a 1-year authorization. The intent of the bill is to keep NASA on its current path towards completing the International Space Station, transitioning between the Space Shuttle and the next crew vehicle, and maintaining a balanced set of science and aeronautics research programs. It also reaffirms Congress' long-standing commitment to NASA and to its programs. 
   But by being a 1-year bill, H.R. 6063 is designed to give the next President an opportunity to work with the next Congress in order to fashion a long-term strategy that is consistent with the administration's desires, as well as Congress. 
   H.R. 6063 contains a number of important provisions. It authorizes $20.2 billion for NASA for FY 2009, including $1 billion to accelerate development of the new Constellation crew vehicle launch system as a replacement for the space shuttle. This new launch system will provide our country with a modern, more robust and safer manned space flight capability that will enable our astronauts to fly out of low Earth orbit, an ability we haven't had since the retirements of Apollo over 30 years ago. 
   As we are debating the bill today, China has three men in orbit and the scheduled space walk took place earlier today. They are fast accelerating their space capabilities, and if we are to remain the leader in space exploration, we must continue to innovate and accelerate our programs. 
   As most of you are aware, there is currently a substantial gap, as much as 5 years, between retiring the shuttle and bringing the next crew launch system online. During this gap, our Nation will be in the untenable position of relying on Russia to assure a U.S. presence on the international space station. I find this unacceptable. Therefore, I am pleased that this bill authorizes extra funding for the new launch system, thereby taking a step toward closing the gap and reducing our dependence on foreign partners. 
   As this is only a 1-year bill, I look forward to working with the next administration to find further solutions to close the gap and preserve our own human space flight capabilities. 
   The bill also includes a number of provisions to encourage NASA, working with the private sector, to foster development of domestic commercial cargo launch capability primarily designed to take supplies to the Space Station. In addition, H.R. 6063 includes language directing NASA to solicit for commercial crew launch capability. Both of these provisions confirm our commitment to advancing American  space capabilities rather than relying on foreign nations. 
   In addition to human space flight, the bill also advances a balanced and robust space science, Earth science and aeronautics program. It embraces a number of recommendations that were put forth by witnesses from government, from industry, and I could name them, who testified at hearings before our committee over the previous 18 months. 
   These are sensible provisions designed to strengthen aeronautics, space science and Earth science research programs, encourage technology risk reduction policies and activities, foster efficient technology transfer from NASA to other Federal agencies and to the private sector, detect and mitigate the threat of near-Earth objects and research and monitor the effect of space weather on satellites. 
   The list is not exhaustive, but I want to mention these few examples to emphasize to all Members the breadth of this bill and how it improves upon many of NASA's activities and programs. Suffice it to say that NASA is one of the most exciting and innovative Federal agencies, and it serves as a huge inspiration to our young people to take a serious interest in math and science education.     
   It also continues to inspire Americans, and it draws the admiration of nations worldwide. 
   On the fiftieth anniversary of NASA, we should all be proud of what our Nation has accomplished in the last half century. We should boldly push forward with the excitement, support and anticipation for what the next 50 years hold. I am convinced that our greatest accomplishment lies in the frontiers ahead. 
   I want to thank Chairman Gordon and his staff. I want to thank my staff, Ed Feddeman and Ken Monroe. They worked closely with Dick Obermann. 
   I also want to acknowledge the work of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and her capable staff. It's a good organization, and I appreciate all of them. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (MINORITY SERVING INSTITUTION DIGITAL AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - September 04, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on H.R. 694, the Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act of 2007, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The legislation has been an initiative of my colleague, Mr. Forbes, for several years and I congratulate him and Representative Towns and my colleague, Representative Johnson, on getting the legislation brought to the floor for a vote. 
   The bill requires the Secretary to establish a program to provide grants to increase the use of digital and wireless networking technology for institutions of higher education that primarily serve minorities. 
   Having been on the board of a minority institution in Texas for many years, I like the intent of the legislation and I want to say a few words about it. The grants may be used for training, education and professional development programs to increase the use of digital and wireless technology or to obtain capacity-building technical assistance and distance learning services. 
   Additionally, the grants may be used to foster the use of digital and wireless networking technology to improve research and education, including scientific mathematics, engineering and technology instruction. 
   H.R. 694 will help to provide grants to promote crucial development and educational programs for minority-serving institutions. It will help to ensure that minority students will not fall behind in education on critical digital and wireless networking technology. It will also help to ensure access to the technology and the training programs on the use of these technologies. 
   While I am a longtime supporter of grants to improve education and training on digital and wireless networking technology, and I commend my colleagues on this very important initiative, I would be a little bit remiss if I didn't raise some concerns about the process of bringing this bill up and the price tag associated with it. 
   The bill was referred to the Committee on Science and Technology in February of this year and received an additional referral to the Committee on Education and Labor in June of this year; yet neither of these committees has had a chance to really review the legislation and to hold hearings and to go through the markup process. I am a strong believer in proper order and the  important role that committees of jurisdiction play to make improvements to legislation. 
   In addition to my concerns about the process, I am concerned about the authorization levels in the bill and the fact that it does not contain any opportunities for grants for rural colleges and universities which experience similar equipment shortages and could benefit from the use of distance learning. 
   The bill authorizes $250 million for fiscal year 2008 and then such sums as may be necessary from 2009 to 2012. There is no CBO score, but I think we can look at the authorization levels and determine that this is a lot of money for a very limited group of institutions. 
   Despite these feelings and despite these problems, and because of my longtime support of these types of programs, I will be supporting the passage of the bill and will vote for it, but I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will address my concerns and the concerns others have as we move forward.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, leaving most of the time for Dr. Gingrey. 
   Mr. Speaker, I want to just say that the Green Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2007 offered today by my good friend from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, will provide for research and development of chemical products and processes so as to reduce the use of creation of hazardous substances. Advances in these areas have the potential of reducing the creation of substances that are harmful to our environment. 
   In particular, H.R. 2850 includes a competitive merit-based grant program to universities to incorporate green chemistry concepts into the curriculum for chemistry and chemical engineering. This will ensure that future generations will consider the importance of green chemistry ideas. 
   The legislation strives to build a base from which the creation of hazardous substances may be reduced. I look forward to Dr. Gingrey's comments on this bill and urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
   And just to comment, this bill was originally introduced by the 109th Congress as H.R. 5658 and included in Congresswoman Biggert's comprehensive energy R&D bill, 6203, which was passed by the House under suspension of the rules. And I see no reason why this one couldn't have been handled that way. As a matter of fact, I am a cosponsor with the ranking member of the Energy Subcommittee, Bob Inglis, and with the chairman of the full committee, Chairman Gordon, and Mr. Lampson. Actually, at leadership's suggestion and working together with our leadership over here, I sent a letter to Chairman Gordon requesting that he bring this up on the floor under unanimous consent agreement. It could have easily been done and bypassed the Rules Committee. 
   It is easy to bring an open rule up when there is not any opposition to it. I hope they will follow this pattern for the rest of this session.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise today, of course, in support of H.R. 547, the Advanced Fuels Infrastructure Research and Development Act. It is a good noncontroversial bill that was passed unanimously by the Republican-led Congress last session as part of a larger energy efficiency research and development bill. I am pleased that Chairman Gordon has indicated that we will be addressing other provisions of that bill in the coming weeks and months ahead. 
   Subcommittee Chairman Lampson has already described what this bill does, so I don't really need to go into that again. But I feel it is important to point out that this bill not only addresses our energy independence issues, but it also addresses clean energy issues by working to mitigate potential problems that can rise from transporting clean fuels, such as ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel. By doing this, it ensures that clean burning and alternative fuels can be a viable part of our Nation's transportation fuel mix. 
   Energy independence and clean coal are not just buzzwords that you hear thrown around these days. They are noble and necessary goals that we are one step closer to by the passing of this bill. This bill may be a small piece of the puzzle, but every piece is important and every piece is needed.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike what I really hope deep down and pray might be one of the last words. 
   Mr. Chairman, I just want to be practical about this. You know, I sat this morning in the ranking position as a Republican with Bart as chairman over there, and we listened to the First Lady. She came before us, everybody was gracious to her, she made a good speech. One of our Members used his rights under the rules to ask her some questions. She graciously answered them. Then we came on over here. I came on over here hoping that this would be about an hour and a half or maybe 2 hours. 
   I served as ranking member under Bart today, and I was ranking as a Democrat under Boehlert and Sensenbrenner, and the only airplane I would like to be thinking about was the one I wanted to be on at 12:30 today heading for Texas. 
   But really and truly, I don't call anybody silly or anybody's speech that they want to make here, they need to be heard and express themselves. That is just what a lot of people call the music of democracy. 
   But we started out, I thought, talking about a bill that would direct the EPA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology to initiate an R&D program to make biofuels more compatible with present-day infrastructure and to direct agencies to do so and so, to provide low-cost, affordable and accurate measurements and do all that; and it is going to cost $10 million to carry this act out. 
   This bill was introduced in the 109th Congress and was included in Congresswoman Biggert's comprehensive energy bill. It passed under suspension of the rules last year. We didn't have all this debate about it. Everybody was for that bill. It encompassed more than what this bill started out with. 
   Somehow--and I like Bart Gordon, and I respect him. I have known very few people from Tennessee I didn't like. If it weren't for Tennessee, there probably wouldn't even be a Texas, and that may be better off for a lot of people. And I wrote Bart a letter, what is it, in the Merchant of Venice or Othello, where they said, ``O, that mine enemy might write me a letter.''  Maybe you should have read it, Bart. Maybe you should have answered it. 
   I wrote him a letter to this effect, that I have conferred with my leadership, who agree that the best way to bring H.R. 547 to the floor is under a unanimous consent agreement. Given the uncontroversial nature of the bill, there is no need for us to go before the Rules Committee. And for some reason, we wound up with an open rule. 
   Now, I can only guess why that is. I wondered why. An open rule for a bill that everybody is already for? Give me a break. That doesn't make any sense. 
   So I can only think that perhaps maybe you, Bart, or somebody over you, made the suggestion that, well, it looks like we are fair with that bunch of poor people over there that are in the minority now to give them a shot and tell them, yes, we have given you an open rule, probably thinking they wouldn't use it. 
   Well, I did not think it would be used either, but we have talked all day about everything in the world here. And there is a poem that says, ``Maud Muller, on a summer's day, raked the meadow sweet with hay.'' The last verse lines are, ``For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, 'It might have been!''' 
   It might have been that I would be on that airplane if we had taken that unanimous consent, sent this on over and gone about our business. All this other is just the music of democracy. It doesn't bother me 15 cents. And it might be a little cheaper on my government for me to ride the bus from here to Dallas every week, you know. Maybe we could talk about that some afternoon: Why doesn't Ralph Hall ride the bus to Texas and back every year? That would save money for this country. 
   But I have another feeling about the third person in command in this country. That is the leader, and I think she is entitled to protection and to a good way to go and to cut short the time that she has to spend in the air to get there and get home. Those things don't really bother me. 
   But what really bothers me is for us to sit here throwing things at one another when there is better work to do. We need to get about our business and pass this bill and let me get strapped in that airplane and go back to my grandchildren, who need me. 
   My son is a district judge, and I have got to go home and do a terrible thing. I have to go home and file suit against him in his own court. He threatened to spank one of my granddaughters last week. I don't have to stand for that type of thing.

   In our drive towards energy independence, we cannot exclude one of our greatest natural resources. I am a fossil fuels guy. I am from Texas, and I am for fossil fuels, but I also know the value of coal. Coal must continue to be part of our energy portfolio, along with alternative fuels and renewable fuels. 
   The Republican motion to recommit recognizes this fact, and I thank you for it. It ensures that coal is going to continue to have a place at the table by clearly defining coal-to-liquids as an alternative fuel and including ultra low sulfur diesel derived from coal-to-liquids in the bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5940, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008, and I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   Mr. Speaker, I control time for what we call the opposition for the legislation here today, but I guess that is just a mere technicality, because I am pleased to join Chairman Gordon as well as an overwhelming majority of our committee members on both sides of the aisle as an original cosponsor of H.R. 5940, the National Nanotechnology Initiative Amendments Act of 2008. 
   The initiative was first named in the 2001 budget request and made a priority by President Bush. We codified it in 2003, and I was pleased to cosponsor that measure as well then. Now we have taken an already good statute and improved it just a bit, and streamlined some administrative issues to ensure that areas such as nanomanufacturing, education and environmental health and safety are adequately recognized. 
   It is mind-boggling to realize that the piece of paper that I am reading from is 100,000 nanometers thick. 100,000 nanometers. The fact that our scientists and engineers can create and manipulate matter on that small of a scale to be used in electronics, biomedical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, energy, catalytic, and materials applications is amazing and the kind of research and technology that makes the United States the leader in this innovation. It is important that we continue to make this area of research a national priority. 
   Certainly, just as an example, look at how nanotechnology has been used to create clean, secure and affordable energy. With gas prices averaging $4 a gallon, when was the last time we heard ``affordable energy''? 
   Nanotechnology research is currently taking place to improve the performance or increase the efficiency of renewable energy systems, such as solar energy conversion, wind energy, biomass power for utility applications, hydrogen production and storage for transportation, including the development of fuel cell technology, and geothermal energy. Nanofilms for windows are being developed for home use to promote energy efficiency. Nanotechnology is being used to improve batteries and create solid state lighting and low powered displays. The list and potential at this time are absolutely endless. 
   So I encourage my colleagues to support this measure. This has been a bipartisan effort from the beginning, and while we have made some changes to the program, I believe that, by and large, we continue to give the NNI and all the Federal agencies involved with this the flexibility that they absolutely need to do their work without being overly prescriptive. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Concurrent Resolution 366. This resolution expresses the sense of Congress that increasing American capabilities in science and mathematics and technology education should be a national priority, and I couldn't agree more. I gladly support the gentlelady from Texas's resolution. 
   The Science Committee recognized a few years ago that this Nation needed to make American capabilities in STEM education a priority. Our current chairman, Mr. Gordon, along with then-Chairman Sherry Boehlert requested the report that was to become the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report to which we have so often referred in this Congress. As a result of this report, the President came out with his American Competitive Initiative; and this Congress passed, and the President signed, the America COMPETES Act, which specifically addresses the concerns raised in this resolution. 
   In COMPETES, we're dedicating resources to create a broad pool of citizens who are literate in STEM subjects and we are increasing science scholarships and providing financial resources to attract underrepresented populations to STEM fields. Likewise, NSF is funding tremendous STEM education curriculum work in all grades, and OSTP and other Federal agencies, like the Department of Education, are providing strong leadership as appropriate at the Federal level. 
   A few weeks ago, I held a hearing in Texarkana, Texas at the Martha and Josh Morriss Mathematics and Engineering Elementary School, a 100 percent locally funded public school that focuses on inspiring our young children to excel in math and science at an early age and hopefully keep them interested all the way through college.  This school is a prime example of the kind of leadership and commitment necessary at the local level and included input from several groups, businesses, the academic community, and parents. 
   However, there is always room for improvement, and we should strive to do more. In fact, it's imperative that we do more if we're to remain the world leader in innovation and technology. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution introduced by my good friend, Ms. Johnson.

   The gentleman from New Jersey keeps talking about doing away with fossil fuels. You know, that's just almost laughable. You do away with fossil fuels today, a year from today, 2 years from today, 5 years from today, 10 years from today, turn these lights out, cut out your air conditioners, forget about driving up to anywhere to get gasoline or oil, forget about building the roads, heating and cooling, just shut her all down, forget about it, and forget about that 40 percent we get from a Nation that doesn't trust us, Saudi Arabia, that's all fossil fuels. We have no control over them. 
   Sure, we ought to have technology to address fossil fuels to make it cleaner, but we're whistling Dixie if we think we're going to do away and do without fossil fuels. 
   It's easy to condemn and not trust the oil and gas people, but without them, we wouldn't have the lights we're using right today. We wouldn't have the gasoline that's in our cars, the money that it takes to build asphalt roads, and I could go on down the list forever. 
   Where do you think 40 percent of that comes from? Saudi Arabia. Another 20 percent from other Arab Nations just like Saudi Arabia that don't trust us and we don't trust them. That's what it's all about. We can't do without fossil fuels. That's foolishness. 
   Mr. Speaker, I think it's high-time that we realize that we have to work together and seek technology to lessen the effect of carbons and be sensible about it, be reasonable about it, but we can't just shut this off and condemn those that are producing, the men and women in the oil industry that are producing the lights that we share today and cleaning the air that we have today.

But when we talk about who's furnishing fossil fuels, and who's furnishing nuclear energy, who's furnishing clean coal, who's furnishing solar. And no one has objected to this or no one has said it's not so, 91 percent of the House Republicans have historically voted to increase the production of American-made oil and gas, while 86 percent of the House Democrats have historically voted against increasing the production of American-made oil and gas. I don't know where the other thousand are, but that's the major reason we're where we are today. 
   They don't want to drill here. They won't let us drill off the coast of Florida. They don't want to drill up in ANWR. Let me tell you something, we better be drilling on American soil or we're going to have to send our American boys to take some energy away from someone.

   According to the National Science Foundation, a recent study of fourth graders showed that 66 percent of the girls and 68 percent of boys reported that they liked science. But something else starts happening in the elementary school. NSF found that by the eighth grade, boys are twice as interested in STEM careers as girls are. The female attrition continues through high school, college, and even the workforce. 
   Women with STEM higher education degrees are twice as likely to leave a scientific or engineering job as men with comparable STEM degrees. Despite the fact that women earn half of the bachelors degrees in science and engineering, they continue to be significantly underrepresented at the faculty level in almost all the S&E fields, constituting 28 percent in 2003 of doctoral science and engineering faculty in 4-year colleges and universities and only 18 percent of full professors. 
   The Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology Development was established by Congress on October 14, 1988 through legislation developed and sponsored by Congresswoman Connie Morella, Republican from Maryland. The mandate of the Commission is to research and recommend ways to improve the recruitment, the retention, and the representation of women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities in science, engineering, and technology education and employment. 
   In addition to the Commission, the NSF Research on Gender in Science and Engineering program has worked since 1993 to broaden the participation of girls and women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education fields. 
   One of the things research has discovered is that the more positive images you present of women in these fields in school, the more likely girls will want to enter into these fields later on in life. 
   So the resolution before us today honors the contribution of women in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, both in the United States and around the world. It also allows us to thank women for the contribution that they have made to these fields, women such as Madelaine Barnothey, the first woman in Hungary to receive a Ph.D. specializing in physics; or Rosalind Franklin, who received her degree in chemistry in 1951 from Cambridge University and was instrumental in putting together a detailed description of DNA; or Sophia Germain, an outstanding mathematician who developed the modern theory of elasticity, without which modern construction would be absolutely impossible. 
   Women have been pioneers in the field of science, technology, engineering and mathematics for centuries.     
   We owe it to girls growing up today to recognize these accomplishments,  accomplishments such as those of Maria Telkes, who was a physicist and pioneer in solar energy and designed and built a solar house in the 1930s; or those of Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, who was buried at Arlington Cemetery in January, 1992, and was one of the very first software engineers who helped both the military, private sector, and academia develop the foundations of modern digital computing. 
   We just can't discuss important women in history without recognizing the outstanding contributions of Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist, who is one of the only people to ever receive two Nobel prizes in different fields and the only woman to have won two Nobel prizes. Her Nobel prizes were awarded for her work on radioactivity and the discovery of the elements of polonium and radium. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the resolution before us today. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, first and foremost, I stand and I hope we all stand in support of our troops. But I also rise today in opposition to H. Con. Res. 63. While I believe that we all share the same goal of winning this war on terror and bringing our brave young men and women home, I regret that this bill before us today absolutely will not lead to that goal. Nobody wants this war to end more than those fighting in it and we need now to do what it takes to bring our brave men and women home, but to bring them home in victory. If we don't achieve victory, the consequences are going to be disastrous for the progression of freedom all over the world, and instead of taking a step forward, we would be taking multiple steps backward. 
   So what is the point of this resolution? Is it going to block the troop surge? Absolutely not. Will it end the war? Not a chance. Will it help our chances of achieving victory? Absolutely not. This resolution will demoralize our troops who are sacrificing themselves for us today and tonight, and this resolution will give comfort to an enemy. This resolution puts politics before the lives of our brave soldiers and there is no way in the world that I can support it. The only chance we have for victory is to support the President's troop escalation. It's not a sure thing, but it's our best chance for victory. These added troops will help us secure Baghdad, stabilize the area, and accelerate the training necessary for the Iraqis to stand on their own. Only after these things happen can we leave Iraq the way we should and that is victorious. 
   I fully support our Commander in Chief, and I think he has much more information than I have or any other Member or combination of Members in regard to our war on terrorism, and particularly the war in Iraq. I think President Bush is a godly person, intelligent and educated, and cares for this country and cares for those who defend it. I will continue to support him as long as he holds the title of Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America. I heard the President loud and clear in his State of the Union address on January 23, 2007. What I gleaned from his speech is that he is asking for calendar year 2007 to complete the existing plan being implemented by General Petraeus and those who serve under him. And at such time, he fully expects the Iraqis to be in a position to defend their borders and protect their people, resulting in an executive order hopefully to bring the process of withdrawal of these American forces still defending our Nation, to bring them home. 
   This resolution will absolutely undermine the efforts of our troops in Iraq. I strongly oppose it.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (AMERICAN ENERGY ACT -- (House of Representatives - July 23, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Dr. Gingrey, I thank you very much. 
   I rise today to talk about a bill that I introduced just today, this very day. And, yes, Dr. Gingrey is, I think, the fourth cosponsor on the bill. I have 40 or 45, somewhere in that area. Only four have failed to cosponsor it. They simply want copies of it, and they will cosponsor it. I didn't ask one single member of the Democratic Party to endorse it or to cosponsor it because I want to give them time to look at it, to talk to their Speaker, to see what she thinks about it. I don't want to put them in a bad situation with their Speaker. I hope she is going to accept this bill because I think all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, want to solve the problem of high prices at the pump that are putting people out of business, that are costing jobs, that are causing airlines to fly full and losing money. And, yes, you have heard this before, a hundred and one times, that my bill's different. But this bill is different. 
   It's H.R. 6579. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about this bill just a little bit. It was just this day introduced toward affordable energy independence, and that's a word we have heard. Dr. Gingrey has been going over it here this evening. We hear it day in and day out. I hear it all the time when I go back to the Fourth District of Texas. 
   My bill is totally different from the multiple attempts to drill on ANWR. And just stay with me. I offer something different. I offer something that should appeal to anyone who believes in States' rights. This bill came to mind last week when I said to myself if we can't drill on ANWR, let's give it  back to those who can. So stay with me. This is a little bit different. It's called the New Resources for Domestic Consumption Act. It transfers the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, called ANWR, to the State of Alaska. Give it back to them for their environmentally responsible work and exploration and development of oil that's to be explicitly used for domestic purposes or consumption only. By that I mean none of this is going outside the United States, and that's embodied in this bill. 
   According to the United States Geological Survey, there is an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil in ANWR, which equates to 25 years of Middle East imports that we have to rely on today. This would be one of the largest oil fields ever developed in the United States. This is the answer now and not 10 years from now. You hear it said, oh, we can't drill on ANWR and people are against drilling on ANWR. Many environmentalists who don't want us to drill on pristine ANWR say, oh, it would be 10 years before you would get any energy from them. That's just not true. That's not true at all. Let me just talk a little bit about it. 
   In addition to producing much-needed oil under this bill, the Federal Government will receive much-needed royalties if we give it back to Alaska. I'm saying transfer this by deed, transfer it back to Alaska, and let them make their own decisions about ANWR. 
   We have not been able to get a bill through, and there have been many bills tried. None of them have reached the President's desk except one. It reached Bill Clinton's desk 10, 11, or 12 years ago. He vetoed it or we might have some $2 gasoline today. 
   The Congressional Research Service has predicted that with oil at $145 a barrel, ANWR's 10.4 billion barrels would deliver $221.7 billion in corporate income taxes, not just wages, in corporate income taxes and royalty revenue to Uncle Sam. 
   So what's important about that? Well, I will tell you. This bill would mean more American dollars staying in the United States, not going to OPEC countries, and would result in more jobs for the entire country. A study from the National Defense Council Foundation says the figure could be as high as 1 million new jobs for Americans in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
   A principal argument against it, let me talk about that for a minute. A principal argument against using oil from the Coastal Plain of ANWR to help bring down gasoline prices is that ``it will take 10 years to produce oil because it is on Federal Government land.'' 
   Well, the State of Alaska has a lot better track record than almost anyone else I know about. In 10 years America's largest oil field at Prudhoe Bay, adjacent to ANWR, was discovered and developed, in 10 years. And the building of the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline that crosses two mountain ranges and many rivers was designed and constructed. The infrastructure is in place for expeditious and environmentally friendly development and production of oil, and the people of Alaska stand ready and willing to help, as they have helped in previous crises in American history. 
   The attack on Pearl Harbor spawned the construction of the Alaska Highway, a 1,522-mile-long highway stretch that was built in just 6 months in 1942. In the 1970s our Nation faced an energy crisis as a result of the Arab oil embargo, and in a close vote in the U.S. Senate, Congress finally approved construction of the Alaska Pipeline. Both times the people of Alaska stepped up to the plate on behalf of all Americans, and today we need their help once more. As a Texan in one of the producing States--ten States produce energy for this country and Texas is one of them--and as an American, I say let's not hold Alaskans hostage to congressional gridlock. Let's give it back to them. 
   Now, who's for giving it back to them? According to a Dittman Research Poll, more than 75 percent of the Alaskans support exploration and production, and these are people there on the ground in Alaska, on the Coastal Plain of ANWR. 
   As well, the Governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on June 23 of 2008, just several days ago, asking Congress to authorize development of oil and gas on the Coastal Plain of ANWR. More recently, Governor Palin issued this following statement: 
   ``I strongly support environmentally responsible oil and gas development in the Coastal Plain of ANWR because production there would promote the economic and national security interests of the United States.'' 
   She would know better than anybody, and she would have more say over who produced there and how they produced it and how environmentally perfect they were because she's there. She lives there. This is where they are. 
   ``The decision on how best to accomplish this objective rests with Congress,'' she says. ``However,'' she says, ``I would support any reasonable approach, even including the possibility of State ownership of the Coastal Plain, to facilitate production.'' 
   Governor Palin continued: 
   ``The important thing is that Congress expeditiously authorize exploration and development in the most promising unexplored petroleum province in North America. If Congress elects to transfer the Coastal Plain of ANWR to the State, I promise, on an expedited basis, to initiate a program to explore and develop the petroleum resources located there''--we have never had that promise before from anybody else--``subject to the safeguards,'' the safeguards that she is going to put in, ``designed to protect and preserve the natural resources of the Coastal Plain, including the fish and the wildlife.'' 
   Now, who else is for this? Don Young was the second person to cosponsor this. He's the Congressman for all of Alaska. The two Senators are for it. I don't think there is any question that they will protect their own State. 
   Mr. Speaker, since the 96th Congress, there have been 19 votes on the House floor that pertained to allowing drilling in ANWR.     
   19 times on this floor this body has said yes, we want to drill on ANWR. And all of those times, except one time, when President Clinton vetoed it, it failed in the other body. 
   Votes in the House of Representatives on energy development within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are as follows, and these aren't all of them. I am just going to touch a few of them to let you know that we have been doing it a long, long time. 
   In 1979, in section 152, on a voice roll call, Udall-Anderson substitute for H.R. 39 adopted by the House, including provisions designating all of ANWR as a wilderness. H.R. 39 passed the House, 360-65. 
   Then on 11/12/1980 it was voice voted, a unanimous vote, Congress, of H.R. 39 passed the House. 
   In the 104th, in 1995, the House agreed 237-189, the conference report to H.R. 2491, reconciliation of a large bill that included the 1002 area development provisions. That is the ANWR development. 
   In 2001, the House passed the Sununu amendment to H.R. 4, to limit specified surface development of that same area in ANWR to a total of 2,000 acres, which we agreed, to which the Governor has indicated that all is the only amount she will take. 
   And yes, Dr. Gingrey told you a moment ago how really ridiculous it is to say that if you drill on 2,000 acres in 19 million acres, that that would ruin the beautiful pristine part of Alaska. That is outrageous. As he said, it is like putting a dollar bill in the end zone of Texas Stadium or in the Yankee baseball field, putting one in any part of the field and saying it ruins the whole baseball stadium or ruins the football field. It is just outrageous, it is not true, and it is almost silly. 
   In 2001, article 317, the House rejected the Markey-Johnson amendment to H.R. 4, to strike this 1002 area. That is the area we are wanting to develop. It was passed. They rejected Mr. Markey. 
   On 8/2 2002, H.R. 4, an omnibus energy bill, passed the House. Title V of Division F contained the 1002 area development provisions. 
   And again, in 2003, the House passed the Wilson amendment to H.R. 6, to limit certain features, but still to drill on the 1002 area. 
   Again, in 2003, again in November of 2003, the House passed a comprehensive energy bill. 
   And again, in 2005, the House adopted 218-214 the concurrent budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 95, which included  spending targets that would be difficult to achieve unless ANWR development legislation was passed. 
   In 2005 the House rejected, again, the Markey amendments to strike the ANWR provision in its omnibus energy bill, again, saying we need to drill in ANWR. 
   Again, in 2005, the House passed an omnibus energy bill, and in 2005, in section 669, the House adopted the conference report on the defense appropriations bill which would have allowed oil and gas leasing in ANWR. 
   I could go on and on, but on 8/4/2007, the House rejected a motion to recommit H.R. 3221 to the Energy and Committee with instructions to report back with language authorizing ANWR development. 
   And then 5/14/2008, the House rejected a motion to instruct conferees for S. Con. Res. 70 to adjust budget levels to assure increased revenues from opening ANWR to development. That is 19 times I think that has happened. Not one of these votes has led to us letting an overwhelming number of Alaskans do what we have been asking them to do. Let's give it back to them. 
   I understand and agree with the desire and the need to maintain pristine environments in our great and vast country. But it is impossible for opposition groups to mislead, and it is irresponsible for them to mislead the public into thinking that the Coastal Plain is the wild and scenic area they would like to point to in photographs. 
   Let me show you, here is the wild and scenic area. Let me just show you this for a moment. This is the area that they are talking about, and it all looks just exactly like that. The truth is the Coastal Plain is just exactly what it says; it is plain. There are no trees or snow-capped mountains with streams running through them. This is what the Coastal Plain looks like right here. That is what they are talking about wanting to save. How many of you have ever seen it? 
   I doubt if there is anybody within the sound of my voice or reaching here that have seen that, have even been up there to see it. I have never been there. I bet there haven't been 10 people out of this Congress have ever seen ANWR. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is 19.2 million acres. The Coastal Plain is 1.5 million acres of that. And point to poster 2, right here it is. This is the wilderness right here. This is the little area that they have set out to send back to Alaska, and this is the area that there are no trees or no snow-covered mountains with streams running through them. The Coastal Plain, allowing the Alaskans to drill responsibly on the Coastal Plain in not going to ruin ANWR, nor will it ruin the experience of the average of 1,200 visitors a year to the refuge. 
   So I would just say to you, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This is a different bill. There has never been a bill like this involving ANWR. And it will allow them to move through the legislative process and come to the House floor for a vote. 
   Actually, I tried to speak today to the Speaker. I have asked only Republicans to sign on to my bill. I have not asked a single Democrat to because I am not asking them to sign something that I think that their leader may object to. 
   I don't think she is going to object to it. Here is what I intend to do. I tried to see her today, but logically she had appointments. I went over and waited a while, but we were in session. I just missed her. She would have been courteous enough to give me a hearing if I could have waited for her. But I am going to talk to her again tomorrow. I want to impress upon her that this bill is different, that this is a different situation. 
   The President didn't set ANWR up for drilling when he encouraged us to do some drilling on some other areas. Neither of the aspirants for President have set up ANWR up. 
   Madam Speaker, you could be alone on this. You could be alone in giving back to the people of Alaska the right to protect themselves. They may not drill. You are not directing them to drill. You are authorizing them to drill. 
   I just hope very much that procrastination has cost Americans dearly at the gas pump. We can't afford to wait any longer. We have an emergency, we have a crisis, Americans need our help.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (BEACH PROTECTION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - April 10, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Chairman, I am of course pleased to support H.R. 2537, the Beach Protection Act of 2007, and appreciate the efforts of Mr. Pallone to advance this legislation. 
   It is my understanding that this bill will receive overwhelming bipartisan support. It is going to be a totally green board, which I applaud. But it seems to me that the House has other, more critical issues to consider, such as the rising cost of energy which affects the success or failures of the traveling public to even reach the beaches of the world. 
   Oil and gas prices are at an all-time high with national averages topping $3.25 a gallon. A year ago we feared a time when crude oil could reach $100 a barrel, and now oil has reached $110 a barrel for the first time in history. 
   Unfortunately, energy analysts are saying that prices at the pump are not likely to decrease any time soon, and could rise as high as $3.75, maybe $4 a gallon this year. 
   My constituents in the Fourth District of Texas, as well as all Americans, are very concerned about the ever-increasing cost of gasoline and diesel, combined with the escalating prices at the grocery store. It is costing them more to travel to work, and more to provide food for their families. They are looking to Congress for some immediate relief and some long-term solutions. 
   The Energy Security Act that the majority passed and the President signed into law has some good provisions; but, unfortunately, none that will provide Americans the relief they need from high energy costs. Not one barrel of oil was provided in that entire act. There was no mention in the Energy Act of an increase in domestic production, which is one way to help bring down energy costs. 
   This year marks the culmination of a research and development product which I have worked on and passed, I think four times as a Democrat and one time as a Republican, and it is the Ultra-deepwater and Unconventional Onshore Hydrocarbon Resources Act that was signed into law as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   Nuclear energy has also seen a surge in recent years as people realize it is a clean and safe source of energy. But as with building a new refinery, the permitting and construction process is extremely expensive, and there are still significant risks to venture capitalists who would otherwise invest. 
   Congress needs to reduce uncertainty in the regulatory process for permitting and construction of new nuclear plants, as well as oil refineries, by streamlining the process and requiring the Environmental Protection Agency to issue its rulings within a realistic time frame. 
   America needs relief at the pump now more than ever. Congress needs to jump start efforts to bring down energy costs in the short term and build on comprehensive energy policies that recognize the importance of all energy sources in the long term. Providing Americans with affordable energy is an important issue.

<DOCNO>Mr. HALL of Texas. (ESTABLISHING A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM -- (House of Representatives - September 17, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, is the Nation's lead agency charged with conserving and managing our coastal and oceanic resources. NOAA also plays a vital role in public safety through the programs of the National Weather Service to issue weather forecasts and warnings. We must ensure that NOAA has the resources it needs to meet its statutory responsibilities and to accomplish its resource management, marine and atmospheric research, and public safety missions. 
   H.R. 1657 establishes a science and technology scholarship program to recruit and prepare students for careers at the National Weather Service and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This scholarship program would provide assistance through a competitive process based on academic merit to those students who desire careers in weather forecasting, marine, or atmospheric research or satellite program. 
   Similar to other Federal incentive programs, this scholarship program would require participants to enter into contractual agreements working at either the National Weather Service or NOAA for 2 years for each year of scholarship money they receive. This two-for-one condition is beneficial for both the government and the students in that it guarantees that highly educated individuals will be working and gaining experience at vital national organizations, particularly at a time when our most experienced scientists and researchers begin to retire. Institutional knowledge will be passed on from one generation to the next, and young scientists will gain the experience needed should they choose to leave government service for the private sector. 
   Mr. Speaker, at a time when our Nation is about to be short on educated and qualified scientists, we cannot ignore the benefits that this bill will provide. I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1657. 
   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution 593, congratulating scientists F. Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina and Paul Crutzen for their contribution to atmospheric chemistry, particularly the formation and decomposition of ozone. Their pioneering research on the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer in the early 1970s was the start of a nearly 15-year campaign that would include an overwhelming consumer reaction to products containing CFCs, a national ban on aerosols and unparalleled international cooperation. 
   Twenty years later, the Montreal Protocol has been described as one of the most successful international agreements to date. It is the ideal illustration of what can be accomplished when scientists, policymakers and industry work together toward a common goal. Uncertainty did not stop us from looking for alternative solutions. However, action was not taken until those uncertainties were addressed through further scientific research and until viable substitutes were available. Cooperation on environmental problems requires that the outcome be beneficial for all parties. This was achieved through the Montreal Protocol. 
   I offer my thanks to these three scientists. The environmental consequences and economic impacts in terms of greater health costs and loss of crops and damage to vital species due to the use of CFCs could have been far worse if not for the work of F. Sherwood Rowland, Mario Molina, and Paul Crutzen. 
   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 593.
