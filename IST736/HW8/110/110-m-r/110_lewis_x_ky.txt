<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (EMERGENCY EXTENDED UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACT OF 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 12, 2008))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I think the American people, the American workers, they're fed up. They're probably fed up with the fact that we have to be here today debating an extension of unemployment compensation, and if we don't do something about the energy crisis in this country, we're going to be back time and time again to talk about extending compensation to unemployed workers because it's going to lead to more and more unemployment. 
   You know, it is a shame, and I think the American people are starting to say, What is wrong in Washington when America has 496 billion barrels of oil that can be used, but the Democrat leadership in Congress says, No, not one dime for American oil. But they're willing to spend billions upon trillions of dollars to foreign countries for oil. 
   What is wrong with that picture? It's okay for gas to be maybe at $5 a gallon by the end of the summer, but no, we can't do anything about building new refineries here. We can't do anything about drilling oil here. We can't do anything about mining coal here, coal gasification. 
   The energy bill that the Democrats offered was solar, wind, and renewable. Not one dime for oil, not one dime for coal, not one dime for natural gas. You can't put solar in your gas tank. You can't put wind in your gas tank. 
   Now, I'm wondering how the United Miner Workers feel about the fact that they have a 300-year supply of coal but no help for coal gasification. I wonder how the United Auto Workers feel in Michigan, talking about losing jobs. When GM and Ford are moving as quickly as they can to electric automobiles but the Chinese are buying SUVs as fast as they can get them. There's something wrong with this picture. 
   And I wonder how the Teamsters feel when their trucks are sitting idly by not being able to move the goods across this country, out of work because the Democrat Congress--where is the leadership? We need in this country leadership to step forward and say by a date certain, we are going to be energy independent from the Middle East, from Venezuela, and we're going to have our own energy, our own opportunities to create jobs. 
   Can you imagine the millions of jobs that would be created by building pipelines, by going after our resources? Can you imagine the millions of jobs that the United Mine Workers would have, the United Auto Workers would have, the construction union workers would have? I think the rank and file members of our unions in this country have got to say, What is wrong with these people that we've been supporting all of these years? What are they doing for us now?

   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. I think they're starting to ask. 
   I talked to a group of citizens this morning, and they're wanting to know what is wrong with the Congress; what is wrong with the Democrat leadership; what is wrong with their presumptive nominee for the presidency who says, Yeah, I think this is good that gas is at this all-time high price. I just wish it had come along a little slower. 
   You know, I think there is going to have to be some answers, and they're going to have to come up fairly soon because the American people are fed up. They're not wanting worker compensation, unemployment compensation. They're wanting jobs, and energy provides jobs.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (MOTION TO ADJOURN -- (House of Representatives - January 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Thank you for yielding. 
   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition to H.R. 6 and encourage my  colleagues to vote against this bill, because one of its consequences is to raise revenue for some of America's most adamant and ardent enemies, such as Mr. Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and Mr. Ahmadinejad in Iran. 
   As I travel my district, my constituents have a consistent message for me: Find a way to achieve energy independence and end our reliance on foreign oil from unstable regions of the world. I am extremely disappointed that the Democrat leadership has chosen to pursue an energy bill that does nothing to achieve this goal and is simply a ruse perpetrated on the American people. 
   In the past, I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to promote alternative energy legislation. In previous Congresses, I have sponsored bills to offer incentives for the development of biodiesel and ethanol, to encourage investment in coal-to-liquid technology, and increase the use of renewable fuels. Each of these received bipartisan support. 
   I attempted to offer an amendment to this bill on an issue that has received bipartisan support, but it was refused. This is the sole piece of energy legislation in the 100-hour agenda, yet our party was not allowed even a single amendment. Why has this legislation not been an opportunity to discuss real solutions to our Nation's energy crisis? Why does this bill include no provisions to move our Nation away from oil use at all? 
   Why, Mr. Speaker? Because the majority doesn't want a real solution. They only want to stand here today and play politics with our Nation's future. 
   I truly wish this debate could have been about the virtues of developing alternative energies. Instead, this is a veiled tax hike to create what some may say is a slush fund for future use. This is unconscionable, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (MORTGAGE FORGIVENESS DEBT RELIEF ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - December 18, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. I've heard concerns from many homeowners in my district about the serious situation in the mortgage market. These declining prices have led some families to sell their homes for less than they paid. 
   On August 31, President Bush spoke from the Rose Garden and called on Congress to address the crisis in the mortgage market. Included in the President's priorities was a bill that Congressman ROB ANDREWS and I introduced in April. Our legislation would relieve tax obligations on those who sell homes that have lost equity and had been forgiven a portion of outstanding mortgage debt. Our measure is the cornerstone of the larger bipartisan bill that we are considering here today. 
   Under current law, only two categories of individuals pay taxes when selling their principal residence: those who have been able to realize a capital gain of more than $250,000, or $500,000 on a joint return, and those who lose the equity in their home and are forced to pay taxes if the lender forgives some portion of the mortgage debt. 
   It is unfair to tax people on phantom income, particularly when they have suffered serious economic loss and have less ability to pay the tax. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act would relieve this tax burden. The Andrews-Lewis provision states that no tax will be collected when a lender forgives part of the mortgage on the sale or disposition of a principal residence. This proposal has earned the support of the National Association of Home Builders, the National Association of Realtors and the United States Department of the Treasury. 
   Addressing this Tax Code inequity and other long-term issues in the housing market goes to the core of our national economic stability. Today, we advance a bill to the President that seeks to calm financial markets, aid local communities, and support one of our most basic American aspirations: homeownership. 
   I would like to thank my colleague Congressman Andrews for his commitment to this issue. I also appreciate the time and effort of my chairman, Congressman Rangel, Ranking Member McCrery and their staffs for moving this important measure to the House floor. 
   The bill before us is a good first step toward addressing the mortgage situation. But more importantly, this bill is an example of what happens when both parties work together to produce good policy that will benefit millions of Americans. 
   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. In closing, I want to, again, thank Chairman Rangel and Ranking Member McCrery. JIM and the chairman have certainly done a good job in working together to bring about this piece of legislation. Also I would like to thank the majority and the minority staff for their hard work and effort on this. And, too, I would like to thank Kevin Modlin on my staff. He has worked hard to help move this legislation through the process. This is a good day for those homeowners that are in much need of some help. And of course, Congressman Andrews, thank you so much for your hard work on this and putting it forward. 
   I yield back the balance of my time and ask for a ``yea'' vote on this important piece of legislation.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2008 -- (House of Representatives - June 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of funding for our soldiers, veterans, and military families. Military service is part of the proud history of the Second Congressional District of Kentucky. The provisions included in this bill will significantly benefit many of those I am honored to represent. 
   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act of 2008 contains the largest ever increase in Veterans Health funding: including $29 billion for new and modified medical services. 
   If passed, these funds will initiate the opening of two new Community Based Outpatient Clinics in my District, as designated by Secretary Nicholson. These facilities, and dozens of others across the country, will help to ensure that veterans have the highest quality local care possible. 
   The Second Congressional District is also home to Fort Knox. As a result of the 2005 BRAC proceedings, Fort Knox is transforming over the next few years from an institutional training installation to a multi-functional installation that will include an active force infantry brigade and the site for the Human Resources Command for the Army. 
   This bill includes $8.2 billion to support necessary infrastructure preparations at Fort Knox and other BRAC-affected installations working to accommodate new military operations. 
   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support timely funding for our nation's veterans and military installations by voting to approve this bill.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the millions of seniors who will be hurt by this bill. In my home State of Kentucky, over 73,000 seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, as well as all 19,000 of Kentucky's retired teachers. Each and every one of these seniors will have their benefits cut as a result of this bill, and some will find themselves without any Medicare Advantage options at all. 
   It is unconscionable to me that this body would even consider robbing seniors by cutting $197 billion out of the Medicare trust fund to give to families making $80,000, or even more, free health insurance, many of whom already have coverage. 
   This bill also cuts home health, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and dialysis centers. It is clear that this bill harms many of our Nation's most vulnerable population. This bill should be about providing poor children with health care, but it rations our Nation's health care, taking from seniors and working-class families to shift Americans from private health insurance into a big, liberal, tax-and-spend government program. Folks, they're back. 
   I urge my colleagues to stand by their seniors and defeat this bill. Let's get back to helping poor children, not a Michael-Moore-endorsed health care system.

   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I rise today in strong support for the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007. I have heard concerns from many homeowners in my district about the serious situation in the mortgage market. A recent University of Michigan study of homeowners indicated that at least 26 percent of those surveyed had experienced a loss of equity in their home during the past year. These declining prices have led some families to sell their homes for less than they paid for them. 
   On August 31, President Bush spoke from the Rose Garden and called on Congress to address a crisis in the mortgage market. Included in the President's priorities was a bill that Congressman ROB ANDREWS and I introduced in April to relieve tax obligations on those who sell homes that have lost equity and have been forgiven a portion of outstanding mortgage debt. 
   Our measure was later incorporated into the larger bipartisan committee bill that we are debating today, just a little over a month since the President's remarks. This legislation, although not perfect, is a piece of legislation that I asked my colleagues to take a close look at and the intent of the bill before casting your vote. 
   You will see that this legislation delivers real help to our constituents. Under current law, only two categories of individuals pay taxes when selling the principal residence: those who have been able to realize a capital gain of more than $250,000 or $500,000 on a joint return and those who lose the equity in their home and are forced to pay tax if the lender forgives some portion of the mortgage debt.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION ACT OF 2007 -- (House of Representatives - January 12, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition for H.R. 4 and to encourage my colleagues to vote against this bill. 
   Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I am from the government, and I am here to help you. Our seniors should say, thanks, but no thanks. 
   H.R. 4 is certainly a solution in search of a problem. The Medicare drug benefit is a quantitative success. Millions of seniors now have prescription drug coverage through Medicare part D and over 86,000 beneficiaries in my district alone are saving money while enjoying greater access to the prescription drugs they need. 
   Competition has reduced monthly premiums and empowered seniors to make their own choices about drug plans. On average, seniors saved $1,200 off the cost of their prescription drugs last year. In fact, 80 percent of recipients nationwide report high satisfaction with the new program. 
   Actuaries for the Congressional Budget Office, the ultimate scorekeeper in Congressional spending, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, both predict that H.R. 4 will produce no savings. At the same time, strong competition has lowered drug plans, the bids, by 10 percent, for 2007. Overall, analysts estimate that part D will cost $373 billion less over the next 10 years than initially expected. 
   Mr. Speaker, if passed, this bill would allow the Federal Government to get into the medicine cabinets of millions of Medicare beneficiaries across the country. Part D is working. The changes proposed in this bill would create tremendous uncertainty among seniors who are benefitting from this successful program. This bill is nothing but a veiled attempt at national health care that could end up driving up costs, reducing seniors' access to much-needed prescription drugs and serving as a downfall of community pharmacies. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.

<DOCNO>Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. (IRAQ WAR RESOLUTION -- (House of Representatives - February 15, 2007))</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, this debate is a sad moment in our Nation's history. If there was ever a time when Americans should be standing together, this is the time. This resolution does nothing but divide. 
   Throughout our country's illustrious history, we have been confronted with many challenges, but challenges met with unity of purpose, unflinching courage and unyielding resolve to be victorious against all odds. 
   This debate, disguised as a no-confidence vote against the President, is really about defeat, about surrender, about retreating from an enemy determined to destroy our very existence. 
   Mr. Speaker, the obvious truth of our situation is that we may run, but we can't hide. They know where we live. 
   Today, Americans all over this great land should stop for a moment and consider this national debate. They should ask themselves what this means to them personally, their families and their neighbors. Is it worth the expense and sacrifice of war now in order to establish a secure and lasting peace? Or should our Nation take momentary relief and retreat as we wait for our newly emboldened enemies to strike our homeland with even more fierce and deadly attacks? 
   Mr. Speaker, we must all realize that September 11, 2001 was not the end of the radical Islamic jihad against the United States. It was just the beginning. September 11 was a declaration of war. The fact is, we are not at war with Iraq. Iraq is an ally in our war against the radical Islamic jihadists. Iraq is only one among many battlegrounds where we are fighting jihadists who are committed to the destruction of Western civilization and replacing it with theocratic Taliban-style rule. 
   Mr. Speaker, if we cut and run, if we retreat from Iraq, we will forfeit our ability to lead the world against the enemies of peace. Iraq, in all likelihood, would fall to Iranian dominance and would become a launching pad for terror attacks against the United States and Israel. Islamic jihadists will be emboldened in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the greater Middle East. The world oil supply could be vulnerable to jihadist control, and nuclear armed missiles in Pakistan could turn into a hellish nightmare. 
   And Israel, Mr. Speaker, one of our closest and most faithful allies, could see its very existence perilously close to total annihilation. World War III could even be the final consequence of the misguided actions of this Congress if we retreat from Iraq. But sadly, Mr. Speaker, there are some in this Congress who are more concerned about the next election than the next generation. 
   So where are the FDRs, the Churchills, the Pattons, the MacArthurs, the Trumans, the John F. Kennedys, and the men and women of the Greatest Generation in this hour of our great peril? They are in Iraq and Afghanistan fighting for our safety and our security. But the self-centered generation, the politicians, the media types and the whiners and complainers are sitting in the safety of their homes complaining about the unpleasantries of war. This generation of the self-centered and indulgent, if successful in their defeatism, will condemn untold numbers to horrors never imagined by the most creative writers of horror fiction. 
   Mr. Speaker, I cannot, will not believe, as a Nation, that we have become so preoccupied with our own personal and political agendas that we have fallen asleep to the dangers before our Nation. The hour of decision is upon us. Will we rally from our slumber and awaken to reality? We are at war. Or will we close our eyes in self-deception and hide ourselves under the blanket of a cowardly resolution? Tomorrow we must choose. Will it be commitment over retreat, freedom over slavery, courage over fear, democracy over theocratic fascism, security over terror, life over death? 
   Mr. Speaker, our brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces have already chosen. They have willingly volunteered to put their lives on the line and, at this very moment, are fighting for all that we cherish. It is they who represent today's greatest generation. 
   Tomorrow we can honor these brave souls by choosing their values, by defeating this disgraceful resolution, or we can pass this vile legislation and have it recorded to our eternal shame.

   Mr. LEWIS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding work the Members the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 696 in Owensboro, Kentucky continue to do to improve their community. Post 696 has exemplified the mission of the VFW: Honor the dead by helping the living. 
   The Post has donated over $22,000 to local and state organizations in the past year. Beneficiaries of their generosity have included local schools, the Boy Scouts, shelters, and churches. Their generosity has also been extended to organizations such as the Wendell Foster Center, Shriners Hospitals, the Children's Wish Foundation, the Disabled American Veterans, and JEVCO. 
   Post 696 recently sponsored a going away picnic for the members of Ft. Campbell's Alpha Troop and their families being deployed to Iraq. The City of Owensboro adopted Alpha Troop through the Americans Supporting Americans' Adopt-a-Unit-Program. I thank the members of the troop for their service and the City of Owensboro for this commitment to these brave soldiers. 
   The VFW Post 696 Honor/Color Guard has been busy serving the community as well. Since 2001, they have participated in over 400 Veteran funerals and 50 community events in Daviess County. 
   I want to recognize the leaders of Post 696 Commander Richard ``Ike'' Eisenmenger Jr., Ladies Auxiliary President Marilu Goodsell, and Color/Honor Guard Commander Joseph Hayden. They have worked tirelessly to serve veterans and improve their community. 
   It is my privilege to honor the members of VFW Post 696 today, before the entire United States House of Representatives, for their past service to our country and continued dedication to serving their community.
